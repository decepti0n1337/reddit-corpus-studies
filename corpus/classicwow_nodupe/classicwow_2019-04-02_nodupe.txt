True, if you can get Earthshaker, Obsidian Edged Blade or Finkle's Lava Dredger without spending DKP, Vendorstrike is obviously useless. On the other hand, if you're planning on making mages cry by outbidding them on Azuresong Mageblade, some paladins/warriors are willing to bid on the other two handers and your guild lets you take Vendorstrike without paying any DKP, it can get the job done while being prime meme material.

It's pretty tough to decide what the best holy/prot build is too
---
Ok god damn it, I've held out as best I could for as long as I could. Theres no fucking way i'm going to last another 2 months, I dont understand how or where to figure this P sever shit out at but I know damn well we cant discuss it here. Wana be a champ and PM me some details on how and where?

But that's just a double win for you xD

&lt;Get Off My Lawn&gt;  OCEANIC (Alliance)

---
Region: Oceanic

Faction: Alliance

Focus: End-Game PVE

---
About US: It's honestly a mix and I'll try to be as succinct as possible in explaining that.  
---
We're old. Not super old. But back-in-vanilla that-guy-is-old old. We played a lot back in the day, and raided through BC and Wrath with some continuing to play. We raided in Vanilla Naxx, we raided to Sunwell in BC. We had Gladiators in PvP. We're pretty chill, but just expect people to not be bad. Please don't be bad, and we'll crush the raids, enjoy the atmosphere, and generally relax in-game.  
---
Given our demographic, there is a slight preference for older gamers, but anyone can apply. We've had many different types of people over the years playing with us, girls and guys, old and young.  
---
The main takeaway is that we'd like people who are looking to maximise their efficiency for raiding, are prepared to buff when necessary (again, we're not wanting everyone to spend all day farming, we have families and lives too!), and know how to advise and take advice. A little thickened skin wouldn't hurt.  
---
Atmosphere is comedic; very few if any restrictions on content.  
---
Raiding schedule: TBC – 2 Nights with possibly 1 weekend day as an option (ex we all want to push for something or a 20 man raid). Likely nights Wed/Fri or similar. Timing would likely be at night ~7:30/8:00 AEST, for ~3-4 hours depending on progression.
---
Player Base: 18+, Our core group is 30+ (OG Vanilla players)
---
Server type: PVP or PVE (Primarily Raiding Focused)  
---
Requirements: Mic. Brain. Sense of Humour.
---
Contact: PM, Discord
---
Yes I am so about this. Making me so nostalgic. Haha I love the phrase ‘make them immortal’ because as a dps who’s pugging a bg you know they are freaking ecstatic when the game ends and they realize holy mother of god that priest never let me die once.   
---
Sounds tastier than bottom round. 
---
I already bought the game. Three times for multiple accounts. I will be crazy mad if I have ti buy the game.
---
This is accurate. 
---
Also played a Feral Druid in Vanilla and ended up grinding out the Field Marshall PvP rank. Had a pretty successful go of it tanking 5 mans and some raid bosses as well. Knowing when to shift forms, cat stealthing/running flags/bear form dragging them back for a capture, being willing to heal as needed, etc etc. Druids have a ton of versatility and are a great class when used correctly. Good groups appreciate good druids.

Grits?

I already let my boss know a few weeks back that I intend on taking two weeks off for the launch of classic. He thought I was joking at first, but he soon realised I was serious. Might have been the fact that I told him if you don’t give me those holiday hours off I still won’t be coming in.

Do you guys remember the “is this cloak blue or black” joke based on that dress phenomenon from years ago?

**&lt;After Dark&gt; Alliance NA - PvE**
---
**Raid Time:** Monday &amp; Wednesday 12:00 AM CT (midnight) and Sunday 7:00 PM CT. **Subject to change upon discussion.**
---
**About:** &lt;After Dark&gt; is a semi-hardcore raiding guild. It will be on a PvP server, because what is vanilla without PvP. It is open to everyone. English is the primary language. I am a busy adult that works 2nd shift. It has been hard to find a raiding guild on current WoW with my schedule. I'm sure a lot of you are in this same boat. This is our chance to experience Classic WoW, while still holding a second shift job. We may be few and far between, so we must come together as **night owls!**
---
**Goal:** My goal is to bring everyone together with a late night schedule. We will be able to **form dungeon groups, raid, and PvP, late at night.**
---
**Expectations:** I expect **you** to be somewhat respectful. But, if you do something **stupid,** you will get **flamed.** But, leave our mothers out of it. Or not. Oh yeah, we **will** be downing **Kel' Thuzad**.
---
**Extra Info:** I am not expecting to be the guild leader, but I can be. I will organize raids and other events, if so. I will promote a select number of **officers**. I do not have extreme Vanilla WoW knowledge, as I only hit level 30 in vanilla. I have played private servers and know the Molten Core mechanics. Again, it was hard to raid with my late night schedule. **If you have excessive Vanilla experience, or raiding leading experience in general, then DM me.**
---
**Discord:** https://discord.gg/fua5p6f
---
**Update:** I have teamed up with a former guild leader from the server, Aegwynn. He is recruiting, alongside me. We still need many more players.
---
We are currently playing on vanilla servers. DM me if you would like to get your vanilla fix, and hang out, before Classic drops! **Come join us!**
---
The short answer is 3 points is the same as 5 points 60% of the time, I prefer 4/5 or 5/5, I think pvp gear can find 3% hit. (I realize you have PVE to worry about also with hit rating, but arcane hit talents are useless)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Arcane Missiles are a kind of esoteric spell in vanilla, some people thought it was an absolutely useless spell. I think it's a pillar of pvp vs casters and in some cases hunters/paladins/healers. 
---
* You can weave 2 procs of AM and when the global cd is done cast fireblast for 2 AM hits and then a fireblast, this is better than a scorch - fireblast sometimes
---
* Best pushback spell offensively and defensively
---
* In some mage duels you are rotating cooldowns like blink and CS and you get into these deadspaces of time where you have no way to stop freecasting, sometimes AM is good there. This is the most true when have recently used both CS and blink and would prefer the enemy mage CS your arcane tree to leave open other important spells like ice barrier - wards - frost nova (forces enemy blink) - scorch/fireblast.
---
* Arcane missiles scales 100% with gear IIRC and works well with mana conservation during a clearcasting proc. This is a big deal in the early stages of progression raiding where dps isn't as important as mana to damage efficiency. (not that the pushback is super relevant here)
---
* Hopefully the "bug" where AM was able to shoot at unlimited range once the cast was successfully started will exist and that is also important in sniping runners.
---
I probably missed some reasons but this spell is so misunderstood because it occupies a niche of 0 usefulness or 100% usefulness.

---
Totem twisting.  The windfury totem gives a buff that lasts 10 seconds, so you drop WF, then immediately drop grace of air (agi), wait until windfury is about to fall off, and repeat.  It's hard to do much else at the same time since it uses 2 GCDs every 10 seconds and eats a fair bit of mana, but you can get reasonable uptime on both totems.
---
You can wait until you get downranked after not doing pvp for a while or do you retain the higher rank? Don´t know anymore

I went into this knowing full well that it was April Fool's Day but I still had heart palpitations while reading the end of this.

My main issue with the pandas is their god awful animations. They are simply too bouncy. Infact most animations now are too bouncy.

Gotcha, didn't think about the pushback implications on casters

I always wondered why there was no such thing as a "world" or "global" channel on retail. At least there aren't on my server.

I played wc3 when I was so young, that when wow came out I thought it was pretty much wc4 and I was so excited to play and everything I didn't even know it costed $15 dollars a month to play. After everything installed and begging my parents for $15 I log in and I'm like wtf is this.... It's not Warcraft rts. And within 5 mins I met someone who guided me on basics and I was hook to world of crackcraft
---
What color is the sky in your world?
---
I leveled my priest as holy in vanilla. It is 100% not necessary to be holy to heal a dungeon. As others have said, just keep a set of healing gear (which will probably be the same as your other gear until you get to around 40) and switch to it for dungeons if you're healing. It also isn't necessary for your friend to spec as prot to tank dungeons. As you near 60, you might start having a little trouble in dungeons, but it's doable. If you want to do stratholme or scholomance before you hit 60, it might be a little easier for at least one of you to switch to the "right" spec. 
---
I also should point out that solo leveling as a smite priest isn't too different in terms of kill speed than shadow. Especially if you're looking at an efficient kill rotation where you toss on some spells and then wand the mob to death so you can regen instead of drinking every couple of mobs. And picking up Holy Nova from the holy tree gives you the option to do some AOE grinding.
---
I just looked up that trinket and holy balls that seems so strong haha

You ever get a few grains of sand trapped under a ring at the crease where two fingers meet? That's how little changes like this would strike me. It isn't really big deal, but as soon as I noticed it, it would annoy me until I could go wash my hands.

We were in grade 6 and we didn’t have headphones, had to use home phones
---
Love this post.  Although I won’t be able to take time off around the release (already got summer vacations booked), I agree that this may just be the last game launch for true no lifeing. 
---
I’ll take solace in the memory of doing it the first time around! 
---
There used to be a global defense. You could post in it if you had a high enough honor ranking. 
---
In theory it's great, but it's really just a vehicle for spam and then players just turn it off anyway.
---
You’ll get geared the same way all the fury warriors, rogues, and mages get geared. Probably have 6-8 of those per raid as well. A lot of overlap for who needs non tier items as well. 
---
If you can be reliable, prepared, and sociable in a LC guild you’ll get gear relatively fast. Those aspects tend to count the most I find. 
---
Why plan in so much detail? What if you get a sweet blue boe and boom your gold issues are solved? I say roll with the punches a little and not over analyze everything. After all that's what vanilla was actually like.
---
To be fair, i would be completely fine with being a raid healer if healing in vanilla wasnt sooo booring.
---
I played rshaman on a tbc pserver yesteryear and it was real fun. Only precasting healing wave though, bot so much.
---
Hmm...so this is where Apex Legends got their voice comm integration idea.
---
Definitely ZG. I played on an RP server, and we always did in-character tours hosted by a few of the major RP guilds. It was awesome actually progressing through the raid week after week, albeit at a slower pace than actual raiding guilds.
---
Sequel of Space Jam is slated for release **July 16**, 2021.

**July 16 still confirmed.**
---
Haha I did the same thing.
---
I'm a butcher and my boss is an old school degenerate. When I told him he gave me the funniest look like "WTF is he talking about taking vacation for a video game?"
---
I will endure his ridicule in the meantime lol but I'd love to lock in my dates asap.
---
I thought paladins were the strongest healers in top gear. So much crit their hels were essentially free.
---
Druids are actually amazing at so many roles, there is just this odd persistent stigma which I don't expect to go away any time soon. So nah I don't think they'll be popular. 
---
Ironically I think Druids are the weakest when healing, which is the role they purportedly can solely play.
---
For anyone curious here are some experts playing Druids to the highest level:  
---
[Skarm - Tanking Naxx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alH2QXm8MM8) (check his youtube for guides)  
---
[Shedo - Topping DPS as Feral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUc70zMFAKI) (check his youtube for guides)  
---
[Stormx - High end PvP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQwH0atQZ0Q)  
---
At this point there are no plans to add anything new to Classic after Naxx.
---
Lots of time left between now and then, but as it stands now it's not gonna happen.
---
Holy shock is also the best pulling ability paladins have. It helps tanking a lot
---
You cant dispell on helbot in retail anymore?
---
The best thing to do is put 2 points into improved sinister strike and from that on out it doesnt matter at all what you put your points into
---
We all wish we could be playing on 10k player servers, but Blizzard is then forced to use server sharding. Imagine how many players there would be in the major cities
---
I thoroughly enjoyed playing my rogue all through vanilla and has been my main through nearly every expansion since. I was in the 30-39 bracket when xrealm bgs were released and as far as PVP goes, those days were the highlight of my PVP career. 
---
Dual cold rage daggers with +wep dmg enchants and preparation made for epic fights in bgs and world PVP that I still look back on fondly. 
---
I can't speak for raiding as I was only level 60 for a couple of months before BC was released and I joined a PVP guild when patch 2.0 dropped. But I can say that there are only a handful of times that I've had that much fun playing wow as I did when on my rogue during vanilla. 
---
Regardless, I'm excited to see what happens when we reach that point.
---
Oh dude Storm is a fucking crazy druid.  He makes the class look tier 1.
---
You guys should definitely consider Tanking and Healing your 5man dungeons. You can do this easily as Fury and Shadow specs respectively.
---
If you learn to do this well, you will find groups ultra-fast and your runs will go much smoother with a coordinated tank-healer combo.
---
&gt;Your build is split way too thinly
---
someone already said that, thanks.
---
&gt;soooo good luck finding groups outside of leveling
---
if you're going to be condescending without contributing useful details then just stfu and don't reply
---
True enough. Still got a couple years before we get there.
---
You might be able to make dagger work if you always played with someone else, probably a bear druid would make most sense. It's going to be pretty frustrating and slow if you ever have to play without them though.
---
If we're posting vanilla rogue videos, I think this one deserves a mention. 
---
https://youtu.be/oWNt_8xcOZw
---
But i was saying theyre both wrong.
---
I honestly have no idea what your point is. Are you talking about this thread? https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b86akr/rogue_leveling_spec/  
---
OP asks a question and all the top comments are just straightforward answers. Have I got the wrong thread? Where exactly is the controversy? 
---
It is all single target and single target just doesn't matter at all. There is not a single fight where single target healing is the thing that strains your healers. Whereas Chain Heal is completely broken for raid wide damage, which is what actually threatens wipes. Being able to cast forever on a target that would live anyway or having so much raid wide throughput that you can run less healers and more DPS. Legit Horde can comfortably run two less healers than Alliance for all fights and therefore run two additional DPS full time. 
---
Paladins are still the best buffers in the game for raids tho, so they have that. 
---
Looks cool. Could be interested in this one, depending on how the raid schedule would look.
---
Unless I’m really missing something, there is no world chat
---
I think people forget that just getting to level 60 is in itself a big achievement that is time consuming no matter the class. According to that poll awhile ago only a little more than half of responders even got there (https://www.strawpoll.me/15526254/r for anyone interested). Granted most players will be more experienced/older/whatever now, but that’s still a big chunk. I see druids, and other classes that have a heal or a pet, being way more popular now. 
---
Be careful downloading anything like this. I got dillbagged with some pirating notices because I'm stupid and haven't pirated in like 10 years.
---
They never disappeared on logout. Your healthstone/soulstone does.

I try .. to ... ahh ....wait...
---
The game didn’t even work for the first 3 months. I have a ton of free time on my account in February from server queues and downtime. I cannot even tell you how many time I sat in queue for hours to finally get in and within an hour the realm crashed or all of them came down for emergency maintenance. I just jumped right back in que though because the game was that damn good :). 
---
Bwl hands down
---
A buddy of mine wrote it. He was working on an Atari game and ended up speaking with a producer.  He lent them the unfinished game they used for the video. 
---
Come to think of it I think he and I came up with the joke.  Hell may have been me.  Long time ago. 
---
Nah man.  Vanilla forever.

Let it be the last incarnation.

This is really cool

Zanza and well fed buffs are in their own categories. No override.

Ah I must have been thinking of hearthstones! Thanks

If you're on the team, tell us the release date!

Please?

I’ll still be rerolling my alts and leveling through arathi highlands

What is happening?
---
Pretty sure they did at one stage, but I can’t remember when or how it changed.
---
Not *that* team.
---
Honestly whatever man
---
This is a circular discussion. The PvP sets are better for PvP than the PvE gear in Vanilla. See my posts literally right above yours.
---
Now, there wasn't a PvP item for every slot in Vanilla. That much is true. But in later expansions, pretty much every damage dealer would use their 4-piece PvP set + the highest item level piece they could find in other slots, no matter where it came from. PvE always had the highest item level pieces. The end result is that the best gear combinations are essentially the same as they were in Vanilla, except now the pieces that come from PvP are worthless in every other aspect of the game because so much of their item budget is wasted on resilience.
---
Arthas, Jaina, Thrall.

Didn't remember any of the NE names or stories.

I’ll be doing the same. I’m maining a warrior :P
---
This seems pretty difficult. I'm not familiar with people doing this very much.
---
I believe that 25% of 60s will be Warriors
---
And? It works fine but even 6k feels good
---
The most recent vanilla server had 15k on launch lol
---
Hearthstones don't disappear either.

Reread the post
---
I think you mean /5 World
---
it exists. Someone has to make the channel then everyone can /join world
---
You sure those were really bears, and not furbolgs?
---
Would have been good if he talked about what you give up/gain in regards to stam/agi. This build looks sick as long as you don't become a glass cannon compared to stacking agi.
---
Well, I planned to win that big Powerball jackpot but that didn't work out.  
---
Mad cause bad LULW
---
Yep, iirc it was a reference to that from EQ. Back when EQ was still a huge influence on WoW, or was commonly referenced. I miss those days.
---
As someone who loves arena on retail, I hope it never comes to classic. Arena has never been balanced, but classic is the least imbalanced 1v1 version of WoW. Especially since CC in 1.12 (if I'm correct) hasn't been reduced down to 8 second cap with DR. So expect to be sheeped for a full minute and ice trapped for 30 seconds while your team is murdered. 
---
could be wrong but isn't rend your #1 source of damage? you optimally rend + hamstring a target and strafe kite it to trade blows on your swing timer.
---
Not saying I don’t believe you....but unless you post a screenshot....I don’t believe you :)
---
Yes, once a Priest has some gear for sure.
---
As a fresh 60 though I prefer to take the mana pool increase in Disc over the plus healing in Holy. At least until you have enough +healing to down rank efficiently.
---
You have a phone, don't you?
---
There you go, [here's the email](https://i.imgur.com/gr5MEc9.png).
---
I didn't post screenshots because the survey was in Spanish (my Bnet account was made in Spain), so I figured not many people would be interested in a bunch of spanish text.
---
A few questions were also asking me about localization of the games and whether I like the translation. So that might be an indication that they are sending this survey to non-english speakers. I play all my games in English so I didn't reply.
---
Everyone wants to be the new leet feral warrior.
---
You arent prioritizing the right talents
---
What was that?
---
You’ll want charge. It will speed up your farm speed tremendously. Frankly I wouldn't skip on any skills unless you are just a few gold short on mount. 
---
POSTING IN AN EPIC THREAD
---
I wouldn't really consider this a valid build since its main requirement to "work" (video creators words not mine) is requiring a higher level person to apply Shadow Oil to the weapons.  For all intents this abusing a glitch.
---
It would be no different if someone figured out how to allow level 19 twinks to drink flasks.
---
Just turn off seeding once your done downloading. I got one too, its just a warning and nothing to 2orry about at all
---
You're trippin bruh,
---
I love getting all up in there.
---
Uh, what kind of flairs?
---
Class flairs (rogue) 
---
Lots of racism and homophobia probably 
---
dude with 6k pop and mot people 60 its easy to get tags low level. I think people are just used to lvling in dead, sharded retail zones. The most recent vanilla server had 15-16k online at launch peak and it was buttery smooth. Obviously they had dynamic respawn but still
---
Idk man private servers are way too packed in a lot of areas.
---
No we dont all wish that speak for yourself.
---
10k active online players makes doing any sort of solo content a literal un vanilla clusterfuck. Every single quest mob camped by 10 bystanders. Absolutley every single grind pr farm spot camped by x10 people. Extreme price gouging thanks to strong mafias. The game world was in no way meant to handle that many players and I genuinley hope blizzard either sticks to blizzlike or 3-5k total. Anything more than that is just an utter and total clusterfuck.
---
PS: Yes I know how great it is for getting quick groups, and it is awesome to see the world always busy.  But, with even 10k characters you loose alot of the close knit feeling the servers of old would give. You become almost akin to LFG group finder people, your reputation means much less and your a random face in the sea of 10k people.
---
Worse
---
I just added more screenshots of the survey to the main post, in case you need more proof.
---
Only thing I’ve found so far is https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons
---
Well we know Classic is based on a Legion client so no, all 1.12 addons will be useless. More than likely they will have a beta and there will be a wide variety of addons available at launch to use, and a stress test open weekend for you to get them setup in the month before launch.
---
I highly doubt that addons will work day one if you are using the vanilla ones on a private server newer addons will most likely work though sinds it will use the bfa client as far as i know also getting ahead of the crowd to have the leveling zones all to your self? Just go play bfa there you will have all zones to your self
---
good
---
They haven't announced when bgs will.be released or if it will be at start but deffinately no rank rewards. The bis pvp for war would be some.off piece dungeon gear and mostly valor set for bonus armor and AP. Raiding gear isn't a must but will provide more stats that you need. Look up some forums that were created explaining the 3% hit needed etc
---
Illidan and arthas. I was pretty psyched when the expansion trailers for TBC and wotlk came out.
---
You don't have to raid, it just makes things easier. Dungeon blues will get you a fair way. Blue pvp set will be available pretty soon after launch but ins't much stronger than dungeon blues. Your main problem is a weapon. Once the normal raiders are clearing MC/BWL every week (ie 1-2 months after launch), your blue dungeon wep is going to start feeling pretty sad. Ideally you really want to be raiding here just to poach a nice 2her and maybe a few other pieces if you can.  
---
Presumably 3-4 months in the epic pvp rep/quests will be out and you can start grinding them which are pretty good. With exalted ab/wsg and TUF etc as well as ZG/AQ20 you will do ok even against the AQ40 geared people. It won't be until naxx is out that you will really start falling behind again. Once naxx is out there's not much you can do. There's naxx geared people and then there's everyone else.
---
This proves that the apocalypse is upon us.
---
Really cool.
---
But, you would probably have the survivability of a wet noodle. Still awesome video and very interesting concept
---
by that same logic if you dont mind being in the  crowd why dont you go do raid finder and be in the crowds when your que pops?
---
Usually gets political.
---
&gt;  changed the way a lot of these attacks scaled midway through AQ. I was somewhat tuned into the PvP scene on my server and there was an Orc Hunter (I was a gnome rogue) who I knew who had put together a full spell power set was legit getting 2k arcane shots on me.
---
jeez, thats crazy!
---
Difference is that BFA sucks tauren dick.

I am very aware was just commenting on how you seem to already want to rush everything and get ahead of the crowd when classic hits

You can apply temporary weapon enchants such as mana oil through the trade window. You can apply Sapphiron's shoulder enchants through the trade window. Neither of those are an exploit. You can't drink flasks at a lower level because of the level requirement.
---
Then again, I don't expect you to answer to me since you've been blocking every single person proving you wrong the other day.

There are several German speaking guilds on the private server I play on.  They are always recruiting, and looks like they have cleared all content.  Maybe try to find their discord and give em a shout. 
---
This post brought a tear to my eye
---
This and Teldrassil.
---
Seriously some of the most atmospheric music in the game. 
---
Hopefully nothing!

I can't comment specifically about warriors, but for pretty much everyone the first thing to do at 60 is start looking for your dungeon sets. It's spread out over the level 60 dungeons (UBRS, LBRS, Strat, Scholo) and it's good enough to get you started on whatever you want to do. For warriors, you're looking for the Valor set.

This will not help at all.

If you're going to get a piracy notice from your ISP, torrenting the offending files even for just a few seconds will make it happen.

You need to get a trusted VPN and keep it on at all times when doing anything like that. 
---
We'll see more Druids in Classic because they have been very optimal in Retail since Vanilla and a lot of people will mistakenly assume they are good in Classic.
---
This is actually correct and I was mis spoken. Thankyou for correcting me
---
I wouldn't want to hear anything today at all.
---
Actually, it might be solid marketing to 'not' allow download of the client and require players to buy a physical box w/thumb-drive inside.  
---
A LFG chat existed for every zone, and as a result I recall a lot of people on my server had it turned off, since general chat was usually enough?
---
Trade only existed in capital cities, and you'd join/leave it automatically when entering/leaving the cities (unless you manually left). So I think trade just ended up being a more useful chat for capital cities, and since trade and LFG are the two main things to do in a capital, it worked out well.
---
Also, for the oldest servers, WoW didn't launch with LFG channels. It was added in 1.2. Server habits may have been established by then.
---
“Language: Salsa” is hilariously racist.

Happy cake day pirate king. I got 3 notices on one day for the same file.

This was clearly written by someone who has actually, successfully played a druid in pvp. OP, ignore the other posts that were clearly written by rogues, etc.

Copypasta from another thread:
---
&gt;Folks who think a druid is a gimped warrior, rogue, or priest are, in a sense, right. If you want to do one thing, and do it best, don't pick a druid.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;The power of the druid (and the _fun_, especially in pvp) is in being the right one at the right time, adapting yourself to the situation from moment to moment.
---
&gt;[Bruce Lee best explained how to be a druid.](https://youtu.be/cJMwBwFj5nQ)
---
If they continue the current plan with Classic's "No Changes", then factually speaking... *nothing* should happen.
---
As it shouldn't.  Because the majority of WoW players that are going to be playing Classic is are the people who played in Vanilla 15 years ago, except now they are older with jobs and families.  Naturally, if it ever happens and one of these people manage to max a character with T3 and the rest of their BiS gear, they will move onto making another alt and doing it again.
---
But that's just it. The average player is this person. And this person could happily play this Classic WoW for Years and be happy.  This gives Classic WoW several years to thrive. **YES**, *surely* there will be some younger players or returning players with time to devote and will get bored faster. But majority of the player base we are going to see is going to be returning players in their late 20s or 30s with a life that can't be devoted to WoW the way they used to when homework was really the only thing they were worried about.
---
So no, they won't do anything. As they shouldn't.  Because it should be No Changes. And if they Do do anything. At all. It will be a BC launch... a good time from now.
---
TL;DR-  Nothing. They will do Nothing. Maybe BC release. But that's got some time before it happens.
---
Charge is fun.
---
It’s hilarious. Calm ya farm. 
---
There’s entire subreddits devoted to having a laugh at ourselves and others in lighthearted ways, aka blackpeopletwitter, shitwhitepeoplesay etc etc.
---
Nooo this was part of the charm. Nothing quite like a thunderfury chat spam lol.  Good times 
---
It's exactly what I am looking for with Classic as a MT.
---
Could be, though 1.2 was only a month after release. It'd make sense that most people had at some point left LFG and so wouldn't be in it in a city either though. Less people would be leaving trade. 
---
If you are currently dating actively, maybe you should play Classic at a more casual pace so that it doesn't affect your non-gaming life (MORE IMPORTANT).
---
I'm in /r/wowclassic , not in those subreddits, tho.
---
I read that sentence *exactly* the way you intended it to be read.  My focus primarily on the "yuuuuge" part.
---
Thank you for this.
---
Daggers on Fury Warriors prior to them making Whirlwind hit with the offhand in mid TBC was a pretty legit setup, at least in the offhand.
---
Hi, /u/Tomas_Baratheon
---
No interest in playing druid/paladin anymore.
---
Dude, I 100% know where your coming from. This has been a serious question I’ve asked myself as well. To be honest I don’t think that it’s as black and white as “I can’t play if I’m going to progress in other areas of my life” or “ I’m going to play til my eyes bleed” balance the two. If you truly love WOW and enjoy it as a cheap, fun hobby then have fun and play casual. Tell yourself your going to limit yourself on week days to 2hrs a day and 3hrs on weekends. Or the other option is to drop MMOs as a hobby for yourself because you know it’s an area where your self control can’t keep up and the other areas of your life start to drag. It’s your call man but if miss the classic wow experience then have some casual nostalgic fun (: 
---
PS, If you do end up playing I hope to see you in Azeroth. For the alliance ;) 
---
&gt; It’s pretty obvious 
---

I think the idea of "no changes" is being taken out of context. If you look at the OSRS community (which is honestly the only community you could compare wow classic as of today) besides updates, the game has stayed true to the 2007 feel. It's the same thing with WoW. When people want Classic, their not just talking about the overall game itself, but the skill, leveling, talent trees, race choice, class choice, profession leveling etc that came with it. 
---
You mention alts, however, WoW Classic with your approach can easily fall into the BFA issue with allies races, where you quickly realize even though it's a different class, it's the same adventure with no changes which can be demotivating.
---
Blizzard is a business first and foremost. If it was "no changes" there would be a cap with how much money they could make with it and the game would decline overtime.
---
If you can control your play time, sure. If not, then no. One of my coworkers told me a story about how he met his wife: His buddies invited him out to a bar and he was going to raid MC so he said no. Rather than leaving him alone they pestered and peer pressured into coming out so he relented. That’s what he met her and they’ve got two kids now. 
---
So don’t let a video game take you away from the opportunities right in front of you. As with anything, balance is key. 
---
Are you actually upset about this?

I agree, it's hard to take them seriously as warriors. Even as Shado-Pan.
---
Yeah, I'd like it. 
---
That depends entirely on your personality. I remember back in the vanilla / tBC era when some guildies started having marital issues or work-related issues because they played too much and focused too much on the game. Can you play in reasonable amounts? Can you handle a super casual leveling / gearing process? Are you going to get addicted and ignore the rest of your life for your online friends? No one can answer that but you.
---
Given that vanilla came out 14ish years ago, most of us who are going to be playing for the nostalgia are older (I'm in my mid-30s, for example) and have other stuff going on. Classic will be a different experience because many of us already know the world, but we have less time to play. So if you do decide to play you'll be in the same boat as many of us. There will be a slower progression. But there will be progression. In vanilla, I never saw raids beyond ZG because I was never willing to put time into it. And I still had a great time with the game. 
---
It's possible to both play video games and have a life outside of gaming. But that balance depends on what you decide to prioritize. If you want to date, focus on your career, and play a little bit of WoW during your down time, it's entirely possible. But you have to set your priorities and stick to them.
---
Then cheers to BC in a few years! 🍺
---
They haven’t announced when PVP rewards will be given out yet. What matters most is your weapon. Until they tell us when PVP rewards will launch it’s difficult to map out a gear plan. 
---
The funniest thing is the flair the mods gave OP.
---
You sound like you won't be able to control the amount of time you'll be spending on WoW.  
---
It's not worth it. Keep improving your life.  
---
Felstriker? Hehe...
---
Oh I hope the Classic community isn’t like this thread.
---
In vanilla, master loot would bug out sometimes and not be able to pass out loot, which is why free loot would be turned on and ninja followed.
---
Master loot should be fixed by now and hopefully won’t see that behavior.
---
Life your best life, king. If you think your improvement would slip because of any video game, then them off.
---
The games will always be there - the right woman might not wait 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Omg! That flair!

the funny thing is; this is basically the gameplay of every single class in retail now
---
I’ve been listening to westfall on repeat
---
I get you. I'm alone and suffer from anxieties time to time. Life is a balance. If video games are making you unhappy, give them a rest. Or if they make you happy, just show some restraint. Don't let them get in the way of work, social events or day to day living. There's enough hours in a week to fit everything.
---
There’s nothing more powerful than whispering into a girls ear after you’ve laid her (or in a dudes ear after beating his ass) is ‘I have a wow subscription’
---
Simple answer: why not do both 
---
😂😂😂
---
Me too, but Thousand Needles. 
---
You are taking yourself too seriously if that is making you upset
---
You don’t really need to raid for gear but at the start of the game, getting one of the 2handers from MC would really help.

The Tuesday thing means nothing. Tuesday was a release-day back in the days for retail-copies. This was a thing like 30 Years ago.

If we are being legit. My cousin referred to his pserver wow experience on his resume last year and it turned out to be  quite successful for him. Running guild/pug raids and coordinating 40 people is no simple task. Just because it occurs inside a video game doesn't mean the experience is any less valid than coordinating a rookie sports team or small volunteer event. In case anyone is interested, the blurb we used is posted below:
---

Class Leader in the online multiplayer video game *World of Warcraft.*

* Coordinated 40 teammates to execute complex missions, 3 times per week.

\*\*Epoch of Thought \\\[H\\\]\*\* | NA-PvP | Wed, Thur, Sun 1800—2200 PST | Hardcore
---
\*\*About\*\*: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow’s release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  Our leadership is experienced, skilled, and caring.  We've been around since the beginning and we're not quitting until we've farmed naxx enough to gear everyone :).  We look forward to developing a winning team of people you'd not only want to raid with, but would also like to meet in real life if the chance arose.
---
For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We run a unique/proprietary point-guided loot council (attendance and contributions are measured and accounted for but there is no bidding and the system is designed to be transparent and efficient). focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
\*\*What we expect\*\*: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  Toxicity and drama stirring have no place in our guild.
---
In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.
---
\*\*Why We Will Survive and Thrive\*\*:  We are experienced, dedicated, and prepared.  Our leadership team consists of mature, experienced, and professional leaders.  Our raid core consists of experienced, skilled, and most importantly, dedicated raiders.  We are busy doing all the prep work we need to run a highly organized, reasonably competitive guild.  We are inclusive, non-toxic, and value team building and a rewarding social environment over pyrrhic victories.  We were successful in actual vanilla and have only gotten smarter, wiser, and more organized with age.
---
Most importantly we desire complete decimation of classic content and will not stop until we get there.
---
\*\*Raid Schedule\*\*: Wed, Thur, Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
\*\*Looking for\*\*: Great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply; \*\*specifically seeking: Fury Warriors &amp; Mages.\*\* Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. This means that no core spots will be predetermined and certainly not before anyone's hit 60.
---
If you are interested in leadership roles within the guild please send me a whisper &amp; let’s chat.
---
\*\*What we offer\*\*: Membership on an experienced, skilled and dedicated team ran by incredibly dedicated and passionate leadership with the time and flexibility to build and run an organized, efficient team.  Our roster is already very healthy  but we welcome every recruit with the potential to excel in a team environment and those dedicated to enriching themselves and those around them.
---
\*\*Apply\*\*: The best way to join is to shoot me a private discord message \*\*(Discord: Lne#2710 | Battlenet: Lne#1326)\*\*.  You can also hit up either of my assistant GMs on \*\*discord:  XvK#7740  &amp; AYD#5916\*\*

&lt;Mediocre&gt; is led by an extremely experienced player, both in retail and the private server scene. Dependable, transparent leadership coupled with policies that promote healthy competition and community is what sets us apart.

The core of the guild has been playing together on the private server scene for a while. While we are still months away from retail classic launch, we wanted to begin the process of building a player-base for the big show.
---
As information comes in regarding the more nuanced questions surrounding the game (e.g. reverting from 16 to 8 debuffs at launch, dungeon loot itemization/tables etc), we'll be updating our internal resources and plans accordingly. We'll be fully prepared for launch, join now!

if you're at 100 rage, should you bt then ww then execute? or just bt then execute
---
True!
---
Beckon was my favorite Shadow Priest. He's the reason why I rerolled a priest 
---
Definitely don’t disappear in 1.12. I used to keep 3-4 bags worth in the bank, ready for pvp premades or raid times 
---
This was the type of April fools joke I was looking for.  Everthing about this hits all the buttons that would trigger every single member of the community.  Well Played.
---
You earn your days same as anyone else.  Screw anyone that has a problem with you vacationing in Old School Azeroth.
---
If you assign each letter of classic a numerical value based on their positioning in the alphabet then add those numbers together, you get 66. 
---
June 6th confirmed.
---
Craft bandages only when regenning hp/mana between pulls. Kill things on the move between two points. Don't waste time waiting on a spawn if you can just skip it.
---
I started in Vanilla, but to me TBC had better music. TK Forrest and Zangarmarsh with a pinch of nagrand 
---
the lua to allow such bots and scripts was banned ever since the EULA updates of 2.0.1
---
So short answer. Yes you won't be able to dispell with the help of addons anymore on the classic servers.
---
\-
---
As much as the 'no changes' crowd tries to fight things like this. Bliz is not going to allow people to run those scripts again. They made farmbots way too easy
---
It's alright. Just do the right thing. Turn yourself in and take the information of said server with you.
---
When weighing gold/hour versus all around versatility, what's better at farming Mage or Hunter? I think I'm more interested in having a Hunter as my farming alt because doing DM:Trib runs seems really fun.
---
Space Jam 2 has 8 letters and 1 number in its title.  
---
8+1 is 9  
---
9 is a multiple of 3  
---
Half-life 3 confirmed.  
---
Wait. Wrong joke.
---
You'll probably find yourself more popular in any dungeon with elementals DM:W being a big one because of those pylon pulls. But, everyone loves a warlock because they can summon.
---
It depends on how much attack power you have and which weapons you're using (2H/1H/Dagger). If you're using a CTS and have over 2.5k AP (very very unlikely), then WW is more DPR. If that's not the case, then Execute is more DPR. But that can be changed if you're using a BRE, for instance. 
---
As a general guideline, it is more advisable to use BT and Execute until BT is up again. That'll give you the most DPR.
---
Are soul shards a pain in the ass as much as it looks like in vanilla? Thinking about rolling a lock.
---
Rend doesn't scale with weapon damage and falls off signficantly, lvl30-40 seems to be the drop point.
---
I wasn't suggesting not taking the rank 1 of those abilities, I'm debating whether to not take subsequent ranks. For example, spending several gold to add \~20 damage to intercept &amp; pummel (without any improvement in CD/effect) certainly doesn't seem worth the cost.
---
I have a week long trip end of June. I’ll be really mad
---
Great thought! In my case, I like the idea of pre-planning my route.
---
To your point about a BoE, it'll be interesting to see what that market is like. Provided I'm not too far behind, no one will have much gold to buy those BoEs! (They're also going to be much rarer than people are used to from bad pservers with inflated drop rates.)
---
Thanks for the perspective!
---
Unrelated but if you do the same with MATH you get 42. Which makes Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy a lot more interesting.  
---
I wasn't suggesting not getting charge! Just whether I spend several gold to add an additional 6 rage on a long cooldown that I won't always get to use.
---
I’m going rogue as well with mining/engineering. Mining is more profitable than skinning hence my choice there. Will make a mage alt with herb/alch
---
Better get that release date soon then 
---
Oh, are MS ranks cheaper than other skills at that level? I didn't realize talent skills might have different costs.
---
Not sure what is going on with my UI on retail, but it's showing the Vanilla character screen!
---
A bar class wouldn't even be a bad idea if it was implemented correctly. They could do damage or tank etc. just like any other class but have different animations.
---
You are deluding yourself if you think someone who loves Vanilla for what it is, has been playing it for years now, was willing to reroll time and time again because his server became depopulated, is more likely to stop playing Classic than someone who never played Vanilla.
---
All over the subreddit today. One of your addons is doing an april fools day prank. 
---
Those fuckers! I'm here trying to update my shit to fix it lol
---
IIRC Wrath and Warlords are the only two WoW releases to not come out on Tuesdays (Both released on Thursdays incidentally) so it’s pretty traditional for major WoW things to come out on a Tuesday.  
---
Especially since Tuesday is also patch day so it’s the most likely launch date for the digital-only Classic anyways.
---
Just a minor addendum to your statement. Certain addons won't work at all even after people got time to update/adjust their mods. The necessary options for certain lua functions are simply non-existant. (healbot, emergency monitor, decursive - those are the first that come to mind)
---
you will wait....several days to find a Mauradon group.

Do you happen to work for Honda? It was our new fiscal year, too.
---
I didn’t have any issues torrenting the client and deleting it afterwards. Probably depends on your isp and country. 
---
Am I right in assuming druids who heal in classic need to only manage 3-4 ranks of Healing Touch and Regrowth? Do we bother with Rejuvenation? I'm a bit daunted with priests in classic, they seem to have a high ceiling cap with the range of spells at their disposal and as someone who's never healed before, druid seems the most easiest to pick up.
---
I think the community reaction is dependent on how blizzard handles the first high profile ninja looters. If the official response is a permanent ban with the items promptly returned to the proper owner, then I doubt anyone will have that serious of an overreaction. 
---
If nothing happens, or nothing happens publicly (which can be the same thing), then the community will know that blizzard had no teeth and that it's up to us, the community, to dole out justice. 
---
Now, I'm not saying that that is right but that will happen if blizzard does nothing. And, at that point, then everything you mentioned is on the table including potential swatting calls. So let's hope blizzard brings down the hammer of justice when it comes to those blatant loot ninjas.
---
Raiding will be easier this time around while ranking in pvp could be harder (more people who no-life nowadays). 
---
Point being, I think raiding will be the way to go to gear up.
---
The effort is minimal, but it does consume valuable time. A dedicated few, who's utility is noticed, will.
---
Honestly it kind of sounds like you shouldn’t.
---
Classic is the least casual friendly iteration of wow. At max level, you’ll have to commit to certain times to raid for PvE, and for pvp the honor system means you’ll hit a cap and that can’t really progress from bgs anymore unless you expand your playing time. Will you be satisfied with being in shitty blues/maybe some pug MC gear/blue pvp gear (even that takes some time)? It seems very likely at some point you’ll find little bits of extra time to add to your wow hours, and that will cut from the time you are allocating to things like dating. If you are obsessive, you’ll probably sacrifice more time than you’d like from your social life, but still not enough to excel at wow, and be dissatisfied with both. It also sounds like you are in place where meeting someone soon is really important to you. Maybe find a hobby that enhances you as a person where you won’t be held back like time, or even just exercise regularly (if you don’t already), or learn to cook etc.
---
If you could enjoy playing wow just for the leveling experience maybe it wouldn’t be so bad, although you’ll need to ask yourself if you will really be able to stick to that. If you do meet someone and have a character to play at max level when BC likely comes out a few years down the road, that’s much more casual friendly. You know yourself though and what you really want (hopefully), and none of us do.
---
Oh, you two are in for some arguments if she thinks that’s a reward
---
It's a game man, if it becomes a really bad problem then maybe you should take a break or seek help. It shouldn't be getting in the way of your life. If it's just a joke than hahahaha, but really if u need help you need to talk to someone not in game :)
---
I’ll be looking at taking a few days to a week off around then too, but due to needing some days off left for Christmas break it won’t be more than that.
---
I think you have no idea how WoW works. If a new Expansion releases there is no Patchday. The Patch with all the new Data releases like a Month in advance and when it actually releases they just flip a switch and its released.
---
I'm sorry about your accident, hope that you will get better soon. Its good that blizzard thought about wheel-chair raiding when they did Alliance
---
All those 33 minuses are an April Fool’s joke, chillaxe broski
---
Exactly, holidays mean different things to different people. It doesn’t always mean your going away to the Bahamas lol
---
Xzibit 
---
Saved them in dropbox.
---
I wouldn’t rank up slam, but I would for mortal strike. You’ll be using MS off cooldown. That aside, I think your list is good. You’ll save plenty of money not levelling those you mention in your first paragraph, and I agree with all the choices. 
---
Man I use to play 12 hours + a day lol
---
40 vs 40 in vanilla happens once every blue moon,  less than 0,1% of your play time.  Biggest fights you'll encounter on a regular basis is something like ~8  vs ~8  in AB at Blacksmith.
---
I dont have a gf. Nobody cares how long i play. And when i'm finished, i masturbate.
---
Those people had to try it for the first time just like everyone else.  Why is it supposedly NO one except the people that are familiar with Vanilla WoW will continue to play the game? We dont know what the normal person will do, I’ll say it again ITS ALL SPECULATION. 
---
I'm surprised anyone used Facebook in 2006.
---
You guys seem like a perfect fit for me. I’m looking forward to playing again. I played a lot of Everquest, Everquest 2, and jumped over when WoW came out. 
---
Quick question.  What does the rogue distract skill do? I can't remember the benefit, especially in pvp.
---
I sure as hell hope release is late June so I don’t have to flunk my exams for classic wow
---
Idk I see it as another cloth caster class, with one healing spec (Romance), a DD spec (Adventure) and a tank spec (Heavy Metal)
---
Ehhh depends on your perspective. I’m 26 single atm but am purposely not trying to pursue a relationship with anyone so I have more time to no life this game lol. May sound sad whateva it’s what I wanna do. That’s not saying I’m pushing women away at every opportunity, I’m still open to meeting someone cool I just may not be going out every weekend to attempt it.
---
That being said I been with a few women already and know the”song and dance “ if you will of meeting the womanz. So if I really need to crawl out of my hidey-hole to meet ppl, I have the reference experience to just do it. Not trying to flex or anything like i said just giving a perspective. 
---
If you really feel like  this area in your life is lacking you should absolutely put time into meeting girlies. Otherwise your unconscious will nag you as your putting your 13th hour of wow into the day.
---
Originally watched this while chain-wiping on Huhuran. Good times.
---
Pretty sure it interrupts 
---
Fuck.....
---
240-300 hours played in any game would be considered a pretty heavy investment. Like, you’d be satisfied you got your moneys worth on a game of any price, and most people would feel ok with stopping there.
---
That’s how long it will be taking most people to get to 60! Behind every single 60 toon is a ton of effort and investment, so yeah, a lot of people will fall off along the way. And I assure you most people who believe they’ll hit lvl 20 on day 1 are blinded by what subsequent expansions made them used to. There are actual hardcore powerlevellers and speed runners of course, but they are a minority.
---
It's probably not too bad if you wait till 45 so you have instant corruption as well as SL. No instant corruption sucks the donkey didi so I would just hold out till then. You will be missing nightfall and SL and SM but I don't think you'll have any problems levelling. It might be worth levelling with succy out with SL just because incoming damage won't be too much of an issue, and you get the +10% dmg  from master demo as well as succy naturally higher dps. Then you can fel dom out a vw a puppy if you need to for pvp.
---
It wasn’t so crazy given that Starcraft was released on the N64
---
Same, I remember a lot of people believing this too!
---
If you know bad hair will bother you, just be sure to pick one you like at the start. Make sure to rotate in character creation and look at it from behind so you know how it is from that perspective, as that’s what you’ll see 99% of the time.
---
It makes you turn a direction (towards where it is cast, just like an how it works on an NPC). You can use it in pvp to annoy people mainly. I think if they're auto running (particularly on a mount) it cancels it so that can be handy.
---
It definitely was, the /pizza thing had essentially just happened in EQ. A partnership with Pizza Hut was one of the ways they tried to claw back their lost revenue as people left the aging EQ for other MMO’s.
---
Balance in all things. Easier said than done, but if you try classic and see it's interfering with other life goals, you know what to do. 
---
Try enlisting a friend to help keep you accountable. You can have it in moderation, of course. It's just going to take some vigilance on your part. 
---
I am keeping my WoW Classic time a secret, don't need anybody finding out how much time I am really sinking in to it. Feels like I am hiding a drug addiction.
---
"it's ready when it's ready"
---
No matter how many times you keep repeating the words "interesting" and "fluent", it doesn't make a bar of blocks more than a bar of blocks. This isn't a resource system it is just a picture.
---
So you're a screaming black kid having a stroke?
---
COME DO WoW HEROIN WITH US, ANON, JUST ONCE MORE. IT'S NOT LIKE IT WILL KILL YOU.
---
Thank god rogues like him are very rare.
---
If you're on a PvP server it might even out or increase efficiency depending on how often you get ganked and how effective you are at using soul link in duels.
---
Hah!! This is exactly how I felt when I told my husband. We quit in Cata and swore we'd never go back. Repeatedly. 
---
The instant I found out about classic WoW I did a complete 180. My husband tried to talk me out of it at first. Some of my friends did too. Like a day later they all changed their minds and now we're all going to play together. I can't wait to get addicted all over again!
---
why do i suddenly feel 15 again, now i remember this so vividly
---
Ah fair enough I hadn't considered that. 
---
But i was dispelling with healbot in 2012 so we must be talking about different things...🤔
---
You still have corruption, curse of agony and wand so it won't slow you down much at all
---
If you want to
---
“Best”
---
The cloud gaming section was added to ban the botters/cheaters using cloud platforms to bypass detection. They will not enforce the EULA if you are streaming from your home computer to another personal device. 
---
I have 300 hours of PTO built up. My body is ready.
---
Oooooooor you can, hear me out here, respec for raids. Or is that to much work?
---
Everytime I see this subject come up I think of Ironsides on the old F*enix servers.
---
Good times.
---
The most basic thing to learn for lvling warrior 1-59 is to not use zero-stam pieces. You should be using str+stam or agi+stam.
---
It makes the character face the distract centre point 
---
So it can delay or interrupt only if the attack or spell requires you to face a target and you use it to make them face the other way
---
I clear my throat and with as much stern authority as i can muster tell everyone to get bent. I'm going back where I'm happy no more dancing monkey at social shit I don't want to be at because I'm a reclusive shut in. I got things to do, loot to grab and a hobby to enjoy I've sorely missed. If you need me plan a date in about a decade because my days are spent with my family and my nights are spent on azeroth.
---
It sure sounds very bizniz like.
---
I voted zg over bwl simply as a guild officer/raid leader it was less stress to run. Both environments were great with a variety of interesting mechanics.
---
We know what the normal person will do, because we have data from Blizzard. Once again, 90% of characters (or was it accounts) never passed level 10.
---
What makes you think blizzard would ever entertain the idea of banning people for /ninjalooting/?
---
same here man. can’t let anyone know i’m playing wow. bald and bearded chief of brigade, cannot lose that hard earned respect from my men (ex prisoners, boxers and all sorts of tough guys).
---
solitude awaits
---
Theres likely a person out there on the same fence that could be with you. Some couples go bowling. Some shit on horde trash together. Find someone that would roll healer for you then marry it. Problem solved.
---
More than likely there will no be a beta.
---
They know the game works
---
They know the engine works
---
There will most likely just be launch, which means no addons for a few days/weeks
---
I don't play Druid but afaik you are never going to use Regrowth because it wastes too much mana, and you'll use Rejuv here and there just like a priest would use Renew, especially on aoe heavy fights.
---
And then you get T3's set bonus and just keep rejuvs rolling on your rogues/warriors because the tick has a chance to give them energy/rage (and mana if it's on your casters, but not as impactful).
---
The orc character model will not be changed. 
---
#nochanges
---
we dont know
---
I misspoke, I didn't succumb to FB for some time so it would've been MSN :)
---
nah theyll get banned by blizzard
---
Players count as humanoid, proof of that is hunter and druid's tracking abilities. They probably deleted their comment after they realized they were wrong.
---
You're an inspiration dude! Keep up the great work, I'm really looking forward to your race to 60 in Classic, I'm rooting for you!
---
It turns targets around when they're out of combat. They turn towards where you throw distract.
---
My parents played too, so they understand.
---
10k is not necessary. Give me 5k and I’ll be content.
---
Good point we're all going to be broke AF! Hah
---
Everybody and their mom let their heads and legs get enchanted with +100 health. Does that means its a glitch, because lvl 19s can't do Blackrock Depths by themselves?
---
Don’t be silly:) Do your exams properly, wow will still be there after you’re done!
---
This seems an apt time to remind everyone (as a dude currently getting his bachelor in psychology) that video games do not cause addiction. 
---
So many studies have been done on the subject (especially by media looking for a scapegoat to blame stuff on) that academically speaking it’s frankly annoying. All of them (credible ones not paid for by agendas anyhow) all state the same thing: unable to find a link between playing video games and addictive issues. On the contrary some games like Starcraft 2 is being studied heavily for its proven positive effects on cognitive development.
---
There is a distinction to be aware of however. Video games do not cause addiction, but if a person has an underlying, pre-existing addictive tendency or disorder, video games can be a trigger for it. If you find that this fits you, the first thing to do is become aware of it and learn to take care of yourself. Consider a psychologist as good advice will help you manage the issue and better take care of yourself.
---
In particular, do not let the social stigma that sadly still prevails some places to guilt you. It is perfectly normal to take a leave of absence from work for things like a vacation or a hobby. Some people will not get that, nor count video games as one, but that is their ignorance. We’ve waited a decade for this, there’s no shame in making it the event we want it to be.
---
See you all in Azeroth &lt;3
---
Nahhhh
---
Actually 1.12 druids were pretty decent
---
lmao. remind me 6 months and we’ll duel. i guarantee you’re trash. 
---
30% threat reduction nuke at will
---
If I were in your shoes I would know I shouldn't play WoW but I would anyways and then I'd go from 30-36 no wife or girlfriend
---
Then I'd get suicidal all over again.... Wait...
---
Let me try again: I've already decided that doing nothing but working 8-10 hours a day then playing WoW is my life from now on. 
---
It would be both extremely disappointing and a relief if I log in and don't find classic fun at all
---
IIRC:
---
\- You are not automaticly grouped when joining a BG.
---
\- The honor you get depends on the targets rank and how much damage your group has done to them. If you are solo and do all damage you get all honor. If your group has 2 members in range and your group do 50% of the targets hp in dmg, you get 25% honor.
---
\- The honor is split even between the members in your group who is within range.
---
\- If you get instant queues in a premade grp honor from kills won't matter much compared to bonus from winning.
---
\- If the queues are long (45min+) and your faction is mostly winning the random vs random BG's, honor from racking up solo kills will outweigh bonus from winning the BG. This means soloing (preferably with an out-of-group healer) is the best honor/hour on your faction.

Pretty good watch. The patience that both players play with is insane. Unrelated to the video itself, but even as a rogue I prefer MNs videos. Just more chill editing, soundtracks and the footage feels a little more natural. Both dudes are great players though. 
---
Sure you did
---
With teebu’s blazing longsword as the main hand 
---
Find someone who also enjoys video games. Back when I was in high school I convinced my bf to play WoW with me and it was sooo fun playing together! Haven’t played since 2011, but I really miss this game and wish my current partner knew what it was like back in the good ole days.
---
giving the SO due warning. Not telling anyone who doesn’t need to know. 
---
man internet addiction is literally in the DSM, where are you studying psychology lol
---
Maybe Blizzard could give us two different servers for the beta. One for the classic population cap, and with double the capacity, and just see what happens (we won't *really* know until people actually hit level 60 and things have stabilized a bit)
---
Wtf... 🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Why are you directing that comment to me? I was saying **exactly** what you are saying now
---
Hello?
---
JUST ONE MORE HOUR MATE, WHAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN
---
I'm currently in the same hunter profession debate boat. I'm thinking mining/skinning right off the bat. Basically going to live in un'goro and farm thorium + devilsaurs awhile instead of farming mara ad nauseam. Get some wpvp in, stack up on arcane crystals for an arcanite reaper, that sorta thing.
---
From what I've seen mining has the most value early on. Might as well mine early, stock up on mats to level engi twice (gnomish/goblin). Drop skinning first, pick up engi. Make sure you get that taken care of incase you have to do some more pesky mining. Then drop mining for herb and achieve your final form. Or go super crazy and get BS for the fear immune trinket.
---
Boom
---
Don't tell them 😏🍆
---
Some people put their overtime into pension savings. Some people pay off mortgage. Some people save it for when their first son is born. This guy/gal knows what really matters.
---
Between this guy, Stitches, and bored Horde players Duskwood was a major PITA to level in 
---
&gt;  But you may also be wrong.
---
And you cannot live with yourself if someone is wrong on the internet, i get it. Like i said, its my estimation, so fuck off.
---
The world worked on 10k vanilla pservers. I don’t see 5K not being GREAT on official servers. It will definitely feel packed at the start, but even 2K would feel packed when everyone is in a few low level areas.
---
ONE...MORE....LEVEL....
---
It won’t be the same. 
---
It will be fun tho. -5 years of private server vanilla. 
---
It's cool that they did a classic-themed joke :)
---
A true community player!
---
Never Forget in game Panda Express ordering. 
---
These two players are in fact the best players representing their class. They’ve proved it many times and they’ll prove it again in Classic.
---
hm, I definitely remember soul shards disappearing on logout and then that later being changed
---
We're talking about WoW, not Skyrim
---
hey that's pretty good!
---
I did some testing on Retail and warriors should not have any issues Switching stances and weapons in a One Single GDC  (In Combat) when classic launches.   But we don't if you can switch weapons while casting.  (Since we can't do it in Retail)
---
Retail BFA: (In Combat)  Even if a GCD is active you can still swap weapons, but swapping weapons activates a GCD.  
---
Of course. Remember hunters: when in doubt, roll need.
---
Thanks - T3 is a pretty hopeful prospect at this point! Unless there are weekend only guilds playing
---
What about hamstring kiting with a big slow 2h
---
No, but since it's based on legion maybe modern addons will work?   
---
  I have no doubt there will be a lot of new addons anyways.  
---
Your friend sounds like hes smuggling cocks in his asshole
---
Tranquil Air might be handy
---
LOL i literally had this conversation with my manager earlier. "I'm not exactly sure when this game is going to be released, but you know I never take time off for anything and I am going to take off a week for this."
---
Well maybe they didn't play on a popular one. Thats more likely than OPs friend thinking Vanilla had 20k pops.
---
**\[A\] Kiwi/Aus Semi-casual Raiding Guild (NA | PvE)**
---
In Vanilla WoW, many more people ran dungeons as they levelled. It was common to meet likeminded people and make friends as you journeyed through Azeroth. The world was huge, with lots to experience – and that experience was magnified for people who joined a guild whose members supported and helped each other.
---
This is a guild where you can hang out and chat, join guild-led instance runs, quest together, and give and receive help with classes and game mechanics.
---
**Are you a progression guild?**
---
This is intended to be a guild for people who work full-time and have families but still want to enjoy playing Classic with others. We are going to take our time to level to 60, but there is an expectation to gear up and delve into raiding (and a bit of level 60 PvP).
---
**What are the requirements?**
---
The guild has a few rules:
---
* Be open and willing to accept all different kinds of players, with different levels of experience, a different approach to how they play and different real-life commitments
---
* Have a good attitude to the game in general and towards your guildmates, regardless of how they choose to play; be willing to help others where needed, albeit dungeon runs, supporting alts or helping people with group quests
---
* Be willing, as you approach level 60, to work towards pre-raid gear
---
* Be free for three hours, two nights a week for dedicated raiding progression
---
* Be communicative: let the guild leader or other guild officers know if you need to take a break or can’t attend a raid or event
---
This is about community and helping each other enjoy the game; but understanding that sometimes life itself prevents you from doing everything you may want to do.
---
**Is this guild only for Kiwis/Aussies?**
---
We will be raiding 9 p.m. to 12 a.m. NZST (New Zealand Standard Time), two nights a week – but anyone is welcome to join.
---
**Do I have to have played vanilla WoW?**
---
I suspect many people who are going to jump into Classic experienced vanilla WoW to some degree. There may be a few dabblers or people who started in TBC or Wrath; but I predict that the majority of those who stick around through to level 60 will be veterans coming into the remake with a nostalgic view.
---
This guild is a place of acceptance, where anyone with the right attitude and willingness to learn and improve can find a home. I’m looking for people with dedication, who are willing to level to 60 and enjoy playing with like-minded people as part of a supportive community.
---
**I didn’t see a name. What is the guild called?**
---
I have a few names in mind, but I’m going to put the guild name to a vote once the game goes live, for two reasons:
---
* If I name the guild now, there’s no guarantee that the name will be available when we get the guild charter up (call me paranoid)
---
* Collective, or at least majority agreement on the name, will give people more investment in the guild
---
I understand that some people may not want to commit until they know what the name of the guild is. We will have many weeks, if not months of levelling to 60, so I don’t expect a full 40-man raid of committed members when Classic goes live. But it sure would be nice!
---
I am also hoping that those who are happy with the choice of name when the time comes will be willing to pitch in and help pay for the guild charter. The more people who pitch in, the sooner we will be able to secure the name that we agree on – if enough people contribute to the 10g fee, we may even snag the name we want within a few days (or even hours) of release.
---
**How do I apply?**
---
We have a guild Discord server ([https://discord.gg/wc6Eye3](https://discord.gg/wc6Eye3)) where you can put in an application; or PM me on Discord: Lokhor#2882.
---
Peace.
---
Until adulthood got in the way.
---
What have you brought to this accursed land
---
Yeah and that one attack that drains mana from your target makes it mostly unlimited. 
---
It’s hella fun... a bit too fun :( :/ :)
---
Yes, but one can assume that a proto-meme about linking an item would occur most frequently in a chat where you can actually link items.
---
Back in vanilla as a warrior, rogues were the only class that I could reliably beat in 1v1.
---
Not sure I will play a warrior in classic, but if I do I hope rogues will not see this video :D
---
Found your self a gamer and play with her ^^, That's what I have right now and it's amazing. 
---
Yes, and I believe it's one of the most important things to consider that many overlook.  
---
  This is a golden opportunity, one that will be taken if classic starts strong, blizz gets a second shot at their golden goose, storylines can be handled better, resulting in characters such as kael and illidan not being wasted, something so dumb even modern blizz had to start changing, on top of not writing themselves into a corner like they did with current wow, heavily limiting their story lines, future possible games, etc.  
---
  With retail declining more and more every patch, I'd think it would even be foolish for blizz to not do this, BUT, and a big but at that, only if classic does exceedingly well on the first months.  
---
 Don’t be silly , his exams will be there but the launch of classic is a one time thing ! :o
---
Half joking here.
---
A lot of people play like this and dont feel the need to make videos. some people are even better, like Mn doesnt use trinkets/engi/skull very well and jumps maybe 2 novas in his 20 movies while perplexity only plays on dead servers farming keyturners. 
---
Classic will be here to stay, there is nothing wrong if you start an year later or even more than that. From your post it sounds you can not control your time. I would suggest to focus on your personal life and career and you will be surprised by the results. 
---
Meet someone, travel a bit, it’s ton more fun at the beginning and you won’t even be thinking about WOW. 
---
I am writing this because I had the same issue but I was younger, around 18. Highly addicted, bad grades, no job etc. It took me about 2-3 years to put my life back together and do what I always wanted to do. 
---
Now I am 27, good job, beautiful wife and I have a son, but I know how you feel. Your life and the events that happen and the people you meet and if it’s a special one, WOW will be at the bottom of your list and you wouldn’t even care. The feeling of being successful is addictive and I think you will do just fine, just remember that your life comes first.
---
Yeah just mention it in your Tinder profile. What could possibly go wrong?
---
Ok I nearly gave up on life but then I remembered this.
---
Why would you want to date in our generation? The dating game has been destroyed by social media and most women have become selfish narcissists. I used to think like you — I’ve had 3 long term relationships over the past 7 years and they all crumbled.
---
Now I think WoW is more worth it. You won’t get this chance again. There could be a relaunch in 15 years but do you really think it’s going to happen?
---
Women of the 21st century will be great at the start but will waste your time in the long run. They see us opportunities, not individuals. The idea of real relationships and love is dying due to social media and hookup culture. You need to do what makes you happy for yourself. Play fucking WoW man and if worst comes to worst, 30 is still young so you can find a woman later. 
---
Never sacrifice what you enjoy for a woman and don’t feel bad about it either. If you have to stop playing WoW to keep her then she’ll just fuck you over in the long run anyway.
---
Also don’t worry about your career too much, the economy/society will collapse in the next 30 years due to everything I mentioned above and abrupt climate change.
---
/r/mgtow /r/collapse
---
I have been playing on a server with 1-1.5k average, and Its very alive.
---
This year they only had a budget to describe their April fool's joke
---
Feel free to check us out on our Discord [https://discord.gg/92V5CCD](https://discord.gg/92V5CCD) Guild name is Glamorama. We aim to progress through content while it's relevant but not "no-life" it. In order to do so we are gathering a group of competent players that now how to play their class. We will accept ppl without prior Vanilla-exp but wont cudle ppl that aren't pulling their own weight. We plan to raid twice a week (tues/thurs) and no planned activities during weekends in order to allow for a wow/IRL-life balance. That said, random ZG-runs and wPvP will probably happen during the weekends when the kids have fallen asleep
---
I suppose it's hard to objectively prove such a thing, but they are fuking good though.
---
It sounds pretty good, tbh. Your survivability goes way up, which means less downtime and less corpse running. Especially on a PvP server it sounds neat. I bet [something like this talent build](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IVMbZ0xIzgxot) would work.
---
In my experience, Shadowbolt generates a lot of threat and with a Nightfall proc, that's just more threat. AKA the enemy will focus on you instead of your VW. You'll still use Corruption, Immolate and CoA with the same damage output and wand 'em down. I agree with Minkelz on the instant Corruption.
---
Total healers count is what matters. In my guild the amount of shamans varied greatly but is around 8 right now in AQ with a decrease in the amount of priests (up to 2) and druids (up to 2). That how the guild composition evolved as players moved.
---
As for gearing. MC tier and offtier items aren't as rare as you may think. It will take take to make a sort of set from them or even more to get mp5 trinket from Onyxia but it's gradually moving forward.
---
I'm in a loot council guild and that is IMHO much better than any DKP or drama variants. You know beforehand which class gets priority on what and where you are in the line, what is an open roll and what is not - so there is no cheesing, no shady actions. Before the raid tier even released you know everything.
---
Sure bro
---
They should have made the quickbar numbers go up to eleven.
---
There is nothing more sexy than someone talking passively about his hobbys. Also you are not committed so alot of time to play.
---
Just forget about dating, wow is your life now.
---
But what about that F R E S H experience
---
Are you saying that you actually got friends &amp; had any family left after the 1st time getting addicted to WoW?
---
Cat durid is 4 FITE!
---
Lot of people will want Enhancement or Elemental or Ret Pala, Balance Druid... this will be "fun" to watch.
---
Way back in Vanilla, about a month or two out from BC, my wife gave me a choice: her, or WoW. I'd played since release, but I didn't hesitate. I chose her. 
---
Back in December, when I started getting interested in Classic, I raised the subject one night after our daughter had gone to bed. As I expected, her first reaction was a bit of trepidation. But then brought up how much I'd changed since then. I wasn't in my early 20's anymore, studying (badly) at uni; I was in my late 30's with a regular job, a wife and child. My mindset now is totally different; I don't game for extended periods anymore, and with a 5 year old running around, it's not like I really can anyway. 
---
Most of all though, she said it would be a way for me to play with my friends again. Most of them who played WoW with me back in the day are dads themselves now, though they still game. But most of the games they're playing aren't appropriate for my daughter to see, or else aren't of interest to me. Classic is something they all want to play, and it's something that my daughter can watch without any issues. She's in fact already seen a few screenshots of dragons and is very interested in seeing more. I foresee myself having a Hunter alt just so I can tame animals for her and name them what she wants. 
---
God damn I love you Brits
---
I wouldn’t spec sl till you can get those afflic talents also though, at least 47 for SL and imp drain soul pref 49 for life tap as well.
---
Much better, this time. When I got home from work one day, my room was trashed and my PC was taken out of my room. My family gave me an intervention about spending too much time playing video games ... Needless to say I was confused and deeply hurt. I knew I played a lot, but this was the most fun and social I've ever been in my life. Playing with IRL workmates and friends from school, I was studying and working part-time as well. For years I thought playing games was wrong, I felt ashamed and hid it from my family for years ... 10 years passed, my mother comes to visit me, get the typical, "How are you? What have you been up to lately?" I tell her I'm playing WoW and I didn't give a fuck. I love her to bits and explained to her how I felt after that day. I just put it down to my folks being from the days of "video games are for kids" and they were just looking out for me ... But whatever, it's in the past, I'm happy and my mother's happy that I'm happy

Im sure we have people that are faster than Usain Bolt out there, too, they just dont feel like competing.
---
"still haven't met someone"? You're 27. Take it from a 26 year old that just ended a 5 year relationship, you've got *time*, my man.
---
Or just find a girl that plays WoW.
---
Yea i think it would be good idea to go real school instead of University of Azeroth.
---
SWG was the shit though. Greatest sandbox ever. 
---
Yeah I get da downvotes. You made me lol though 
---
Then do it already ya fuckin nerd
---
The video editing is pretty rough and makes it very difficult to want to continue to watch personally. Only made it like 2 minutes.
---
No sleep it is
---
Enchanted forest (Teldrassil) will always be my favorite!
---
I will after i am done with University of Narnia.
---
Seeing a number people in the major city and a few people scattered around the world is not alive at all. But I get it, I thought the same when I had nothing to compare to it.
---
Shamans anyone?
---
I have PTSD all those shamans wanting Azuregos dagger
---
That is not knowing. That’s a figure that doesn’t show us a whole lot but got people to stop asking questions at the time of that statement’s release. 90% of all characters means nothing, plenty of people have alts, bank or otherwise. 
---
Even if there was a 90% mass exodus of accounts being active, sharding wouldn’t magically stop it. 
---
Yeah definitely. Instant Corruption and Imp Drain Soul are too good to pass up. 
---
If there‘s little enough Fortnite-Kids then it‘ll likely evolve into something oldies like us will understand. Guess we‘ll have to find out in summer. 
---
All these wannabe warriors make me sad.
---
Unless you are very very well geared (which means raiding) and you have friends assisting you (heals, dispells), warriors are shit at PVP, assuming competent opponents of course. 
---
I was very frustrated with the class back in Vanilla, and if you could find what was said in the forums back then you would see I wasn't alone.
---
So unless you have a lot of time in front of you (raiding + farming consumables) and some healer friends, I would say it's not worth it to lvl a warrior for PVP.
---
Side note : I don't know how the player base has changed, but back then when I was healing in PVP with my priest alt, I was receiving a lot of thanks. I remember a Tauren warrior even gave me 50G in Alterac after I enabled him to crush the Alliance defense and told me "dude ! If you were a girl I would kiss you on the mouth" :D
---
Imagine the despair of the guy to just give 50G to a random player just because he received some heals once ! 50G is a lot in vanilla. I followed him the whole BG :D
---
And games with RNG mechanics are literally slot machines with a very fancy UI. There's a reason loot boxes are creating headlines across the globe. 
---
Even if we play along and say that videogames themselves don't cause addiction - elements inside different types of games do. 
---
WoW is basically an online casino and that's what pulls you in. RPGs, pen and paper or computer based, are all based on RNG and in gambling that's referred to as a Game of Chance. That's why we like playing them (speaking from a psychological point of view) and why they get us so hooked. 
---
StarCraft and similar types of games are not based on RNG and don't trigger the same reward system in our brain and are more similar to sports. Same reason why eSports are games with very little RNG - it's a competition of skill, not luck. That's also one of the reasons we see RNG based loot systems being tacked onto genres - to make them more addictive. 
---
Its not a few people. Its people everywhere. 
---
adulthood is given me even more time to game than childhood. maybe I'm doing it wrong...
---
Hmm i see, mana tide is that important then.
---
Ill consider the one you linked.
---
Hard when you have to know that far in advance. Feel for you. Shouldn't be bad though since they are releasing content in chunks. Losing out on some early grind time won't put anyone far behind. And those who rush will probably find themselves a bit bored after rushing through everything. 
---
I certainly dont have it that hard for PTO. I telecommute as a software dev. Most of the team is remote and across many timezones and 2 continents, so PTO scheduling and work hours are really flexible since everyone is on different schedules anyway.
---
This post made me realize I'm never gonna get into any serious raiding. It's just not worth it. There is so much more in life than wow and I don't wanna miss that. 
---
Give me those shitty blues any day and I'll have fun anyway. 
---
You said that we all wish we could have 10k people servers. We don't all wish that.
---
A good game is a good game, no matter how old it is. Vanilla WoW is a good game. It has very compelling game design that developers tried copying for a decade.
---
This is the main reason I am really keen to have friends to play with whom have played before and DON'T want to straight to the deep end. 
---
If we all want to play more casually and maintain healthy social lives we're not going to lose it, right?
---
It's not going to be like that time I quit for a month in Vanilla and came back to "raid casually" and ended up even more hardcore than before... RIGHT?!
---
Yeah people are deluding themselves if they think it will be the same as before. Nobody knew what was going on back then, and just playing games on the internet at all was a pretty new thing in the world.
---
But yes, it will still be fun
---
You poor dumb piece of shit. 
---
AMS with no upper limit was my jam on Sarth 3 drakes and Sapphiron, eating 1 million nukes for breakfast!
---
I think 5k is a good compromise. It's almost double what most servers were in vanilla while not being a faceless nobody with 10 ppl farming in all of the farming areas.
---
How was it back in the day prior to battlegrounds? Was there no honour at all and pvp was just for fun? Or was there honour ranking without battlegrounds?
---
Like nefarious 20% add spawns. If you have 20 ppl with engineering those adds die in 1-2 seconds. Nobody even notices them. Melee actually COMPLAIN that they didnt get to throw their sappers (lower their dps logs).
---
Well, you can do that with stratholme water as they are undead, but same idea applies to like the green blob in AQ40 when it splits up.
---
&gt;dynamic respawn
---
Which classic wont have.
---
I say, stay away from Wow. There are much more important things in life and it's stupid to risk them for an addictive game if you know it's gonna be problems. 
---
Internet addiction isn't the topic.
---
Can't find it in any of the patch notes :)
---
Dating is also a game life. 
---
I only have internet friends who game, so they don't give a damn. Though none want to play classic unfortunately. An excuse for me though to branch out and meet new gaming buds to spend the next decade with off and on.
---
The Arcanite reaper is only good when everyone is in green or dungeon blues and judging how fast they rush the raids nowadays, this sweet AR is not going to last long.
---
5% spirit

Don't you guys have phones?

It isn't true that 300 hours in 'any game' would be considered a pretty heavy investment.  I have 1,000 hours in Dota 2 and am still considered a beginner.  I have a. 300 hours in R6 Siege and it's still early days.  OTOH, there are games that you can master in 20 hours and feel pretty good that you seen all there is to see.  It just depends.  And, of course, WoW has more to do with the first two games than the third type.
---
You are truly terrible, Benjamin. 
---
With burst you only mean: use orc racial... 
---
&gt; Not excited by an extra 6 rage on every other pull  
---
Said no warrior ever !
---
A warrior always need more rage, MORE RAGE MORE RAGE MORE RAGE !!!!!!!!
---
Else you will feel like a paladin waiting for your auto attacks ;-)
---
Sigh, that move is bound to cause so many misunderstandings and rampant ignorance. Yes in the perhaps most controversial move yet in the DSM scale, gaming disorder is now under the list. Naturally this means we're talking of a simple video games = bad equation. No, its a bad name and reality is never as simple as tabloid news.
---
The formula they are using to designate people is a list of 9 criteria where if you fit 5 of them, you qualify to have the disorder. This list has faced harsh criticism as it is both vague and extremely subjective. One of them is literally ''Thinks about video games outside of playing video games'', a criteria that like the rest in the list, can easily be attributed to just about any hobby - you might as well call your grandpa addicted to fishing when he starts rambling in the middle of dinner.
---
Now why would they decide to do this? Well its no secret most people play video games these days, and if you want to take the extra leap and just call it the internet, you can in all practicality say everyone does it. When you take the sample pool of everyone, thats a lot of people, and given what we know of human nature: some are bound to have issues. To be unable to self manage and regulate. Those people need help, but what i stated above remains true: their issues, while certainly real, are not caused by video games - they are fueled by them. It is an important distinction that will no doubt escape many others besides yourself. This is further evidenced by the many surveys and analysis of the general health of the gaming community, all of which find that gamers are as mentally, socially and physically healthy as any other demographic. Not nearly the state you'd expect to find if games were rapidly consuming humanities ability to self regulate (not that we've necessarily ever been that great at that to begin with, but the point stands)
---
The highest figures I've seen cited as having issues was somewhere around 1-2%. That is still a lot of people to be sure, but not the cause for mass hysteria and panic that tabloids sell you on, which as is sadly the norm, is the first thing you find when googling. It is largely the same phenomenon that caused soccer moms to refuse vaccinations.
---
Let me simplify it for you: There is no such thing as ''wow addiction'', nor was gaming disorder added to the DSM to combat it. There is such a thing as addictive personality disorder, and that naturally needs to be combated, however the latter existing does not mean the former does. 
---
A last distinction (in the hope that if i keep mentioning the word you may perhaps understand it) is that addictive personality disorder can attach to just about anything.
---
At this point you are far to offended with me over attacking your core beliefs, so perhaps your bias will be better served by reading this statement from an impartial 3rd party: 
---
http://www.theesa.com/article/entertainment-software-association-statement-december-3-dialogue-world-health-organization/
---
This. They also said they will disable some functions on the modern API that they feel don't belong to Classic, they haven't said what though, so it's really not possible to write/update addons for Classic before it comes out.
---
why would i feel stupid about some trash comment that you wrote because my opinion doesnt fit yours ... hahaha 
---
The kid gonna turn into ur gold farmer huh
---
Dude don't even remind me... if I haven't been maining DK since Wotlk I'd give up on that class in BfA. It plays absolutely terrible now and I can't recognize my once favourite class.
---
Is there any chance there will be a trial like today. That you can level up to level x before having to sub but you have certain restrictions?
---
Hey, even if she doesn't stick with it, you can make a twink/transute alt out of it.
---
Ye all those runs hoping ur item dropped
---
Then hoping u won the roll
---
Or farming whatever boe
---
Its all slots 
---
Precisely
---
This year it was one of the worst imo. Of course r/wow downvote you into oblivion if you say that, but compared to even last year's it was just as lazy as the whole BfA. 
---
Come back to all your gold and items gone and his level 10 all of a sudden has raid gear and 500g...
---
When the mobs parry 6 attacks in a row, you'll be begging to get that extra 6 rage.
---
what? i dont get it... 
---
"If I don't play someone else will win the jackpot so I should play."
---
Now swap play with run Strat UD again and jackpot with Baron mount...
---
Scripts are still allowed, but the majority of the script macros as well as addons that we know and love wont be working in Blizzards classic wow. It's really a shame and kind of a setback for some classes such as warrior where stance-dance and rage usage can be difficult to manage to perfection. Also the management of switching gear (trinkets and other misc items that are useful in PvP) back and forth will most likely be very "clunky" from what we're used to.

**&lt;Wanderlust&gt; [Alliance] EU-PvE Server | English language**
---
**Our Philosophy:**
---
No rush, no guides. Let's play the game and learn it that way. Many of our members are new to Vanilla or at least to Vanilla raiding. We would like to experience the game to the fullest by going in "blind" and taking our time. (This should be taken as "first few times", for fun and flavor. We are not overzealous.) Veterans are of course welcome if they are fine with the style. There are already members with extensive WoW experience. We know this will take a lot of time but we are fine with it.
---
Progression. Although we should be relaxed and not rush anywhere, we should progress through all content eventually. Wipes on first tries of raids are completely expected but eventually we should learn them and clear them efficiently for progressing to the next one. The same goes for characters. We should be somewhat relaxed, not demanding the utmost in min/maxed builds. But just goofing off with "joke" builds shouldn't be our style either. Anything which works reliably for progression will be fine but no less.
---
**Who are we looking for:**
---
Anyone wishing to experience the whole game in a relaxed but mature atmosphere and who is prepared to take it slow with us. Focus is on raiding reliably, which means that people should show up and perform sufficiently. You don't need to know know stuff or be good at the game now, just be willing to improve and get good enough for raiding. Gear distribution will favor reliable progression. We should also be able to help each other in every facet of the game but apart from raiding, everything is optional. 
---
**Raiding related information:**
---
* We'll start raiding at least 6 month from release. You can use the time as you see fit, leveling slowly or leveling more than one character.
---
* Raid times are up for discussion still but I expect two raids on weekdays. (Most likely around 19-23 CET)
---
* Loot council (most likely).
---
Anyone interested, message me!
---
I've never played on private servers. Always on retail. But BfA is such a huge piece of shit I'm seriously thinking about trying a private server meanwhile waiting for Classic. And your post makes me to want it even more.
---
Ive levelled a priest up to 38-ish, it’s great fun. It feels a lot like vanilla. You’re right about grouping, I group up as soon as I see another person (which is all the time) there not much reason not to. 
---
The strange thing is I feel like there’s a few things that will be easier and a few things that will be harder.
---
Firstly, I have around 100g just from selling everything I’ve ever got that’s white or better in the AH. 
---
Secondly I get ganked all the time by rogues and warriors with fiery and crusader.
---
Both of these just won’t happen on classic because the server is new, so things like having to switch to shadow much earlier than I’d have liked and expecting to lose every fight anyway shouldn’t really be a problem. However, I’m not going to have 100g at 38 either, so I’m going to have to be even more frugal. 
---
It’s been a great way to see what I’ll need, what’s worth it, what isn’t etc. Right now I’m thinking I’m going to race to get lesser magic wand because spells only to level 12-ish is a nightmare.
---
The community is so good though, it’s so nice to see people everywhere, it’s very rare you can’t finish a quest. I did a full run of SM on the weekend, I think our level range was about 15 levels in the group. It took longer for everyone to get to SM than to run them all. There’s no way this would ever happen in retail.
---
I guess it’s suggesting that “Wrath Babies” are the ones that claim that private servers are completely incorrect, except getting left girl makes no sense in this meme.

• NA Horde PvP ~8:30pm PST raid start time

There are about 5 of us. Not looking for loot council.
---
Reply here or message me.
---
Aye loot boxes is one of the main issues the world is thankfully trying to combat. In the fight against them, many misunderstandings and wrongful diagnosis will sadly be had. You seem to be having some yourself m8, as WoW is in no way a slot machine, no more than going fishing. That is a stretchmark, they happen: https://youtu.be/-77cUxba-aA?t=4299
---
Very good players but impossible to watch for me. Way too much running and hiding, totally not my cup of tea.
---
So... you gonna roll a Gnome Priest ?
---
This story again. It seems so twisted to me that a person that supposedly loves me, tells me that i must choose her or a hobby i love. I don't think you can build a healthy relationship on top of that.
---
Perplexity is one of the most skillful players to ever touch this game tbh.
---
Monkeynews.. ehh.. not so much, but thats my opinion. He's good tho.
---
its my life. fuck what others think about what i do in my free time.
---
That's the way PvP was in classic.. Yeah it sucks for us non-hardcore players but PvP wasn't fair in Vanilla. 
---
If you cannot control an urge like this at least to the extent where you know it won't hurt the most important aspects of your life, you're not ready for it. You can definitely still enjoy Classic, no doubt about it, but if you allow yourself to slip back into old habits that you recognize as being bad then it will only hurt you. Plan around it, keep an eye on how long you play and what you actually do in the game, and you'll doubtlessly still get something out of it.
---
When BlizzCon had the classic presentation lined up, I had a friend visit me who I hadn't seen in about 3 years.  Watching the stream on my TV while I waited for her, just in case I could catch the presentation.
---
So she arrives, we say our hellos.  Her eyes glance to the gaming images on the TV.  I explain, "Oh - there's an announcement happening, about an old game I used to play.  It's a pretty exciting weekend for me honestly."
---
Without missing a beat she replies, "Oh No! That's the game you played non-stop for two years and stopped coming out drinking and lost most of your friends and nearly failed University, right?!"
---
Well... damn, woman.
---
My fiancée knows, my old guild mates know, (she knows), nobody else.
---
I was 15 when wow was released in Europe and when I turned 16 I got my first own gaming computer I could have in my room.
---
Entering IF without lag. Seeing at max distance in BGs.. it was amazing.
---
Can't wait for classic since my computer is quite good now (max retail without issues). I want it noooow
---
I think...its saying that people (specifcally work players) are complaint how certain private servers arent perfect and arent worth their time. Despite the fact that people running the servers spent a lot of time and money setting a close replica.
---
Granted PS are a no no here so eh. 
---
I agree, if anyone gives an ultimatum, it’s not worth it. My wife understands why I go play on pc, mostly WoW, because I get these periods when I’m super excited, and then a couple of months and I barely touch the computer. My friends and I talk on Discord alot so that’s one way to keep in touch with my friends. I also don’t play for many hours and go watch netflix with her whenever’s a good time. It’s all about balancing your time.
---
"Denmarkian" LMFAO. That's a bit ignorant there still
---
No use trying to shy away from it, mate. It's true and it's just good game design. 
---
Yes. Thats why its broken
---
...Also not sure what server this is, but if its one of those instant 60 PvP server, Monkeynews really made a mistake for not choosing to play as dwarf for those fights. Dwarfs are easily the best option for warriors to beat rogues. Then again, I guess Perp could've picked a better race too for countering warriors even more.
---
Are you Gordon Freeman
---
If you're worried that something is going to have a detrimental impact on your life because you don't think you'll be able to balance it properly with the other things you want in life, then you probably shouldn't do it, and focus on those other things.
---
Interesting duel series.
---
I'd like them to show all the gear they're wearing, because they are probably adjusting their playstyle to match the gear level meta that they have.
---
Neither of them were wearing the top end gear at least. 
---
MN using mostly the rank 10 gear, which has less stamina and damage overall compared to the rank 13 set. Using the [Draconian Deflector](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12602/draconian-deflector) which isn't even a level 60 blue shield, [Bonereaver's Edge](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17076/bonereavers-edge) from Ragnaros which at 3.40 speed is pretty fast for an arms warrior.
---
All I can make out from Perplexity's gear is 2 pieces of R10 (boots, gloves), 5 pieces of T1 (he has 110 energy and prep, helm, chest, legs, bracers, belt), [Truestrike shoulders](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12927/truestrike-shoulders) which is more PvE oriented, [Perdition's Blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18816/perditions-blade) in MH and [Warblade of Hakkari](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19866/warblade-of-the-hakkari) in OH.
---
So most of the gear pieces are early vanilla, restricted to MC (and ZG) Warriors scale ridiculously with gear so it would be fun to see them do some more duels with a Warrior wearing e.g. R13+T2.5 + [Dark Edge of Insanity](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21134/dark-edge-of-insanity)
---
its actually a pretty bad build that i would not recommend. but of course if you have fun with it, go for it.
---
No I'm sorry buddy your overly smart analysis has no basis in reality. That video games can be fulfilling and cause basic and natural reactions in the human brain is not the same as what happens when addictive disorders are exploited.
---
the belf part is actually true. was the nr. 1 reason for me to roll alliance.
---
If it was affecting his college courses like he said it was, then he picked the right path. Graduation is worth more than any epic drop. After that, back to the REAL grind. 
---
If only there was some kind of old server out there that some of us had played recently that let us know exactly how much fun we'll have in Classic when it's released..
---
Maybe after a year or so, but this should have one of the most lowest priority.  
---
I dont see how you can add an award system to this.....  
---
Maybe add gear, which you can only use in Arena mode.... But im in huge favour of the no changes camp.
---
And this wanst in classic...... so..... (REEEEEE No Changes)  
---
Of course. Certain games do trigger the same reward system though. There's no denying in that being exploited in every way possible in a majority of industries.
---
This isn't "overly smart", perhaps you are just naïve. 
---
Those private servers are plagued by so many problems and I still had fun playing them. So I fully expect the real thing to be better, but it won't be anywhere close to the same experience as playing it in 2004
---
says the guy who spent the last 10 years getting a psych degree solely to justify is relapse into WoW! :p
---
I did something similar. Although it's a while back. And I leveled some characters. But I can't be bothered now to level any of them to 60. Since I'll switch to Official Classic the day it comes out. So there is no point to me to level further then the level 38 I've currently reached.  
---
Most of my enthusiasm for classic is drained after playing retail.  Hopefully when classic does come out I will get some will to play it.
---
Can't blame ya, i hear that one doesn't cause student debt. Neither does mine thankfully, hurray for scandinavia. America must be some country to live in when not being surrounded by stupid is such an expensive (and apparently appalling) affair. 
---
That's... a very bad excuse to present to Blizzard
---
do you? i thought that was a private server thing. (never played real vanilla though)
---
I love how Blizz made this guy an in game Character in TBC I believe it was. A fully decked out T5 Warlock with a level 1 staff named Kralnor.
---
I started out a private server "just to try it out a little" leveled a warlock to 36, warrior to 25, mage to 29, druid to 34 until i forced myself to uninstall to focus on my finals and save myself for classic.
---
Vanilla truly is something special.
---
Heh that would be quite the dedication! No i believe my interest first sparked when my schizophrenic uncle was stigmatized and socially outcast for no genuine reason. Yes, you heard it here first, movies and newspapers did not give you an accurate understanding of what schizophrenia is! Shocker! Thankfully child me was able to see through the veil, and so can you!
---
I looked a video of one of these guys (can't remember which one) were he was farming the pummeler in Gnomeragan. His kill speed (or lack thereof) for lvl 30-35 elite mobs changed my mind about levelling a druid : these guys have bis gear and they can't 2 shot a lvl 35 elite ? Count me out.
---
At least this time around I’m not in school and my parents won’t have to worry about me failing any classes!
---
Also largely dependant on your ISP, I've never ever gotten a piracy note while I torrent occasionally
---
Neat 📸
---
Broke 100 days played (without afking/autorunning into walls) before WoW reached its first anniversary. Haven't played since leaving for uni around WotLK release. 
---
I'm afraid.
---
1 thing you never skip is Hamstring and R1 Cleave. Hamstring kiting is just way too op. Imagine this: you have a 4.00 attack speed weapon vs a mob that attacks every 2.00 seconds. Pull the mob, use hamstring, white hit, and then kite till the 4 seconds pass. What you earn with this is that the mob deals theoretical 50% less damage, which means that you lose less HP, which means less downtime. R1 Cleave speaks for itself. The occasional AOE is nice.
---
Nost had 15k peaks, the definition of insanity, it was way too much.
---
I feel like 6k caps would be the perfect middle ground to keep every place of the game somewhat populated.
---
lol true. Perplexity as well as Nyht really takes rogue pvp to a whole new lvl.
---
I guess we're having a case of whoosh, as my ''overly smart'' comment is referring to soccer mom scientists, which seems an apt comparison to your conclusions. Yes, video games can trigger reward systems, as can shitting. I suppose we are addicted to shitting in a way, but that hardly makes it useful for your argument. Your line of thinking is an oversimplification of what is an extremely complex situation. Hopefully we as a global society can get better at understanding what's science and what's easy conclusions.
---
Yea, I don't think anyone's expecting it to be exactly the same, for a lot of us it will be just as fun (if not more fun this time around)
---
Hi, /u/CruSherFL
---
How do you sell enchants at the AH ?
---
And I always tried so sell on /2 before the AH : it's quicker and there's no AH commission.
---
I wish I had a mom like this, it actually makes me sad to think of what a life this guy must’ve had. :(
---
My wife, who I met in january 2006, completely understands how things are going to go down come launch.  I played lots of games before we got together, and have played lots of game since getting married.
---
I feel that, especially where relationships are concerned, as long as both parties are actively seeking each-other's happiness things like this just don't get in the way.
---
That is just age, and experience talking though.  18 year old me probably wouldn't care about stuff like commitments.
---
Good for you m8. Nothing wrong with making a choice on how to spend your time, so long as you still manage irl.
---
The reverse "mom, get the camera" situation.
---
So to even point out that the data some of these servers use is inaccurate is a bad thing?
---
 I think the idea is to get people to temper their expectations on what Vanilla really is, if all they've had for reference is a private servers 'recreation' of vanilla.
---
That's nice and all and I can tell that you are rattled and perhaps feel a bit triggered. You are however factually wrong.
---
Have a nice day :)
---
Ah no i can see why you would equate that to lootboxes, and its certainly a complicated argument, but it is a bit of stretch m8. Basic incentives are not the same as manipulative gambling mechanics.
---
Savage
---
Who knows? And I was referencing 15k pop at start but 6k long term it's fine.
---
Dude, stop that.. I’ve played on 1k servers and it’s stranded. You have no idea what you’re talking about.
---
same here. couldnt wait. thought i will play a few hours. now my rogue is lvl 60. the last 6 levels i grinded in 2 days with like 15h per day playing. i was just so fun. even made some friend i repeatedly played dungeons with. and randomly saw them from time to time while questing. i have no motivation to put in further item / rep / honor grinding, since there is no sense to me for that. but the leveling part as unbelievable fun. and will save me a lot of time when classic hits, cause i just didnt knew how much i forgot in the last 10 years about wow.
---
&gt; There is a distinction to be aware of however. Video games do not cause addiction, but if a person has an underlying, pre-existing addictive tendency or disorder, video games can be a trigger for it. If you find that this fits you, the first thing to do is become aware of it and learn to take care of yourself. Consider a psychologist as good advice will help you manage the issue and better take care of yourself.
---
This is true for most addictions though, unless the drug causes a real physical addiction. 
---
We're all moving away from discomfort (real life, stress, tasks, jobs, school) to something safe, something that takes your mind of all that. There are healthy and less healthy ways to deal with all that, i'd say gaming is in the middle of that. 
---
Blizzard should never interfer in matters like that. If you don't want to be ninjaed, use master looter.

I need to get a new job and I'm seriously hoping I get one before this comes out or I'm screwed 
---
If you're level 22, you'd already be dead long before you saw that lol
---
I have made slight hints towards my girlfriend, but really, she's in for a big shock.
---
My life seems to have settled into a pattern where family all go to bed a couple of hours before I do every night anyway. I'll be spending my evenings playing WoW and watching a movie instead of playing Civ and watching a movie. Probably no need to upset the Mrs by mentioning the WoW part.
---
I was presented with the same ultimatum with my then girlfriend in college. It felt like a huge red flag. I said if you're going to make me pick, I am going to pick my hobbies over you because I don't see us lasting with power moves like that. I also realized she wasn't feeling very important, and I should better balance my play time anyway. That was on me to change because I loved her, not because she was making me do anything.
---
SL is good when geared well
---
You likely wont be during leveling
---
This story is understandable. Let’s be real, this game can be a huge timesink. The extent of it depends on the personality of the player. Some people can play for an hour or two and then walk away. Others can’t. And many are somewhere in the middle. We called it “World of WarCrack” back then for a reason.
---
I completely understand that someone could lose patience with a partner who gets sucked into WoW and puts hours upon hours into the game. I completely understand the ultimatum mentality, if she put up with it for months and months on end. It’s not her being controlling, it’s her saying “listen, if you want to play this game this much, maybe we aren’t right for each other.” I totally get that.
---
If my wife one day picked up a hobby that I had no interest in which took her completely out of my life for a large amount of time each week, that could be a real challenge. It’s disruptive to the life we’ve developed together. If it was just 4 or 5 hours a week, no big deal. If it was 10 or 20 or 30 hours a week (and those are all possible with WoW), then yeah, it could come to a point after long enough where I’d have to ask her to choose. What would be the point of being together if she was out of my life that much? In this shitshow rat race world we live in, you get precious little time with family as it is.
---
&gt;This seems an apt time to remind everyone (as a dude currently getting his bachelor in psychology) that video games do not cause addiction.
---
This.
---
I don't have any education in psychology. But I've been in love with, and briefly lived with, someone who was taking methadone treatment for a heroin addiction.  I knew her fairly well :) so could tell the difference between what she was like sober and what she was like when she needed a hit - the change in her personality even from needing a hit of methadone was bad.  I've also lived in a low income neighborhood where I knew several neighbors with heroin addictions.  And I've also been involved in the online games scene for many years and met a fair number of "video game addicts" over that time, including myself.
---
I can understand how someone who's never seen the real thing close up can mistake "video game addiction" for a hardcore addiction like that of the heroin addicts I've known.  But, if you've seen both close up, they're not comparable.
---
I don't like to talk about it.  One of my neighbors with a heroin addiction, fortunately for me not the one I was in love with, died from an OD.
---
100% agree with this, all about balance.
---
Also, as a 31 year old I am *so much better* at balance then when I was a no-lifing 18 year old barely scraping by in college due to raid leading BWL.
---
If I’d had a girlfriend back then, she’d have had every right to give me ultimatums.
---
Don't you get sick of posting this

I tried it with a blue geared warr and it sucked

Having ups and downs in how happy you are with how you looks makes you love yourself more over time.

I am pretty sure my grandpa was actually addicted to fishing though.
---
I had an alt rogue back in Vanilla. I remember being very squishy until lvl 20-30, but it became easier after that.
---
Good luck.
---
This means you literally spent a third of your life playing WoW in it's first year after release? As in, you actually played more WoW every day that many people spend sleeping? As in, if you sleep for 8 hours, you spent half of your waking day playing, every single day?
---
Wow.
---
What sword is the dwarf in front carrying? Looks familiar.
---
Interesting
---
That ‘recreation’ will be much closer to the actual game, since it uses the actual 1.12 client, most people who claim that some data might be off have no real clue about what is actually off, and by how much. 
---
Besides from a few interactions, the thing we don’t know for sure yet is: how exactly weapon skill correlates to hit. Exact proc rates for some items/abilities and exact armor value of all bosses/mobs. The idea that these values make any legitimate difference is fucking silly. 
---
Sure, your off hand auto swing might hit .05 more than it should, and some items might have a higher drop chance, but that’s about it. 
---
No way in hell a bastardized BFA client comes
---
close to that. 
---
For the record; I don’t care and I’m not invested at all, I just get tired of this ridiculous argument from people who hate on private servers. It is literally the closest thing you will ever get to actual vanilla. 
---
You do realize that all these comments are just random sentences just to bait people into watching Rickrolled, right? Happy April fools buddy.
---
Hey man aside from the hostility at the end, thanks for the post. FWIW and without listing my credentials I’m well aware of all these things.

Is this a copypasta

Gosh darn millenials and their *shuffles deck* wait wrong sub

Cmon, wotlk players aren't the ones ragging on pservers being accurate.

AH costs too much, you can't hire crafters, you can't sell lockboxes, you can't hire lockpickers, you can't buy level 55 water (mage conjuring those) you can't buy portals to other cities (important for alliance, no zeppelin between cities)

Absolutely. It's a dependant on the files your ISP and the files you're torrenting.

The act of simply deleting the files to prevent seeding won't help to avoid detection. 
---
Eh if you are as reasonable as you seemingly want to appear I'm sure you'll understand that ignorance is a frustrating matter, particularly when it is as bland as insulting as your comment definitively was. If you are truly someone who also intends to study the science behind this and add to the debate in a healthy manner (with the aim to prevent poor diagnosis and ignorance), then i hope to see you there some day. Until then though, you will have to forgive me for entirely doubting you.
---
Resist formula? Mob abilities and AI? Theres plenty of stuff we don't know.
---
Nah, there's a huge difference between "choose between me and playing video games" and "choose between me and doing literally nothing with your life because you're playing WoW for 14 hours a day". 
---
I got the same ultimatum from my wife, and I really needed it. I was going nowhere fast and I needed to pick my life up and do something.
---
I resubbed during BC and played through to early WotLK, and resubbed again for WoD and BfA. My wife didn't care, because it wasn't about choosing her or the game - she just wanted me not to ruin my life.
---
You did notice I used the word "blatant" right? An example: an officer in a guild is appointed as a master looter. He then takes all of the items for himself. In this case, blizzard should do nothing? That this person should just keep all the items? Such instances will be rare but they will happen. And when it does, blizzard should get involved at the very least to strip the items from the person. 
---
My thoughts on the issue:
---
* Leave at Rank 1 until 60:  Mocking Blow, Shield Bash, Pummel, Intercept, Thunder Clap
---
* Leave at Rank 1 until 60% mount: Hamstring, Slam, Cleave
---
* Stop buying ranks at lv40: Rend, Heroic Strike 
---
* For tanking only: Sunder Armor, Revenge, Demo Shout 
---
I would not recommend leaving Charge and Overpower at rank 1. It's only one additional rank before lv40 anyway. Not worth it at all.  
---
If you're confident in tanking, skimping on the related abilities is probably fine. Like, delaying the 30-something ranks until after the mount. This will significantly reduce the amount of threat they do, however.  
---
Shield Wall probably won't be used effectively before maybe ST/BRD, but I wouldn't skip it. You never know.
---
Demon Hunter in WC3 was a caster. So turn your warlock into one.
---
We know all of those things. You on the other hand, don’t 
---
If he is 3 yrs old I guess lol
---
Heads up, dire maul won't be there at launch. It'll probably be months before anyone is allowed to farm dire maul. 
---
The helm and chest thing is obviously private server bullshit. They are contained in an item called [Hakkari Urn](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10773/hakkari-urn#comments) which is a quest reward from a long chain in Sunken Temple that requires a minimum level of 46.
---
A lot of keyboard critics in here who probably couldn't beat either of them in a duel even if their life depended on it.
---
Usually someone that wants to only play one specific spec like Ret, Enhancement or Elemental will be keen on "pointing out" how pservers are inaccurate, 50%, 20%, 10%... you name it. The more inaccuracy fits someone narrative to portray their only spec as better the more inaccuracy will be procured to do so.
---
Do people usually pay for leveling guides?
---
I told my wife that my life will completely change in the next 100 days or so. She shocked, asked me if we are going to divorce or not. Then I told her I had to order a new desk and a chair and at least 24" screen.
---
She still doesn't know what I am going to do but searching on Google 100 days and vanilla. Couldn't find anything so far
---
I completely disagree. This is an issue that should be handled by the community. In vanilla you are at the mercy of the people you decide to play with. It can have unfortunate effects at times, but that is the name of the game. 
---
Believe me, there will be addons for classic really, really quickly. Modders are great like that.
---
Just play with the standard UI for a few days, you'll live.
---
Depending on timeline, I would consider an arcanite reaper. Should hold you down until AV and unstoppable force. 
---
You're most likely right which is why I said that such a response would be extreme. 
---
Technically speaking, a blatant act of ninja looting can be considered a violation of the code of conduct which is outlined as follows:
---
Cheating
---
You are responsible for how you and your account are represented in the game world. Cheating in any fashion will result in immediate action. Using third-party programs to automate any facet of the game, exploiting bugs, or engaging in any activity that grants an unfair advantage is considered cheating.
---
Exploiting other players is an equally serious offense. Scamming, account sharing, win-trading, and anything else that may degrade the gaming experience for other players will receive harsh penalties.
---
Behavior
---
Behavior that intentionally detracts from others' enjoyment (such as griefing, throwing, feeding, etc.) is unacceptable. We expect our players to treat each other with respect and promote an enjoyable environment. Acceptable behavior is determined by player reports and Blizzard's decision, and violating these guidelines will result in account and gameplay restrictions.
---
While we encourage you to report players that are behaving in a disrespectful manner, falsely reporting another player with the sole intent of restricting their gameplay is also unacceptable and will result in penalties to your account.
---
I feel like dying. 
---
   I don't even want a release date that much as we already kinda have one, but I NEED news and confirmation on what they're gonna do/not do.    
---
As I just posted in a reply, blatant ninja looting can be considered a violation of the code of conduct described in these two descriptions:
---
&gt;"115 Days played, 49 pounds gained..."
---
Had to laugh :)
---
Your rambling post just reeks of something written by a second year undergraduate student trying to sound academic. It lacks objectiveness. It’s also pretty amusing that you wrote different parts and went back and moved things around because you started with a pretty nice tone and then switched to personal insults for some reason. This level of discourse doesn’t belong on a forum about a 15-year-old MMORPG so I’ll leave you with something more appropriate for the context:
---
Suck my fuckin’ dick and move along to try and wow someone else with your Psych 101 galaxy brain horseshit. Good luck with your upcoming exams. 
---
The loot system is part of the game design. A master looter is just that, the master looter. You are able to roll on items that are not optimal or usable in group loot. I don't think any of this can count as cheating, griefing or exploits. Blizzard did not interfere in ninjalooting back in vanilla, only bugs and mistakes, and I don't think they should this time. It is a big part of the game and the experience, and is part of what builds a good community. 
---
Sure sounds like they get involved:
---
https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/900641023
---
High quality post thank you for sharing
---
To be honest, I never told anyone I played WoW back when I did. I was like a 13-14 year old kid struggling to fit in at school. I wasn't gonna try and explain WoW to anyone there. 
---
I'm probably going to just not tell anyone I play WoW this time round again. It's much harder this time though, with things like Windows 10 giving away your activity and Discord doing the same. 
---
Does that mean you don’t have to go farming before raids, you can just keep some spare in your bank?
---
Most people have played it on a private server and trust me its even more fun than it was before so yeah.
---
Boss armor values and resistances are 90% guesswork. They know the armor value of 2 bosses, and the resistances of 0.
---
Various mechanics are bugged, and many things have been rebalanced. Availability of black lotus is increased by 10 times or more, and dragon buff used to have an 8 hour cooldown.
---
Paladin spells and abilities are unkown because there is so little info. Might be weaker or stronger.
---
Blizzard has a 100% 1.12 server+client that they are copying data and mechanics from, and it will be 500 times more accurate than some yolo scripted mango core with half its data from random websites an tbc. 
---
This was in 2010. If you show me an instance of it happening in vanilla, I'll gladly change my mind. 
---
Exactly! And realising that Hunters can have such a huge variety of pets... i kept seeing cool beasts as a Rogue and looking on enviously. 
---
I'm sorry folks, but this badass deserved [his own sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/morladim/)

Some of the more in-depth ones. Either through Patreon releases or members areas. No doubt you can find some basic text based guides. This guide however has been streamlined and tested to minimise time to 60.
---
No. But addon developers will be quck to make new ones when they release the api.
---
The api is different from old and current wow
---
Yeah he's a really good rogue but I bet he's been playing for years and these guys practice a lot and they literally know every single class mechanic. Like a lot of people have no idea that distract can interrupt spells like combat charge.

Mom: "Well let me know then."

No because then people just say "Blizzard ban this guy!" cause they did something that one group didnt like. Then 40 guild members insist that 1 person did something bad and Blizzard ban them. But its just because those 40 guild members didnt like that 1 guy.
---
Way too open to abuse

Well said!

If your heals are perma sniped you have to many healers, go cat and dps
---
It's 2AM and Im tired so maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see CB on his bars or any usage of it - is he a prep build without CB?
---
And deep wounds. I get what he means, if you have a much better dagger dps wise it's worth it, but I don't think you'd get better than the numerous 2h anyways. 
---
Hahaha, you're like a classic zombie. 
---
BRAAAAAINS I MISS NEEDING TO USE MY BRAAAAIN!
---
True, if I found out they were putting in the barbershop, I'd be much more vocal about adding dual spec.
---
sounds like a case of GIT GUD! I routinely solo'd entire servers as arms warrior, even solo'd BWL and Molten Core at the same time as arms / prot warrior, I even knocked the entire EU serverbase online with my OP Mortal Strike / Rend / Hamstring combo this one time.
---
you’d prefer to watch him just stand there and lose? this is how rogues need to play to beat warriors because they hit harder and have more armor. 
---
Ironfoe and trashblade? 
---
It's better than 2004 because you know what you're doing this time. I had more fun on p realms than back in vanilla because I could actually experience all aspects of the game.
---
Most of what you are saying is straight up lying, why would you care that much? Paladin spellsare exactly the same, all data needed is easily verifiable on multiple sources. World buff cooldown was never 8 hours, it was 2. Boss resistance tables are known, exact armor value is not. ‘Many mechanicsare bugged’ is a ridiculous statement, what mechanics? 
---
You have no argument, just laziness and opinions.

There's no way on earth to kill a warrior as a rogue if you want to face tank him. Once your evasion expires you're dead and also the spell only increases your dodge chance by 50% and warriors can hit through dodge with the Overpower spell and you die in 4 seconds literally.
---
just a tip big guy, just about every company in the entirety of Earth's fiscal / tax year runs from April 1st to April 1st. Dont know why, they just do.
---
I’ll go with yes if it gets me up votes. Never been compared to a video game character before!
---
The 49 pounds part can easily be corrected this time around brother. Once you hit level 40, you have to do level* amount of pushups, sit ups, and burpees every level. Do this all the way to 60. 
---
Once you hit 60, do the same thing (60 push-ups, sit-ups and burpees) after each of the following;
---
- Dungeon complete
---
- BIS obtained (preraid or post)
---
- Attunement complete
---
- Epic mount obtained
---
- Raid night complete
---
- Profession capped
---
- Every 100 gold earned
---
- whatever else works
---
Switch out the soft drink for water. If you need a pick me up, black tea or coffee. Drink a LOT of water. 
---
Stretch before you play, and after you play. Also, every 30-45 minutes give your hands a quick stretch. 
---
If you still eat garbage, but start doing these things, you’ll notice two things. One, you’re not gaining weight as fast as you were before. Two, you don’t want to eat garbage as much as you did before. 
---
Good luck brother
---
Yeah evasion is basically asking to be killed, overpower hits for way more than normal auto attack and are on gcd (much faster than weapon speed.) 
---
If they did commentary, about why they're doing what they're doing and when, it would be more useful
---
I would definitely agree with this list, but with that said, saving in skills learned, for most classes is only a marginal benefit. It might help you get epic mount a day earlier, but 60% mount is very well manageable at 40 straight even if you buy all the skills. There is definitely benefit to this practice, but if you are having hard time finding to money for mount at 40, you are probably doing something wrong with money management else where too. I don't want this to be a absolute statement, but I have tried both methods multiple times (skipping skills vs not skipping) and I know I'm getting all the skills while leveling on classic.
---
Weak :D
---
Trust me, I thought the same thing. After playing on a private server I can confirm that it will, in fact, not be "the same" but it is still every bit as fun as it was back then even after 15 years of retail.
---
Please tell me more about how the people with the actual 1.12 source code are going to be less accurate than the guys who try to cobble things together from 240p videos and memory. You may as well be saying that the Dead Sea scrolls are less authentic than the king James bible. 
---
No, it’s just because they are afraid to be constrained not to be able to play what they want.
---
Very very few people are going to be optimal: are you going to farm all the potions and reagents required to be full buff? Of course not. Then, even if you play your humain fury warrior, with swords...
---
There is always more optimal...
---
Got the recommendation too
---
No one is telling them not to play what they want. They’re just telling them they’re mediocre - which is correct. And yeah I do plan to farm consumables and get world buffs. If a Druid does the same, they’ll still be far, far behind :)
---
Thank you a lot for all of this information! I will take good use of it.
---
I am well aware that I wont be one shotting players and the druid playstyle from what I have understood so far, damage up, kite, heal up, back in, tank damage etc is just want I like. To be an annoying piece of shit in other words. 
---
&gt;they'll simply merge servers
---
unlikely if they continue what they do on retail, and servers are a completely different thing from bringing people their childhood memories back.
---
I wouldnt count on blizzard to merge servers, they are more likely to force a server transfer instead
---
You would like to find a romantic partner? You do not need to go out for this, nor to bars and discos and destroy your liver. Visit a dating site m8.
---
As for your question, absolutely. You should cater it and form it around your other life choices, as one should in all things, but think of it in logical terms: playing or not playing wow, that is not the deciding factor to you getting a girlfriend. The notions as absurd as most of the dumb things kids say in high school. For one thing, people meet a romantic partner in wow, as they do in all social activities.
---
Yeah, I did the same not too long ago and it was the weirdest and most eye opening experience: After all these years of hearing people claim that no-one actually wanted vanilla because it was endless grind, all the classes were broken, balance was all over the place, full of pointless busywork, needlessly obscure, and just generally that people didn't actually like vanilla so much as the memories and friends they had that I had kind of internalised that message and doubted myself whether I really wanted a return to the old style of wow seen in vanilla/tbc.
---
After binging youtube videos on the upcoming Classic though I decided to bite the bullet and try out a private server and...wow. The magic is still there and everything I remember it being. Grouping with strangers, *actual conversations*, combat that was actually threatening and required you to pay attention. When was the last time I took on a mob 1v1 and lost? Isle of Thunder? I can't remember but pretty much no matter who you are even a non elite in vanilla that was 2 levels higher than you was a very serious undertaking. It's incredible and I really haven't been able to look at retail the same since, it just feels too hollow and simply doesn't stand up in comparison. 
---
I honestly feel kind of silly for thinking the way I did before because this is *vanilla wow*, the definitive mmorpg that cemented the genre and became a household name across the world, the idea that it was more coincidence than design that it took off the way it did is just plain silly.
---
lol good one.
---
wasn't peggle available for Wotlk only?
---
I 100% agree, following this list will save 5-10g for the 60% mount at best. And I wouldn't even consider holding off buying out the remaining ranks at 60. Once you have to consider preBiS gear and epic mount, this becomes a tiny, tiny sum of gold in comparison.
---
Spot on my lad

I think you need to watch world of roguecraft 1 and read up on the “10 mistakes”.

On a more serious note though, I agree.

yes, yes and yes.
---
First there was no honor/BGs and it was just for fun.
---
Then they intruduced honor but no BGs and there were raids like tarrens mill/ss or crossroads/astranaar.
---
Then WS + AV were introduced and later AB.
---
We can expect a similar timeline for classic.

There's no real practical difference between merging two servers together or transferring the entire population of one nearly-dead server onto another server.

Dude take control of your life and make up your own mind. People play wow casually as well you know. And if you're a virgin at 27 then you have to get that stuff sorted FIRST that is an order. Don't waste your life not getting important shit done. Get a woman ind your life and play wow as well. Why obsess when temperance is there for you.

This is a woman who straight up told me to start collection Warhammer 40K minis. 12 years later and I have over 15,000 points of Orks (and 3,000 points of Seraphon now as well). She's got no issue with me having a hobby, but when a hobby is being destructive, which WoW back in my early 20's absolutely was, it's a different story. I was neglecting her, my studies, my friends, everything. All I did was game and work. I barely spoke to her, and we'd been married for two years when I quit. 
---
She stuck through that whole time when I treated her like she didn't exist, and still stayed with me. She knew I was doing something massively unhealthy and she intervened. I absolutely think that anyone in a healthy relationship should do that. 
---
Love everything about it. the 50 days played. She is a little embarrassed, but still proud about it.

Fuck no. LUA coding has changed from "vanilla" to "stripped Legion+some parts added from vanilla". Doubt even few if any addons just plain work.
---
Was a blend. And illidan was a mage. 
---
They don't need to know.
---
I already did you baby, it’s not the same client. If you actually think the feel and movement of the old client is less important than armor values being as little as 50 to 100 points of, you are delusional. 
---
Now if you actually read the post before frothing at the mouth, you’d realize I don’t actually think the difference will be more than barely noticeable, but if you think playing the original game is further away from the original than a repurposed new client, you are fucking stupid. Also, you have no idea of how private servers sourced their data and how impressively accurate it actually is (spoiler: it’s not hard work, just a lot of basic math, but
---
somehow I’m guessing that’s to much for you to comprehend). 
---
Not really, since they took out parts of legion LUA code too, not to make it possible to do stuff that wasnt in vanilla.
---
Hi bobbyk
---
Ninja looters never lasted long in my experience.
---
Perhaps it was just the server I was on (Dunemaul EU), but such events always ended up on the realm forums (official and unofficial) within the hour, and the looter often ended up getting kicked from their guild. 
---
There was a list of confirmed ninjas stickied on the unofficial forum as I remember it. A lot of them either transferred server, switched to an alt (which lead to occasional drama if their original identity was discovered), or ended up in some shit-tier guild that didn't have a reputation to protect anyway and only ever running instances with an all or mostly guild group.
---
As I say I don't know if my old server was just particularly harsh or what, but high profile ninja looting was a social death sentence. People didn't really care as much about spats over sub-60 loot or lesser items, but the ones that stole the well-known blues ended up totally disowned.
---
There will be a REAL stress test for sure. And im sure there is a beta running as we speak, its just closed one.
---
This absolutely helps if you’re doing long levelling sessions too. The best way to fight tiredness at a desk is light exercise like this. You will sleep better too. 
---
Did this for the last two retail expansions and performed miles better than before. 
---
Talking in third person to self promote?
---
This almost killed me lmao.
---
WoW is a skinner box, and those mechanics are ulitmately the same as gambling. 
---
God I miss vanilla. There was something so... real about it. But I realize it sounds crazy for someone who didn't live it. But waiting for everyone to show up outside the dungeon was a big part of it.
---
I seem to recall that generally what happened to terminally-declining low-pop realms was Blizz offered a free character transfer to everyone on it. It was then the player's problem to sort out names.
---
Same here bro
---
It's build on the same core as legion. Your potato that can run classic on private servers will not classic the same way.
---
Because orc racial is worthless, smh..
---
Was not the "peen meter" with an extra bar over your head, part of this joke too?
---
To each thier own. Not everyone goes after the life partner and kids. And it all lead up to this moment 😁
---
I feel personally attacked
---
Felstriker
---
If you wait untill the late 40s it's, so you get corruption, imp lifetap and less resist chance. At like 49-50 its a good idea to switch. Untill that point affliction is better.
---
A friend of mine actually name changed when DKs first came out. I logged in to the "a friend has been removed from your friend list" or whatever the message was, and then maybe an hour later some random DK whispers me telling me it's my friend. 
---
I was convinced he had sacrificed his mage to make a DK or something. 
---
Headbanging to ambience?? 
---
I somehow feel that classic WoW will be a LOT more resource intensive than vanilla. Also, I bet the size of the game will be 50gb plus, even though the original vanilla was probably less than 5gb.
---
Bit boring if it was all the same though? I think a lot of us want to achieve the things we were unable to the first time around and aren't necessarily focused on reliving nostalgic moments.
---
I told my brothers about classic and I felt like I waved a bag of cocaine in front of junkies. Seriously it was way too awkward and you could see the glimmer in their eyes. All 3 of us played this game for insane amount of hours and when we decided to quit in cata I secretly kept playing. Their lives improved a lot after wow so not sure if it was right dragging them back to it.
---
Now I am crying because the nostalgia of us playing together hit me again :(
---
No, they offered free transfers from people on high population servers to low pop relief servers. This usually did nothing to the high population servers and the relief servers stayed low-medium. 
---
You have a hand don’t you... 
---
nice
---
It's basically a way for blizzard to split the server population up into smaller groups to avoid overloading servers and causing instability.
---
You could picture it like how raids and dungeons work, A group of people get there own instance of a zone
---
Green tea is healthier than black, but otherwise I agree 
---
Just think of it as seperate instances of the world that the server creates and populates. This can lessen server load (if a lot of people are in the same area it's easier to have them on 5 shards fx), makes ressource gathering easier (won't have to compete over mobs/nodes, but can also help make the world feel alive by sharding dead servers together.
---
Always is a dreampipe, but a Looooong time, yeah.
---
I thought that was how all the cool kids talked?i am not awesome at titles and it seemed like the easiest way to market “Blokkaroach” as in the channel.
---
A quick explanation of  sharding is say you have 100 people going into Elwynn Forest, Blizzard has set that zone to hold 20 people so the first 20 gets into Elwynn Forest #1 the next gets put into Elwynn Forest #2 and so on.
---
I've ran legion on it as well. Choppy at times in cities, but it could run open world content fine enough. 
---
Might've got my memory round the wrong way, then. Trying to cast your mind back to fairly small details to 12+ years ago is bound to introduce some inaccuracy.
---
Yeah, so pretty much as I thought. Part of the magic of WoW was seeing these starter areas with hundreds of toons running around.
---
Even if they did sharding and still enabled like... 25 players per instance, I would be semi-happy with that. Maybe more like 50, I'm not sure about the numbers to make it seem like it wasn't dead.
---
You can throw a highend PC at vanilla and it still runs like shit, because fps is linked to server traffic.
---
Yeah, so pretty much as I thought. If they sharded dead / quiet servers together I would be a fan of that but the whole thing just seems a bit unauthentic.
---
Dude what are you talking about? I've played on servers that top out at 1.5k. Definitely did not feel super alive, and people weren't everywhere.
---
1k average sucks. Just like 10k sucks. 
---
Damnit, OP! After months of soul searching I was ready to not roll Shaman this time and go Hunter instead, but now my mental pendulum swings once more.
---
yeah but many many people didnt transfer and right now there are tons of ghost realms still running, check wowprogress for some of those pops.
---
thats why i am personally going to try to roll on a server that will have a community before it even goes live. 
---
The difference between wow and coke is when coke starts getting boring you can just do way more coke. 
---
TL;DR: Alliance Warlock and Priest, NA region, normal server, not looking to start raiding ASAP but does want to raid, want a group to play/socialize with.
---
Hi! I (Warlock) played WoW since a few months after launch. I never reached max in Vanilla, but I did raid a lot of TBC up to Illidan. Very casual WoW playing since.
---
The Priest started playing in MoP and casually raided, but wants to get into raiding in Vanilla. Planning on healing at 60.
---
We are looking to get into Classic with some new friends as none of ours want to play. It can be a guild, a small group, or if you are a single player looking to join us in making our own group. We put emphases of the sociability of a potential group/guild as opposed to unwelcoming required min/maxing.
---
Looking forward to hearing from anyone who reaches out who feels as though their potential guild/group is suited for us. Please contact me by PM here on Reddit.
---
In modern WoW your server name doesn't matter in the slightest. Everything is cross-realm sharded: everyone is in effect on one massive server that dynamically instances every open world zone so you don't see many people.
---
Blessing of America lmaoo
---
I'm traveling that well as well --- confirmed 3rd week of June release.
---
Yeah but that taste.....that god damn taste....
---
evasion is still better than eating MS + autos. You can even see perp using it in this video.
---
No. It is exactly the right weapon to give a tauren tank without ironfoe. That way he is settled for threat for a while and won't increase loot pressure on axes or swords.
---
Keep edging brothers, we're so close!
---
Can't comment on size (depends on how they implement shared data with current) but I'm quite sure it'll run even better than the Vanilla client (slightly). It'll run the modern client (which is more optimized) but with the very light Vanilla data.
---
See this (demo is not final, of course, but it's strongly hints at how it'll run): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGQ8w46JOL4
---
&gt;  
---
Even if they did sharding and still enabled like... 25 players per instance, I would be semi-happy with that. 
---
That is actually how it works, the instances are a healthy size, just not so many that every spawn in a cave is camped, for instance. 
---
For some reason the Honor Hold music fills me with nostalgia. Probably cause I spent so much time in Alliance towns with my friend while waiting for heroic groups. Probably the most fun I ever had in WoW.
---
Shush, you're ruining my immersion
---
A very rough guesstimate would be friday, saturday or sunday evening, starting after the kids are asleep for everyone, probably around 20-21 GMT+1 and running for around 3 hours. It all depends, maybe our DPS will be so good that we can clear it faster :)
---
We will choose the day(s) that fit the schedule for most of our raiders though.  
---
People already did a good job of explaining what it is, here's why it's one of the worst aspects of the game:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlgOOsVQqX0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlgOOsVQqX0) 
---
Ol Tommy Two-Tone
---
They won’t need to stress test anything when they can just use sharding to solve lag OMEGALUL
---
The vanilla form of decursive that was active till 2.0.1 worked drastically different from later iterations. It was in short a bot that targeted people for you.
---
You hit the button and the bot was selecting a viable target in cast range range with a debuff fitting for the dispell ability you've just used.
---
No extra bars, no mousover, no player decisions. just 'oh by the way you can dispell a debuff in range of your character - hit the button to make them disappear'
---
I fear you are a little bit too optimistic. The concept you vent is right but it's hyperbolic.
---
Classic will last 2 to 4 years. 6 years top. During the Vanilla progression everything will be fine. After that if they go with TBC people will stick with it. If they go with Woltk too, many will probably leave but some core will stay. After that is darkness.
---
However if at any point they will deviate from this path they will begin to bleed playerbase. All those players that will keep looking for the a fresh 2 years vanilla cicle.
---
Oh God pls no
---
this seems like a casual approach, much more efficient just to go 18h per day sitting in your chair
---
I think they did. I remember them disappearing, and so do others, but a lot of people also say they didn't. 
---
Either the mandala effect, or it was something changed on pservers, so everyone thinks they didn't in classic. A ton of pserver people who may have never even played vanilla think they're an expert in vanilla mechanics, but constantly get corrected by those who were actually there or blizzard. 
---
DOWNVOTE ME BRO!
---
Hunters druids too
---
Tanks
---
Everyone else will suffer much
---
Lmao lvling and mounts were definitely very different
---
what happens when u tell ur isp to fuck off? asking for a friend
---
This is not for classic, this is for vanilla private servers. You have no idea how inaccurate this might be for classic. 
---
Asking people to pay for it is even more ridiculous. 
---
I'm still kinda convinced by the 16th of July theory based on the character names from BlizzCon - it just seems too odd to name them after a number and a month otherwise. 
---
But yeah it sucks not to be sure when you need to book time off. 
---
Oooh!
---
Well, im not too sad i wont be able to do that. Doesnt sound all that fun imho.
---
It's missing "Tip's out".   
---
Also this video should be exactly 10 minutes long and end abruptly.
---
I believe the sum of every integer is -1/12
---
The issue arises when you want to play with friends. If you weren't grouped with them, you have a good chance on being on separate shards and wouldn't see them in the "persistent" world
---
Too many copyright strikes notices and they can shut off your internet. This is extremely rare, though. The notices typically just serve to cover the ISPs ass, so they can say they warned the users.
---
In regards to getting sues for copyright infringement, the company you are infringing does the suing, not your ISP. This, also, is very rare. 
---
Thats a lot of assumptions, little guy. 
---
Firstly. I am not asking for anybody to pay for anything. I am promoting a guide that I have been given to test for classic.
---
Yes, the testing grounds are only what is available currently. I can’t really talk to anything apart from my own tests of the guide. You are assuming however that it would not be updated to encompass any changes that may arise after launch.
---
That’s why it is currently a 1-19 early release with an update release close to launch.
---
&gt; If population drops they'll simply merge servers and the population will be back to normal. 
---
Did that ever work ? If it was so easy there wouldn't be dead servers on retail since they had more than 10 years to use this.
---
Tbf, what you cant see from this video is that this type of world pvp was only fun for those who played either mage, lock, or any other caster-class. Well actually, world pvp in general in any situation was only fun if you played any of those, maybe adding hunter + rogue to the list for 1v1's.
---
Ive seen such battles back on retail vanilla when the pvp system was introduced outside of tarrens mill and sometimes in front of if, sw or orgrimmar. But unless either side actually had some good lead and an actual goal, it was just endless pointless zerging back-and-forth, with the mages and warlocks having their time of their live and everyone else just sitting back half afk, constantly eating/drinking or spamming a heal button, or they were spending 90% of their time running around as spirits and waiting for the rez cd.
---
Open world mass pvp CAN be extremely fun and be a core part of an mmo, as long as it serves a purpose and is atleast somewhat balanced.
---
Thanks that’s cool. I joined during AQ event and never witnessed it
---
To answer your title, no, a Shadow Priest does not equal a PVP Server
---
Hey man I hear what you're saying. Something other people alluded too and I'll agree with is that you were a kid then, and a man now. 
---
I was the say way with videogame addiction when I was younger and it's something I just have to be aware of now. I love gaming though, it's my life long passion, I just do it responsibly just like drinking.
---
I am 28 now and have a wife and career. I know that I could have a problem if I spent TOO much time just playing games. But that's the solution, if I know then I can take precautions and set boundaries for myself. I reccomend you do the same. That way, you can casually play this game you love and still focus on your real life. When you figure out how to balance both, you will absolutely have a since of real accomplishment as well. Whatever you decide, gl my dude.
---
Sorry, shadowstrike is not that useful, but at least you can troll with thunderstrike saying that: "you've been... THUNDERSTRUCK" 
---
Telling what? I will disappear for 2 to 3 months, until the garbage odor from my apartment make my neighbours think that I'm dead and they call the police.
---
In vanilla its easy for rogues to dead zone warriors so they can't charge/intercept due to 70% slow from poison. So in that case; yes orc racial is pretty useless since extra attack power doesnt mean shit if you can't even land a hit.
---
&gt; The consensus I get from the community is that no one wants this and I am inclined to agree. While having to wait for certain quests can be a bit of a bummer, I dont think its a game breaker, and it encourages grouping up with others
---
Yes, this is why noone likes it, it's antithetic to community.
---
BUT
---
the reason why Blizz wants to use it for the initial few weeks in starting areas is they expect a great amount of tourists, that is people that will try the game just to see what all the fuss is about and then quit in maybe a couple of weeks.
---
If they didn't do anything about it, they would end up with several dead realms only a month after launch.
---
My favorite solution would be server merges by it seems Blizzard is allergic to it, they don't do it on retail, they do connected realms instead (that is connecting servers together like it was a merge but without actually merging them so you don't have to change names, but you see people are from different servers just playing together).
---
Something like that would destroy the sense of community in Classic, so it seems their intention is to launch allowing more people on each server than the game is designed for, to account for tourists, use sharding to compensate such an overpopulation, then, after the tourists leave, bring down the population cap and remove sharding.
---
IF it works, they would end up with healthy servers overall.
---
It can go wrong IMO, and I don't like sharding as much as everyone else, but from the point of view of potential dead realms early on, it makes sense what Blizz intentions seem to be ... unless someone finds a better solution, but I haven't seen any so far and summer is very close.
---
My fiancé knows about my WoW addiction, but she hasn’t experienced it yet. I’m really curious at this point to see how she’ll react. She’s used  to seeing me do a bunch of different things when I get home from work, but now it’ll be straight to the computer for hours. 
---
I told her I'd be playing a hunter so that I can spend little time farming and that I'd only need to raid one night a week because my gear doesnt really matter a ton.
---
This was me too. Only a little older. :)
---
You do know that the big vanilla pservers are filled to the brim with bots right? Most of the players you saw were probably not real players in the starting zone.
---
Also there's no way blizzard will do massive 10k pop servers. Pservers feel "alive" because they're insanely packed. One server was never meant to home that many players. Which is why most pservers rely on dynamic respawns to compensate for the increased number of players.
---
If you play Classic, don't expect to see nearly as many players just out in the world leveling. 
---
That's how I feel as well...
---
I've been picking out parts to order for a new PC and have been scheduling some vacation, my wife doesn't know what's coming...
---
I don't really have a preference between green and black tea. I prefer oolongs, which I guess is blackish, but a nice cup of green tea with lemon in it tastes great as well. 
---
My biggest annoyance with multiple instances though, is when you walk to a certain area and all of a sudden you get shifted to a different phase, and you're playing with entirely different people, different mobs are respawned, etc.
---
The starting content is the hardest, imo. I've leveled a mage, a priest and a warrior on pservers and I died more often doing 1-20 than 20-60. You just lack so many tools at lower levels. Once you start getting most of your class abilities, you're fine. 
---
I'm looking to raid on Sunday and MAYBE Monday nights, do you think guilds will exist that do 1 night a week raids?
---
lots of games implement this now. the tech really boils down to dynamic resource allocation on the server.  wow is a cloud server game now so while you still pick your server on live, it's more or less meaningless as you are not exclusive to that server.  because they have merged these servers in groups to see eachother in the world, they run the risk of having more than the server can handle.
---
so if you have super high pop server 1.. and dead server 2 3 and 4. these servers are merged on the back end. but you still keep your realm identity and name and such.. but with advancements in the tech over the years for more action like combat (not all spells are point and click anymore... lots of smart spells etc) and just more spells higher animation fidelity etc. they can't support 1000 people in one area.. so they will take that area and split it up so that while person a and b might be standing on top of each other.. they won't see eachother.  this reduces lag for the player and server not having to serve that data.
---
if you group with someone, you are sent into the shard of the group or raid leader. which can pop people in and out of your view..  but also if a shard gets too low on number, it might merge into a different shard for resources.. this can cause issues where you will be fighting a mob and it disappears on you and mobs you already cleared just spawned around you.  or you just spawned next to a level 60 rogue in stealth. and any mobs you killed despawn if you haven't looted or skinned.  but from playing on live while this has happened to me.. I will say it is rare I find this happening..
---
the use case Blizzard proposed is the starting zones because lots of players are spawning at the same exact coordinates and running everywhere..   this is fine except they want to reduce the latency and served stress here.. so that's not to say you'll be solo.. they could still allow for like 100 people in that shard we don't know the numbers they use.. but eventually the player base spreads out..  eventually they'll have some in elwynn, some in gold shire.. some in storm wind.. some in Westfall.. some people doing professions, some even starting a bank alt just to get to 5, learn enchanting and parking next to an ah.. some will log off eventually some won't.. some night elves will be running to iron forge.. etc.. so the server resources won't be stressed after that point.
---
but people believe too that this will be an issue again when aq comes out and you have everyone in silithus.  that may be the case and it will cause server stress.. I hope they don't choose to shard it but we will have to wait and hear from them.
---
but to your main point I would be surprised if there were as little as 25 people per shard.. I think classic will be plenty full.. you still share the same general chat and all that.. the only thing that isn't cross shard is /say and /yell.  but you will still be able to group for quests and such. you'll still find friend and foe out there questing and fighting it won't be dead everywhere.
---
the other thing is even on live, most people are at max level and just sit there in the main cities and those are sharded too and full... if you go out into the world yes it looks more sparse but that isn't sharding so much as no real incentive to go out into the world.. even questing is slower to level than grinding islands and sitting in the capital city..  but I see plenty of people doing incursions and such so i don't feel that the sparseness is nearly as bad as people portray it on here. 
---
Wait what is this theory?
---
Well.. Let's enjoy these 6 years the.
---
Sharding and cross-realm are different things, sharding is one server's elwynn forest split into 2+ instances, no other servers are involved just that one.
---
I'm scared. 
---
I'll have things to do that won't be done.
---
I think it was after 15 minutes of logout, or something like this

That’s all well and good but the clients I see at work that suffer from playing video games 18+ hours per day would be highly invalidated if I said video game addiction isn’t thing. It’s good that you’re being critical of the dsm and psych literature, as we should be as psychs, but the dsm guidelines and approved therapies for treating addictions are the best research based evidence we have at the moment, and I’ve seen first hand that people benefit from the current recommended therapies for video game addiction. It’s not perfect, as no psychological therapy for any mental health condition is (as you probably know), but to completely dismiss video game addiction as a mental health condition is a bit drastic. How would you support someone with video game addiction symptoms then? Dont know about you but i  know I’m using the established research. 
---
Like you say, video games aren’t necessarily addictive (although more and more games have addictive RNG gambling-like features) but people get addicted to things, and they get addicted to video games. So yes video game addiction and treatments exist to reflect this human observation. 
---
At the end of the day it’s easy to get caught up in semantics and criticise the dsm and literature, but the established research has practical uses for psychs doing face to face therapy. But If you can improve the evidence based practice “Revolution”, be my guest.

Don't do sit ups/crunches and burpees. Do hollow body or plank instead.

As a former rogue I will always consider the Shamans as mvps of the horde.

---
Do not run 3/3 Imp. Blizzard. It's going to overwrite your (considerably longer) CoC slow. Use 2/3.
---
Thanks. I also think the chances are quite small. Trying to recruit 
---
I still stand by this, btw, and have an army of PC parts to really validate this once a beta (or release!) of Classic gets into my hands.
---
This guy way over exaggerates. Firstly, if you want to play any class for any reason whether it’s “good” or not, you should do that because it’s a game and it makes you happy. 
---
Second, yes Warriors are gear dependent. But is any other class going to walk into a BG in full greens and 1v5? Obviously not.
---
Lastly, Warrior is not only not as bad as this guy is saying, but arguably the god class of vanilla. He argues the class is better with a healer. Yeah. Who isn’t? Warrior is WAY better with a healer because the uniqueness of rage mechanic.
---
If you want to play an arms warrior and not raid, please do that. You can still own and have tons of fun.
---
P.S. Just roll Orc and you have the most broken racial ever made for PvP without ever having to raid
---
Good riddance. 
---
Yeah, kinda liked that she was involved in lower level quests, but weird usage of such a big character 
---
Have a friend who says he won't play it because you can't get skilled at it and it's just a big grind. He might have a point but he is pretty pessimistic about everything so I don't listen to what he says. 
---
just read something about living action potion.

can everybody buy this from ah and use it or do you have to be an alchimist?
---
Oh yeah now I do good to get 4-5 hours a week 
---
ye dungeoning doesnt give much Xp compared to questing and grinding normal mobs. But u should spice it up, do both, especially since dungeons are a part of the experience and you get those shiny blue items! but i guess you already know this since you wanna do them =)
---
Love hamstring kiting! But on p-server,s I've been able to do it with 40%. Guess we'll see how it goes on live.

A new shop opens, there’s 500 customers in the shop every day for the first 2 weeks, but it’s only designed to hold 50. So the shop decides to open 10 different stores and everyone is happy for the first few weeks!
---
Then a month goes by, and instead of 500 customers a day they have 50 because it isn’t new and exciting anymore, and now they have 9 useless stores that have no people in them.
---
Sharding is a temporary to basically handle the people that will play for 3 weeks from retail, get bored and never come back. Would you rather there be 100 classic servers, that on launch are all full, but then after a month 80% of them be dead? It’s a good solution if it’s implemented well. 
---
This is me as well. Thinking about what I’m going to say lead me to create this post. I was curious if I was alone.
---
This is so false lol. You have no idea what you're talking about and its friggin adorable.
---
This is where blizzard thought they were just gonna fard and a little poop came out too right?
---
It definitely pooped on the community aspect of the game.
---
Its when you think you just have to pass gas but it ends up being equal parts fart and runny shit instead.  
---
Errr wait... that's... never mind. 
---
Agree.
---
Modern Blizzard can f\*k the things up at almost every aspect, so hold your wet dreams as of yet.
---
Lmao sora 😂
---
&gt; Will Blizzard allow fire spec?
---
You're saying that Blizzard are going to ban people from going into the fire spec as a mage? Hmmmmm
---
This man knows what's good for you.  
---
You need to play WoW to have fun and/or relax. It is not fun nor relaxing to screw your life up over a game. A lot of us are getting older, and have some kind of commitments. I know i will be able to play 5-10 hours a week, and I am okay with that. If you are able to control yourself you could give it a go, else move on with life.
---
Yeah I mean I’ve had a few ltr but just seems like life is going really fast 😂😅. 
---
And we all know wow girls don’t exist 😂
---
My main fear is the server tech being used. If you play wow now, even in a group of just 40 people, there's mad amounts of latency. It somehow got worse over the years. WPVP will not live long unless blizzard has a way around this problem
---
What is the big difference on playing on a good private server, with good population, blizzlike content and a free subscription, to playing on a offical one that will cost u dollars every month?﻿ 
---
Thank you master. I shall follow you into the dark
---
What I find amazing about all of this is that I will be playing a game I replayed 5 times sense 2004. Every single experience was a different one, but was also the same. I can’t really describe it. I’m excited to try it for the 6th and see the new different amazing experience all over again.
---
This makes me really happy. It's nice that he wasn't like me. I was the type to always pester my family about video he's instead of letting them figure it out on their own time. 
---
As a result only my brother stuck around for MMORPGs and he doesn't like to play with me. Can't say I blame him
---
If I had gold to give you I would. This is the most positive post I’ve read on this subject. I’m in the same boat and I’d be happy to end up on the same server as you and your Dad friends. I have none joining me this time around 
---
This gave me anxiety lol 
---
If sharding in the starting areas for a few weeks after launch is enough for you to not want to play classic, then whatever. You'd probably be out of those zones in a few hours of playing anyway.
---
Westfall and Loch Modan for me &lt;3
---
I also have friends playing for the first time.
---
They will 'try' the game with the regular sub that is 13 euros. Buying the game is not necessary. 13 euros is not that much if you're working a normal job (at least in Germany). And it's less than you would pay for other games. And how many games did you play for less than one month and paid more than that?
---
I think the experience of the fresh start of classic itself is worth the 1 month sub on week 1.
---
If they really only want to try the basics of an mmo you could start with retail or one of the not so official servers for a few hours. 
---
Same! Last time I had a toddler. Still managed to get some raiding done but I was pretty casual. This time I have a teenager who's going to play with me. 
---
Lmao 😂 seems reasonable.
---
BTW, I like your videos! Although you tend to be very scatter-brained. :)
---
(I hope everything is going ok with the relative of yours and you can get back to creating them.)
---
I also remember them disappearing on a clean log out. (I.e. if you disconnected by accident and reconnected quickly, they would be waiting for you.)
---
Idk why but this gave me the itch to play... Fuck 
---
Me and my best friend wanna play together but we know no bounds.
---
I'll take it slow, not sure if I' even be at 40 when the second patch hits.
---
Yeah I would literally need a lady who’ll play with me. Even then though i doubt any girl would wanna be that committed at my age. 
---
Good. Attitude. Keep it up, but don't lose your life to Classic.
---
In the world.
---
Ftfy
---
Thank you enshin!
---
The dungeons were really, really bad. Especially coming from the epic and extremely difficult Cata heroics. MoP was definitely a step backwards in that regard. Otherwise it was pretty cool, got my first and only server first kill in SoO. 
---
No
---
I have no online buddys but I’m hoping for a few in classic.
---
Bear in mind that the epic warlock mount isn't actually that much cheaper at all. If someone's 60 early and doesn't care about catching Rapidash it's actually gonna save them money in the long run getting that expensive mount first and being able to zip about at 100% way before their class mount is available. 
---
I think girls are more prevalent in WoW than any single other online game I've ever played. You might just not want to wife most of 'em.
---
Not to mention class mount is worse since it costs mana to summon. 
---
Not far far no. Lot’s of work has been done in theory crafting to maximize Druid’s dps/tanking ability. 
---
The class is not mediocre: it brings specific traits that other classes don’t have. A warrior and a fury dps are not bringing anything to the raid appart from their dps.
---
Feral are bringing leader of the pack which, alone, to other dps, brings between 40 to 100 dps, depending on the stuff of the other melee in the group. The additional dps provided to the 4 members of the group alone, largely reduce the difference between a maximised rogue and a maximized feral. 
---
This is not including, the innervate, the brez, the decurse ability and so on.
---
I invite you to read a bit more on taladril tanking guide for druid or Shedo’s guide on dps.
---
(Yes, yes, I know, they are playing on ps, numbers are not accurate, etc etc)
---
Just a shoutout do Spinal Tap, the movie being referenced. Imo one of the best movies ever made.
---
Every two two years, all of you accomplishments will become meaningless.
---
If they somehow allow your T3 toon who you cleared Naxx with to stay on the same vanilla server, it would be fine. But what will happen a year after that? People will leave the progressed server in search of the next fresh one. We have already seen that pattern repeat itself on pservers. I think Nano in a recent ClassicCast said something to the effect that players in an MMO need a carrot to keep progressing towards. What will the solution be? Classic TBC? Another content patch? (More level 60 content in the spirit of the Vanilla game would be cool.) Fresh servers, periodically? Community feedback will be a contributing factor with whatever direction this goes.
---
Greetings! Thanks for sharing your thoughts m8.
---
Absolutely, taking away the help people with genuine issues need is the last thing i want to do. My purpose with these posts is to create the distinction from people who do suffer from these things to those who are practically beaten into thinking they do by societary norms. I'm sure you are aware of the pressure or even hate mongering that video games and gamers have faced for decades now. Hopefully that clears things up.
---
I do hope that by the time i am practicing the dsm will have given it a more apt name, off the top of my head i feel even changing it from addiction to compulsion disorder would benefit the general public, as addiction just carries so much stigma with it from drugs and the like. I'm sure you'd agree that while its a serious issue (loot boxes and other manipulative mechanics being imo the worst one) that we need to get better at treating, its hardly fair to start treating gamers as heroin addicts (I know you probably don't, but imo the stigma does in many ways, which only aggravates the problem) 
---
As pointed out i also do feel the criteria list for fitting the disorder is rather ineffective. Basically, i feel there is much work yet to be done on the matter and that its current iteration is likely to cause more confusion than benefits. I know I'm far from the only one with this opinion as well, as its easy enough to find fully educated scholars who will state similar beliefs.
---
I'm very curious to know, what has your experience been? I can only refer to what i read online and learn in my studies, but it seems clear that many worried parents are wrongfully paying for expensive sessions because their worried their child has a hobby. Has this happened to you?
---
You seem mad about something 
---
For a psychologist, you seem emotionally unstable and easily provoked into a defensive mentality at the slightest challenge. This is why I never bother going to psychologist, they are just normal fuck-ups like me. At least a psychiatrist can prescribe medication that might help.
---
It's amazing to see people in WoW regardless. I saw my brother play BfA yesterday, he was at that Kul'Tiras island at the bank &amp; inn. It made me sad how few people were there during peak hours, and that was on one of the highest population servers. He then went to Stormwind, also to the bank, and again: very few people. Part due to sharding, part due to many other factors. The game can look as pretty and large as it wants, if there aren't many people around, it feels empty and sad and just makes me want to quit. Playing an MMO with few people around kind of defeats the point. Might as well then just play a singleplayer game with a good story.
---
It doesn’t use up a bag slot though.
---
Classic servers will always be there for people to dabble on whenever retail turns to shit. For the progression crowd, you might be right, though. The great thing about vanilla is that there is more to it than endgame progression.
---
&gt; use sharding
---
I reckon they said it'll be temporary at launch so it's not that bad after all
---
I don’t know...having listened to some voice chats in Fortnite, I’m thinking I’d rather Classic be a “need-to-know”game.
---
Okay so a handful of druids amongst the entire population will minmax, making those individual players worthy. Most players will not reach that level and sadly a druid has to try extremely hard to be on par with an average player of another class. It’s simply the hybrid tax at work. No one said they don’t bring utility, hence why you always have 1 or 2 max in a 40 man.
---
here take this ''un'' and add it to your username &lt;3 
---
Its alright m8, its a normal thing. Find something you disagree with and take the easy solution: assume the guys just upset, conclude this invalidates his opinion, then move on without ever bettering yourself. One day we may find ways to improve on this basic human flaw, but not today. Good luck to you.
---
For a 15 year-old game, I'm fairly certain they know the capabilities of their systems by now. It wouldn't hurt to have a Beta period to iron out any bugs that were overlooked.
---
Living for this thread right now. Absolute classic replies. 
---
Really appreciate your suggested testing method ;) 5/7 would join! 
---
I don't know, I can't really pick between either of them. TBC's music budget (allowed for actual orchestras) and synthesizing techniques did see significant upgrades that enabled composers to do more.
---
Hmm.. The dungeons seemed pretty fun and interesting to me though I didn't run them too much... I didn't find Cata dungeons that hard though either, more tedious than difficult 
---
Hey Dude, at first of all big respect to posting your personal life in here! 
---
I kind of came from the same, spent a very long time at home playing wow back then.
---
Just like many people told you already, if you are able to "control" yourself and only play a few hours a week, do it.
---
If you are unable to control yourself stop immediately, don't let a game change your life!
---
**IF** you think you can moderate yourself, think about joining a "parents guild" I think many of the "old" wow players with kids and stuff, will also return. The biggest mistake you can make is joining a hardcore raiding guild, you will feel good because everybody else feels good too!
---
I (24) will be joining a casual guild with mainly parents because I want to play wow to relax and chill, maybe do a raid or two down the line but thats it. Nothing more hardcore as before, I won't be the best DPS but I will have fun in WoW and still be able to control my life! :) 
---
Hope this may help you find a good balance in between! Have a good time! 
---
It's not important when you got 12+ bags imo.
---
&gt;The more players the better
---
Eh, not for me. I'd rather Classic was a niche. I'm not exactly gonna try and stop it from exploding but I'm certainly not gonna help it. I don't want floods of people clogging up servers just because it's "the hot new game".
---
Same argument for a non min/maxed rogue, that prefers to use evicerate over SnD. This argument is good for every player. 
---
All hybrids have the ability to bring something unique and useful, like a buff, a debuff, or a useful skill. A shadow priest, will bring 15% of dps to warlocks, that starts to be really good in AQ.
---
If you have 2 warlocks in the raid you starts gaining dps by having one.
---
From my experience, 12/15 in naxx in vanilla, I never raided with less than 2 druids. 3 or 4 most of the time from what I can recall. Overall, it’s only because of the lack of druids (8.5% of the pop in horde... 9.5% in alliance)
---
I don’t think there could be a more accurate representation. 
---
So that’s 0.43lbs per day played. 
---
1lb is about 3000 calories.
---
3000*0.43 = 1290 kcal per day played.
---
1290/24=54kcal per hour.
---
WoW contains 54kcal per hour.
---
Depends if you're like I was when I played vanilla. I didn't get enough gold for an epic mount until the first week of TBC came out :D
---
for me I think it's barrens.
---
Until BWL: definitely
---
After BWL: very likely
---
MC will easily be cleared in one night.
---
And there were and will always be more casual guild. Maybe they raid more than one night, but it wont be mandatory
---
Purge is even better. It would be shame if you lost your world buffs...
---
It’s my guide. 
---
Feel free to ask if you have concerns about pserver vs vanilla, I’ll be happy to respond 👍
---
What’re you gunna do with that? Get to level 12?
---
Nope this isnt true
---
Yoo what server
---
World buffs isnt a magical effect though. Like rally cry for example. 
---
With the state of the industry and the steady decay of activision blizzard as a company... i dunno man, i hope to the high heavens your right on all points, but i would not be so quick to believe it. So far they seem to have an okey touch on what classic can and should be, but it seems far from impossible they would do a 180 and start adding loot shops, lvl boosts etc. I hope to god not 2, but i do not believe it impossible.
---
I think I’ll enjoy it this time 10 times more then when I first played. No more 15-20 FPS.. bad internet and lots more haha. 
---
Doesn't even use spellpower, dropped
---
Somewhat true for me. As an adult I can binge for a lot longer periods like a whole weekend or an entire night, but usually responsibilities get in the way and I won't be able to play for several days or sometimes weeks. Whereas when i was a kid I'd consistently play 2-4 hours a day until my parents kicked me off the computer.
---
Why not? We will easily be ahead of them and we can just gank them all day long
---
Too bad it was ruined by fucking pandas. Completely lost it for me.
---
Songflower, dmt buffs...
---
Joke's on you; I don't have any friends or family.
---
...
---
:(
---
Quit my job already, gave away my kids and wife to the nearest stranger willing to take them. I don't answer to my parents anymore so who cares. I have better things to do rather soon, and until then I can prepare better like this too.
---
Cats heroics weren’t extremely difficult. You needed some good DPS to avoid your healer ooming the first couple of days, after that it was easy.
---
Our time is finally gong to have value again.
---
Swat someone, go to jail for 20 years. You showed them!
---
Although I remember them disappearing after extended log out periods, I'm struggling to find supporting evidence in either direction of the opinion. I didn't play warlock as my main, so perhaps my missing soul shards were due to patches rather than time disconnected. I feel we need a blue post to settle this one!
---
I remember this sentiment well:
---
&gt;*"It sure would be nice if they stacked."*  
---
&gt;\- By Miriamelle on 2005/09/02 (Patch 1.6.1)
---
**Here are patch notes related to Soul Shards:**
---
&gt;**Beta:**  
---
&gt;  **0.7:** Enslave Demon: Soul shard cost added.  
---
&gt;  **0.9:** A failed Ritual of Summoning should no longer cost a soul shard.   
---
&gt; **0.12:** Enslave Demon - Soul Shard cost removed, duration reduced.   
---
&gt;**Classic:**  
---
&gt;**1.1.0:** Enslave Demon once again requires a soul shard, increased the chance of breaking early if cast repeatedly on the same target.   
---
&gt;**1.2.0:** Create Soulstone: Reduced the Soul Shard cost from two shards to one shard.   
---
&gt;**1.5.0:** Honorable kills will now generate a Soul Shard when Drain Soul and Shadowburn are used.   
---
&gt;**1.9.0:** Tailors now can make soul bags to hold soul shards.  
---
&gt;**1.10.0:** Shadowburn - The debuff which produces the soul shard upon death is now visble to the player and has a 5 sec duration. The Warlock will no longer sometimes receive two soul shards upon the victim's death. Targets which do not grant experience or honor will no longer produce shards.   
---
&gt;**1.11.2:** Fixed an error that if you try to create a Soul Shard bag while you have one equipped the materials used for the creation of the bag are consumed and the bag is placed in the inventory queue.   
---
&gt;**1.12.0:** A soul shard will be refunded to the caster any time a summoned pet despawns rather than dies.   
---
&gt;**1.12.1:** Players that log out of the game and back while having a pet summoned will now be properly credited a Soul Shard.  
---
&gt;**Burning Crusade:**  
---
&gt;**2.0.1:** Fixed an issue where the Warlock spell "Shadowburn" was improperly consuming two Soul Shards.

---
&gt;**3.0.3:** \[Glyph of Souls\] no longer removes soul shard cost. It instead reduces the mana cost of your Ritual of Souls spell by 70%.   
---
&gt;**3.1.0:** Drain Soul: Each time Drain Soul deals damage to a target which can grant experience, it now has a chance to generate a \[Soul Shard\].   
---
&gt;**3.1.0:** \[Soul Shard\]: This item now has a maximum count of 32 in inventory.   
---
&gt;**Cataclysm**  
---
&gt;**4.0.1:** Soul Shards have been removed from the game as items. Instead, they now exist as a resource system necessary for using, or altering the mechanics of certain spells. 
---
Hah! I was even worse. I dont think i got epic flying till mist or warlords, despite playing actively (pvping tho, pve had long since last its flair and i never was much of a money maker)
---
Buff duration was 2 hours. The cooldown to place the head was 8 or 6, though I'm fairly certain it was 8. 
---
So I guess you're the liar.
---
Various paladin PPM, interactions and coefficients are entirely guesswork from conflicting sources.
---
Warlocks demons do not get stun/dazed when summoning a new one in vanilla, it vanishes entirely upon starting to summon a new one.
---
As blizzard, who are in possession of the real 1.12 client and server have mentioned. Many things private server players thought were correct are in fact entirely wrong. 
---
Resistances on bosses are now know, nor is armor values. Only ones known are KT and one other boss. Source: one of the recent classicasts where they had the nost guy on. 
---
PPM's on various weapons have been altered.
---
Sorry to burst your bubble. But private servers aren't as blizzlike as you think. They're kinda close, but not really. 
---
Well you need every slot you can get because soul shards
---
Yep, when the straw breaks the camels back, it will be genocide. 
---
Wow the struggle! Fortunately i had a decent adsl 256kbs/128kbs back then so my internet was fine, but damn i had some serious fps lag though.. great times never the  less!
---
Stop what? Having a different opinion than you?
---
I've been leveling a lock on a unmentionable server, according to the website there are between 1000 and 1500 online at most times 
---
There are plenty of players in my areas so far, no trouble getting dungeongroups, and from what I can tell from world chat, at very active 60 bracket also.
---
This seems sort of /inceltears'ish 
---
The fun spec is hemo prep, the fastest and most boring spec is combat swords. 
---
Either way you should pick up remorseless attacks, most people ignore it, but opening with an ambush crit makes a huge difference and p much makes weapon swapping worth it until you get WC quest sword or cruel barb
---
Yes, i got more some of those.
---
Here's my secret, i never told my family or anyone of my friends that weren't playing that i was invested. I told everyone i was vlogging if they asked. People look down on girls who play video games where i live. So i hide it.
---
I wait, if they f it up like I expect them to do I stay on private server or not play at all. And for the unexpected case the actually get rid of sharding after a few weeks (don't believe them though) then I still can play it on an official server.
---
I can't wait for TBC servers so I can \[Dirge\].
---
Neither is the mana.
---
I'll be farming a normal epic mount long before the class mount is available.
---
To be totally honest, 10K or even more like certain private servers is not balanced at all, way too many players on one single realm. 5K would probably do it, and remember we will probably see battelgroups so pvp is not an issue
---
Lol yeah I was also too busy patrolling hot spots to pvp with some alliance. Or just raiding.
---
I was definitely the type of person who could not be bothered to level a professional (except first aid of course). Although I think I did max out herb and alch but just never did anything with them really. Maybe I survived off letting people use my cooldowns. 
---
In TBC there was a dungeon you could stealth picklock some chests and get some pretty good BoE blues and good uncut gems. Made decent money from that whenever I absolutely needed it. 
---
I really actually look forward to playing all the professions out this time around though! 
---
Getting dumped over the timing of a wailing caverns runs with the boys is gonna be rough.
---
&gt; &gt; If population drops they'll simply merge servers and the population will be back to normal.
---
&gt; Did that ever work ? If it was so easy there wouldn't be dead servers on retail since they had more than 10 years to use this.
---
One of the theories floating around, is when naxx is cleared regularly and people are asking for a FRESH server, they might merge all the current servers to a single "perpetual" server, and start all over, eventually funneling into the 1 perpetual server.
---
1000x this.
---
I don't have friends, I'm not close to family, I don't have a good career to take up my time, I don't have kids or even a girlfriend for that matter. I have a lot of free time!
---
.... Too much free time..... Damn. I probably should get my shit together. 
---
no
---
AB tabard is best tabard
---
I basically think it's pretty much: 
---
The people who have enough experience with the game to realistically be level 60 AND have 1K gold significantly before DM launch will buy the regular mounts
---
People who take longer leveling and/or don't have efficient ways of grinding gold will welcome the cheaper mount. 
---
I guess there's a third category for whom the quest line for the mount is too hard, so they don't get it - but for those guys getting 1K gold might be tough too :) 
---
They don’t have much of a choice. Their servers *have* to be able to handle 40 people in one place otherwise you won’t be able to raid.
---
Go with herbalism mining, save the needed materials for leveling engineering from 1-300 + all items you want to make, once you got the materials you need, unlearn mining and skill engineering. 
---
Sell herbs through the entire classic timeline to sustain gold. You don’t really have to ‘farm’ either, chances are you’ll still make enough by just spending time in the open world. 
---
You can do this with all gathering professions of course, but herbalism is probably the most lucrative, mining would be but there’s more competition for basically one single type of vein, while alchemy uses a lot of different herbs, even lower level ones. 
---
I think it's more the idea that were going to have a true mmorpg in the world we love again. Needing to interact with players and a community feeling.
---
An expansion every year and you choose whether to migrate your character across (for a small fee).
---
&gt; video games do not cause addiction
---
&gt; if a person has an underlying, pre-existing addictive tendency or disorder, video games can be a trigger for it
---
This really sounds like wheedly semantics for the sake of being able to feel more correct than everyone else. WoW almost destroyed me because of my addiction to it, and I shrugged off tobacco, weed, booze, psychedelics and stimulants like a duck. 
---
WoW is incredibly, deeply, dangerously addictive. (See you in Classic!)
---
Man I've got a wife and a full time career, if I made it to 60 before DM is released than either I'm divorced or fired and my epic mount quest will be the least of my worries lol!!
---
But to answer your question I'd buy it straight up if I had the funds. 
---
you need quite alot of gold to do this quest to get your mount, it ain't free, plus doing this whole chain is quite time consuming.
---
just spending this time farming gold and buying a regular mount is almost as good already.
---
Good argument, both to be honest no one sourced any of their statements
---
Yup for sure, still feel the paladin outweighs a shaman for pvp. I guess having both dispel and purge would be insane tho &gt;.&lt;
---
Private servers always have shady shit going on at the high end which inevitably leads to the closure of the server - not only that but you deal with serious botting / rwt of gold and it becomes retarded after a while
---
At least with a blizzard server you can be assured the server won't die because a corrupt GM has decided to steal the server money or done some other shady shit 
---
Just a heads up that 60 press-ups/ sit-ups is tough even for fit people. Try breaking them into 3 sets of 20 of 6 sets of 10 repetitions!
---
In all seriousness buddy just play casually at end of the day the content will be the same for a long time so even at a slow pace you can catch up eventually as the content will come to an end at the end of the content cycle :) I doubt if they do move forward with future content to add onto classic it will be a long time coming anyways if they ever do that in the first place :) I got a girlfriend and a full time job of 48 hours but I’m just gonna go at my own pace and have fun regardless :D
---
Will be back probably this week, and things are going well, thank you.
---
Its why I said "looks" and spoke hypothetically. 
---
I'd rather play with temporary starter zone sharding than reliving the release again.
---
Nopp. I can see why you think thats what I mean tho
---
It wouldn't be authentic then. Need those free one/two day play time credits again.
---
Well uncles are typically people who’ve never had a girlfriend or gotten laid. 
---
I’ve had sex with over 20 women. It’s just not worth getting into a relationship with a modern woman. 
---
Played in 2004 i was 33 years old and still play i have a 20 year old boy and a 26 year old girl almost 50 [now. ](https://now.My)I was married and i am still married so she nos what is coming she is good with it.This is going to be sick see you all in the game and for the horde. 
---
I doubt ill be 60 before DM hits, and I highly doubt Ill have the gold before DM hits, so thats a sure yes from me
---
Incels*
---
No matter what people say, even to themselves, it will never be like it used to.
---
So many things have changed in your life, that even with Blizzard trying their best to keep the gameplay, your experience will be totally different.
---
I am willing to be that nobody will be as addicted as they were 15 years ago.
---
&gt; There will be no loot shop. Everything we find will be purely skill or luck and we can show our mounts and gear off now like we actually earned it and no one will question it. Got a epic piece of gear? Show That bad boy off to new players.
---
I wouldn't count 100% on this tho
---
Don't talk to the big guy like
---
Already warned my S/O. Have explained to her I have several great PS4 games she will have ***plenty*** of time to play through: Fallout 4, Horizon: Zero Dawn, Persona 5, God of War, Spiderman, Last of Us.
---
She seems to be okay with it^(, but I also think she does not understand how serious I am about "piss jug" and "poop bucket" /s)
---
Yeh I don’t know how true this is I only saw guys from like 4-5 realms last time I played. Not all of them of course I also didn’t pay attention to server unless you were from ragnaros and couldn’t English. 
---
Imagine not playing because the launch won’t be a shit show.
---
“I wAnT tO lAg AnD dC oN tHe FiRsT dAy!”
---
First my Boss was like this:
---
You need 4 Weeks off of work because of a Videogame? (i always took 1 or 2 weeks for some games)
---
My Girlfriend:
---
You took you whole free days for WoW classic, you are stupid as hell (we played from Cata to BfA together but she is not into Classic)
---
My Game Friends:
---
Dude we will push PvP Rank so hard this time!!!!!!!!
---
My "Normal" friends:
---
Ohh you can not take a big break in summer for our  vacation  because of a game?
---
My Metalhead friends:
---
No open air this summer? No festivals? You are Weak!
---
My Pen and Paper Group (I am the Gamemaster):
---
4 Weeks without progress to our Group? is this a out of season april fools joke?
---
Jep that summarize it really good.
---
Provosorisk's \[Reincarnation\] applies to Provosorisk
---
not that they confirmed it yet but its going to be nice having a normal server pop instead of  this overpopulated shit show like on some unnamed server im on. 
---
They have dynamic scaling, they dont need a stress test.  Their infrastructure is worlds beyond what it used to be.  
---
If they do need a stress test, they can launch a virtual one, they have zero need for the the community for that
---
Yes, lots, you to search a bit, but they were there (mine included I'd dare say :p)
---
Rifleluvin comes to mind altho he's not in blues, but even then it's not a crit highlight. Laintime too, even drakedog
---
Just to remind you, it is not safe to push-up that 249 pounds body with 40 reps without a warm-up
---
No those caves have always been the first raid for Night Elf.  Those memories have never left. 
---
I’m not going to play Warlock as my first character, but I would wait. It looks awesome and the quest is really cool.
---
Are you sure it’s not just your computer. I have a beefy rig and I didn’t experience any lag even when I accidentally flew into two raids camping a flight point in war mode. Or out front of tol dagor where there were like 50 people standing or at the AH where there’s tons of people stacked up. 
---
&gt; Our time is finally going to have value again 
---
That. Not just stupid work, sleep and dinner.
---
It’s true if you have a good computer you will probably rarely experience lag source has bitchin computer. Last time I played even when I experienced the old let’s camp the FP with two raids I didn’t lag. 
---
I'm sorry you feel that way, it is important to have reasons for our suffering. All the same, it is what the field shows: An underlying, pre-existing condition is necessary to have been there in the first place, as video games cannot cause it and of themselves.
---
Honestly, you will probably end up coming back. I would personally get in the mindset that you are now going to play for run and not do it like a job. That way you can pick it up and put it down as you please. Limit your playing hours and stick to those hours.
---
&gt; you are investing nothing but time on a pserver
---
Wont this be the case for classic as well?
---
I'm going to be playing with my wife.   And if my 12yo daughter wants to play to she can
---
I drink diet soda and don’t have problems with gaining weight tho
---
The problem is high spikes of population in specific zones at specific times - e.g. the starter zones at launch, Silithus at gate opening, etc.
---
The authentic vanilla way of dealing with this problem was to not deal with it at all. We suffered really long log-in queues, server instability, random crashes, terrible loot lag, random disconnections, and then a really long log-in queue to get in again. I remember during the gate opening event I got about 1FPS during the time when I was actually online because my PC couldn't handle the spell effects of a couple of hundred people acting simultaneously around me. 
---
Sharding is the solution to this problem that Blizzard introduced WoW. Instead of being on a single server, different people - even though they are on the same realm in the same zone - are separated onto different shards. The downside to sharding is that you can be wandering along a road and all the mobs and people around you will fade out and some different mobs and people will fade in as you're dynamically shifted from one shard to another. 
---
More horsepower in servers and better network tech means the infrastructure could probably handle more people online at once, but the gameplay itself can't: particularly the respawn time for mobs means that people would risk standing around with nothing to kill, and a swarm of people desperately trying to tag the mob as soon as it spawns. Some people have alternative solutions to that problem which they prefer over sharding.
---
or move them to TBC, and start a new, fresh wave. I know you want to keep your characters forever, but come on, you won't be playing on the same character for 2+ years without any new content.
---
My worst fears are, though, that at some point the first wave will bake it to WotLK/Cata/MoP, and will get merged with retail or have transfers open - which will greatly violate the retail's relic market.
---
Soon tm
---
They definitely aren’t for everyone also it’s okay to be a bit more of a tryhard but yeh it can suck when people you know in real life get frustrated by you telling them the optimal way to play. 
---
Can't wait to hear up my druid and laugh at all the rogues, mages and warriors competing for loot
---
Is this an actual Blue April Fools or is this someone pretending there is a Blue April Fools? I can’t find a link to the original post.
---
Either way, pretty funny.
---
Example 3 of my RL friends wouldn’t play with me because all they care about is leveling and the story. Where all I care about is being a bamf tank that could raid... it still sucked though to be excluded. 
---
Hi, /u/dantech2390
---
&gt;I wouldnt count on blizzard to merge servers, they are more likely to force a server transfer instead
---
You mean suddenly, without any notice, close the high-pop servers, and all force players to transfer to another one, to split population? Like it happened in RIFT?
---
NO WAY
---
Though, they could just MERGE some dead servers into some high-pop server, forcing renames for players from dead servers. Though, 3 scarab lords on one server, deal with it.
---
Heh when i discovered myself rather short on gold for lvl 40 mount ( a good 50g) i merely ran players through wailing caverns for gold until i did. I was almost full bloodfang by the time TBC came and yet still did not have an epic mount, was an odd situation (everything about me was really, as you may have put together i played the apparently least played combination of class and race.
---
I intend to do things entirely different as well! Am so torn on what profession to choose to maximize my gold farming. Skinning and just vendoring seems to be the safest bet, as i imagine herbalism and mining to be extreme timesinks at launch. Probably add tailoring/enchanting to that, or if it turns out i can gather alright, pick up herbalism. Will drop one at 60 and pick up engineering, leveling mining on an alt to take out the worst sting of buying mats for it. How about you! ?
---
Not to mention the global cooldown
---
I see you are a man of culture
---
Regular mounts are better because they don't use the GCD
---
Damn, they didn’t think sharding the starting areas was enough? Now they gotta shard our items too!
---
I hope that 49 lbs is gains, from constantly doing pushups and situps during any downtime.
---
Just because we want it doesn’t mean they need it
---
They do not need a stress test.  They do not need a beta
---
It is not a new game.  Their infrastructure is not new
---
Yeah they'll take anyone's money.  But if they give a time frame, they're likely giving it in their local time/calendar.  
---
Defiler's tabard is probably one of the top 5 reasons to play horde.
---
Due to the argument earlier today, this is my response
---
Just a question about those "connected servers", if my character is named BigDick69, and there is one on the other connected server named BigDick69, will we both have that name then?  
---
Will one of us be BigDick69#1 and the other one #2?
---
No, you should not. 
---
IMO the biggest reason to not use sharding (although I'm ok with it being in the starter area's, especially at launch) is that in Vanilla the resource nodes were not personalized, only one person could mine a node/pick an herb.  Because of this you were able to lock down an area and monopolize the nodes there, helping you to be able to set the prices on that resource.  
---
For example you and some friends could spread out to all the Mythril farming spots and just keep anyone else from really being able to get a good amount for a couple days, then you have a larger say in the market than you could otherwise.  If sharding exists you can't do this because there exists multiple shards and you can't lock them all down.
---
That's the one thing that would make me not play Classic. Even if there's a shop for cosmetics, I'm out. 
---
The excessive zoom level ruined my eyes.
---
But the ends justify the means.
---
I think some of the most fun was just after BGs came out, when you had to queue at in ashenvale for WSG, that place was a minefield for PvP.
---
Can’t beat the old 1v1 stuff when walking around EPL/WPL though, it’s so natural it just works.
---
How short can a character name be/what’s the minimum, 2 or 3 letters? 
---
What, and spoil that OG WoW feeling? herecy!
---
Or just use God-awful form to make them easy.
---
what's rwt of gold?
---
Ya that’s good advice. I just remember how fun BC was as a kid. Hopefully my adult brain can register just for fun and be able to do this.
---
I’m into that Pepsi Max myself.
---
Confirmed.
---
if they used sharding for launch that would mean they dont have the proper server hardware to handle the AQ event either. there absolutely cant be any sharding.
---
Yeah, but I obviously get a real mount first. I'm not fucking using my 60% mount for a few month.
---
My wife told my parents I was gonna start playing wow again and they looked at her and said “Poor girl”
---
Kinda hard to ask questions about something stuck behind a paywall.
---
Real world trading - selling gold for life currency (although it does still happen to a small extent on retail it's very rare compared to a private server) 
---
Fair. 
---
“They cost money, they are outsourced and todays server are also really weak,”
---
Uhh you know that a bunch of virtual servers will be on ONE physical server correct?  That server, currently, and in the future, won’t be running at full capacity either.  It is dynamic scaling, and the crashes are more than likely bandwidth related
---
Here is the biggest underlying problem with SP rouges.
---
Private servers don't know the actual SP coef of equipment based spell procs.
---
SP Rogues could entirely be a Private server phenomenon, especially considering that after years of people trying to find proof of this existing during vanilla/TBC, there is zero reports of it working. 
---
The closest thing to being something that existed is paladins/shamans with several proc effects like darkmoon card: maelstrom, heart of wrymthalak, and some elemental weapon procs scaling poorly, but still having synergy with shaman and paladin SP based spells.
---
While the idea that having a ton of "on hit" spell type procs working in the 19 bracket working, its very unlikely its an effective means of scaling rogue's damage at any higher levels where base line ability start to overcome enchants/buff procs.
---
it was an inside joke for vanilla players, I literally copied the most famous WoW vanilla thread of all time.
---
Of course. Remember hunters: roll need. 
---
FTFY
---
&gt;Me: "Don't you worry about blank, let me worry about blank."
---
Good. I would have also accepted "Blank? BLANK?!"
---
they need better server hardware. Not a work around like sharding. If they cant handle populated zones then we can say goodbye to an AQ event which would be completely  unacceptable.
---
Unpopular opinion: for Horde, the undead skeletal mount looks better, and is more impressive if an orc / troll are riding it.
---
Also, costs no mana to cast.
---
honestly with people being able to find bis lists and best specs and strategys for content.  you wont spend that much time raiding per week.  less than what you would spend levelling for sure
---
pvp is a different matter but tier 2 replaces the pvp sets anyway.   sure you can spend time farming consumables but not everyone in the raid needs to use them
---
that, and youre not the only one thinking you wont have time.  theres a shit ton of people who have lives careers and families now that need a guild that will cater to that kind of player, if you are one then join them.  can still enjoy the game cause everyone forgets 80% of the game is levelling up and making friends along the way lol.  max level content is an afterthought
---
What is this from?
---
I’d had enough and quit during Legion. I was convinced I’d never return but literally the minute I heard Classic was announced I was hooked. I’ve been obsessively planning my return to Azeroth since then. 
---
Exactly this.  If you have a good gold farming method, you could very much so have just farmed the extra ~300g in the same time it would have taken you do to the quest line.
---
I think it costs ~650g depending on server economy for all the mats and quest related items. Cheaper if you have a buddy share some quest items already purchasd, but rarely happens.
---
All accounts created before 2006 get lvl 60, the dream.
---
does the warlock mount require riding skill as well? iirc, that was 90% of the cost anyway
---
I don't think I even disagree (addictions only get you if there is something about you that they speak to, plus you're seeking escapism) - call that a condition if you like.
---
But you are rebutting "x is addictive" with "x is only addictive to those with a predisposition". Like... so? The adjective "addictive" is English shorthand for "causes those with the predisposition to be vulnerable to this thing".
---
Would you call cigarettes addictive? If so, why not use your carefully qualified version of "addictive"? Loads of people try smoking and are put off by the grossness, health issues, it just doesn't click for them, etc.
---
Unpopular opinion: I would not mind a hunter/warrior class quest that upgrades the shadow strike OR thunder strike to an actual usable item.  Fodder for 'Classic +' content.
---
(Isn't there already a thing like this in some later expansion?)
---
Horizontal content my friend
---
I think Blizzard never really merged servers.
---
The only thing they did/do is "connected servers", it's basically CRZ but only with the servers that are connected. You could even join other guilds etc on connected servers as far as I know.
---
The general rule is if you're on an RP server but not RPing:
---
1) Try to at least have a somewhat lore-friendly name; some leeway here as it depends but no meme names.
---
2) Don't be a jerk/troll to the people who are RPing; you can observe or whatnot, but don't try to ruin the RP.
---
3) This can vary by server but if you interact with people in /say, it is probably in character; OOC stuff usually goes in parentheses to indicate it's OOC.  It's doubtful that any sort of in character thing will be enforced as it is not even on RP servers now, but that's a general rule.
---
Hi, pldcanfly. Rolled any dices lately? :D
---
No, it's a spell. 
---
It may cost him more than that.  Presumably we must own BFA currently subscribed to play classic.  But that is just the community guess.  
---
Thats not really true at all. Sharding is to make it so you aren't competiting for kobolds for 3 hours. Blizzard will want to get people out of starting areas as quick as possible.
---
I agree. Plus with all the wealth of knowledge things will be a lot easier to achieve. And we won’t be as surprised by things as we were then.
---
So you're saying I can need on a spirit staff for the rare occasion im OOM and need to switch? Noice.
---
Honestly, something like Star Power would be a cool resource. You build it for hitting complex parts of your rotation correctly, then you unleash it as your damage cool down. I could dig it.
---
Keep in mind there may be people who play super-casually and take years to level. Or people who assemble a family of alts. Or the folks who roleplay and would happily have one character for years. Or the completionists - every quest and every rep would take considerable time I should think. Or any of the inummerable inventive ways people play this game.
---
Personally, although I'd love to see TBC and WotLK, and am curious about horizontal progression/new content, I want a permanent vanilla option as well.
---
It's pretty clear that they wouldn't be able to make the AQ event now like in the old times, you can't even start a 40v40 WPVP battle on retail servers right now because it completly blows up their infrastructure for that server. But im pretty sure that they could assign a lot more performance to Silithus regions for an event, they just dont care on retail because 40v40 WPVP is way to rare.
---
And you'll have access to retail, so you can play it on the side if you're in the mood for that kind of thing.
---
I love that you put this on github and wrote it with latex. Im gonna read it later, it looks comprehensive! Like a journal paper on WoW.
---
Maybe we need a peer review WoW journal...
---
I play retail and haven't had lag since BFAs launch. Regualry do the world bosses in 40 man groups and there ain't lag there either.
---
Infact I was in a world boss group the other day where there was also a horde group of 20 players trying to kill us, game ran perfectly fine.
---
What harding will do is cap population per area, lets say they cap starting dun morogh to 50 or so. So the servers will throw around players to differnet so called "shards" which are capped at 50 players, so you end up having insane amount of "shards" but the server doesnt crash and you can actually do content instead of crashing for a week and taking hours to finish basic quests.
---
It still costs money and you need a form of payment. Anyone with a computer and internet connection can play pservers.
---
this guy is experienced, but still wrong. not with wow being more important than woman, but his picture of modern women in general.
---
alot of girls, hell even most of them are the way he describes them, narcissistic bullshit as soon as the rose tinted glasses wear off. i almost lost hope too.
---
then one night i went out with some friends, got a bit drunk and just talked to the lady who cought my eye.
---
weve been together now for 6 years, didnt even have a fight yet and shes going holy paladin once classic releases!!11 &lt;3
---
so, meeting women and having relationships can be frustrating, especially if youre the one investing and all you get is bullshit. all im saying is dont give up bro, if you stop trying youll never get your long-term holy paladina. :)
---
When will ppl stop thinking that 2004 hardware is more powerfull than 2019 hardware. The hardware is not the issue, its the way they implement the software layer on top of the hardware with containered microservices that is. 
---
There are a few free alliance guides if you prefer to grab something at n/c, that’s cool. I think Joana will also have a free alliance one out before launch. 
---
This is a speed running alliance guide that Umbra and I developed for alliance side. It’s the result of a couple years and several thousand hours playtesting. 
---
The guide is designed on a custom pserver though which has corrected for vanilla values far more than any publically available one (eg mob density, armour, drop rates)
---
We only made the 1-19 early access available this week, which is probably why you haven’t seen it. 
---
Blokkaroach is one of a handful of streamers who have access.
---
Horror movie called "The Ring" I believe. It was a staple horror movie back in the early 2000's 
---
Arcanite reaper until av is released, then tuf.
---
PvP blue set is on par with bwl dps plate bc itemization is really good.
---
PvP trinket and either black hands breath or hoj.
---
PvP jewelry is ok, but even Mc /zg jewelry is spades better, if you don’t mind raiding a little bit. (Also axe and sword spec are both superior to mace spec for PvP so if u can grab a 2hander while raiding it will be an improvement).
---
All this hate on warriors is nonsense.  Undergeared warriors are the weakest class in the game, but after a certain loot threshold (approx bwl) they are at the very least comparable to every other class with equal gear and godlike against anything geared less then themselves.
---
Note: Charge doesn’t work properly on any pserver I played on, and the only time warriors got gimped in vanilla was during the atrocious rage normalization period (might have been tbc but that’s the only time I ever felt gimped as a geared warrior)
---
Gl
---
Most people wont even be 60 yet by the time DM hits, let alone having 900g for the epic mount
---
I told my wife I was planning on buying a gaming laptop so that I can go on vacation AND still be able to play Classic this summer. She wasnt that amused . 
---
Have you played retail recently? Server can’t handle high density of people. The parallel between starter zones and AQ event is very valid. 
---
That is truly min maxing! 
---
I can give you an argument, Sodapoppin startet a ~40v40 (maybe bit more) WPVP battle with another streamer and the world server for the region completly peaced out.
---
I know of the movie. Guess I just didn’t remember this part.
---
I anticipate to be level 60 prior to phase 2 release, so if I have the required amount of gold, I'll just buy the regular 100 % mount, but if I need about 1-200 gold and phase two is about to release I'll just wait. 
---
I'm playing this with my Significant Other when it comes out :\]
---
ok so deffenetly need to make plans for raiding
---
It's incredibly common on retail and has been since vanilla. 
---
Hahaha you sound salty mate.
---
It's no fun without a challenge.
---
Yes, I remember merging with another server in Vanilla; I had to choose a new name. The population was noticeably higher and the economy improved a lot.
---
But why would you want to play together with someone and not be in a group? 
---
Thats even worse in Classic because you wouldn't get any XP or loot from mobs that were tagged by someone else.
---
I have a week of pto earmarked just for whenever we have a release date. Wife knows she isnt going to see me much 
---
Thank you, then I'll try to find a name which fits with my future character (female Dwarf pally), likely something related to light. Any suggestions?
---
Obviously we don't know how pvp itemization is going to happen but isn't the blue set really bad in the begining until it gets buffed later?
---
I play retail reguarly, I made a comment further down. In a 40 man group to kill a world boss + 20 or so horde the game ran perfctly fine.
---
&gt;I was in a world boss group the other day where there was also a horde group of 20 players trying to kill us, game ran perfectly fine. 
---
I mean, i do that with the games im playing now...including retail...lol
---
&gt; without new content
---
New Vanilla content please. No level cap increase 
---
Then they’ll just spam their wares in that channel too. No thanks. 
---
Not off the top of my head but good part is your toon name could be the surname. E.g. my human pally is "Nobleshield" which IC is his surname and it works. 
---
So I'd suggest that, find something like that and it's her "surname" so it fits the RP server naming criteria. 
---
Today's servers are virtual in a cloud. They give each instance the minimum required hardware resources to be efficient, and sometimes it doesn't properly compensate for spikes in activity (thus sharding comes into play -- BOOOO). But they *can* merge servers if populations are out of whack.
---
I was falsely correlating your statement to the heaps of comments about private servers and the chance of losing characters for some reason.  I'm not quite sure why when I look at what you said now it reads pretty straight forward..  I'll just delete it and blame this on tuesday morning. 
---
That's not a change, there will be an LFG channel regardless of whether Blizz or a player makes it.
---
Starter area with 100s of toons running around? You are mistaken sir. When classic launched there were queue times and bad servers and bad PCs. There were like 10-30 people through all of elwynn. You're probably thinking of Nost and that wasn't the classic experience. 
---
"I'm taking a couple days off this summer to play a video game." 
---
"Is it that war game again?"
---
Official ones will get a lot more players
---
Yea. The issue with that type of setup is that its super predictable in PvP :/
---
Thank you! I worked in research for a very long time, so reproducibility and transparency kind of rubbed off on me.  The goal was to make something comprehensible and in-depth but still easily accessible (which is why I don't exactly explain how the distributions are drawn, for instance).
---
Small raids of priests waiting in BlackRock mountain Mind Controlling MC and BWL raids off the ledge down into the lava to die as they trickled in.
---
If I happen to be in the position to make this decision, it seems obvious that I should go ahead and grind + buy the regular mount.
---
But my dilemma is then, do I still drop the ~600g (or whatever it is) on the dreadsteed? Because I want to do the quest. And I kinda want to have it because it’s cool. But that’s quite a lot of gold to throw around for a quest and something cool...
---
How did the players took the merging ? It seems there was enough backlash for blizzard to stop doing them...
---
There’s only 1 way to move a dick
---
The horde didn't even have to burn Teldrassil, because you just butchered it.
---
Thats because like the comment you replied to...... you aren't going back to Legion, or Cata..... you're returning to the WoW that you left involuntarily. WoW shifted itself into something else before a lot of people quit. In other words, WoW (as you knew it) left you and only now is it returning.
---
I think thats a big part of why everyone is so excited, because we literally played Vanilla until it morphed into whatever expansion turned you away. For most that seems to be Cata, but the point stands.
---
fuck
---
Dirge dirge dirge span was more iconic for me than thunderfury spam
---
I started playing WoW with one of my real life friends.  He had a Warrior and I had a Rogue.  We leveled up to 60 mostly together with him tanking instances.  But once we hit 60 and started gear grinding, he greedily need rolled on the Dal'Rends in UBRS.  He went on to be a greedy gear hawk and I never really forgave him.  Granted, I didn't know at the time that Fury Warrior dps is quite good.  I eventually rerolled a Warlock because he constantly beat me in dps.  
---
Yup. /join LookingForGroup
---
On my private server, people kind of use this, but groups are 90% formed from world chat.
---
I would imagine it as something where you can change song on the fly and your rotation becomes different. I guess kinda like Lucio from Overwatch. I guess to make it completely unpredictable, they would have to make it so that you are the only one who can see your star power.
---
Haha brilliant. 
---
I'll always get a regular mount just for the fact that i dont need to spend mana
---
I do this at the great lift :)
---
vanilla was actually 6GB when it was released in EU, I remember this very fondly because I thought it was massive as hell.
---
Nothing specifically jumps to memory but I'm sure plenty have seen their fair share of:
---
- Ninja looting.
---
- 60s corpse camping random lowbies just to be dicks.
---
- People quitting dungeon runs as soon as they got the gear drop they wanted or as soon as the boss that drops it is down and didn't drop it.
---
- People afking/not contributing in/sabotaging BGs.
---
- People trying to scam you in trade windows with the various different tricks they could try.
---
- People deliberately trying to tag a mob just before you pull it so you take the aggro but don't get the kill. (Though I do have a fun story about that)
---
- Never experienced it personally but heard of a few cases of guild bank theft/fraud from officers or leaders that were quitting or likely to get kicked over something.

My own personal story of someone being a dick and it backfiring was attempted mob theft. Some mage tagged a mob just as I pulled it and then pulled the mob next to it as well. Dude clearly didn't realise or forgot Hunters could feign death, so I did, and he got 2 mobs on him and died. He even sent me raging PMs afterwards calling *me* the dick for not killing his stolen mob!
---
Oh i pity your wife
---
Hunter for content that is close to your level, mage for farming lower level content. 
---
Just spam tradechat
---
Me too. She’s dead.
---
Hackers also beg to differ!
---
I used to sit in the barrens and advertise selling a BOP Staff for 8 Gold, back then no one knew what Bop was so when people would want to buy it i would put it in the do not trade tab and they would trade me the gold. They would realize that they did not receive the staff and i would just say it must have been a bug because i never received the gold either. 
---
I  had over 300 gold by the time i left the barrens lol.
---
I agree. The last expansion I truly enjoyed was Wrath. Cata was the beginning of the decline of retail. I went through a pattern of buying the expansion, trying it for a couple months then getting bored and quitting for periods of time. 
---
Your names will be followed by your server. So, you’d be BigDick69-Chromaggus, and the other would be BigDick69-Anub’arak, as an example.
---
Order up
---
While I don't doubt there are some people who are just...... looking for something to that with, playing the lottery doesn't have anything else to it. My wife has played WoW off and on for years and she barely even gets to end-game when its current. She likes to PvP and level (historically....... slowly) but gives zero shits about gear.
---
There's no other angle to the lottery other than "buy numbers, maybe you win (lol no you won't)"
---
Thats like saying the supermarket is a casino because they sell lottery tickets there........... there's so much else to the supermarket!
---
Is it /join lfg or /join lookingforgroup? See yhe community is already split. Lets just get an official one in the capital cities! #nochangesbutchanges
---
&gt; I clear my throat and with as much stern authority as i can muster tell everyone to get bent.
---
DM: roll for intimidation with disadvantage
---
They have always said authenticity is the goal. This is meant to bring players back so that a few of them get the itch to play the retail expansions. I think from a business decision it makes sense to only have a cash shop for transfers and such.
---
Vanilla Coke Zero. I can’t stop drinking it. Help. 
---
Rather it comes back to an overarching point of the general community in the game. Let's say you're in Org/IF and the game is sharded. Back before sharding, you would eventually recognize that lvl 60 warrior who had Windfurry and full tier set running around. Or that lvl 35 rogue who always seemed to have a hold on the copper ore market. You could actually SEE them when they were in the world when you were. Let's say there was a rival raiding guild to yours. Both of you competing for full clears and timing. You would see their raid members before a Friday raid night in zones prepping or in capital cities etc.
---
In these examples, none of these people are your friends you're grouping with but you still know them, they're a part of your gaming community. Logging on and seeing them go about their own journeys gives a true since of a world you're a part of. 
---
If you're sharded however, that all goes away. You are then places on shard 1.2.0.5 or whatever when you log in and you just arent instanced with everyone around you anymore. They are just randos here one log in/phase in time to the next, maybe you'll be sharded with them again, maybe not. This... is the downside and danger to sharding and why we don't want it.
---
Nor do they need to see you playing at 11am........ on Wednesday....... while you're still in the office.....
---
60 people? That is supposed to be impressive?
---
The state of retail really is sad. I'm sorry so many people didn't get to experience Ironforge or the AQ release in Vanilla. 60 people.....lol.
---
I don’t think they ever merged servers because it looks bad PR-wise. And now they don’t feel a need to as they have their cross-server tech.
---
Lag has nothing to do with your computer. It's either your internet connection or Blizz servers.
---
&gt; Bear in mind that the epic warlock mount isn't actually that much cheaper at all.
---
True. But Epic mount + Lock / Pally mount is going to be something like 1,500g. So either just get epic now for 900g, wait and get class for 650g. For me, it means I won't be getting my charger. Why spend an extra 650g for nothing?
---
Nor when I'm taking sick days in lieu of holidays.
---
see you on fresh
---
Plot Twist: He meets his future wife on Classic.
---
Sharding is everything that vanilla or in this case, classic isnt.
---
As they themselves stated, they're trying to create as authentic version of vanilla as possible.
---
That’s an oxymoron, but I know what you mean. :)
---
You could do a lot in this fashion by re-using content already made to create a “Classic Plus” server type.
---
Limiting it to capitals is a terrible idea, just join both channels and put it in a separate chat window. Done!
---
If I remember rightly though, you could jump to avoid the damage ticks and be perfectly safe. You could also enter MC by swimming around to the bottom of the little window which was another easy get out clause 
---
I played back in the day so I don't need you to be condesending to me. The way retail works right now with sharding its very unlikely to reach the numbers of classic in one area (AQ event and such) as sharding controls player populations in shards.
---
But it doesn't take many braincells to realise that 2019 server hardware would be more than capable, espically when sharding is turned off for classic. Sharidng causes lag due to how virtualisation is handled.
---
But yeah, you stay on your high horse.
---
Except for the tiny detail that it's not possible to get the Skeletal Steeds for Orcs and Trolls at that point in the game anyway because there's no way to become exalted with UC before cloth turn-in quests are implemented.
---
Agreed on the looks though. Playing Alliance, I'll have to keep my fingers crossed for Deathcharger instead :p I might as well hope for Hogger dropping Ashkandi.
---
That's crossrealm stuff, which will not exist, There will only ever be one BigDick69 visible, since you're on Chromaggus, and only planing with other players on Chromaggus, and the name BigDick69 is already taken.
---
l'll kill you! Thats where I list every enchant I can do and categorize every green I've ever picked up for peoples examination. No one cares that LittleTimmy needs a grp for BFD just BUY MY SHIT!
---
They weren't hard in a decent group, but with pugs that wasn't always the case. For example, in Grim Batol if you had really bad DPS you might be unable to finish because the last boss would keep hatching the eggs forever. And it turns out... there are some really bad DPS out there. People lost their shit over it, leading to massive nerfs to heroics not too long into Cata.
---
at least 50% of the reason i bought a gaming laptop last week was because classic WoW is coming out and I don't want to miss playing it. I travel too much to use my desktop and basically haven't been gaming at all for a year or so. I started WoW in late TBC and always wished i had a chance to see the original raids in their full, difficult glory. So excited.
---
The sharding you described would mean sharding everywhere, but Blizzard already stated that sharding would only occur in a very limited matter like on launch in starter zones and only for a limited time.
---
agreed
---
You might be giving a limited number away for free, but the [WoW Speed Running Discord](https://discord.gg/w8ttZZF) is always free, unlimited, and we have a Classic server up where we're anxiously awaiting launch so we can attack the game head on.
---
If the release isn't a horrible laggy mess, is it the true Vanilla experience?
---
Wasn't there also a pvp arena in Gadgetzan? 
---
I used to duel low level players on the zeppelin outside of orgrimmar and right before it left i would fear them off and make them miss it lmao. Oh to be 16 again
---
Ooh yeah. Guess I'm not thinking.
---
I have done every bracket of twinking and 49 is my favorite, followed by 39. 
---
Reason why i enjoy 49 is because most classes has their key abilities and talents and they also have their armor unlocked. 
---
I have had 49 twink mage, warlock, rogue, paladin, shaman and warrior. Twinked both in Vanilla, TBC and Wrath. 
---
I always felt it was fun to min/max at 49 as some of the gear you can get with 1.12 itemization in BRD for example is pretty nutty and also with ZG enchants and the likes you can get to a char that reaches absurd power levels. Probably comparable to full green lvl 60 vs full nax gear. 
---
I have one shot plenty of people with fireball crit on my mage. Even twinks get to the point where their damage output is so high that they can blow up other twinks very effectively and it really resembles lvl 60 PvP alot once you reach that point. I mean i have crit for 3k+ on fireball at 49 - which looks really awesome. 
---
One of my friends also twinked at 49 and we usually made duo's, so he had about 6 or 7 twinks also and i can say that amongst us we twinked out all twinkable classes and they all do very well at 49. Balance wise i think 49 is the best for twinking and you won't go wrong with any class - it is more a matter of playstyle and what you find fun.  
---
I’d like to see that bank after a few months at 60
---
lol top secret leveling guide.
---
I don't get the point. If you made something cool just post it somewhere. Why are you hyping up a stupid leveling guide?
---
I’m just going to have to have less sleep that’s all...
---
&gt; I gave a lower 30s warrior a boe axe I found free of charge. A couple of days later I saw him in trade chat trying to sell it :( 
---
Should have given it to a Paladin/Enhancement Shaman. Just help the warrior with his lvl 30 quest to get Whirlwind Axe/Sword/Mace
---
[http://classicdb.ch/?item=6975](http://classicdb.ch/?item=6975)
---
The problem is that we have no evidence of them handling large numbers of players without sharding. 
---
You can talk about how simple/easy it would be to make it so, but until we actually see it in action (or at least have it confirmed by Blizzard) it is a legitimate concern.
---
I didn't play vanilla WoW back in the day. But on Nostalrius I played a fury warrior at release during the pre-raid gear rush. I ran a bunch of UBRS with my guild, and finally won Truestrike Shoulderpads. This other Rogue in my groups/guild just starts cussing me out and shouting about how it's unfair for a warrior to win the shoulderpads over a Rogue and dude quits the guild.
---
That was a pretty spectacular meltdown.
---
I'm in my mid 30s with a good job, living with gf in our apt, and to this day my mother texts my gf about her recurring nightmares that I've become a full-blown WoW addict and my life is going down the gutter.
---
Oh boy wait until they hear the news.
---
&gt; 3 scarab lords on one server
---
Totally possible in actual vanilla, so it isn't even something to "deal" with.
---
I can’t remember the og blue PvP set specifically (I remember the lvl 58 requirement but can’t remember if it got bumped to 60 or not when they buffed it), 
---
I do remember that even the og PvP blue set was better then valor (tier 0).
---
Again depending on how much you are willing to raid /5 man/etc and how gear progression is released, your options will vary, but PvP blue set is a good goal and you can multitask it while grinding av rep for the unstoppable force.
---
3, no triple repeating letters either
---
There are no game rules about ninja looting. You can 100% stop it from happening by using ML. 
---
You're not breaking any game rules when the boss dies, loot is on FFA and you take all the loot. 
---
Yeah anybody that has had a large fight in retail knows this. 
---
Even battleground instances designed for 40v40 have problems. 
---
If allocating more resources fixed the problem you'd think Blizzard would have stable bg instances?
---
Bruh
---
.. 
---
You entitled much?
---
Haha that's great! Too bad people probably won't be noobish enough to pull that on this time around. Also, the game even let's you put BOP items in a trade window?
---
It’s lookingforgroup. It’s the only official channel. 
---
Yeah that's probably why he was trying to sell it haha. I had no experience with warrior at the time so I didn't know about the whirlwind axe being a thing unfortunately. He could have passed on it or given it back at least :/
---
Yes, so you can get them enchanted.  
---
Yeah sharding has been proposed for the starting zones only for a limited period of time.
---
People ignore those facts so they can bitch on reddit.
---
Mithril isn't in the starting zones
---
Not really true even a little bit.....the entire US gov't runs Sept30-Oct1 for example.  Why would you make such an obviously incorrect claim?
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year
---
Let me paint a picture for you. You see a mining/herb node. But there’s mobs between you and the node. So you begin attacking the mobs. You finally pull that last mob between you and the node. 
---
What do you see? Another player stealing your node.
---
**Fiscal year**
---
A fiscal year (or financial year, or sometimes budget year) is the period used by governments for accounting and budget purposes, which varies between countries. It is also used for financial reporting by business and other organizations. Laws in many jurisdictions require company financial reports to be prepared and published on an annual basis, but generally do not require the reporting period to align with the calendar year (1 January to 31 December). Taxation laws generally require accounting records to be maintained and taxes calculated on an annual basis, which usually corresponds to the fiscal year used for government purposes.

No it definitely wont happen this time around. I'm not sure if you can anymore. They used to allow it back then because that's how players would enchant your items. 
---
It's not about computers, it's the servers that can't handle it.
---
During large fights people will experience more and more latency on abilities/movement, until it gets to the point where you're basically perma-stunned and the server crashes.
---
RemindMe! 8 months "so who's salty now ? :p"
---
Not to be a downer but I still have my troll rogue from vanilla and it doesn't really mean much to me, I can't log on that character and play vanilla with them anymore, none of my old friends from vanilla still play and even if we all did play again we'd be playing retail which is a completely different game. I think it's best to just enjoy what you're doing when you're doing it more than anything else.
---
To be fair, it's quite possible he didn't know he could get a great weapon if he got help doing the Whirlwind quest.
---
Still a massively inconsiderate move trying to sell a BoE you got from someone in your guild.
---
You'll be out of the starting zones fast so you don't need to worry about that.

Ah, here we have a Wikipedia warrior. Get lost buddy. 
---
It's seriously the dumbest, low IQ move anyone can pull in chat. I just add anyone that does it to my ignore list.
---
Me and two IRL-friends leveled together in Westfall. We had all gotten some quest for Deadmines and grouped to do it, happily thinking that 3 lvl 16 could do a dungeon. Oh and we were all dps ofc. 
---
Anyway, as we made our way down to the instance we saw something fantastic! Two players stood idly next to a treasurechest, not opening it!! A TREASURE CHEST!!! Thinking the other two players hadn’t seen the chest yet, one in our gang ran for it, ignoring the strange phrase ”roll 4 it dude” the two players said over and over again (clearly they were broken somehow). As he opened the chest and linked the Malachite he had found within we couldn’t understand our luck!!! We were rich!! Incredibly rich!!! 
---
But sadly there was no ”we” in ”malachite”... our friend refused to split the immense winnings we all saw coming. As the two, broken, players seemingly got stuck doing the /spit and /fart emotes, a Shakespearean drama unfolded in partychat. Minutes later our party was no more and van cleef could live safely a little while longer. 
---
Correct, my post was higlighting the reason not to use sharding in general.  I even stated I'm fine with it being used in starting zones.
---
The OP wasn't sure what sharding was, and the reasons why players didn't want sharding were covered for the most part, except for this aspect, so I was filling him in on why many people are against it outside of the starting areas.
---
Live by myself with a really good job I was lucky enough to get. Work 10 hrs a day Mon-Fri, weekends off and at 23 y/o. With no other things to do besides play WoW and work out in my off.. I haven’t let anyone know about it yet besides my brother, who is also going to be playing Classic with me.  There is no way I’ll be telling my boss or co workers what I will be doing in my off time come Classic. Maybe the dark bags around my eyes from the late nights grinding won’t throw up some red flags for them lol. 
---
I’m afraid I’ll easily become addicted to the game. My friend wanted me to play on a P Server with him last week and I agreed. It was a very fast leveling server and well, started on Wednesday and was 60 on Friday. Stayed up from 9am on Saturday to Sunday at 9pm.. 36 hours playing. It was incredibly fun even with all of the bugs and problems with the server. I told myself yesterday I would not get back on that server and save it for Classic go release. Been thinking about it since. Rolled Dwarf Pally btw on there btw. 
---
TL:DR Have a lot of time to play in my life rn at a young age. Only told my brother and he understands. Work will definitely not understand, and I will not be telling them about Classic. 
---
Not sure if it's the biggest dick move but stealing other peoples songflower always gets them angry &gt;:)
---
A lot of things are possible, but most of them are not "legitimate concern".
---
And this is just fearmongering.
---
I hate it when people know you're going for a chest in the wild, they'll wait until you pull the last mob(s) surrounding it and then run in and take it.
---
Luckily as a hunter you can dismiss your pet beforehand and use feign death to reverse this on them when you see them waiting. Little more satisfying.
---
OP said they didn't know what sharding was full stop, I was just explaining it in full for general info purposes 
---
Okay, so what does retail have to do with classic? their servers aren't going to be the same, it's not like classic will be an extension of retail servers.
---
As a priest, I get sniped pretty bad by paladins so I can't imagine what druids go through healing LOL
---
All very strong solo, and mage is as well.
---
Don't listen to these nerds. Find a woman in WoW and spend time with her walking thr beaches of Darkshore and watching the sunset over the hills of Azshara. Remember, World of Warcraft is a feeling. Games are the most important thing you will do with your life. Everything else is secondary. 
---
The dream 
---
You know... I think you’re right. Wtf was I even considering?
---
Absolutely. I almost gave up on my rogue at 26, but decided to push forward. At 30 everything became so much easier due to talents + new skills and now I'm at 47.  
---
Safe to say, every class has some tipping point, after which everything becomes more enjoyable.
---
That doesn’t mean they are extremely difficult.
---
That's a bot you fucking dingus.
---
I remember playing wow with 2gb ram. Fml.
---
Whatever you say, dude. 
---
Mankrik?!
---
It won't be new because online world's have become standard and open world is a common game model. But it'll also be better in the sense that I legit quit WoW so long ago I never got to experience it with a beast of a computer. I've always disconnected and lagged out in av,mc,world PvP. I just kind of ventured.
---
Did I say 10K like ever? Why are you pulling numbers out of your head? 
---
I have an actual business degree.   I also work in an actual corporate environment as a gov't ctr and know what I'm talking about.  The entire govt I work with is Sept.-Oct, and I don't know a *single person* in a single company involving govt work or otherwise that does April1-April1.   
---
Sorry you're offended that you're wrong...but you are *absolutely* incorrect.  I only provided wikipedia as a quick backup reference, so basically fuck off with preaching your ignorance as fact.
---
Hahahaha yup.
---
Well could just jump off and hit the small ledge all the way at the bottom causing instant death due to fall damage.
---
Biggest accomplishment, finally got this night vision thing!
---
Idk I feel like you could sweeping strikes whirlwind all those guys down quick. It’s not the most efficient, but pulling 40g per hour out of a reset without going into the open world is pretty chill. I haven’t done it enough to see what my real rate would be tho so maybe this number is inflated. Guess it depends on how lucky u r with herbs and lasher trash
---
Im playing in one of the worst populated realms and its killing me. The world feels dead and we badly need a merge that never comes.
---
Sad.
---
I played 40v40 battlegrounds in BfA. This is nonsense. No lag.
---
The only problem was the "rush the boss" meta, and when the battle started and all those particle effects assaulted my GPU.
---
This isn't fear-mongering, you're just being wilfully ignorant about player concerns.
---
Retail lags in wpvp fights, sometimes the servers crash because of it and it's a very disappointing experience. We do not want this in Classic because the wpvp is much more significant in comparison to retail.
---
[Here](https://youtu.be/CvG7VKwJb20?t=638) is a developer Q&amp;A mentioning it as a concern, "top priority" and also mentioning that they don't have an easy fix for server stability. 
---
If we want to have an "authentic" vanilla experience, the server needs to be able to handle similar sized fights.
---
Only your game friends seem like nice people to me. 
---
If you actually did play retail you would know how bad the modern blizzard servers are at handling large, dense populations. It’s not a secret, the wow servers haven’t been designed to handle high density in many years, because sharding always solves it before it becomes an issue. 
---
It doesn’t mean that the modern blizzard servers are bad, it just means they’re designed for something else. 
---
No one has said that the server technology doesn’t exist today, but I guess you used that mainly as a chance to insult people you don’t agree with. 
---
What’s an efficient speed? ik U can only do 5 per hour if ur just doing lashers. I know on my sham I can def do that before an hour. Made around 40g so it wasn’t too bad for solo chill n smoke n farm lol. 
---
During a duel I mind controlled somebody off a ledge to their death before and they ‘reported me’ to my guild master. It was funny because it was a dude and his wife, and I was 18 years old and drunk 🤷🏻‍♂️ 
---
GamerDads unite!
---
I'll be looking for a casual leveling guild too.
---
Can't they just stress test with bots?
---
ZOMG50DAYSPLAYEDTOLVL60WTFBBQ!!!!!
---
I’m not too upset about it if it’s just 1-10. I’m thinking there will be more people than blizzard is anticipating, which could make later areas require sharding in their eyes. Plus, server stability is more stable than Vanilla, but it’s capacity is lower. I hope not though.
---
Retail uses sharding. For the layman, you can think of this as a bunch of little servers (not a lot of resources). Those servers also have more network communication going on (which means more overhead). By contrast, Vanilla servers were singular, and IIRC had dedicated blades per continent. This means a SHIT TON of resources, plus no overhead from the excess comms.
---
Finally, Vanilla came out in 2004. CPUs in 2008 were clocking around 2ghz. My desktop CPU clocks at 4 right now. So not only is new hardware almost twice the clock speed, but the per clock processing has also increased
---
TLDR: thinking tech that ran fine in 2004 wont run even better in 2019 on faster hardware. Thats your OMEGALUL
---
&gt; There will be no loot shop. Everything we find will be purely skill or luck and we can show our mounts and gear off now like we actually earned it and no one will question it. 
---
Until tokens are put in classic. Its inevitable. :D 
---
Blizzard will do their own "promotion tour" on various mediums closer to release. Everyone involved in the gaming world will hear about it.
---
To be fair, if they see that its probably because they are also playing at 11 am on a Wednesday while still in the office.
---
I did like it a lot. It was my last expansion actually. However, there were things I didn't like... 4 difficulties, much sharding etc. 
---
Well, the game is launching on a 7.3 interface, so, I'm sorry bro
---
roflmao :) honesty is the king
---
By not being addicted.  Taking care of my real life responsibilities, getting enough sleep, spending time with family, and still pwning newbs and raiding. Have some self control.
---
People trying to monopolise the AH by buying out all of 1 item and then hiking the price dramatically, when you really need said item. 
---
It does make a difference, specially in BGs
---
Wow is on life support at this stage.  Blizz should focus on what made the game successful in the first place.  I understand the technical reasons for sharding, but it sucks for the game itself.  Time to find another solution.
---
Reminds me of my guild application in TBC to my first real raiding guild.
---
I was eager to do well, so I researched the *hell* out of how to maximize Rogue DPS.  I was only in Kara gear, heroic 5-man epics, and PvP purples, but I squeezed every fraction of a DPS I could out of that gear set.  I really wanted to impress this new guild.
---
They took me into Hyjal with them, along with 3 other Rogues who were full-fledged members.  These 3 Rogues were in full T4/T5 gear from having raided for a while, but it turns out they weren't the greatest players.  They would screw around on raid nights, not take enchants and gems and consumables seriously, and kinda half-ass their DPS as a whole.  Apparently one of them had even been warned about this several times in the past, having actually shown up to raids in his PvP spec and really just not taken things seriously.
---
Well, we get to Anetheron (the 1st or 2nd Hyjal boss), down him in ~2 tries, and the [Blade of Infamy](https://tbc-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=30881) drops.  I was still super new to raiding and didn't have Damage Meters installed yet, but turns out I, as an applicant in crappy gear, had out-damaged all 3 of their main Rogues on both attempts, as well as on the other fights.  Aforementioned PvP Rogue got all excited at finally getting his Blade of Infamy, but the guild's loot council gave it to me instead and invited me to the guild on the spot.  Other Rogue raged and raged and gquit, but apparently it was kind of a "good riddance" moment from ~20 of the other raiders, and they all welcomed me with open arms.
---
It took all of a month for them to make me Rogue class lead.
---
Hi, /u/jojopixi

TLDR: sharding infrastructure introduces a lot of overhead. Vanilla doesnt have this overhead. End of thread.
---
Not sure if classic will mirror private servers but my suggestions for you are:
---
* Start your own groups. Sounds like "duh" but it's easier even starting with just you spamming for LFM
---
* Ask for Blessing of Salvation from a pally and try to group with them for 5 mans
---
* Try to make friends with a tank who is patient and waits for mana, marks targets, and is careful pulling
---
* Find Ret Paladins and healer druids who have trouble finding groups and get them together. SS the paladin.
---
* Mages always help a group with a variety of stuff plus you can summon, mage can portal, mage makes water, you can both CC
---
Thanks for repeating what I already said. 
---
I already pointed out large dense populations in one area don't happen anymore because of sharding.My original reply was to someone claiming 40v40 (As common as these are) is a lag-fest when it is not true.
---
 Stress testing the servers I support 100%, but the idea 2019 servers would even be inferior to 2004 is hilarious.
---
I actually have yet to run into someone who I thought was botting, which I'm surprised by, but I know they're out there. I think leveling will feel very similar when Classic drops, but the crowds in early zones will subside as more people progress.
---
I know, I was just explaining what connected servers were to the person above.
---
Did someone say... FRESH!
---
I assumed thats what you wanted since others who have mentioned 2.5K is too little want that kind of numbers. Appatently not you.
---
I never understood this mentality. You rather stay on a server full of factual errors and custom solutions that never was in vanilla. Out of a sense of nostalgia over vanilla?
---
This is all wishful thinking. For all you know it will progress to tbc, or progress through custom content, or shut down, or merge into another server... we really have no idea what the future will bring for classic servers so enjoy it while you can.
---
Sharding isnt being used for load purposes in Classic. Its so 600 people arent trying to kill the same mottled boars in valley of trials. So past the starting zones, everything should run fine, because there is no sharding, and we have had 14 years of hardware improvements.
---
I plan to main a lock and have never had one past lvl 30. After watching a guide on how to acquire the Epic mount for lock i think I'll just buy one of the standard wolves (Orc). I don't care too much about having the class mount at this point, but perhaps when im 60 i might feel like it's worth it. Wolves are my favirite mount anyway, so it's nbd to me. I did get the paladin epic mount because that shit is awesome, especially compared to the lvl 40 pally mount
---
&gt; U can only do 5 per hour if ur just doing lashers
---
You're thinking about it the wrong way.
---
Sure, you can only do 5 per hour...but does that mean it's pointless to go fast? No, you still have to think about actual real-life time spent playing.
---
I can do 5 clears in approximately 20 minutes on my Paladin. That means in gameplay time, I can do 15 clears in an hour, not just 5.
---
They’re going to use the current servers they have now that is running bfa, you will just be logging into a classic server. The best way to test this is to have a bunch of people contest zones on bfa because it’s the exact server hardware they’re running. You won’t even get a classic launcher you just launch wow through the app and choose classic server browser like when you choose oceanic realms. 
---
What the hell does this have to do with entitlement? I don't even play Alliance.
---
Women smell desperation like a great white smells blood and it dries them up faster then a puddle in Death Valley. When you actively stop looking for one they flock to you. Don't bathe or groom yourself and play WoW as much as you want. Wear a fake wedding ring while restocking on hot pockets and mnt dew to make them think someone else wanted you already. Follow my advice you'll be knee deep in kitty before you know it. Or elbow deep depending on the woman.....
---
If my Orc Warlock (female) is going to farm gold to buy the epic mount, I'm also going to farm rep to buy either the Raptor or Undead steed.  Don't get me wrong, I love the Riding Worgs, but the the epic riding raptor and undead steed are just so cool!  Now I just have to decide which.  Of course trolls would be easier to get the rep with since you get so much rep questing in Durator/Barrens to begin with as Orc.  Getting the undead rep would be alot of turn ins...but if I can farm the rep and gold at the same time, maybe not so bad.
---
Well, vanilla isn't BfA, so what is your point?
---
SM / Ruin for warlocks is great for PVE and PVP (great for solo content too)
---
When you poop your pants thinking there was only a fart coming. 
---
I don’t get why they can’t just slowly keep adding more raids, more 5 mans with slightly better gear and keep the level cap at 60. Seems like people put crazy amounts of time into getting slightly better stuff.
---
Take up alcoholism and a drug habit, that way you can start playing wow and not worry that it will deter potential partners. They will already be put off 
---
Lol i guess I might be desperate, I meant it mornelike I’m enjoying the adventures of dating and finding a potential wife, and it’s been a good time without any good video games to play. But I will invest in a fake wedding ring and test this theory my reddit comrade. Then enjoy WoW.  
---
You took such a small detail out of the post and made such a kind comment.
---
Good on you man, love this subreddit.
---
Cocaine has gotten me a lot more luck than you’d think. 
---
Blizz has zero incentive to merge.  They would rather charge your $15 for the "service".
---
The most exciting part for me, is a fresh start everyone has 0gold level 1. the race is on again. i love first day of xpacks.
---
Yeah but there is a small little slot on the bottom that's separate from the other spaces and says something like "not traded" next to it for enchanting items.
---
Drunk women love free cocaine 
---
I don't have any friends or family so I don't give a fuuuuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
---
Yet every expansion launch is a disaster due to the massive number of people logging in at the same time.

Well I mean he specifically said 40 people in one shard makes it unstable but I haven’t experienced that maybe he just plays on a potato. 
---
I guess my post should be: is giving up the club life worth it to lead a family friendly classic wow life? The life of a meager traveler bracing the unknowns of a bright and beautiful world whilst fending off disastrous threats with fellow dragon slayers. Or fuck that and get bitches and money? 
---
I created a discord last week to try and collect other parents. Maybe not a guild but at least a little community of mums and dads to level with etc.  https://discord.gg/eq75evx
---
all of us here know what really matters. everyone else is missing out.
---
30/0/21 shaman. Very good for raids and premade. Only down side is no mana tide
---
This and a million times this...
---
Hunter is versatile with all three specs. I maimed marks in Legion and it was fun/strong in pvp and pve. It’s kinda boring in BfA but still viable for both content. BM is strong in both but a little too simple. You press the same three buttons and do retarded damage. I’m currently Manning survival as it’s the least boring imo, more buttons/choices. It’s okay in pve and pretty strong in pvp. I do both actively and have no problem as a Surv hunter

The servers simply cannot handle large fights without heavy lag.
---
&gt; I used to sit in the barrens and advertise selling a BOP Staff for 8 Gold, back then no one knew what Bop was so when people would want to buy it **i would put it in the do not trade tab** and they would trade me the gold. They would realize that they did not receive the staff and i would just say it must have been a bug because i never received the gold either. 
---
I have bolded the part of the original comment that you must've missed.
---
I'll be playing a Warrior mostly running 5/10 mans at 60, maybe with the occasional pug Ony or MC.  Planning on something like this 31/5/15 build to both tank and PvP with:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BSczf9AEATAD8ASg
---
Do both, come home bang out a few lines and level up. Not as if you’ll be sleeping anyway 😂
---
You know this is the classic sub right?
---
u/Myrdok is not a bot lol which is who u/daeVC responded to
---
It's when you try to Fard and a little bit of Shid comes out instead...
---
I legitimately think I played more wow than I did anything. Given, I was like 14 and couldn’t drive yet, but I remember losing body mass because I legitimately would forget to eat (the only food that delivered was pizza and I didn’t have a debit card yet). It definitely filled the void of any time not spent occupied and smart phones weren’t a thing yet.
---
I legitimately would skip meals then just choooowwww down during school. turns out WoW was the reason I discovered intermittent fasting and also the reason I got attractive enough to chase girls and get some of them.
---
Thanks wow. You ruined my life but also made it better. I hope you can do that same again because my BMI is back up a little bit.
---
+1 for karma.

If bgs are not out before DM ill probably just wait for the quest. The difference between 60 and 100% travel time isnt a big deal once done questing and you have all the flight paths. Spend a few minutes riding to an instance, spend an hour or two running it, maybe resetting and doing it again. So shave off maybe a minute every couple hours really not a big deal. Things change when BGs come out.
---
&lt;Beep-Boop&gt;  Yes...not a bot.....carry on fellow human....&lt;boop-beep&gt;
---
Will do
---
As is solemn tradition.
---
They Do not.
---
i convinced a noob that a few Dark Iron Scraps could be used to put armor on his horse so he would never get knocked off it. Sold them to him through the trade channel for like 50g
---
Recent expansions have gotten pretty good at that, no? Besides, stress testing won't magically solve everything. Many launch problems are so fundamental that there is no good solution to them.
---
Oo thanks, will take a look tonight! :)
---
I WAS HERE. Drop date confirmed May 7th. 
---
I sure do hope that they are not going to add expansions to the classic servers which cause the azeroth population to bleed to death and all the people gather around only in the "new part".
---
I'd rather seem them do it like OSRS and keep on making new content for the " old"  world.
---
I don't deny those dead servers need some love from blizzard, just wondering if "hey you should just merge those dead servers and it'll be just fine" is really a good solution, since blizzard already has the tech and seems to not use it because of player feedback.
---
Hahahaha yeh, wth 😂
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
To counter this: If you are expecting someone to ninja your node as a prot warrior you are fairly hard to dismount. So you run around the node and gather up the mobs and run off. Wait for them to drop combat. Follow them back and let them aggro the node thief, and take the node as they deal with the mobs. 
---
I intend to treat it like my sexual predilections.  Those who need to know, will know, and the only ones who will need to know are the ones I'm seeing naked, or want to see naked.
---
Only thing that’s guaranteed is you being an annoying irrelevant rat.
---
I have a 2 letter character name. Na.  Used to have Nu too, but lost it because of their bs policy of deleting names due to inactivity =/
---
 Yeah, things have been pretty good for months now.  Maybe theres less people playing, though especially on the higher pop server i was playing on the last week or two...i mean, things were smooth, and there were loads of people around.
---
Granted, i havent done any 40v40 or 80v80 wpvp battles in months.
---
When will the raid lockout reset? Weekday and time.
---
What is the first day of the raiding week?
---
Been a while since I've played, but remember how entering Maraudon had players drop down into a pool of water? 
---
A shaman could park outside of the instance and cast water walking on players as they ran through the entrance. If you listened closely, you could almost hear the sound of a hard thud against the now solid surface inside. 
---
As people have said, we're getting a modern client, but I'm pretty sure people in the demo said it ran better than the 1.12 client. It's been improved since 1.12 the reason legion/BFA is harder to run is because the textures are better, there's more polygons in every model and there's just way more graphical detail in the game. I think you're good mate. 
---
The biggest difference is that private servers have very, very insular and fragmented communities.  The english speaking, russian speaking, and chinese speaking communities don't really interact.  You might be on a server with 10,000 people, but more than half won't group with you, and 3/4 won't speak your language fluently.
---
If it is, it shouldn't be. Despite their reputation, druids are still the second best tanks, the only other tank with a taunt, and can easily hold their own in all non-raid environments. If you wanna tank druid and don't have time or not interested in raiding, there is nothing wrong with it. Some even swear that they are better tanks in a 5 man than warriors.
---
But they are also awesome healers. The only healer that can stealth. 
---
Can't speak for the dps portion as I'm not privy on their performance there, but they're still fantastic.
---
I'm going to roll one eventually.
---
2 kids dieing because 2 dead beat parents ganking lowbies in redridge.
---
There were issues earlier in BfA, and it was quite often bad...especially if you were playing in warmode and there was a massive pvp battle going on.  I used to run with a group that would do 40 (sometimes 80) man raids vs other groups of the same size, and there were times it got really, really bad.  Like...im talking 30 seconds for the server to catch up kind of bad.
---
It had nothing to do with my PC.  I still had pretty good FPS, and the in game latency even displayed as fine (it always takes a while to catch up on really bad lag like that), everything else was fine as far as internet goes, etc.
---
You don't need it.  During leveling, Void Sac is so strong...especially if you have the speed summon talent...basically double bubble....you will be surviving just fine.  The only reason I could see you wanting it is if there are too many players higher level than you and you're just getting killed all the time.  The only other time it's good is at 60 when you're going up against players who greatly out gear you.
---
Seems well earned. For both players. :)
---
" There is a reason why every rank 13-14 horde shadow priest chooses undead " -- Yes, and that reason is ***models***. According to your argument, most Warlocks and Rogues R13-14 on PServers should be Orcs. While in reality they are 90%+ Undeads. Almost nobody but an ultra minority of redditers Min-max racials for PvP, it's a completely new trend I personally cannot even understand. Same goes for alliance. Should be way more PvP dwarf hunters than Night Elves because of Stoneform, right ? Right ..? Well, turns out it's still like 75-25 stat. People just like the looks and the lore, and chose their class acording to that at the end of the day.
---
By the way, I'd also like to point out I didn't say DP is shit :(  It's just overrated IMO, and troll "*Priest racials*" are veeery good yet completely overlooked. That was the point of my comment, I didn't mean anything else :(
---
" You won't be stacking spirit as a priest in PvP. " -- Certainly right, I didn't mean that either. It's fairly clear that Spirit is the least useful PvP stat in the game, no matter the class. But Shadow PvP gear is hard to get as a priest, so a good chunk of your gear's probably gonna be itemized for "normal" Priests anyway. I mean that's what I meant in my comment, but it's indeed my fault I didn't phrase it properly. 
---
I know this one guy who dropped out of school at 14 to play WoW all day. He didn't get a job until he was 18 because he was playing WoW the whole time. He was an encyclopedia of random information though, because he'd delve into wikipedia while waiting for raids and bgs to pop. 
---
He turned down a free vacation because his guild was progressing through naxx and he didn't want to miss out on DKP.  
---
Ended up starting his 'life' after Cata ruined everything, went to school, did all that stuff, just a bit later.
---
So basically 14-20 for him was the ideal way to live your life. 
---
Also, that guy is me. You may not like it, but that was what peak performance looked like.
---
Jokes on you, my cats love it when I don't leave the house.
---
Well just built my PC... I7 8700k, gtx 1080ti, 32g 3200 ram.... 4k 144hz monitor... Hope it works.
---
" So...priests and paladins can dispel magic including lock DoTs right " -- No, not all of them. There are different types of Warock DoTs. Priests and Paladins cannot remove Warlock curses, they can dispell only Corruption and SL, which are Magic effects. 
---
I was occasionally guilty of this.
---
Good on you!  Nice to see you got rewarded for hard work and seniority didn't just take it.
---
No, it's not. 
---
You're under the impression that I give a shit mate, I really don't. 
---
Pretty sure WoW saved my life. All of my highschool friends were getting into heavier drugs and skipping classes while I was listening to podcasts and leveling alts.
---
Maybe if I start playing again it'll prevent me from drinking myself to death.
---
Who wouldn’t like a sentient meme generator?
---
I understand that. I would take the chaos of it any day tho, part of the experience.
---
WTF is a back round?  Do they mean background?  I don't know
---
Druid HotW spec. Good enough tank for 5mans, good enough healer for 5mans and raids (unless hardcore, where you will miss moonglow or swiftmend and the 10% healing talent) and the best PvP spec for small skirmishes.
---
They do have a choice: incompetence. Make no mistake, activision blizzard have that in stock. Hoping for the best, preparing for the worst is very much the mentality to adopt when it comes to dealing with them in this day and age.
---
&gt;I know my character I make will always be there. My progression will not be for nothing.
---
.&gt;Roll on a random PvP server even though you played RPPvP in retail Vanilla.
---
.&gt;6 months later, Ion finally releases an RPPvP server.
---
.&gt;Most of your guild rerolls on the *fresh* RPPvP server they wanted to roll on in the first place, you reroll and your 6 months of effort is abandoned.
---
"My progression will not be for nothing"
---
Speak for yourself :(
---
Ah fellow rogue! What race were you?
---
Lol I also was basically full bloodfang too riding the piece of crap undead horse till tbc. Had 6/8 BF and 7/8 NS and a few off pieces from AQ40. 
---
Yeah I think the same for gathering professions for the start. I'm rererolling a rogue again but this time gonna do leatherworking and skinning and I'll just do another alt for herbalism alchemy to supply my own fadeleaf and eventually raid pots 
---
There is only so much of the experience that your personal pc is responsible for. If the server you are playing on is not able to handle things, none of your specs will matter.
---
Prot/holy paladin and feral/resto druid. 
---
I think it'll surprise many people when they login to classic, people who havent played vanilla before will realise, that leveling is BIG part of the content vanilla or in this case, classic offers.
---
I personally cant wait for the leveling process and I have absolutely no rush to 60.
---
It is being build from the ground up tho and bugs are most certainly gonna be present. A playtesting will help alleviate those bugs before launch.
---
To be extremely clear: Just because they bug-fixed vanilla (eventually anyway) dont mean classic wont have those same or all together different bugs at all. It *needs* testing.
---
The best strategy for dealing with him is disarming. Partying up with a riposte rogue makes him a complete cakewalk.
---
The westfall music is so incredibly soothing and I don't know why. Super relaxing.
---
1. Will Blizzard put membership bonds in Classic? 
---
2. Do you need to buy the base game to play Classic, or is a sub all you need? 
---
3. What armor reduction debuffs stack on bosses? Do Sunder Armor, Expose Armor, Faerie Fire, and Curse of Recklessness all stack? 
---
As I’ve heard it she’s disabled and needs Zach to take care of her.  So WoW probably enhanced her quality of life where for most of us we intentionally let ours slip sometimes.  This video is still hard to watch for me.
---
As a Priest i can recommend 33/18/0. Works well in PvP and PvE, mages and warlocks sometimes pay you to cast PI on them at raid encounters :)
---
I think you are on track with your thought process. I would say that MS is one to always rank, as it does add good damage since you almost always use the ability every time it is off cooldown.  I would rank up charge, the extra 6 rage is super valuable particularly because it is at the beginning of the fight. Reducing that awkward time span where you charge in then have to auto attack’s a few times to generate rage for anything else and in general feel very lame.  It is the difference between getting that first MS off after 1 autoattack and 2 autoattakcs, whcich depending on weapon speed can be a big thing.  My two cents. Also make sure to get anger management talent. Best rage talent ability in the game.
---
It ached for me to stay in character all day yesterday and only say Kralnor things, but Kralnor never managed to clarify his famously obscure post, instead berating forum participants for having ever been confused. My above statement was not an original thought directed at you, but another verbatim line from Kralnor himself. 
---
Do check out the top link by Draakex below in order to elucidate for yourself this pop (sub)culture reference, and have an otherwise peaceable day now that April 1st is over... 
---
It would be better to go Ele/Resto...unless you want to carry around a bunch of gear with healing/spell power and a bunch of gear with strength/agil or whatever enhance uses...
---
Except if lag is the reason they're using sharding then it won't be contained to starter zones. If it's for the player experience then there's no problem with it. Blizzard hasn't been clear about what problem they need to solve with sharding. 
---
You should’ve played a hunter. 
---
Literally was just posted last week. 
---
That shyamalan ending was golden...
---
No, I’ll be getting a regular epic mount. 👍
---
At least Ele can use the healing gear and still work for farming and stuff.
---
Yes and, you know the worst part? I spelled it backround because I thought thats how you spell it. When I spell it like that it tells me I spelled it wrong though... I'm a horrible speller so I assumed the computer was right. Turns out this is the one word I did actually know how to spell :(
---
Like I said, I don't give a shit what he does with it. I don't play Alliance.
---
My point is that it's silly to monetize a 1-19 leveling guide for a 16 year old game, when a bunch of people have already done something similar and made it available for free.
---
Sunder armor and expose armor don't stack with each other. The rest do stack.
---
My first GM was using the enchant mats we were all contributing to the guild and was selling them to pay for his epic mount.
---
Bonus point for letting everybody think he was a girl IRL.
---
Shit raid leader without any authority too.
---
I gquited in the middle of a MC run were he started insulting everybody.
---
The first guild I was a member of fell apart rapidly because the guild leader of another became jealous of our recruiting and raiding success and started a hate campaign against our guild leader in order to try and bolster their own numbers.
---
Lots of drama followed and sadly our guild leader left the game entirely as their doctor warned them the stress could trigger a heart failure (he had other health complications).
---
I'd like to think society is less toxic these days but no less the whole affair put me off the idea of being a guild leader for life.
---
Both Legion and Bfa launches for me &amp; my friends were super smooth tbh. 
---
A very crucial thing you forget is that sharding will not be a thing. Making such zones packed an issue. Look at those retail big raids. It’s a mess.
---
You do though.. you told him to post it somewhere.
---
Kinda what he's doing.
---
The 1-19 is being given for free iirc. 
---
And the fuck does 16 year old game have anything to do with it? Open market. If people want it they'll buy it, why get wound up over it?
---
That being said I called out OP for weird ass third person self promoting on this sub, which I dislike. But turn the guide creator came in and that's who you responded too.
---
We always had a holy paladin off-tanking periodically spawning mobs with Righteous Fury + Blessing of Wisdom assignments until the real OT could peel them off. I think it lasted through most of classic that the mp5 gain threat would be credited back to the caster of BoW, which with RF meant a ton of aggro for that one. In some fights, it got to be too much threat, like at Nef, but it kept the squishier healers alive, even if they dropped massive heals just as the skeletons spawned.
---
Yep, but also this.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/bHbicf3.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/bHbicf3.jpg)
---
I would create lots of Blood Elf characters at TBC just to listen the Eversong Woods soundtrack. I enjoyed the first 10 levels so much.
---
That's a twist.  That's very twisty!
---
Oh yeah I did miss that. That explains everything, thanks.
---
Anyone can use it. Bear in mind that as a potion it shares a cooldown with other potions. So need to make a choice between it and other valuable potions. Health, mana, free action, limited invulnerability, etc.
---
?
---
So many of these moments in classic that make leveling up and gearing up special:
---
- first green
---
-first shoulders
---
-first blue
---
- getting rid of all your gray/white statless items
---
- first ring
---
- first necklace
---
- first helmet
---
- first full length (not stupid looking) cloak
---
- first helmet that doesn’t look dumb
---
- first trinket 
---
- first actually useful trinket
---
- first epic
---
-getting rid of your last green item
---
And then there’s the entire raid gear progression. 
---
If you are okay being a raid healer shamans are fine. If you are okay being a raid healer for a long time before you get the pay out of chucking some bad ass lighting they are great. How ever if you wanna hit sixty and do anything but heal raids for a while. Shamans are not so great.
---
Yeah, I know it's not needed. But being virtually invincible sounds fun! Double void sac is good. Double void sac with 40% damage reduction is better!
---
Something is wrong.
---
Yeah well I’m just browsing various ways a shaman could grind gold solo on my priv server shaman. He’s already max mining/engi so I can’t explore herbing at the moment. Do you know of any good solo spots? 
---
It’s kind of pointless to compare yourself doing 5 clears in 20 minutes if u just log off anyways. You’re just waiting for the lockout to expire so you end up yielding the same gold per hour. If you actually went and farmed somewhere else for 40 minutes then it makes sense. But ur just yielding the same amount of gold if all your doing is 5 clears and waiting. 
---
I think you don't understand the situation. Optimized hardware in 2019 would 100% be able to handle thousands of players in 1 location. But here's the issue: Blizzard has deliberately chosen hardware that can't handle it because they use sharding. Saves money.
---
If they decided to remove sharding from their servers, as they said they would post leveling zones, the servers will choke and die. So in that sense, yes, a 2005 server can and did handle population better than if we were to take a 2019 and throw 1,000+ people in 1 area.  Blizzard has to choose how they want handle that situation going forward (better hardware or sharding to save money), and you can bet the people in charge of money will choose the cheaper sharding option.
---
Holy paladin, holy/disc priest, resto druid, resto sham, sm/ruin lock, mm hunter, ret paladin, deep frost mage, shadow priest, ele sham.
---
It's from a recent reboot movie I think
---
Not very good on discord because I'm new to it. How do i find this one you're talking about? 
---
That's probably what they could have done, rather than implementing new mechanics &amp; maps every couple years.
---
Even if Blizzard chooses not to do this with Classic, it would be fun to see a community-based project that's eventually able to implement something like that. The nice thing about having Classic in Blizzard's hands is the ability to unity the community in a standard version of the game.

As a fresh 60 paladin planning on going holy 31 and debating between 20 prot or 20 ret...where are the best places, quests, etc for picking up a shield that will work for holy spec?  Will want one for occasional prot farming and PvP healing
---
I normally would, but since it’s Vanilla...
---
but when their girl is born, fuck women amirite? gamers rise up
---
This is a bad opinion
---
God damn these wrath babies....
---
This is some great advice for everyone who binge-plays games. Just a little thought into your health and fitness can go a long way. 
---
I agree and still think there should only be 2 difficulties. "Story mode" for casuals that want to experience the story and get a few cosmetics.. And then just the one difficulty for everyone else who wants to raid and do progression and gear. 
---
Played more Vanilla than you did
---
[Skeletons... skeletons everywhere](https://i.imgur.com/LXJJ9km.jpg)
---
And this was just one part, there were skeletons outside and once you went inside you would always see at least one skeleton at all times. Even in the small corridors. I kind of miss that sense of danger that keeps you engaged
---
IMO anything that takes away from being "forced" to be social is bad for the community.  I agree about trade spam being annoying, Blizzard could put in a global or city LFG channel (if it didn't exist, can't remember) as an alternative  
---
Well did you enjoy it? 
---
The 1st was yesterday.
---
I hope they come out with 'fresh' vanilla servers every couple of years. Maybe merge the old ones. Sort of like seasons.
---
Yeah! good point
---
Faxmonkey was the reason I created my third vanilla WoW level 60 mage, but by then, I'd invested so much time in my warrior and druid main/alt combo, that I never did get geared as well as Faxmonkey was during vanilla. I didn't start playing until vanilla WoW was at least a year old. 
---
With Classic on the horizon, plus my increased experience (played halfway into WotLK), I should be able to emulate this play style much better. As a warrior main who only liked pulling one MoB at a time, seeing a frost mage use freeze/chill effects to control entire batches and shatter mechanics to crit more often than not, I had instant class envy. 
---
This go-'round, I'll main mage first for later AoE farming in order to pay for my alt's college tuition.
---
I played a fury warrior in vanilla and honestly, its a real slippery slope once you start wearing leather instead of plate for more DPS.
---
No. 
---
WoW is not a sandbox game, its a themepark horizontal content doesn't really work like it does in RS.
---
Except league of legends. Don't bring that toxic sludge 
---
&gt; I think a dungeon finder UI simply for finding groups would benefit the community
---
 /join LookingForGroup
---
Right, so a priest can dispell everything that really matters dmg-wise and laugh at agony - or be annoyed by tongues. I honestly think that locks having to face both paladins and priests from a horde perspective would be worse than an alliance priest having to deal with WoTF.  I guess not 1v1 for dueling and such but for group PvP.
---
Anyway, everyone made great points about shadow trolls and I learned something. I was thinking of something like starshards vs. devouring plague would be a no-brainer.
---
I'm alting a warlock as my solo / farming toon when I'm not playing with my wife as warrior / priest. DM will be out by the time it's necessary for me.
---
And doesn't cost mana and isn't affected by cast time modifiers like Curse of Tongues.
---
To be fair wow is a pretty heavy drug too 
---
I too dislike fun.
---
Go cat spend all your time farming crowd pummelers to make your garbage work. I'm half kidding but the reality of druid life is that you will do 300% of the work everyone else does. Just to achieve 85% of the result. 
---
Bro just disenchant that crap and sell it. People will be leveling enchanting or enchanting their weapons.
---
Just download vQueue.
---
Sure it's a benefit just like handing out free epics is a benefit. Classic is challenging and finding and making groups is a part of that experience. Lol no dungeon finder
---
You also forgot
---
First pair of pants that actually aren't pants but a man thong. No, we don't unequip. We power through. 
---
I remember stumbling onto a 4 page forum thread dedicated to my brother with ninja looting stories and everyone warning each other not to group with him.
---
It was hilarious, NE Hunter named Nerwin on Medivh. Wish I could find it.
---
my mother used play back when i start late bc - early wowtlk and she played shaman that evutually made me play shaman aswell iv been playing shaman ever since
---
The funny thing is I'm going into classic and excited about it, but I honestly liked TBC the most. I suppose flying ruined a lot of world PvP though so maybe sans that. 
---
Crendor is so down to earth it's great.
---
I worry about two things:
---
- Selling Tokens in Retail for Classic gold. Buying gold will be a huge thing. It will require a third party site, but that's not a huge issue. Classic and Retail being on the same network will make the transfer  really convenient too, and I doubt Blizzard will monitor/sanction it in any way. 
---
So no, certain people will be still be able to cheat themselves out of putting work into the game. If your gold funds are almost unlimited you don't haveto farm for your consumables and you can just buy boosts from guilds (like in retail).
---
Sure there were always goldfarmers and buyers, but the inhibition threshold to actually do it is really low this time around.
---
-Second, I fear it's only a matter of time before they announce a cosmeti item shop for classic. Maybe not comparable to retail, but with things like unobtainable mounts or collector's edition items.
---
Most raid lockouts reset on Tuesday, I believe at midnight pacific time. 
---
ZG was unique with a 3 day reset, so it doesn't line up on a weekly basis. 
---
&gt;But here's the issue: Blizzard has deliberately chosen hardware that can't handle it because they use sharding. Saves money. 
---
I'm sorry but you can't throw that round as a fact when you don't know what blizzards chosen hardware actually is. 
---
Having less servers for sharding means those fewer servers need better hardware to handle various virtuilizations. You're right it saves money, but it does not also mean that they use terrible hardware.
---
I agree. It was such a change of pace. Apart from the brief Mulgore experience, everything Horde to that point was dead and bland. To get something like Silvermoon and the Blood Elf starting area was quite refreshing
---
If DM Tribute farm isn't nerfed then hunter is unquestionably the best gold farming alt since it will make twice as much gold per hour as any other solo gold farming method. If it is nerfed then hunter and mage make roughly the same gold per hour, but mage is a much more versatile and desired class in most group settings.
---
Agreed. Even them putting a "tip" such as
---
"Try making or joining custom channels for new social circles! LookingForGroup and World are common channels on many servers."
---
Promoting without forcing
---
This is how you get put on ignored and make a bad impression on other communities. 
---
I am not a popup add
---
But keep the passion going!!!
---
The loss of mana regen upon casting the mount hurts more than the mount's actual cost, at least IMO.
---
I actually like that both have pros and cons attached. Whichever you prefer, that's what you'll get.
---
Man this shit made me laugh haha
---
I LOVE CRENDOR!!
---
Same 😂😂
---
Just because something is more convenient doesn't mean it's more fun.
---
Addons / Websites are much more readily accessible than they used to be. I believe an addon or webapp could be created to do the same thing with the addition of a qualifying score or something.
---
if you can't limit your time to a couple hours/day at most, don't start playing.  There is much more to life than classic W and those things will be 1000x more rewarding.  
---
so, if you can self control, sure.  if not, don't and keep focusing on improving your other areas
---
Slow mace in MH, fast dagger in OH.
---
1H maces have the slowest speed and highest top end damage out of 1H weapons...which makes for bigger SS and bigger Evis.  Fast dagger in OH for more poison applications.
---
...but that's just my opinion and how I've always leveled my rogues...but I'm a weirdo too so...
---
Oh and I guess I should also mention that I always leveled as Sub spec because I was always on pvp servers and like stealthing past shit to get to quest objectives.  I also like Hemo...but like I said...weirdo...
---
 **&lt;Event Horizon&gt; \[EU-GER\] \[Alliance\] \[PVP-Server\] \[Semi-Hardcore\]**
---
We are a newly created German based guild for classic PVE progression. We're looking at a semi-hardcore approach, we will be pushing to clear content as quickly as possible, while our goal in classic is to clear all raid content in an efficient manner while maintaining a relaxed &amp; Fun atmosphere.
---
\- **Discord**: [https://discord.gg/u5sXqzH](https://discord.gg/u5sXqzH)
---
\- **Realm** : EU-Ger (realm TBD)
---
\- **Realm** Type: PVP
---
\- **Faction**: Alliance
---
\- **Region**: EU
---
\- **Timezone**: GMT+1
---
\- **Guild Type**: Semi-hardcore
---
\- **Raiding Times**: TBD. But we are looking at 2-3 Raids per week.
---
\- **Loot Rules**: TBD
---
Because we are a German based guild you should understand the language on a basic level. We expect all of our members to be respectful of all guild members. We don't expect everyone to know strategies to every encounter, but if you don't, we will expect that you show up with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn, and put 100% effort into it.
---
Also we fully expect some people cannot raid as hardcore as they used to, and we have kept that in mind and will be allowing casual’s also to join, as long as “if” or “when” they become available to raid they do so by giving their all.
---
Was the looking for group channel in Vanilla a worldwide channel? That would be really cool, so I don't have to travel to Stormwind in order to join a chat looking for SM groups?
---
So in Europe that would probably be midnight CET.
---
Your 30s really are your best ~~years~~ levels. 
---
Only saw this on private servers, but alliance players camping the entrance to Hinterlands and tanking horde. 
---
Horde GY is literally as far as way from the entrance to the zone as you get, so most will just ress at the spirit healer, where of course a rogue would be waiting to kill players with res sickness 
---
That looks like phasing, not sharding.
---
Ha yeah, getting the rings/necks/trinkets slots filled always felt like a really big deal.
---
Nah it's all about time management. As a kid I had homework and chores and a mother who didn't like seeing my play computer games all day. Now I go to work and the only chores I have are messes I make. I can play as long as I want as long as it doesn't affect my work. 
---
Alright! I can understand that choice. I was a leatherworker originally and was so happy to learn about devilsaur gear. Will serve you well no doubt, even if it will be a bitch to go without herbalism for a while.
---
Raptor mount buddy! Least played combo. I was a troll rogue, ya mon!
---
or you just do them until you cant anymore...
---
I hear what you're saying. But at least a Classic server will give a great experience for at least 3+ years before slowdown or server migrations *may* occur. And then we can just swap them around.
---
Compare it to private servers where someone scripts a better server and it looks like your max level ready-to-raid character is worthless now.
---
Thanks for reminding me why I won't be playing this game
---
Part of the vanilla experience was the manual nature of having to build dungeon groups. The automation of this process played a major part in the community aspect of the game dropping away.
---
So no, I don't agree with this.
---
safer then sitting in the chair not moving.
---
If you would have told me back then that I wouldn't have to reinstall the game with the 6 discs and wait two days to fully patch the game because of dial-up,  I would have called you a fucking liar.  
---
So, lots has changed in technology since Vanilla. I think Blizzard and the community reacting to that would be healthiest for the game. 
---
Guides / Addons / Webapps will have a huge impact on the way people play Classic. Someone mentioned addons that will do what I've suggested. Why not just have everyone on the same page?
---
I tried SS and it doesnt work well
---
Video games are a hobby. Maybe not the coolest hobby, but one nonetheless.
---
It’s not April 1 anymore dude. You can lay off these shit posts. 
---
Stacking shadow damage gear with all of the affliction talents and completely melting your enemy and instant shadow bolt procs during one Void Sac...even better...
---
And what do you think a stress test will do?  Haha its absurd to think they dont know it will be packed.  Stress tests and beta are a pipe dream
---
Sorry, I've never played on an EU server. No idea. 
---
&gt; Only down side
---
Are you sure about that?
---
42% more knockback on heal casts. 20% more expensive totems. 15% higher threat. 25% less effective mana totem. 0.5sec slower healing wave cast. 18% less powerful healing wave. 10% less powerful heals. 5% less mana.
---
That's how an instant friendship is formed. 
---
I can't wait to listen to 10+ hours of Dun Morogh while playing like every class to Level 12. It's going to be a BLAST!
---
Try competing with 20 other Warriors/rogues/mages...
---
Original release date was in 2004 and TBC wasn’t released until 2007. At time of release most of the communities had not made it to Naxx so I think the game has enough content to last at least 4 years. 
---
I do hope for them TBC servers at some point because I did not get to play any end game content in that! Plus the specs in TBC were greatly improved 
---
https://i.imgflip.com/19cfxv.jpg
---
I swear I remember this as well. Any and all summoned items would disappear. 
---
We don't know if cloth turn in quests will just come with the 1.12 baseline of the game state in classic, or if cloth turn ins will be "enabled" when later content is unlocked for classic.
---
My assumption is the Classic team will just have them in there from the get-go.
---
Beat the shit out of things till they’re dead. :)
---
OK, so in either case, wednesday is the start of the raid week, yeah?
---
Would you say PT is the "standard" North American (or at least USA) time zone?
---
Forgot staff warrior
---
Yeah, but please note that Curse of Tongues is far more than just "annoying" ; it's literally an over 60% Damage/Healing reduction for casters as long as it is up. But anyway I was talking about Troll priests ; Hex of Weakness is a 20% Healing reduction, which can be applied to any zerging Warrior with Pocket healers, and it it hardcore.
---
Also alliance warlocks have to deal with Shaman Purges, which is no better than Paladins dispells, so it kinda evens out.
---
I think cross-realm brought the death of the community aspect. Barring server transfers, people will get to know the other players and guilds on their server. Dungeon finder or not, you will know the names that pop up.
---
I think most reasonable people agree with you on this.
---
However the elephant in the room is: what does "temporary starter zone sharding" actually mean. It is a very vague term. They could mean all early leveling zones (barrens etc...) and "temporary" could mean months.
---
I have faith in the Classic team and I know they're aware that sharding take away a large amount of the vanilla experience, but there is only so much that can be done in regards to optimization while keeping it easily maintainable alongside retail. 
---
What about ZG farm, how does that compare in g/hour? I had a Mage alt in Vanilla and ran a few dungeons on him, but never raided on that character. But honestly, the hunter rotation for max DPS seems more fun. 
---
&gt; people who hate respeccing
---
Ia that a other way of saying "people that are to lazy and can't be arsed to raid with an optimal spec on the expense of his guild buddies"?
---
You’ve seen how people have reacted to wanting to implement changes that weren’t in Vanilla, right? 
---
Why the fuck did you think people would suddenly jump on board? Fucking delusional.. 
---
I’m naked from my ankles to 3/4 up my thighs, and I don’t even get +1% dodge from these pants???
---
classic dota 2 when/
---
Please don't expect server merges to be the 'norm' in classic. It has many complicated issues that people are not thinking about about.
---
I'm looking forward to see what their solution to the 'dead realm' will be.
---
WINNER!
---
If anything, making dungeon groups slightly harder to form will only make people LESS social. 
---
Very quickly into Classic, most likely in beta, an addon will be created that draws an arrow on your screen telling you your characters next step in the optimal quest line. Making dungeon groups harder to find will only push people towards following that arrow for the best XP while playing all alone.
---
After playing on private servers and hopping from server to server for many years, I have been looking forward to finally having a main character that I could sink all my time and effort into that wouldn't eventually be 'lost' or having to be discarded.
---
The announcement of no RP-PvP on launch crushed my dreams and now I'll have to play characters that I won't identify with which absolutely kills the vanilla WoW vibe. GG
---
Got any idea for ele build?
---
ROFL
---
Making more money than you .. yo

Modern hardware could run it easily, however hardware is very likely not the restriction. Things are designed differently these days. Modern WoW is designed to be infinitely scalable, so they could run a million shards, and then easily crank that up to 2 million, then drop it 50k without any sort of hiccup. 
---
However the question that remains is if they're able to provide that scalability to player numbers within each shard. 
---
You guys are so american
---
Why are you so angry? Open your window bro, get some fresh air
---
Well he asked for a viable hybrid spec for both pve pvp. Most premadea want the 30 ele for damage output and NS burst kills. Obviously MT isnt the only downside. But you still get improved mana totem, can choose between threat or knockback reduction. Healing wave speed or mana cost depending on how you build the 21 points in resto. But you are also gaining from ele: 5% mana reduction, 5% damage and 5% crit. Elemental focus, cast range, 1sec shock CD reduction, 1 sec cast reduction on ele spells, 100% bonus crit damage on your spells. So yeah I'm sure about it.
---
If they were going to add ANYTHING like that into vanilla I would stop it at TBC's addition of LFG. You'd put on an LFG tag and see other players with LFG tags, you then would communicate with the players to see if you were a good fit. It wasn't a apply for 40 groups with a click of the button and see if you got accepted to one. 
---
However even with what I said to implement you could post on your server to join the "LFG" channel and everyone joins that on the server that wants to look for a group. That way you don't have to be in IF or SW or wahtever to find players to group with. 
---
Then write such an addon and promote it in the forums?
---
Lots of people on pservers already use oQueue. 
---
&gt; getting rid of all your gray/white statless items
---
Unless you run Scholo or Strat.
---
Blizzard is clearly looking at posts to gauge what direction they should go in. They don’t need to see dumbass posts like this. 
---
*Character Transfer*.
---
Okay.
---
Why are you going to post twice? You're just an angry dude! 
---
There were a couple stories about how someone let their infant literally die from neglect while they were engrossed in playing computer games. You have to wonder.
---
And that's why you play on a PvP server. You can't do much if it's a player of your own faction, but if it's not, you can corpsecamp them to establish dominance over the area's resources.
---
I got my first epic from a murloc at level 39.
---
Eh i have to nerd out. Gotta have me pepsi and doritos and pizza hut and chill in my reebok. Its part of min maxing for dps.
---
&gt;You’re just waiting for the lockout to expire so you end up yielding the same gold per hour.
---
Thanks for confirming that you didn't even read my post at all.
---
They had the tech back then
---
SPECULATION on min requirements per modern client.
---
* Minimum Requirements
---
* Operating System - Windows® 7 64-bit
---
* Processor - Intel® Core™ i5-760 or AMD FX™-8100 or better
---
* Video - NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 560 2GB or AMD™ Radeon™ HD 7850 2GB or Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W TDP)
---
* Memory - 4 GB RAM (8GB for Intel HD Graphics 530)
---
* Storage - 70GB available space 7200 RPM HDD
---
* Internet - Broadband internet connection
---
* Input - Keyboard and mouse required. Other input devices are not supported.
---
* Resolution - 1024 x 768 minimum display resolution
---
I suspect the storage will be much less as you do not need the rest of the map and assets from the current BFA package.
---
Blizzard is located on the west coast, so in this case yeah. I wouldn't say there's a standard Time zone in the US. majority of the population lives on either east or west coast, a 3 hour difference
---
Oh, it's a helluva lot more than +1% of people dodging ya w/ that look
---
You’re intersecting Roleplay with the game itself, most Roleplayers have satisfaction with building on the lore with other like minded individuals who have a affinity for said lore.
---
What you’re describing is kinda not RP, economics isn’t really factored in to the real life day to day people in the Warcraft universe. 
---
There are plenty of options for guilds and ideas, I’m keeping them most to myself but I like the idea of paramilitary organizations with our own plot lines that kill Horde players along the way. 
---
If you're very early it's highly likely that you can make your money back by helping other warlocks. I did it in vanilla. The last step requires 250G of material, and I got about 50G in tips from guild-mates and 50-150G from others. That's a fair deal, considering you have to go to DM with them and they save 100-200G.
---
&gt;What is the point of min-maxing a game to death when you need to string this game out for years to come?
---
Because we enjoy doing it?
---
&gt;For example, one of my friends and I did over 100 undead strat runs for a specific piece of priest gear back in the day
---
minmaxers have literally 0 impact on you doing that.
---
Im pretty sure there was free server transfers to low population realms at one point, but never a merge. 
---
That's some asmongold level scamming right there
---
I downloaded a private server and I .. I did this yesterday.
---
i always love farming mining nodes on my rogue or hunter
---
killing a few mobs near a node and someone tries to swoop in? a quick vanish or FD and they all jump the new guy while you can go grab the node and then /rude them 
---
Guess I'll assume that if NA servers are midnight PT, then European servers are midnight CET. Thanks.
---
I think the stages will release much slower than people think to give more people time to immerse themselves and level. The worst thing I think Blizzard could do is rush out stages and make people feel behind right away.
---
No they didn't lol. Youtube wasn't even created when Vanilla came out, much less was it widely used. They definitely didn't have the capability for sites like raider.io
---
WoW almost ruined my whole family. Me, my brother and my dad played every day after work / school. All three leveled night elves, made it to cap around the same time. My mom HATED this. Very much a midwestern 'vidya games are bad' type person. Constantly yelling at us in the basement, telling my dad to stop wasting his time. 
---
So my dad at the time owned a small IT services company, basically doing sysadmin / hosting / development work. Everyone at his office played WoW almost all fucking day instead of work most days. During high school I had half of my classes at a special tech school, but only 4 days a week. So Fridays after lunch I would always go to my dad's office and play WoW on one of their nice computers. One day my mom came to his office and sees me and my dad and everyone else in the office playing WoW at like 2pm and absolutely loses her fucking mind, and makes the biggest fuss.
---
Basically, she made my dad quit playing WoW at home or she was going to divorce him. She started turning off our internet at 10pm, stopped paying for our subs, like it was such a pain in the ass. Me and my brother got jobs to pay for our sub, and moved our computers to a friends house.
---
My dad is looking forward to playing Classic wow in retirement though :)
---
Never ruined my life. But I dropped out of college after my first year. I played WoW at home for pretty much a year. One of the best times of my gaming life, lol. After my friends seemed to be going out and having fun / advancing in their school life, I felt like shit and stopped playing &amp; went back to school. 
---
My best friend on the other hand, straight after high school went into WoW. He never went to college, played for like 3 years straight and was basically having his mom pay for his subscription. He eventually got a part time job, simply to pay his subscription and phone bill, once his parents cut him off. When he finally stopped, he got a full time job at minimum wage and has been working dead end jobs since. I wouldn't say his life is ruined, but he's still living paycheck to paycheck, and would be living at his mom's house if it wasn't for his gf (who makes decent money as a nurse). 
---
FUCK EM DUUUUDE! 
---
I can relate to so many of his stories lmao, i was a huge scumbag back in the day. 
---
Little known fact about Americans. Yes there are fat people but there are also more people who are overweight because they lift and exercise more than the average European. Both contribute to the overweight statistic.
---
you are actually retarded lmao

Guy-who-tells-people-how-to-play, don't be that guy
---
That kind of thing only works inside, most of these tests are to do with the login server.
---
I thought you were referring to the tech for dungeon finders. Yeah addon development and the widespread usage of internet wasn’t as far along, nor did twitch or discord exist. What does that have to do with dungeon finder again?
---
Some didn't like joining with other communities, but I think on the whole everyone realized it was for the better.
---
2/10
---
I clearly understand dickhead. I just said if all you’re doing to farm is 20 min lasher lock out and then wait till the next one. You are making the same exact gold as me who’s just playing longer within the lockout. Logging out doesn’t really count when ur technically adding in 40 minutes of downtime doing absolutely nothing. 
---
Are you this fucking thin minded? Nobody cares that you can do lashers faster than the lockout if your still just ONLY DOING LASHERS. Jesus Christ this sub has some of the most low IQ people. 
---
Well yesterday was April fools so...
---
Warrior named Osyrus(Osyris?) main tanked for our guild. Got 8/8T1, a binding then left the server with the guild bank. He transferred back with full T2 and a TF, somehow richer? probably did the same thing to another guild. 
---
Launch *is* the stress test. As is tradition.
---
no changes FFS 
---
Your mom did you good, bud.
---
It's pretty hard to go as hardcore as I used at as a kid. I'm older now. More money than time. As a kid I had more time than money.
---
I'll be looking for a family friendly raiding guild once it launches. 
---
I'm not a min-maxer, and I agree with you.
---
The only thing that a min-maxer shouldn't do is go around the forums, chats and reddits and tell everyone without being asked that they are stupid for rolling an undead warlock instead of an Orc one, or that they will never get a raid invite as a nightelf priest.
---
Mom asked if I was moving back into the basement.
---
I was a priest who camped in Blackrock Mountain and used mind control to jump people into the lava.
---
&gt; I hope that the overwhelming majority of players are like myself and my friends in that we want to just enjoy the game.
---
For some people, enjoy the game means not caring about min-maxing.  For other people, enjoying the game means *exclusively* caring about min-maxing.
---
Both of those approaches are fine.  The only important thing is that the two groups leave each other the hell alone.
---
You can't just divide it into "normies and nolifers". There's going to be a full spectrum of people, starting with the people who ding 60 in the first week and ending with the people who never ding 60. Some "normies" will be *way* more efficient levelers than others. 
---
nah I'll go paladong and tank/heal dungeons and raids
---
I think your orc needs contacts, badly.
---
Because of virtualization, it really doesn't cost them any more resource-wise to have 2 low pop servers vs 1 combination. However, It does cost them in community health. In the case of a dead server, some people pay to move, but a significant number are at risk of quiting.
---
Are they together still??
---
None of that helps you in raids. As far as hybrid specs go, 30/0/21 shaman loses a huge amount of useful PvE talents. It's equivalent would probably be something like a paladin who raids as a healer but only puts 13 points into Holy.
---
I flunked out of college playing Vanilla the first time.

No joke, I'd play till 6 am, get dressed for "class", drive down the steet and wait for my parents to leave for work, then go back home and play all day. 
---
What the fuck was wrong with me!!! 😆😆😆
---
I think a global LFG channel would suffice. Even local LFG channels (I don't remember if these were a thing already). There was a group finder in vanilla, granted it was not very useful. Meeting stones and, later on, innkeepers functioned as local group finders but they just threw random people together with no regard to roles. Instead of looking toward a new UI feature, I think a more realistic suggestion might be to simply let players choose roles they are willing to fill to better match DPS to a tank and a healer with zero regard to group composition beyond that.
---
I'm not sure that standing in org spamming trade/lfg counts as social interaction and "being out in the world" but I will also concede that I don't think more robust group finders changed that, either.
---
I'm hoping BGs come out sooner than 4 months after launch
---
This so much. 
---
I would like to raid, but i dont have much time on my hands. Therefore i will min/max to maximize my chances of getting into a guild or pugs if neccesary. 
---
If you want to spend more time making a less efficient build viable, that is fine. 
---
Please do not tell people how to play the game.
---
Not a bad suggestion, but it highlights the issue with how WoW’s UI has changed over the years.  Namely, the UI has been updated to implement the functions of the most widely popular add-ons.  A lot of the hostility over later UI changes feels silly since it was all functionality available in Vanilla.
---
Having that functionality built in to the UI means you can rely on others using the same version, as opposed to the fraction of people who will download or be forced to download some other add-on. 
---
You play your way.  I'll play mine.
---
I remember a forum post where someone told his girlfriend he was going to be on a business trip for 3 weeks so he could play more WoW.
---
How many members do you currently have? I’m interested in joining as a rogue but am flexible depending on guild needs.
---
I leveled on medivh. Was that the hunter who ninja'd whitemane's chapeau in Scarlet Monastery?
---
I can still remember my first green, my first shoulders, my first helm that my hunter equipped way back in 2006. I probably couldn't name a single epic item that my current main is wearing.
---
Was this the Royal Militia on Bleeding Hollow??
---
This is a huge change that you're proposing to a group of people that clearly don't like things the way that they currently are. The real flavor of Vanilla was the difficulty of doing anything, which forced group cooperation and increased in-game sociability between players. The only feasible way to improve without destroying the Vanilla aspect would be to still force players to go to major cities, but actually have a dedicated (and widely used) LFG chat that is separate from the spam in Trade. 
---
Not even the demo was true to form.  They are recreating an old game and need feedback to ensure its accurate.
---
Yup, that was him. He thought the icon looked cool.
---
And yet it is widely used and known to be enough to heal through previously cleared content. I'm saying that all those ele stats are amazing and usually necessary if you want to pvp in premades. You're not running this spec until you're cleared and geared on current content and like i said, it's for non HC non progression raiding. Obviously if your doing progression you're going full resto. 
---
How about you just play how you want to play and not worry about how I want to play?  If min-maxing my characters is what I find enjoyable, why do you care? 
---
It’s both.

Yeah I'm doing it for the devilsaur gear and the initial money from selling mats. I remember it cost me a lot to buy the mats for the gear and I know I'll get it again for sure. So why not make it. 
---
After I get the gear though I'll probably switch to engineering and mining mainly for the fun factor and the bombs you can make that stun. Forget what they are called. But useful for wpvp!
---
Yeah I'm going to definitely go to a pvo server. But the guild I want to be in is hopefully relaxed and raids a night or two a week for 2 or 3 hours. I just want to get through content *eventually*. Doesn't have to be fast. You?
---
Where do you get off telling me how to enjoy the game the way I want? I'm not running around telling you not to ERP in goldshire or wear whites in 5 mans because it "looks cool". I'm sick of all these casual carebears getting upset because I enjoy playing a game optimally. Keep you condescending fantasy loving noobishness on RP servers please.
---
Hi, /u/woglofung1
---
I LOVE how people are unable to see passed their own nose. Let people play the game in their own way and stop telling how others should play.... 
---
BGs are currently not part of any stage, and I would not be surprised if they add them individually between stages when they feel the timing is right based on level 60 population and timing. 
---
Mods, don't let people fill this sub with annoying advertisements, please!
---
I’m really tired about hearing all this “BiS gear” or “best Naxx spec” bs.  It took me about 6 months in vanilla to ding 60.  I’m looking forward to fishing and cooking, running some 5 mans or even some 15 man UBRS.  That being said I’ll probably level a bit quicker than I did the first go around but I plan on not killing myself over a number.
---
Oh another post crying about people who are good at the game and make them feel bad 😢 
---
does a bear shit in the woods?
---
I'm not against a LFG tool that returns results of players that are LFG for specific content or a specific level range.  I'd also be fine if they just create a LFG channel.  Been playing on the DAoC Phoenix free shard the past couple of months and the new EQ2 TLE server that launched a couple weeks ago and the LFG channel is incredibly effective for finding or building a group. 
---
You can have a partner and kids and still have time to game. You just have to prioritize and organize your time more effectively. 
---
By doing exactly the opposite. Not only am I metaphorically crowing from the rooftops about the return of Classic, I've managed to rope my brother in too.
---
Now I just need to convince my console-only best friend to finally invest in a gorram gaming PC and we'll be 3/5 of the way to an in-built leveling group.
---
2.	They’ve indicated that a subscription will suffice. I think they hope the interest in classicwow and the commitment to subbing will encourage people to take the extra step and buy retail.
---
1g or fuck off.. those portals don't grow on trees you know.
---
But you could be invincible!
---
These stories are all good and fun to read for entertainment purposes until you get to one like this where you "snap out of it" and realize just how horrific addiction -- even video game addiction -- can be. That's awful.
---
I remember the fire enchant being garbage in vanilla but I don't have any numbers.
---
Full time career would not stop you. Wife will. 
---
A burning demon-horse straight outta hell isn't exactly "nothing"
---
But I get where you're coming from 
---
Not classic but in wotlk i did this as dk in azjol nerub where you jump down into the pool. Been kicked alot because of that
---
Same! I am legitimately playing without telling anyone
---
Yup, if they wait too long the people at 60 will be bored and making life hell for those trying to level.
---
I had a real addiction problem with WoW, 6 years of arguments with my parents, finally they've had peace for 6 years and I'm a normal kid. They'll be happy for sure
---
Hi, /u/Nyhirai
---
Ruined my life when they messed up every expac after level 90. Currently, disc priest are unplayable in arena. Now, Im unsubscribed and have to interact with real people... blizzard/activision ruined their game which ruined my life. 
---
Why would I want to shard and add overhead if everything is on the same server? There isnt multiple sets of hardware to load balance across. If pservers can run 5000+ people at once, Blizzard can run 2500 without sharding 
---

This is a link to my guild website! It's still under construction! Apply if you would like, needed info will be updated shoot me a reply if you have a question. 
---
https://sites.google.com/view/stmco/home
---
if we go to wotlk the obvious next step is cata
---
no, it will not go to wotlk.
---
Umm... where did you get that info? For all we know it could stay vanilla forever, maybe even with new vanilla-flavoured content.
---
No, there's zero confirmation they're doing anything other than vanilla.
---
If we all relapse together do we still need to feel ashamed?
---
the first stage is going to be at least 6 months, I bet. You have to allow time for the average player to get to 60
---
They do, since player are complaining.
---
The current services price is a compromise between players wanting them and blizzard not wanting to put them in the game. Now you can use them if you really want to, but most of the time people don't and that's fine.
---
They already talked about this many times, with the best example being the $60 boost. They could get so much more would it only cost $25 yet they don't to not make leveling even worse than it is today.
---
Why do people allways see this as a greedy move ? Would vanilla still be vanilla should people had a $5 or $10 server transfert &amp; hoped from server to server ?
---
I was playing a Mage on my way to a UBRS raid through the Burning Steppes (picking up quests) and I see a yellow dot on my mini map, its a Black Lotus! However it was surrounded by 5 elite Dragonkin (3 Black Dragonspawn, 2 Black Wyrmkin), it would take a while to kill them all, so I go for a hero play, considering 2 were casters it would be difficult but I had an idea, first off I Rocket Helm one of the casters, getting aggro on all of the mobs, i run over to the Black Lotus, Frost Nova the 3 melee Dragonkin, Counterspell the casters next cast and then... A fucking Rogue is already looting the damn herb! LMFAO
---
Me doing the math:
---
50 days. Huh, that's sort of a long time. Right? Let's see...
---
50 \* 24 = 1200 hours. Oh my gosh.
---
Scared to know what my /played time was back from when I played.
---
Few players (compared to classic) and phasing
---
I told my wife that I will not have a life for the first few days of release and she said I have to use the laptop so she can play classic on the main rig.
---
Blizzard has more experience stress testing MMO launches than everyone else combined probably. This isn't a random private server seeing if they need to upgrade. This is a fortune 50 company Activision-Blizzard. What new insights would they gain from a Classic beta stress test they haven't already garnered over the 15 years of WoW and expansion after expansion launch?
---
For me, it helps that I have less free time than I did before.
---
As long as I'm going to work, not neglecting the gf, etc, then my free time is fit to be used if I want to use it on Classic WoW.
---
I can't do 8+ hour grind sessions routinely, maybe once a week now.
---
So by only getting to play much less is how I'm handling it due to job/gf/etc.
---
Or, you'll lose it all in your 40s when the addiction takes over your life again.
---
It's not a summoned item. That's why we had loot lag while draining a soul.
---
A recent private server handled 10 k pop with another 5k in queue without any type of phasing or lag or server issues. Watch blizzard fk this up and then put in phasing as a band aid
---
If you get """"hacked"""" in this day and age, you deserve it for not taking any steps to secure your account.
---
I liked to cast Slow Fall on that drop. Nowhere as "dicky" as what you're describing but still annoying enough to please me :)
---
Staff warrior is best warrior
---
people who are talking about bis gear are planning to raid, so you can't really blame them for getting excited and working out a plan on how to do that the best. Everyone likes to have goals.
---
And student loans! Fuck them too!
---
Honestly, this is pretty accurate, at least for me. I found the same thing with OSRS: come back as an adult, overshadow all of my progress from age 10-12 (i stopped because tbc came out :p) in about a month, and then have way more fun than I ever did over the course of the next year. BC Private servers let me do the same thing for a little bit: Not necessarily play super optimally and hyper-efficient, but I still did so much content I coulda never done when I was younger because I didn't know what was going on. adult problem-solving skills open up so many doors in this game that were firmly, firmly closed for all of us dumb 13 year olds at the time.
---
I don't think anyone is going to prefer a dead server just because of "muh communities".
---
Historically, Vanilla-WotLK only ever offered transfers away from high population servers.
---
What if your particular server isn't high pop and no transfers are offered? Have you ever thought of that?
---
If you're working full time and have a partner, I'm struggling to see where you find 30-40 hours a week to game. That is what most of us had to play during Vanilla.
---
If you're in a situation where you don't have to work full time maybe sure. But even with just a full time job and a partner, I dont see where you're finding 30-40 hours without neglecting something real important.
---
So because you were bad at it 15 years ago , noone should roll warrior lol.
---
I did it yesterday, PM me if you want instructions..
---
You ever fart too hard and get something extra?
---
Played a shaman to 49 on a private server. Thought it was the class for me to main when classic comes out but while an overall fun leveling experience, I wasn't fussy on being a weird mix of resto/ele end game, makes killing anything so much more challenging. Also keybinds...so many keybinds..
---
god damn it you're 4 hours wittier than I am
---
Yea you want the rage.
---
You've got it wrong. It isn't for no reason.
---
When she says pick the game or me, it means you are neglecting her FOR the game. No longer taking her out, no longer giving her the attention she wants/needs. You've turned her into a roommate. This is a real thing people don't want to admit can happen or has happened.
---
Go to work, come on, play WoW until bed, maybe spend like 5 minutes talking to your GF or eating dinner with her (if that)
---
That type of situation is why you get the ultimatum. Not because you're playing 2-4 hours a day.
---
Sharding will ruin so much, look at retail. Every time a streamer tries to create a big pvp event the game gets insanely laggy and half the raid goes missing. Ahn qiraj will be a mess. Meanwhile certain private servers seem to be able to handle it way better than blizzard
---
not down. u can replace defiance for last stand or toughness 
---
60 people XD blizzard really is a small indie company
---
I think you’re on to something!
---
Well, there lies the problem. A non HC guild is unlikely to have all content on farm before the next content patch rolls around, meaning that you will still have to respec twice a week.
---
It will take at least 2 years, likely more, to get all the content patches. We don't know what will happen then. It will depend on how well this goes and what the community wants.
---
If Classic flops they will just maintain the realms in their current state forever, letting it slowly die. If not, Blizzard will decide on how to continue no earlier than at least a year from now. It makes no sense to map that out right now.
---
Update for you:
---
I shared the link you gave with a Blizzard CM. I have all the transcripts and can say that literally every single communication before this, Blizz CMs told me that I can't use the forums because I don't have a WoW sub.
---
I think maybe they were just glossing over my tickets and not reading that I'm asking about the Classic forums, but I was clear as hell every time, going as far as saying I was able to post before, etc.
---
After sharing the link it seems someone finally understood the issue, and they did something and told me to clear my cookies for the account, and it works now.
---
Thanks for sharing that link.
---
REEEEEEEE Stop having wrong fun !!!!
---
Well.... I remember getting into wow a year after it came out when they announced a free trial around Christmas. You can sure as hell say there were hundreds of night elves running around Teldrassil
---
Why do you assume this isn't apart of their general development cycle? It's almost like you guys think Blizzard have no clue how to engineer and test software (whether or not they make a good game is a completely different question).
---
Have a very similiar story about a friend losing social life, grades etc so won’t bother typing it out. Some people really can’t handle playing WoW it seems like, I get kinda full after a month of straight playing but some people just seem to be hungry for it for a very long time.
---
His human priest ”Normane” was dope tho
---
Classic will get patches in the future. Similar to how OSRS still has updates.
---
Too many pserver players telling them their game is wrong.  Internal testing is all they need
---
Yeah, that would make sense, too.  Plus Last Stand could be fun in PvP as well as useful in PvE.  I suppose it would depend a lot on gear though.
---
Sure but the guy I responded too said every expansion.
---
Classic will be different tho, yes.
---
Where in this post do you see anything about BIS gear or specs?  This is completely off topic lol.
---
Literally what I saw while I was there.
---
You can duel the opposite faction with /duel. If you /forfeit right as they're about to attack it will flag them and you can jump them with your homies. 
---
Once they do they more than likely wont care, people will be gearing alts. And honestly you may be underestimating how easy the first few raids are for a competent group. People will be pugging MC asap and guilds will have on farm after a week or two of raiding. Once AQ 40 and naxx happens it will slow down but the first 2 tiers are relatively easy or gear checks excluding a few bosses.
---
you should go 1/29/21
---
50 days dude, and I thought 10 days was god awfully slow. I guess people played to explore back then and have fun with friends not just slave away to get to max.
---
So it does, my bad.
---
I heard a story of some psycho killed some kid IRL because he owed him gold. Hid his body in crawl space or something. Don't know if it was true.
---
I'd say it's safe to assume at least 2 lives were ruined there.
---
I swam before I walked, was in year round club swim basically my whole life, in addition to club baseball and every sport season at school. Dad got into WoW, I got into WoW. I got out of sports. Fat phase. Got out of WoW end of TBC/WotLK launch. Rejoined sports, thinned back out, but in sports like swimming you cannot compete against people who never quit. I would compete in all-stars after each baseball season, my friend &amp; I would hit in the batting cages that pitched in the 90s while most pitchers were throwing in the 70s, we had insane batting averages. Had I not quit all sports and had my fat phase, I was potentially going to be a 1-2 sport collegiate athlete, maybe with scholarships, potential olympic hopeful swimmer, and if I made it that far I'd probably have had MLB aspirations. 
---
Ah well, odds are those weren't gonna happen anyway, I'm not too upset about missing those. I went from having an 8 pack, being super outgoing, class clown, etc, to being fat, introverted, and shy. That was the biggest part that ruined my life. I lost all my confidence. It's been a decade of recovery since then. While I've thinned out I've never completely regained the confidence. I don't know why I am dying to dive back into this game, but I am.
---
Honestly,  I feel like rolling an off class/race or running strange spec as a badge of honor!  Min-maxers will always exist.  I was that nelf priest, and I can’t tell you how many times I actually used shadowmeld to my advantage. I never had trouble getting into raids, and when I wanted to go shadow, everyone was totally cool with it!  Get yourself some good friends and they will always support you.
---
My wife is forbidding me from playing - and with good reason. We didn’t know each other when I was playing.
---
WoW was my social life from 2004-2012 - it’s all I did outside of class and work. Rushing home from work right at 5pm to get on by 6pm to raid is not a good look.
---
I can’t let it get that bad again. 
---
My friends, family, and coworkers and I all played WoW. In 2005 my brother started dating a girl from work and a year later they were married. We got her sucked into the game, too. They were reasonably happy until several years later he got a job working on the road. It paid really well, and they needed the money because they got in a little over their heads with their mortgage.
---
She stayed home with the kids, playing WoW all day while he was on the road. She transferred servers with her progression guild. She'd spam bnet looking for people to pug some empty raid slots, but when any of her IRL friends and family offered, she'd balk and go on about what a dick the guild leader was and how he'd suck the fun out of it for us. We wondered wtf she saw in this guild that she couldn't get in any other progression guild.
---
That is until she packed her shit and moved to the other side of the country to live with her fucking guild leader she met on the internet. Who lived at home with his parents. Who didn't have a job. She told him my brother was a violent, abusive thug that hit her and the kids, which isn't true at all. She'd been trying to hide her online affair from her friends and family by convincing us raiding with her guild would suck. They were divorced a few months later. WoW destroyed their marriage.
---
Silver lining, she had to move back here to attend the custody hearings and the custody arrangement makes it difficult for her to move out of state with the kids.
---
WoW also almost ruined my life. I was spiraling into depression, in an abusive relationship, drinking, on drugs, not eating, not sleeping, etc. I used WoW and RP as an escape instead of *actually* escaping for 4 years.
---
And lastly, I heard a story on the news about a mom who locked her children in a bedroom with blacked out windows and slid food to them under the door. A neighbor heard them literally crying and begging for help and called the police. Turns out she didn't even let them out to use the bathroom. She permanently barricaded them in so she could play video games all day. It didn't specify the game, but I'd bet $100 it was WoW.
---
People talking about BiS gear, never played vanilla and think it’s as easy as retail. 
---
Finally, a good point
---
You seem as sure as the OP.
---
There's really no good excuse not to have an authenticator. (Don't you guys have phones?)
---
LFG and World were both worldwide chats, between those 2 and general chat in the cities you'll find people. 
---
Sorry, just venting I guess.  Not trying to get mad at my brothers and sisters... just frustrated that’s all. 
---
Ninja happens more often by the master looter just stealing the item. Blizzard has punished people doing this in the past and it is in fact against the rules.
---
Yea WoW isnt worth a marriage unless there are other underlying issues 
---
and you drag the mob to the player and it cleaves him
---
*LOL*
---
also rich thorium meme's: when you roll up on a rich node someone is mining, but they dont *loot* until you move away to stop you from ninja'ing the 2nd mine.
---
You can raid MC, BWL, AQ20 and ZG with pretty much any spec regardless of class as long as your guild is competent. That doesn't really answer OP's question though.
---
Played on a really full server back in the days with many very good guilds on it what leadet to even more people joining the server trying to make a name for themselves ... So there where some people that made a huge Profit of it for offering free high level enchanting (Like crusader) only for the required mats of course. They took the hard farmed mats and you can imagine the rest. Worst part was many people thought that was good and funny because they where pissed by the server Queues ..
---
Not sure why ppl are confused by this thread I think it’s a fair statement. As someone who already experienced wow classic once I appreciate the min max stuff as I want to be more efficient or “ahead of the curve” this time around
---
LOL calm down 
---
WOW classic - here I come!
---
I like this idea a lot better than a truly global lfg channel.
---
if wotlk was the perfect game, they'd be rereleasing wotlk
---
Life tap
---
A large portion of the pre raid bis for pve is terrible in pvp because it is either leather or has no stamina or both. So if you plan to raid, which you really should unless you plan to get r14, you will need 2 sets of pre raid. Another thing no one has mentioned is how you are somewhat forced into being an engineer. Engineer gives several very useful items that can be used in BGs in vanilla. Grenades that stun from range, trinkets that reflect spells, a net gun to root from range and several other useful gadgets. As a warrior you will also need to invest in Free action potions and to a lesser extent live action potions when they come out with zg. These allow you to actually have a fighting chance against a mage if you dont have a pocket healer with you. 
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPOST
---
How doesn't it? You just said any spec can raid with a competent guild. And 30/0/21 is the most run spec for healing shaman for pvp/pve hybrid. My very first suggestion answered his Q. If he wants to play shaman go 30/0/21 once geared. 
---
noice, rogue dps skill is a good thing to have
---
Kids dying due to neglectful parents playing. So many stories made the news over the years, but I know of two that did not and I can only imagine there are so many more. I like this article on it from way back in the day because even then the author was clear neglect happens because of bad parents, not whatever the parent was focused on instead.
---
https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2005/06/547/
---
You’d have to be retarded to have any link  between your real life and your bnet details other than IRL friends on your friends list.
---
I don’t even know how you could do it other than if you’re a streamer, who isn’t going to be ninja looting anyway.
---
No, they made several changes due to user feedback on the demo.  
---
&gt; horizontal content doesn't really work
---
And yet, vanilla pservers have been going for 10+ years now.
---
And Dun Morogh
---
I had a decked out warlock and while I would farm for primal motes to sell on the AH, I would kill others there that were farming "my" elementals and for those in the same faction I would banish their mob so they couldn't kill it and then leave.
---
I still haven’t reached max level on the popular p server that’s been out for like 3 years
---
My assumption, based on how they're rolling out every other piece of content, is that is won't be in at launch. I don't see why this would be an exception.
---
Even without a phone, there's PC applications like WinAuth that can function the same way.
---
How about using BoP on a mate right before he caps the flag in wsg then picking it up yourself and scoring? Im sure some "Iron Man" achievements in TBC got ruined this way.
---
Did u r14?
---
&gt;They do not need a beta
---
They absolutely need a beta, this is effectively a new game and NEEDS to be tested.  I don't give a fuck if I'm in it, or if everyone plays it by me, but the game needs to be tested or it will be a mess come launch, there are going to be bugs, likely lots of them.  And given how often we've been told there is a very small team working on this, internal testing has likely been minimal.
---
Btw, if you didn't know, Honor Hold (more like any outland alliance bases) music "borrowed" song from the Chopin.
---
its just a meme but this actually seems to be what women are like, except that instead of wow shoulder armour its obviously things like status, fame, wealth haha
---
Depends is we have access to realm transfers or not.
---
They made it incredibly easy to just ninja whatever you wanted, once your reputation gets so bad nobody joins your groups, start again on a new server.
---
I think the average player will take a month (real time) to get to 60, if they play a few hours a day and the reason the hardcore players rush the 60 is because they want to farm around 50k gold to last them throughout the game, being 60 first means you can have a monopoly on different areas of the market, Black Lotus, Flasks, Elemental Fire, pre-raid BiS BoEs, Arcane Crystals etc.
---
To me, TBC doesn't have that magic with its itemization and daily quests
---
It is indeed better, but I prefer having more mana and hp when badly geared.
---
I don't like Nature's Grasp's 35% chance, too much RNG. I always feel like I wasted a GCD because I don't know when will it fire off.
---
But yeah, objectively it is better.
---
Tell me how to play please I beg you.  
---
You just turned 12, buddy?
---
I played counterstrike-source before WoW. I was pretty good and played competitively. I found WoW and stopped playing css. My friend, shahzam, kept playing source. He is now pro and i am still nothing because of WoW. Plz bring me vanilla soon to make me happy again. 
---
Many TBC tracks were written by the Matt Uelmen, the composer of D1-D2 soundtrack, that's why it has such awesome ambient tracks, especially dark ones.
---
What is the chance of injury while sitting on chair for 40 seconds?
---
I'm not worried about their servers, I'm worried about the game itself, they need an actual beta, not a stress test, and it needs to be long enough to let people actually level to 60.  I'm already worried honestly, we are well past when a beta needed to be announced if they are still targeting the Summer.
---
dang this is a good point. sad to understand this seeing that the same thing might happen now if blizz doesnt release any rppvp server at launch again.
---
A few hours on week nights after dinner/errands, and longer gaming sessions on weekends. I think 30 hours is definitely a commitment but isn't insane, 40 hours is probably pushing it but I'd still say you could do it responsibly. 
---
I was a full time grad student for the last two years and worked a part time job outside of that. Had plenty of time to game ~40 hours a week as well as make sure my SO has plenty of attention and I had time to get outside and hike as much as I wanted. It really just depends on your priorities and time management. 
---
Gold will come back. You are playing the game for fun so if it's fun do it
---

---
Im concerned with the people that don't want to make their character good lol. 
---
I understand that picking specs to make your character unique and build them around how you want to play them. Thats perfectly fine and I think that will be a perfectly viable spec option in classic when it comes out. But if you want to make a meme spec and play a ret palain in 40 man raids... How is that fun for people? How is it fun to be towards the bottom of the charts hitting seal of the casino every 6 seconds and judging? Legit asking. 
---
I'm all for people having fun and doing what they want, but why intentially gimp your character? If you're playing on your own and just doing solo content, sure, but why intentionally slow down other players? 
---
I wouldn't say it's all dead and bland, Barren's soundtrack was very calm and the zone beautiful in its own way. 
---
Weed and video games are the peanut butter and jelly of seemingly harmless vices 
---
This has to be the 400th thread on this subject
---
I agree. There’s really so much more to enjoy in the game other than max level raiding. There’s so many dungeons and professions and zones to quest in. And they’re all available while leveling. 
---
If you ever watched old school WoW Hobbs on YouTube he made great content and power leveled his friends through Scarlet Monastery.     All while never reaching level 60 in Vanilla. 
---
I’m thinking like this. I still love this game, even after 15 years. No need to hurry, it will just burn me out. 
---
If Vanilla were perfect wouldn't it have included the WotLK story line?
---
And you know this how?
---
He said company, not government. The company I work for, huge company, has calendar year as fiscal year but new vacation gets reset at April, as is very common in Sweden.
---
Ruining a very slow annoying escort quest for someone by ganking the group. They somewhat fixed it in TBC after making escort NPCs friendly to opposing faction, before you could just suicide into the escort mob and ruin the day for the whole party.
---
So you're basing the classic experience on a free trial around christmas time? Again not the classic experience. The classic I played had terrible connections, pc problems, and a loot bug that people didnt want to play through, so I only had to compete on quests againt like 3 people at a time and it wasn't that bad.  
---
When the servers were fixed a influx of players came in, but it wasnt a few hundred in the starting zone. 
---
A trial run around CHRISTMAS time isn't a valid representation of what classic looked like. 
---
The only dungeonfinder I will accept in Vanilla is the stone in front of the instance that puts 5 people into a group randomly, without any consideration for composition. And should some addons sprout up that provide a better functionality I fully expect blizzard to break them, they should whitelist addons in the first place imo.
---
I've never been one for squeezing every last drop of performance, efficiency, and power out of a game. It isn't fun for me.
---
But it is fun for some people. They do it because it is enjoyable for them. It's satisfying, and they're having their fun just like you're having yours. It's okay for them to do this, and other than everybody copying their cookie cutter specs, most players are going to fall somewhere in between.
---
It's okay.
---
That’s why I made a guess.  15 days played doesn’t seem too unreasonable given you can do it in just above 4 or take as long as you want.  There’s so much talk about level 60 stuff I feel like it’s glossed over that it takes a looooong time to get there.  At every expansion afterwards, it took a few days/weeks to get to the new cap.  We’re looking at potential months with Classic, and I don’t see a lot of discussion about it.  
---
Exactly. Karazhan, CoT, Emerald Dream, pre-Outland Outlands, and generally what was supposed to be in WOW.
---
And then, they can just re-release some content from newer expansions, maybe in changed order and different rules? Hyjal, the War of the Ancients they promised, the player housing they promised, Old Hillsbrad Foothills scaled up to 40man, Baradin Hold scaled down into 5man, Blackrock Foundry and Blackwing Descent but with some encounters changed.
---
But, they have to keep Vanilla itemization. Better to add new item slot, than to make it back into gearscore-based.
---
Nice going, cheater.
---
&gt; That's crossrealm stuff, which will not exist
---
OP was asking what connected realms are so u/JabbaTheHuttButt answer is correct. And yes Blizz said this won't be in Classic.
---
Also crossrealm is similar to connected realms but not exactly the same, since you can interact with people on connected realms while you can't with cross realm zones that are just more random people being put together from random servers other than those connected, usually in older zones to make them appear more populated than they actually are.
---
???
---
 p servers aren't horizontal content....
---
So basically capitalization and monopoly. Using those less fortunate to fuel your greed.  WoW economics can be very interesting. I believe some people have written thesis’s about it in the past. 
---
well yeah because theres another fresh server every year.
---
Name one vanilla private server that lasted over 2 years and still has a healthy pop
---
You have revised my considerations for class/profession match-ups.
---
Bump
---
They've said they're going to limit addons that do not fit the spirit of Vanilla. A LFG addon will likely not be allowed. My guess is that the addon API is going to be completely blocked from accessing anything that could automate social aspects of the game.
---
Yeah haha, he quit WoW to save the family.
---
&gt; I would farm for primal motes
---
You're either talking about the wrong item or you're in the wrong thread. This is about Vanilla.
---
That’s a distinct possibility given DM was 6 months after release back in 2004/05.  If they stick to original patches, it’s roughly:6/4/3/3/6 months between content stages.  That always felt a little rushed to me back in the day, barring that first/last 6 month break.  
---
This sub is in no way an accurate representation of what the majority of classic playerbase is going to be doing. Most people will not be min maxers and most people will take months to level cap.
---
One can only hope they do BGs right at launch. What a treat that would be. 
---
I fail to see the argument against sharding in starter zones outside of not trusting blizzard to keep it there 
---
on the other hand though, he's 13 years away from becoming a wizard, I'm not a quitter or a coward so I'd say go for it
---
Had the same experience. Used to feel bad I didn't have any irl friends back then, but looking at where all my old friends ended up, I think I got the better end of the deal
---
Nobody, not even blizzard, is talking about sharding the whole game...
---
P servers don't deal with anymore than one populated server, doing something at scale is significantly more difficult than doing one or two. 
---
Undead shadow priest! PvE!
---
Do they use their Devouring Plague spell, in raiding or in dungeons?
---
&gt; well yeah because theres another fresh server every year.
---
And what makes you think Blizzard isn't going to do that? Nobody is just going to sit and farm Naxx forever.
---
But who are you guessing for? It's going to be such a broad range that trying to guess the "average" player's playtime is pointless. You probably won't see as much leveling discussion on a dedicated board like this since it's mostly going to be players ready and waiting to get going.
---
Can't wait, personally. I'm taking a "not speedrunning but not messing about" approach. Do every dungeon at least once, level herb/tailoring alongside my player level, that kinda thing.
---
The worst thing is that even with sharding retail is still laggy af all the time lmao
---
All you hypocrites that come here preaching how your way is the right way to play the game.  
---
Have you cinsidered the fact that different people enjoy different things? A shocking proposition, I know.  
---
Maybe I'm not going to enjoy wasting months trying to get to 60 in a 15 year old game?  
---
Maybe I'm not going to enjoy wiping on easy dungeon bosses.  
---
Maybe I'm not going to enjoy holding back the people I group up with by playing a meme specc.  
---
Its funny how there's litteraly 0 fucking threads about how casual players shouldn't enjoy playing casually and should min max. Instead, its the casual donuts like yourself that make at least a few of these every week. 
---
Hey don’t do that thing you enjoy, do the thing I enjoy instead.
---
Here’s a novel thought; let people play the game exactly how they want to
---
This is why I was that dude who had two computers and two accounts. 
---
Someone steals the node I'm obviously striving my ass off to get to, and then jeers at me when I mention to them how it isn't good etiquette? 
---
I'm hopping on my opposite-faction main and hunting you if I can help it.
---
Having a spy to search their location was great. Then I laughed at them when they were calling out in zone chat about the level 60 hunter camping them. "Sure, buddy. Let me get right on that..."
---
I think this time in Classic will be a more patient me (I'm 34 this year) and have changed my positions a bit on general psychology, free will, and retributive justice making a great deal of sense, but you couldn't tell 20-year old me that doing this felt anything less than amazing.
---
Just looking to get back into the game i once knew and loved and meet some cool people in it like i once had and maybe be able to do guild IRL meets with etc.  
---
NA  
---
PVE or PVP  
---

---

---
Social Experience (hopefully with people who live in Tx or nearby!)  
---
PM  
---
With The Barrens chat, of course it was beautiful!
---
When enough people leave, the "community" is more or less broken. This happened on my old server, where the Alliance side basically upped and died when a few big guilds broke up, and it became a destination for Horde hardcore raiding guilds, and this made the inbalance even worse.
---
Did you read the rest?
---
He's looking for the classes that are best for doing both PvE and PvP without respeccing. 30/0/21 shaman will have to respect in AQ40 and Naxx, in some cases even in BWL.
---
The correct answer to OP's question is holy paladin (possibly holy reck or holy ret), SM ruin warlock, fury warrior, holy or shadow priest (possibly PI) and marks hunter.
---
Damn hipsters. Smh.
---
I’d say that.  Same goes for threat indicators, target frames, and so on.  Just seems weird to have internally developed UI elements that get disabled so you have to go download someone’s copy of the functionality.  
---
I’d rather be able to say “bro, go turn on threat percent in the options menu” than try to convince someone to go download “k-bobs Vanilla Threat meter, please support on patreon”. 
---
everyone watch out, this guy has a BUSINESS DEGREE
---
We don’t need dungeon finder in classic, we need a global LFG channel and working meeting/summoning stones where two people can start summoning. 
---
Shadow Priest in PvE...nice try
---
&gt; or have the population all migrate to a new server with better scripting or a fresh new server.
---
No, the population will just migrate for other shitty reasons, like 'cornerstone guild left', 'server is now 70% horde, game is really shitty when I'm outnumbered 2/1'.
---
&gt; If population drops they'll simply merge servers and the population will be back to normal.
---
Bwahahahaha.
---
Blizzard was incredibly slow at merging servers in Classic, and now, 15 years later, it is still incredibly slow at merging servers.
---
They have a vested interest in charging you $25/character, to get your character off your shitty server.
---
&gt; Only the highest of ilevel epics are even slightly looked up to but even bad players are able to get those.
---
If you think shitters won't be getting carried in Classic, I have a bridge to sell you.
---
It’s because inside he wants to be the best but he knows he never can be, so everyone else should be on his level.
---
I wouldn't do this. The Prot talents aren't totally necessary so instead of gimping yourself a bit in both realms, why not just say the hell with it and tank in your PvP spec? AKA drop the Deflection for Improved Hamstring and just go down the Fury line like normal (Demo Shout, Piercing Howl, Blood Craze, Enrage) 
---
&gt; People talking about BiS gear, never played vanilla and think it’s as easy as retail.
---
I don't think that's an accurate statement
---
Tuesday is the start of the raid week, as they reset Monday night/Tuesday morning. A lot of guilds didn't raid on Tuesdays because there would often be extended server maintenance on Tuesdays.
---
You dropped this —&gt; /s
---
I'll be some dwarves pet if he likes dik.
---
There isnt one. Assuming a full server at launch (2500) equally spread across all races, thats 312 characters PER RACE. This gets even worse when you realize Orc/Troll start together (I think a couple Alliance races do too?)
---
&gt; There will be no loot shop
---
I agree with you.  However, I don't think they'll be spread about evenly like the OP hypothesized.  I'm thinking they might have DM be released sooner than the others.  But I definitely think the stages will be released slow for two reasons: (1) max profits from Classic and (2) allow immersion.
---
Nah, but I attempted it. I got to rank 13 and was about a week and half into the last push and my internet went out for 3 days. My realm's queue times for alliance were usually 20-30 minutes, and BGs ceased outright around 3am or so because the alliance/horde ratio was so out of whack, so catching up was impossible. If you didn't participate in *every* BG as an ally, it was just impossible.
---
I dropped to rank 12 after Tuesday downtime and I was incredibly upset about it. I knew I didn't have it in me to put in another month and a half of grinding, so I went to Brill with a friend of mine and racked up DKs until I was all the way down to Private. Never pvped on my hunter after that. Switched to my paladin, managed to get rank 10 with him, never pushed past that, though.
---
Happened to a guildie of mine as well. Rank 13 priest likely, on his last week of the grind, motherboard fried, couldn't replace it immediately, dropped a rank, lost his mind. Went on a big rant about how poorly designed the system was, how Blizzard devs are morons, etc. Got forum banned and in-game banned for a bit after calling out hordies. He just quit playing outright as far as I know.
---
Our Horde had it easy. They had instant queues, a premade that took turns with High Warlord (and would blacklist anyone that tried to get more honor than they were allowed that week) and until the Deserter debuff got added, they'd /afk out if they were about to die and then just insta join right back into the same BG.
---
for Blizz to make a Classic WotLK, they would first have to see that a Classic TBC was a success.
---
To make a Classic TBC, then our Classic will have to be successful.
---
If everything comes up roses, a Classic TBC is at least 4-5 years away and that's assuming there will be sufficient *new* player demand for it.
---
Getting to Classic WotLK is an incredible 100-to-1 longshot.
---
It also lets servers have a healthy population, once 90% of the tourists leave.
---
When a server launches with 2,500 people, and 90% of them leave over the next three weeks, you have a dead server.
---
When a server launches with 25,000 people, it is unplayable.
---
When a server launches with 25,000 people, with sharding across low-level zones, you'll both be able to play the game, AND have a healthy server pop six months down the road.
---
Hiiiiiiii I can be your pet if you want
---
&gt; as a prot warrior you are fairly hard to dismount
---
Isn't daze chance the same for everyone if your back is turned?
---
Thanks for the answer :)
---
A tuesday start would probably work out better for me, so I am happy to hear that.
---
uhhhhhhh
---
That would be nice but I may be talking out of my ass here I think some of the gear messes up progression.  
---
No sarcasm it's hypergamy and its a real thing lol
---
Is that Tiffany?
---
Gnomes and dwarves. I will be perfectly fine if as soon as I step into loch Modan, there’s no sharding. Also I expect them to remove sharding from starter zones after a week.
---
I thought wizardom was 30?
---
Sure there can be some women who are like that, but that’s definitely doesn’t make up the majority. You can’t just lump all women into one category like that
---
You can use devouring plague in dungeons. In raids it won't be allowed because it's better to let a warlock use corruption if a debuff slot is free.
---
Good luck friend
---
I’m in the same boat as far as life stage. My wife still hates the game, she thinks it’s super demonic. I want to play soooo bad but I know it’s going to cause fights.
---
I don't really remember how it was back in vanilla but from what I've seen I think it's better? Make a human on moonguard and go to goldshire. Its pretty crowded and runs smooth for me
---
If your first trinket wasn't Carrot on a Stick, you didn't Classic.
---
Can't think of anything that hasn't happened a million times. Maybe just people being dicks to druids. Not being allowed a chance to roll on leather items. While healing being blamed for DPS players deaths when the tank was low level and couldn't attract hate. The usual stuff.
---
Thats genius he must have some serious willpower, i would be so tempted to just go ding
---
That might end up being optimal.  To be honest I'm not sure how much I'll be PvPing versus PvEing, so I'll probably let my tendencies help inform my final spec.
---
Or maybe I'll just level an alt to PvP with and go all-in on Prot with my Warrior.  Still kinda undecided.
---
Nah man, we all base our class choices on the Tier 3 set bonuses. Pssh, its only then that the game is even fun.
---
Gotta be Warlock.
---
Someone on r/wow gave me an idea to repost that here. That’s the true Classic home after all. 
---
Gottem. Nice work soldier!
---
Always do duskwood for that sweet long Watchmasters Cloak :-)
---
A little over 60 right now. Looking to have near 100 for release to account for many retail players never reaching 60.
---
I don't remember that being phased out. I do remember the Lv1 twinks with Crusader or +20 Spell Dmg on their White Lv 1 Dagger. That was funny to see. 
---
You can almost smell the Cheetos dust
---
Transforming into a bear and then back into a night elf to heal yourself then transforming back into a bear all while you are being stabbed and shot and hacked apart and then healing on the spot must be really disorienting.
---
Imagine actually being your druid and doing all of that.
---
The story about your brother is absolutely crazy and deserves more attention in this thread
---
What possibly could go wrong
---
Who would have ever thought that having status fame and wealth would convey social advantages to their owners? Shock.
---
Just do it man. It's a quick setup and you've got nothing to lose. It's so much fun to test out classes/races you wouldn't normally play.
---
I remember trying for r14 on my shaman after rolling on a new server that was created relatively late in vanilla. I managed to get to r12 and was almost definitely going to rank up to 13 but they didn’t calculate the honor the last week before they switched to a new honor system. I was pretty annoyed at the switch in general, had they waited a few weeks I might have made it r14. 
---
But then I needed money for bills in college so a year or so later I sold the account. Still kind of sour about that bad decision to this day. 
---
Yep, enjoy the cycle while you're on it - it may seem glacial, but it is slowly moving towards melting away beneath you
---
Know someone who broke up with his girlfriend, because she visited him and on the first night his guild first killed Chromaggus in BWL, which he could not forgive himself for not participating because he had to spend time with her. The only first kill he missed until the end of WOTLK. Oh. Old times, setting priorities.
---
Your wife is literally forbidding you but you're still here on this sub reddit? Damn dude.

---
I game when I got spare time that’s  0-2h/day maximum.  I got to wait until kids are asleep. I got to get up next day for my work.  And I got to skip gaming some days to spend time with my wife. 
---
When I was at uni I spent a semester playing wow.  It almost led med in to a divorce. 
---

---

---
In that order and you will be fine 
---
&gt; I was pretty annoyed at the switch in general, had they waited a few weeks I might have made it r14. 
---
I feel you. The whole system is a mess, and with Blizzard breaking something every other week or servers dying, or just changing it outright, it just made it that much worse to plan around. It was probably the most frustrating grind I've ever done in a game. Looking back I wish I would have never attempted it, it was just a miserable couple of months.
---
I can say with 100% confidence that I will not be attempting it again.
---
Yeah it certainly would. But at the same time unadultered PVP without twinks would be a wonder to experience. 
---
Yeah I can see where that’s the beginning of a bad thing. I think for me, the improvements in the specs to make them more viable out weighs any other negative things.
---
One of my favorite memories of vanilla.  My roommate and I were leveling in Duskwood and he comes running by me in game and from the other room he’s yelling “aaahhhhhh, what’s his name is on me, mob on me, bin laden, osama bin laden agroed me from Afghanistan, ahhhhh!!”
---
I’m liking how worn the backpedal key is :P #backpedaling4lyfe
---
&gt; Sadly when something is brought up enough times, its bound to get pushed through sooner or late, regardless of it is actually a good thing or not.
---
If only this was true for CPTSD, which still hasn't been included... Fuck the DSM committee.
---
For what it's worth, I agree with you about all this. I'm a person who has a tendency to become addicted to things. The problem isn't whatever it is I've latched onto at any particular time. The problem is (1) executive dysfunction issues make it difficult for me to initiate the things I really should be doing, which causes a lot of anxiety + (2) I don't have healthy self-soothing skills, so the more anxious I become the more strongly I get sucked into things that make me feel good (WoW, shopping, orgasms, alcohol, junk food, reddit) to try and block out the anxiety. Unsurprisingly, this only causes more anxiety because I'm still not doing what I should be doing, which makes it even more difficult to stop the feel-good behavior, which becomes more and more compulsive, until I'm fully addicted and my life is being completely destroyed because I can do/think about nothing else...
---
It's so dumb. I've been doing this same song and dance over and over for my whole life, and I wouldn't have to if I just figured out how to keep on top of my responsibilities and manage my anxiety in healthier ways.
---
I know everyone recommends complete abstinence for addicts, but I don't think it's the right solution to just avoid all the things I enjoy. It doesn't address the problem, it just robs me of the things I enjoy. So, I'm working on those skills now, and I'll be in therapy when Classic drops for additional help (and accountability). 👍 
---
What's crazier is this isn't the first or last time I've heard of this sort of thing happening.
---
dont care virgin
---
Cool find!
---
You can’t really have a monopoly unless you create a huge barrier to entry to other sellers.  Huge prices in WoW are just a mechanic of demand being high and supply being relatively fixed.  Ie fixed spawns of black lotus, large thorium veins, etc.  But even then you’re talking an exchange of labor. 
---
The REAL interesting bit is how classes farm and the relative worth of their labor.  If I can farm DM with a hunter for 150g/hour, why would I farm thorium for 100?  But if I’m Druid, what are my alternatives?  
---
Maybe something like this then:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BSMzefQNATAD8ASg
---
Trades 1 point in deflect and 2 in 2-h weap spec. to grab Hamstring.
---
Like you said, at that point I'm pretty strongly considering sticking with my straight PvP spec.  My leveling spec is going to be pretty close to the flat PvP spec anyway, so basically my intent is to stick with it as long as it works.  If I start to feel like I need the mitigation or threat to run the endgame 5-mans I'll probably roll into that hybrid spec, but if I end up getting by just fine as full Arms, then that'll be the plan.
---
I think more people twink out at 39 than 49 so the competition in the BGs would be greater.   
---
Since I'll be doing a pvp server, the primary driving factor for fast levelling is not getting stuck in contested zones because the allies on my server happen to consider ganking lowbies to be their endgame content.
---
I appreciate the risks that pvp realms bring and the player driven content that results from it, but I don't want it to affect my raid preparation plans.
---
Reminds me of me in tbc, I changed servers with few guildies and went on "trial run" with guild we we're supposed to join(deal before server hop). We went with easy boss - void reaver.
---
Us 4-5 ppl, dressed in mostly kara/hc/craftables were all in top 10 dps with our previous guild leader (rogue) topping meters and me (shadow priest) dying 3 times (we did 2 pulls cause we overaggroed boss few times, i did pull his aggro like 5 times in whole fight) and still being 2nd dps. I logged in next morning before university, 3 of us are now class leaders o.0?!? With our tips, guild we joined went from 12th in progress on ally to no.2 in about 2-3 months.

I don't think so. I know in vanilla, as in blizzard official 2004-06 (not pserver experience) I always could run through packs of mobs without getting dazed far more frequently than most of my softbellied companions. There is no mention of it having the same chance on all people in the wiki. Since daze can only be applied to people facing away from the mob, and it discusses the mobs weapons skill vs the player defense skill I assume that would make a prot warrior harder to daze than anyone else. For reference:  [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Daze](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Daze) 
---
Im surprised no one mentioned the druid moonglow build. Its a resto/balance hybrid. I played this for one of the private servers and enjoyed it. I was healing all 5 man/MC/BWL easily. And was doing pvp on the side as well. Imo the build scales even better with gear once you get higher crit. But its good regardless.

It looks something like this. You can move some talent points around specially in the balance tree. You just want the moonglow and natures grace.
---
They already introduce t0.5 and 1.10 items such a executioners helm and drakki turban later. So there really is no reason for them to not introduce the BGs and just unlock the epic gear from WSG and AB later.

&gt; How much more difficult is it to gear a 49 twink than a 39?
---
Slightly more, as it's easier to get a friend to solo 39 and under dungeons for you, 49 means you may need two friends. Depends on the friend/class.
---
&gt; Any general advice from those who have played in either bracket?
---
39 was faster queues, 49 was less frustrating to play (mounts) but  had really long queues a lot of the time.
---
My advice, try out 39, see how you like it. Play some good music or watch a show while you play, because those treks from farm to stables are going to kick your ass. The nice thing about starting there is, if you don't like it, you've got a head start on twinking out 49.
---
God no fuck off
---
As much as i don't want sharding it is needed... you gotta remember the Release of Wow Classic will be almost as big as the actual Release. and if you were there it was HELL! Supper annoying and unplayable.. this is just a way to divide you up into a bit of smaller groups.. Trust me on this.. you don't even NOTICE a difference
---
That might be a good solution.

Multiple women leaving their husbands for someone in their guild (usually the MT).
---
Hot take: Most women *are* like Ross describes on some level or another, but most *men* are likewise shallow about the attributes of their partner, especially appearance. Go look at the thread earlier this week asking if "Horde was a sausagefest" because it would seem likely that female players would choose the "prettier" or "good guy" races, only for the top-rated response to mention that "most Horde women are fat", as though what a human's body looks like is even 1% relevant to a text/voice-based M.M.O.R.P.G. with an avatar.
---
It's not simply that women are uncharitable to less appealing men, or that men are uncharitable to less appealing women, so much as HUMANS are generally shit to ONE ANOTHER: no gender specifics needed. Life is about passing on genes, this process is extremely competitive, and no one succeeds at competition without someone else failing. For one person to be the winner, someone else has to be the loser, but we all take turns winning and losing (some more than others) based on the lottery of nature/nurture they were born with/into. The Universe isn't fair, we all suck more than we'd like to admit, and you'll occasionally see someone like Ross whinging about it.
---
If you are familiar with Linux then it's not massively hard. You'll \*need\* to install Wine-staging + dxvk and I would \*strongly\* recommend Lutris as it ties in with [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) almost seamlessly and removes a lot of micro-management with the installs and the like. There are tons of guides on the net, just Google "Lutris" and carry on from there.
---
I'm not much of a redditor so I don't know if this platform supports private messaging but if so then you can also slide me a message if you get stuck.
---
19, 29, and 39 are the most popular twink brackets.
---
Society sure isn’t better, but hopefully most of those who make it to max level in classic do so because they love it and we see less of this, but sadly there will still be this element to some degree or another.
---
I shudder when I think of the times one person quitting a 5 man scholo or strat because an early boss didn't drop the item they wanted.
---
any news about classic? when is it supposed to be out? bfa was poop with the incremental grinding crap
---
Check his reddit history and ban him please. Filthy spammer.
---
Your explanation on the benefits of sharding are accurate, but let's make one thing extra clear: nobody wants sharding for 6 months. That will significantly hurt the game. Not saying that you meant that, just making sure people know that sharding is best handled in as short a time frame as possible (1 - 2 weeks maximum, ideally).
---
I'm better at moderation now than I was back then.  It will also mean I'll likely only have one character at max level with decent gear, rather than 3-4.
---
Battle net has always been a pain in the ass with wine, wow in particular also requires more resources so you need a beefier than usual pc.  
---
  I won't personally do it as I already need to use windows for various things, but expect it to have a lot of issues at launch, specially since they're basically tinkering with a modern client.  
---
I think we had very different experiences in terms of queue times mainly. By the time cross server BGs came out queue times for me became very quickly and we coordinated, via ventrillo, for effectively a premade AV group and that’s how I got a vast majority of my honor. I’d be willing to say, going off your comment, that it probably took significantly less time for me to get to r12 than you experienced. 
---
That being said I experienced through AQ40 on Alliance in PvE and r12 PvP for Horde so I’ve felt like I hit most of the milestones I wanted to. Now I’m not sure what I’m gonna do but whatever it is my focus will be on just having fun. I doubt I have the time to go hard with either PvP or PvE any longer but we shall see. The wife has been a lot more accommodating with my playtime (on a pserver) than I ever thought possible. 
---
Let me know how that pessimism works out for you bud lol. All it takes in life is optimism, faith, and a little discipline and you will get all you need to be happy. Your views of life are naive, most likely the effect of a stunted psychological growth. 
---
we dont want that crap, go away plz
---
Try being the guy that is telling your friends and family they your gonna try and play both classic and retail.

Hey those bracers are no slouch! They should be blue, or they are blue in my heart.
---
My best friend.  I had moved west to a major city and was enjoying it after growing up in small towns, and suggested he come out here and find work too now that he’d just graduated high school.
---
He was always a diligent, sharp funny and clean guy.  He worked part time all of high school and saved upwards of $20,000+.  So he moved to my city, and I got him a place to live , with my other friend who rented him a room in a house.
---
I showed him wow when he came... he was instantly hooked.  He was supposed to find work, but 3-4 months in he was still just playing wow, smoking pot and drinking.
---
Eventually, I started noticing big shifts in him.  He stopped answering calls.  My other friend would say he wouldn’t see him during the day and just hear him up all night.  
---
Weeks passed and I’d see him online but he would barely even respond to me there... I kept asking to hang out and he’d ignore me which really weirded me out.
---
I finally went to the house to confront him and see what was going on... I was shocked.
---
His room was literally piled with garbage, both bagged and strewn.  His desk and bed were covered with black garbage bags and beer cans.  But the saddest part, was the little ‘nest’ he had made himself.  On the hardwood floor... where he had moved his computer, and would lay, play and sleep,  only leaving to smoke and bio.
---
I talked to him.  He was out of money, had racked up his credit card completely, and was behind on the rent paying my friend.  There was nothing I could do...
---
I called his mom... they drove 14hrs and came and picked him up.  Cleaned out his room and took him back home.
---
He rehabilitated, but was never the same.  He was never happy again.  And struggled with addiction like I never knew prior.  
---
Love the guy to death.  He’s doing a lot better now.  He moved out to a farm, and lives there with minimal tech and helps ranchers in the area for work.  But I’ll always remember that very dark time.
---
by the way ... are they adding the zone scaling to classic?
---
I stopped playing wow, got into shape, and have a stable relationship. This current life is less fun than being addicted to wow and I can’t wait to go back. 
---
The grass is always greener on the other side I guess.
---
He’s not ordering, he’s just reading the menu.

We absolutely do not want BGs at launch. There is a nice difference between pre-BG and post-BG PvP experience in Vanilla that we want to preserve. Post-BG life means a lot of people farm HKs in battleground premades, which is fun. But before BGs release, people only had world PvP to farm HKs, meaning players would organize community battlegrounds such as the famous "Battle for Hillsbrad" and others. The intensity and necessity of these events is lessened when BGs come out so hopefully BGs come out with the second phase release. 
---
Is this a fucking joke or what
---
It will probably work fine with Lutris
---
Just join world or make your own chat channel. 
---
   People always forget how free the chat system is in this game.  
---
10k pop on launch divided roughly evenly across the starting zones and their follow-up zones means there are only some hundreds of players in a zone. Private servers shard their zones these days (ie. every zone runs as a separate instance in a separate thread). Hosting some hundreds of players in one shard is not an insurmountable problem.
---
The real issue is that the game becomes unplayable at those numbers, because vanilla was never designed with such numbers in mind. There simply aren't enough mobs to go around, and quest objective respawn timers are too long. This is the real reason it's necessary to shard/phase zones. If you're familiar with private server launches with such huge populations, you'll know this to be true (though you may not admit it to be an issue).
---
nothing of that would take more than 5 years.
---
Unless there is a super-casual completionist who is leveling a family of alts.
---
29, 19 and 39 are the most popular, in that order.
---
Don't burn yourself out. Wait for classic to drop.
---
there was one server that implemented some new raids, wasn'T there?
---
I watched some of your video, you had good movement and use of grenades. You were definitely very skilled and I can see why your view of Vanilla is the way it is but your clips were recorded 2 months before TBC. I had already played the game for over a year, and been quit for almost a year, by then. You played after everyone had years of experience to draw upon, after tons of PVP videos had been released teaching everyone how to play. The last 2 months of Vanilla were not "the epitome of Vanilla PVP," there were 24 before them.
---
Rifleluvin, I only watched the first but he swaps his bars via scroll and backpedals...
---
Laintime, I only watched the first but he just hid his crosshair. You can see him digging around in his character sheet...
---
Drakedog, skilled but warlock is kinda boring to watch and they use few spells compared to other classes so it was relatively easy for them to avoid clicking.
---
Wheeliecool &amp; Champ, skilled, and a great movie, but released less than 7 months before TBC, way after Namishin was done filming his video.
---
World of Roguecraft was released less than 5 months before TBC, Vanilla was already all but over by then.
---
Anyway, the opening scene to Pat is unbelievably cool, and he was good for the time(2005). Clicking itself was not that big of a deal back then. I mean you played on Avatar's server (though I think he had transferred off months before your PVP video was recorded). Avatar released PVP videos winning duels while literally clicking through his spell book. And he went on to win multiple rank1 arena titles and play in Blizz tournaments. I, a hunter, with tons of binds, was hitting number key binds all the way out to 9(that one needed my thumb). I had shift modifiers bound way out too and I literally thought at the time "fuck I am running out of good keys to bind (no gaming mice etc. back then), fuck it ill just click all the long cooldowns and shit I rarely use rather than use an awkward keybind." Was I a newb? [https://i.imgur.com/x7OznJH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/x7OznJH.jpg) I dunno maybe, but my main healbot, Tigerlady, was a druid that clicked nothing in Vanilla (druids had few spells needed, like warlocks), and he went on to win 2 rank1 arena titles. In Vanilla, I did fine against him in duels and he never said, "oh I can't healbot you, you just clicked Deterrence."
---
Anyway, cheers mate, thanks for sharing your PVP video.
---
what if we get that improvements, without a level cap raise?
---
512 mb master race reporting. I literally could not use zeppelins. It would finish loading durotar and take me right to the loading screen for going back to Trisfal. Eventually I had my friend log in to my account and walk off the zepp lol
---
Maximize the downvotes!
---
As far as I'm concerned the epic dreadsteed is a significant part of the flavor, and thus appeal, of playing a warlock in the first place. Same for the paladin/charger.
---
Ah yes the Z board i remember this on sale for like 60$ next to the pins and trading cards. back when wow had like 7 million players and i was 11 and i didnt have looming debt, good times. 
---
It's basically the same as a R14 equipping his phat 2hander sword but crappy gear in the rest of the slots.
---
Just e-peening that you can compete in an efficient manner even though one gimps himself.

Or this one shaman just dueling naked:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeqFABd4590&amp;t=5s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeqFABd4590&amp;t=5s) 
---
I think the saddest part is that minus the flying thing (and the DK race restrictions), I would actually be pretty stoked for this. 
---
Beating Naxx to unlock Death Knights as a playable class? How fucking rad would that be? They even would have extra design space since there's no such thing as the "vanilla" DK - they could polish the original pre-Cata-normalisation idea and that sounds dooooooooope.
---
Could not do any harm lol? I get what you're saying and I'm not diminishing it, rather you're just looking in the wrong place. I think what you really want is a TBC server, which would be great right?? But this is classic wow, and adding TBC+ things just diminishes its shine
---
How offensive can this spec play for the priest? 
---
A married couple was in our guild, and the wife cheated with another guy in the guild.  We gkicked the wife and her boyfriend.  Everyone felt really sorry for the husband.
---
Yeah I get that it’s not as fun as wow, but it’s gotta be more rewarding in some sense ya know?
---
i remember playing since early 2005, then talking a couple of RL friends into trying it. in order to make grouping easier, one guy rolled a tank, i was a priest, and my other buddy a sham.  we leveled up to 60 and then started running end-game dungeons, and even got to MC a couple of times.
---
right around this time i also became a father.  i'd wait for my wife and newborn son to fall asleep, then sneak into my den to fire up wow and get into a dungeon.  i would then hear my son start to cry, but i couldn't help him because.. well, i was main healer.  i'd eventually ask my party to give me a few minutes and i could check on him, but my wife was already up feeding him.  oh the guilt and self-examination.
---
so i quit.
---
i've already made plans to play with my sham friend when classic releases, and i am promising myself to limit playtime.  both of my kids are grown up, and honestly i can't stay up past midnight anymore.
---
i guess we'll see what happens.
---
Yup, you could absolutely do this with tranquil air too, as long as you're not in a group with the tank.  I've never been in a melee group that wanted tranquil air over grace of air though.
---
Not vanilla, but as a priest I used to really, really, really love using leap of faith to cause my guildies to run off a ledge, in lava, whatever.
---
What’s that undershirt?
---
If cross realm BGs aren't implemented then both brackets will probably quickly die on most servers unless blizzard sets the population cap extremely high (more than 5k cap). I've seen it time and time again on extremely populated private servers, struggling to get games going in either bracket even when there are 7k+ characters online after the server has been out for more than four months or so. But 39 always is more populated and survives longer.
---
Mounts reduce downtime resulting in more actual PvP. Makes WSG a lot more balanced also.
---
It's more difficult to gear a 49 than a 39 because the dungeons are harder to get carried through.
---
Exactly. They're looking at repeating the selfsame mistake that kneecapped RPvP's potential and initially established its reputation as such a niche thing in the first place.
---
Here's hoping they reverse course on this decision and actually give us a chance to prove our numbers right out the gate this time 'round.
---
No I just didn't have good gear nor pocket healers, but whatever.
---
Curious to see your youtube channel where I could see your awesome warrior skills ...
---
Red dragonscale protector off of Vael. 
---
Prior to Lutris I would have agreed strongly with this but their Battle.net integration is so strong now that it may well work flawlessly, even on Day 0. Or not of course, such is the nature of Linux gaming but it certainly does a great job with other Battle.net stuff and although I've never tried it with WoW personally I do hear good things.
---
A good test would be to install Lutris, get your house in order and then install the current client through that. If that works then the new client likely will too as they shouldn't really be changing much that would matter at that level.
---
There have been many servers that added content that went no where, wasn't balanced etc. and died. I don't see how that's proof of concept.
---
Just because you can do it doesn't mean it's going to work with the setup of classic. Tacking on horizontal content to a game that's about themepark progression doesn't work as well as doing it to a sandbox.
---
I had 3.8k hp when I entered mc. 
---
Yes Southshore versus Tarren Mill is fun, for a while. If BGs aren’t until many months after launch it won’t be fun PVPing for honor when there’s a bunch of people with Sulfuras running around. I guess there needs to be a fine balance. 
---
Yep. It was a grind. We regularly ran 6, ended up running more dungeons and getting the pre-raid BiS pieces which are absolutely fine even better at times, especially after DM is released.
---
Money weed wow pussy 
---
Why has it taken so long for Blizzard to release Classic when underground private server communities with little funding and no legacy game developers released multiple versions that work just fine and are almost 100% accurate the original Vanilla?
---
Side question: I can download a pserver version which is 5GB, install it, and log in to play in under 10 minutes. I'm assuming since classic will be part of the retail WoW client, that I will have to install 60GB+ of WoW content just to be able to get in and play classic, right?
---
Gnome Rogue here. See you in game; Be prepared - wait, who're we kidding? Each 2min res timer is going to give you hours to prepare..
---
_waves_
---
I mean, not really. But I would like to level at least 4 to start with, and will almost certainly hit more (including opposite faction etc.) My main will do rep grinds and pet grinds purely for fun. Certain alts will also do certain grinds. Hell, something I can see myself doing for decades is logging on and herbing/mining. I find it weirdly relaxing.
---
But even someone who just wanted to level one of each class. 8 classes. Say 10 days /played (dungeons, a bit of exploration and crafting, but not massive slacking - note I certainly expect to take longer . . . ) Let's assume they manage a relatively life-friendly timetable: 4hrs at weekends and a couple of sessions during the week. Say 15hrs a week? 
---
That's 16 weeks to level one alt. 128 weeks to level 8 alts (approx two and a half years). Just levelling. No raiding, PvP, rep grinds, rare farms, not much crafting . . .
---
Realistically people are not likely to play like that. They'll level alts alongside other activities. It could easily take 5yrs just to get 8 classes to 60 and clear raid content on a main.
---
you can tell its a code because the first letter of every sentence is capitalized 
---
Hm :/
---
I always run so I don’t do the other person’s work.  Even in retail, I won’t be doing someone else’s bidding.
---
(Says a person playing a game that’s dedicated to fulfilling quests to do other’s bidding.  Oh the irony.)
---
He I actually have said no to sex to finish a raid once.   *confession*
---
That‘s pretty hardcore. I hope everything went to the positive as time moved on.
---
Wasn’t /4 looking for group?
---
The war for names is coming soon..
---
I have. The private servers are waaay off on the important things, mob locations, spawn densities of mobs and nodes, respawn timers of everything. Unless you think the "feel" of the new client is somehow more important than the availability of black lotus and arcane crystals, private servers are way wrong. Private servers are no less or more responsive client side than retail on my rig, maybe it's time you upgrade your PC?
---
Well...if the goal is to Heal in a raid, and be able to use some Elemental skills for farming while using your healing set, then probably something like this  
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0uVZZxcfzAeoo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0uVZZxcfzAeoo) 
---
or this  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hVfuVZZxcfzAeoo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hVfuVZZxcfzAeoo) 
---
The second one would probably be better because more resistances for raids and better escape with earth totems.
---
Less mana for lightning bolt could be ok, but meh...just for farming, not a big deal.
---
Also remember that Nature's Swiftness isn't just for instant big heals.  You can also use it for instant chain lightning to the face!!!
---
Now this isn't setup for pvp or anything like that.  
---
This is basically basic farming as ele.  
---
Fresh lightning shield
---
2 Lightning bolts while mob closes in
---
Flameshock
---
drop searing totem
---
melee auto attack with flametongue until dead while regen mana.  Healing gear will have +spirit and MP5, so you'll be full mana by end of fight.
---
This spec will give you some good Lightning bolt damage and +11% crit of Lightning bolt and CL just from talents.
---
Plus your searing totem will get some extra damage.
---
Plus your healing set should have quite a bit of +Healing and Spell damage gear which will increase all of your abilities.  
---
Lightning shield
---
Flame shock
---
Lightning bolt
---
Fire totem
---
Flametongue weapon
---
All of these skills are increased by +spell power.  Some of them may not be affected that much, but they all  benefit from it.
---
Now if this was my Shaman, I would personally just go with whatever the main stream deep raid healing spec is, and still farm as Ele...but I'm a weirdo and do things people don't understand sometimes, but I have fun and enjoy challenges too, so in the end it's up to you really.  
---
Oof. This reminds me of the first time I leveled through WPL and stumbled on Uthur's Tomb. I loved his character and accidentally finding his tomb while randomly running through zones just shook me. Didn't have a reaction like that for any of the "big wc3 heroes" ie - Jaina, Thrall, Cairne, etc
---
I was thinking fresh 60. Something from 5/10 mans
---
Wel kind of long story so I’ll be brief.  Had a bunch of irl friends who played same server alliance side.  One of my buddy’s was lucky enough to be given the eye for hand of rag and 10 sulfuron ingots.  He logged in few days later and the ingots were gone.  Blizzard wouldn’t do anything for him since they were mailed from his account.  they also would not tell him who they were mailed to. 
---
Found out years later another irl friend had stolen them and sold them to a guild for full t2.5 gear....   no one talks to that guy anymore since everyone was super excited to get to use hand of rag when it was still a bad ass weap..
---
Don’t account share even with your best friends.
---
I also never had any lag at all for the ~6 months that I played Legion. Dunno what that guy is talking about.
---
Why would you have to shift out of bear at all? If youre tanking a 5 man you'll have a healer
---
hi, first post here, looking forward to classic. It's been a long time. 
---
I've decided to roll an orc rogue to pick something completely unlike what I have played before. 
---
I want a non-dagger combat/sub spec that works for pvp as well as pve, with talents in as many 'useful' abilities as possible... does this sound dumb? 
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/AQwEDPHyBATPjQ8R](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/AQwEDPHyBATPjQ8R) 
---
are there any essentials I am missing?
---
cheers
---
Best part about Classic servers, in my opinion, is that every item will drop correctly from mobs, and all mobs will have correct abilities and stats. Every quest will be named the way they were in vanilla, and work as intended again. No more renaming quests cause there's a lack of information. No more stats based on guesses. 
---
Would echo the sentiments from previous posters. I played a rogue twink that I leveled and pvp’d with as a side project while waiting for people to log in for raids and had more fun at 39 than 49. 
---
Not having to deal with Mortal Strike warriors is great. 
---
There are certain addons it makes sense for and others it doesn’t make sense for
---
&gt; 5/4 release date confirmed
---
Official blue post said Summer and that starts in June ...
---
Haha should eBay close to classic launch for mucho dinero!
---
tiffany thompson use for science only
---
nahh..it's overkill.  Void Sac is good enough.  I've leveled enough Locks to know not to waste the talents.  But you do you BooBoo lol
---
So what was this bad boy's name?
---
There really aren't many good healing shields until ZG or the tier .5 patch.
---
There is a quest in the plaguelands that gives a blue +int shield, but I can't remember the name.
---
hang on... nothing in your post about whether or not you’ll duel me? you really are bad lmao. 
---
Blizz frequently uses celtic and gaelic imagery and themes; Beltane is 5/1. 5/4 confirmed
---
I...looted the head of broodlord. I asked multiple times in the raid chat if I could (being a hopelessly ignorant 15 year old), didn't see any relevant response in the chat, I took it. Suddenly I was enemy number 1, and kicked from the raid. Apparently another Hunter, also a new recruit, took it the next week. I wasn't g kicked then, I went on to raid AQ40.
---
I can see it.
---
Before there was LFG and linked trade chats, my server had a “endgame” channel that anyone could join. So it didn’t matter where you were you could look for people for a Strat, scholo, or ubrs runs. 
---
Wait..... why would you be resto if you're never shifting out of bear? Is the point not to be healing yourself? Is he asking about being resto spec and just tanking anyway?
---
The collectors items and unobtainable mounts might not be a concern if you still have to buy a pack for the same amount as in vanilla (with inflation of course) , and the codes you get are random like it was back then. If you can pick and choose from a virtual store front, that's when i see it becoming a problem though.
---
standard fc spec will can tank 5mans(threat talent) heal raids &amp; dungeons &amp; most importantly has the best talents for fc in wsg
---
This is amazing lmao. Your dad is a fucking badass.   How many expansions did you guys play through? 
---
Not if you have 4 SW:P on you
---
Gearing depends on the class you are going to choose. Some can use lots of BoEs, some need many items from dungeons.
---
I plan on doing 5x39, 4x49 really hope those bgs are available :D
---
Hope they have got a solution for dying or unbalanced servers.
---
Something like first search at same server and after x minutes search in a realmpool would be great.
---
X gon give it to ya.
---
I found this thread looking to answer this question. I have been testing it out on a p server with a friend who is also rogue.
---
Someone is always backstabbing, and most of the time, the mob just spins because of threat going back and forth. It seems to be better than combat swords, but I'm not sure how that will change as we level. Extra mob health, the abundance of swords vs daggers, and better talents have the possibility of changing things up in a big way.  
---
Luckily neither me or my girlfriend want kids and she games a lot to. 
---
Telling others what is right way to enjoy game, don't be that guy.
---
&gt; I want to play and have fun,
---
Go all out bro. When you think about it, the average human lifespan is so short in the big picture that you can only do a handful of things. Do what excites you the most now. You'll do all the other stuff you missed in your next life.
---
For all I know, Classic ain't comin' back for a 3rd time around so we might as well take it all in now while we have the last chance.
---
I sure hope so dude!
---
Plus, its not like I didn't learn from when I actually played Vanilla.  My first toon took 16-17 days to hit 60. My second took 7.5 and my third took 6.5, as you figured shit out you got better and faster at the game.  All of that happened before I started min/maxing things too. 
---
It wasn't anything super weird to help out other Locks was it? I wouldn't expect a newer client to have any impact on it. Unless I'm wrong and you were doing super weird buggy stuff.  
---
I have the box and CDs, but unfortunately i threw that game guide away, altho I remember taking it with me around the world as a child on holiday as reading material 😁
---
The most logical answer is to say *"we're going to shard for [about] one week and then shut it off completely"*. 
---
Players have made it painfully clear that they don't want sharding, and devs have said they're listening.

Guilty. Can't wait to do it again in Classic

DBM always felt like a bit of an encounter design failure on blizzards part, like encounters are built around a stopwatch, but bosses were never very good about telegraphing their own moves.

Not sure what all is in quest helper.  “!” Icons for quest givers more than 4 levels below you?  That’s a good toggle.  Highlighting areas on the map where you have to go?  That’s pushing it.  Not sure how much worse it got before you hit cataclysm’s “forget talking to npcs, your quests now autoupdate where ever you are like a voice is talking in your head.”
---
I want to have a arch nemesis this time around.  I'm usually pretty passive while leveling on a pvp server, so I plan on remembering the first person to gank me while leveling and then hold a grudge against them for the rest of time. Just kill them on sight and camp whenever possible. 
---
I ate a big red candle.
---
As a priest and rogue I'm used to:
---
1 2 3 4 5 6 (most common skills)
---
Shift-1 Shift-2 Shift-3 Shift-4 Shift-5 (next most common or combo finishers as a rogue)
---
Ctrl-1 Ctrl-2 Ctrl-3 Ctrl-4 (less common skills/longer cast time (group heals)/higher CDs)
---
F1 F2 F3 F4 (buffs)
---
Personally I prefer the BGs without mounts, so 19,29,39 are the options I'm looking at.

My 1st rule: Don't tell other's how to play.
---
Information is there if you want it. Ignore it if you don't.
---
His name was Farfar, the Norwegian word for Grandpa 🧙‍♂️. I also had a rogue named Farmor (Grandmother) 
---
Depends on where you put your points in both feral and resto. For flag carrying mana regen isnt that good, neither do you want getting rage from crits, but both are pretty important in PvE. On the other hand feline's swiftness is a must, which you don't need when tanking or healing 5mans/raids

hardcore players are in guilds and together they monopolize the open world resources especially Devilsaur and Black Lotus

I was in college with a guy who dropped out before the end of the 1st year because he played EQ so much that he only got 2 hours of sleep a night.
---
I've had a guild leader in AC who's wife left him.

My 1st guild leader in Wow also had his wife leave him.
---
My good rl friend met his wife in Wow, had a mid and are still married too.
---
I had a 49 rogue twink - along with many other twinks in the other brackets. The thing about the 39 bracket is gear that everyone has is from SM. So gear wise, a lot of people are about the same level - not really had to accomplish. 
---
49 bracket what's surprising is that a lot of people will still be in their sm gear but the games are a bit more faster paced because of mounts. The gear you gotta get for a 49 rogue is a but tough to acquire as there are a few world epics you'll need to get your hands on. In addition, some of the gear you'll have to farm out may be too difficult to solo as there are pieces you get from instances. You'll have to get a lvl 60 friend to farm out some of those BIS pieces.
---
This is the absolute opposite to what is going on in the industry. Hardware is relatively cheap while software developers are expensive as hell in comparation. Generally what you see companies do is save money on optimizations and just throw money at stronger hardware. I have seen jaw dropping unoptimized server solutions in my line of work which has been ignored because they can just throw a few extra thousand at cloud processing every month.

This is the greatest comment I've ever recived 🥰
---
&gt;I understand that back pedaling is slower than running but I can see it being useful for tanks to re-position bosses.
---
The benefit of strafing is that you keep your target "in front" of you while getting the speed of running, so I don't really see a benefit for tanks to backpedal either.
---
That being said, I never unbind it personally. 
---
'Lordaeron throne room for 12 hours'
---
/wrists
---
I usually keybind 1-6, ctrl 1-6 &amp; shift 1-6 as well as some other shift combos like shift space, r &amp; t. As a shaman you tend to need a fair few while healing raids. 
---
Solo would be sheeping devilsaurs or those abyssal templars.
---
For raids, that would be wiping an abyssal lord.
---
Well having it so that you get level cap instantly technically would mean that Blizz values your time more, because they arent having you waste as much time leveling. Yeah, I'm that guy. 
---
I think this was bannable even in vanilla, if people got salty enough about it to report it. But a lot of places like the gadget buildings everybody knew how to get up there so pvp was still a viable solution.
---
So you're saying there's a chance?
---
That is why raids move together on pservers. Lot of guild v guild pvp there.
---
§, 1, 2, 3, 4

Q, E, R, T, F, G, V

Shift + all of the above
---
Alt + 1 for mount :)

But orc warlocks aren’t as good as undead. In pvp the stun resist is nice but doesn’t have the same utility as WOF.  But there is an argument to be made in PVP between them. But for PVE undead lock is far better than orc. In PVE nearly all the stuns are avoidable which negates that racial. And the pet racial for orcs is pretty useless in raids because most locks won’t run a pet in said raids. WOF helps you do bigger dps while everyone else is running around. Also not that it’s a huge deal but undead get better starting racial caster stats. I think like 1 or 2 pts. Which is not that crucial but it’s a minimax.  
---
I don't see a problem here.
---
For some classes greens are BIS for a long ass time, like well into raid progression.  So getting ride of last green may not belong on list.
---
My only regret.. is that I have.. boneitis.
---
But think about it. That could be the only time BRE dropped with you due to take it. Pussy has no lockout. U can beat that shit up 7 days a week but rag only lets u hit it once. 
---
I tried unbinding S but immediately regretted it. Back pedaling serves it's purpose while leveling especially, back up while changing camera angle around to avoid other mobs while fighting one
---
Where’s the bubble hearth macro key?
---
Well, gotta farm up the mats anyway. Probably take about that much time to get ahold of them without breaking the bank.
---
I can taste it. 
---
It’s all fun and games until you buy out everything And can’t sell it 😭

/r/gatekeeping is that way

on retail i use macros to spam 1 button for almost all my spells, i wonder how many more buttons im gonna need in classic...
---
reposting
---
I have no experience playing rogue and i'm picking an orc rogue
---
are there any pvp essentials I am missing? i'd say that takes a slight priority for me if it comes down to it
---
classic.wowhead.com/ talent-calc/rogue/AQwEDPHyBATPjQ8R 
---
i like the variety that having as many 'useful' abilities as possible would provide 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zL0hZxGzoZVxfoeq0o
---
Assuming there's no deviation in spec and how talents &amp; abilities work in classic, this spec is competitive in mc/ony tanks well with feral instict and ofc is considered the best talents for carrying flags
---
You mean "Seal of Ascension" ?  There was never anything called the "Upper Blackrock Spire Key" ;-)
---
I'm not sure if you're making a joke or missed my point. In the latter case I would be willing to explain myself better.
---
I grew up the same as a boy in the rural part of the US. My hobbies were listed as hiking, soccer and dancing? Pretty sure I played 50x more video games than those combined. Hope you find a way for you to be yourself in the future!
---
Back pedal is useful in PvE, especially tanking as you say. When somebody says that you should not have it bound they *might actually* be saying "I've gently gimped myself because there is a taboo against this action. You should too." As long as you don't rely on back pedal for travel/escaping the fire and only use it for positioning you're fine. 
---
When I take over the Earth only ESDF people will be allowed to play video games. It gains you a few more buttons which is important in an MMO and it is the natural typing position for the left hand. 
---
Keybinds: ask yourself when and how the ability is used. So let's say I'm playing a fire mage and want to keybind Fire Blast, an instant use ability. Am I going to put that on the keyboard next to the movement keys? Maybe, but what if I put it on the mouse so that I never have to stop moving right (F) to reach up to hit Fire Blast (R) or something like that. Bind it to a mouse button where it is always easily available. A spell like Fireball? That's keyboard stuff, since you can only ever cast it while stationary. Evocation? Very infrequently used and stationary, so I'd delegate that to a Shift+(button) or Control + (button). 
---
When you trust the fart and a little turd comes out with it. 
---
I guess it all depends on how good was the guild.
---
I just dug this out, was new in the box, while playing a private server. Total pita trying to get it running! I may see if I can eBay it.
---
I unbound turn left and right back in 2004 and never looked back. Strafe left and right is all I need. If I want to turn with one hand while I'm auto running, the arrow keys still let me do that.
---
~ is usually auto attack/auto shoot/wand
---
1 though 0 is spells, less commonly used ones further down.
---
Q E R T F G H Z X C V are all available to bind as well. 
---
I rebound my character sheet from C to I. Rebound anything else defaulted on those keys as well, they are too valuable of real estate for spells.
---
In my opinion having to manually ask in trade/general chat for members to join your dungeon group is a good thing in classic. It helps keep chat’s active but more importantly it’s just another factor in valuing your group members once your group has formed. 
---
The more convenient you make grouping the less you feel inclined to stick with those people because they become more easily replaceable.
---
only after the Blizz team relocates to someplace warm, where the beer flows like win and beautiful women flock like the salmon of Capistrano.
---
Yeah, I was hoping for something in text.  I want to compile lists for things like "Need 12 Thorium and 2 Arcane Crystals -&gt; 2 Arcanite Bars" etc.
---
I'll have to go through all those videos and write something myself.
---
The one and only reason Blizzard is using sharding is to keep the servers acutally up and running. They have been VERY clear it's for starter zones and only at launch.
---
I don't understand how that is so hard for some people.
---
You can zoom all the way to first person for full 2 feet off the ground immersion
---
It means temporary starter zone sharding, like daym. It's not vague, It's stupid people complaining becaues that's what people do these days.
---
People will do this. It's important to take note of their names, and spread his bidding like wildfire
---
Brother, that's when bois become bois masquerading as men.  The decisive manhood factors are 1) full-length cape and 2) headpiece
---
And they still got a statue at clan wars.
---
Yes.
---
Several changes?  Ooc regeneration?  Which they thought they fixed before it launched?
---
I’m just putting info and my opinion out there. 
---
Sigh, its not a new game, therefore it does not need a beta.  You can scream it all you want, but the logic is sound
---
So you work 9-5, spend a few hours before bed/dinner playing. So let's say 15 hours during the week. Then you're doing 15-25 on the weekend?
---
I would then again ask, are you spending time with your partner/kid at all? On weekdays that would seem to be no.
---
Because blizzard don't want to work on old versions of the game with outdated code/functions. They wanna use their current version of wow  that retail runs on for simplicity, even though it's a lot of work to work backwards with it, it'll pay off in the long run. Private servers are also not 100% accurate, all of it is a modified version of stock mangos where devs guessed or coded things from sources of old videos or personal knowledge. A lot of things have therefore differ from private server to private server.
---
The fact that you are asking for a duel, of all things shows me you we’re always trash explains why you derp around on private servers
---
Right... lol
---
I want my collectors horse. I hope Blizz also opens up to the possibility to buy and sell CoD knives and guns in their stores to use against Ragnaros. I think that'd be a nice addition to the game. The stats don't matter as long as they don't break the game and the player actually fails the encounter. There must be some kind of guarantee. I also think buying gold would open up a lot of doors to people who don't have the time to play for more than an hour or two a day, and make all items tradeable. Imagine wanting that latest AQ set and not being able to get it because you're only level 54 still. Imagine being able to buy that set straight from another player for 30 gold or so and then pwn n00bz in Redridge. Now everyone can be a hero. And none has put down any effort. It'd be a paradise where everyone with money is better than the rest of the player base. 
---
&gt;having kids in 2019
---
Oof... no thanks.
---
****LICK IT****
---
Or just... get your diet in check, and maybe set aside an hour a day for some well-structured workout. 
---
I was asking more about how far you can zoom out?
---
I like this. Usually I just do wasd with a and d changed to strafe. Then I use QERFVT1234 with shift of all those for more options. ZXC for changing stance or form or something like that. But moving the movement over altogether is a game changer. Could really build around that.
---
What a bitch of a mom
---
Someone earlier posted a site where you could search your toons name and it’ll show at what date it saw it at certain levels.  And my first toon took me ten IRL weeks to go from ~10-60. It was all about the journey back then!
---
i had no issues with threat using this, just need a fast wep, all the way up to naxx 4h. although when i MT or we had a hard progression that was a tank check I would respec. but this served pretty well for pvp and for duels! ( last stand with life gem +bloodcraze regen and you were pretty hard to kill)
---
You probably should have named the post something else, as most people only read the title and not the actual body.
---
If you look in the key binds menu, there's actually an option to toggle the camera view. Bind this key to something handy, then you can rotate your view to look back, hit the toggle key, now you can toggle back and forth between looking forward and back in a single button.
---
Absolutely amazing for kiting, or even in pvp. This technique made CoEx far more effective for me.
---
Its nice that you shared. Do you think you could have turned more introverted and shy anyways, when maturing and coming older? This happened to me, without any addictions or weight gains, on the opposite I have gotten in great shape, but I’ve noticed that I am definitely not the same wild extrovert boy I used to be.
---
I remember when All the rogues left my guild and went *on strike* because they gave perdition blade to a warrior.   
---
1. They won't launch a standalone client like pservers use. They want all of their products to be compatible with their battle.net launcher. They need to migrate the database information to their new database format. Private servers also guessed on a lot of information like armor stats and resistances, so they aren't quite 100% accurate. 
---
2. I doubt the Classic WoW client will be 60GB. It will very likely be under 10GB. 
---
Bots are only a problem if your team can’t win wsg in 6 minutes (our personal record was 4 minutes iirc)
---
Even if a bot wins 50% of its games and plays for 24hours a day, it won’t touch the amount of honor you can farm in wsg over a few hours.
---
It was either /4 or /6 but my server definitely had its own dedicated channel just for groups.
---
Are you sure? I'm pretty sure Blizzard has never actually done a real server merge. They did the connected realm pseudo-merge, and I think they tested server merging tech on a PTR once, but I don't think a real one was ever done on live. 
---
My bad I misunderstood. Idk about that but it's far out enough you really shouldn't ever have problems with not being able to see everything in pvp
---
Can I have some of this free time you speak of?  Thanks in advance!
---
I’ll have plenty of time to wait and save up gold for the questline. A Warlock isn’t going to be my first character and even when Phase 2 and Dire Maul is released I’ll be focusing on other characters first. 
---
A+ post. Grats on living the dream. Hopefully the catch up GED and career/social life stuff etc went relatively smoothly. 
---
My boss is on notice.
---
I've tried reading quest text before (I did it when I first played in 2006) but now I just enjoy breezing through.
---
I so enjoy, however, finding NPCs I never noticed. traveling goblin merchants. 
---
Nice panoramic views and other sights / intricacies of the environment I've missed. 
---

It'd be a paradise where everyone with money is better than the rest of the player base. Just like the real world.
---
If that's a thing then I suppose they could. Wouldn't be much fun for us though. ;)
---
In all seriousness I think an event like that would generate a lot of buzz for the game too which will work in their favour. 
---
I didn’t pay a huge amount if attention before, but i was thinking of replaying the Warcraft rts games as I hardly played them.  Rolling horde this time so I may pay some attention? 
---
Damn that is rough. I hope he is doing better and finds joy in his life again.
---
If you ever are a 'boi', you will never be a man.
---
If they ever did do tokens in Classic, I am 99% sure they would be a completely separate economy from the current live ones. 
---
GG now you have the plague
---
Okay, no problem with that. My point was: Don't insert something into a thread where someone says "I'm so excited to play my undead warlock again!" and especially not to scold them over their choice.
---
Which is a thing I see far too much in this subreddit.
---
So I have really no problem with info and discussion, as long as everyone is on board with the idea that other factors are more important to other people. 
---
A and D can function as strafe by default if you hold down right mouse button, that's what I do. Still gives you a keyboard turn even if I rarely ever use it. 
---
WoW should sell Classic with shit like this.
---
That is like a legit RPer keyboard lol
---
I think it's kind of cool that you don't have mounts in a 39 bracket, if you have a main since it's something different. Others might just hate it regardless. Anyway, a 49 twink in my experience, is going to cost you more to be competitive because a lot of people will have world drop epics in that bracket. A lot of times I wouldn't have permanent twinks but would ask friends to help me get some really nice dungeon blues for a bracket, maybe some BoE blues, and just sit at that bracket with the alt for a couple months before getting it to max level. The bad thing about brackets under 49 is that there will be twink hunters everywhere and they just destroy everyone for the most part.
---
Its always the tanks. They got the biggest armor...
---
I can pretty much guarantee they won't be gold selling.  They'll have gold sellers they have to deal with, but hopefully the Classic mindset will minimise their use.
---
Thanks for sharing your thoughts m8. That sounds like a particularly vicious spiral indeed. I can understand that, complete abstinence seems rather much, have you tried alternative psychs? I won't claim to somehow know better tho, as I'm still just a student forming himself. 
---
Good on you for getting ahead of things and knowing yourself like that. Best of luck to you dude!
---
I use to raid with this guy.    U from rampage?
---
I use 
---
`1234 (5 too but that's usually a low-use ability)
---
4 mouse thumb buttons
---
3 mouse finger buttons
---
c for autorun and alt-c for mount
---
Plus ALT for all the above keys. 
---
I much prefer having extra mouse buttons than worrying about rebinding a bunch of finger keys, and I can't imagine losing S as a tank, I couldn't give up F either.
---
&gt; There is no having the server randomly get shut down, or have the population all migrate to a new server with better scripting or a fresh new server. 
---
After about 3 years, I'm predicting they either create separate TBC servers, or create new Classic servers for people to start again.
---
Why is consecration needed? Its a very bad skill for leveling, it deals low damage and takes a lot of mana. To me it seems that its only good for aoe tanking.
---
Lol that's pretty much what I said. I didn't say mana was their only issue, it's just one more thing, but it means little in pvp when you just aimed shot someone for 2/3+ of their health.
---
Oh man, if you are a fantasy freak like me, you'll have the best journey of your gamer life. I know that I did, and will have once again.
---
Better hearth to Ironforge and kill everyone with it.
---
My first epic was Wall of the Dead AMA
---
Jesus fuck,  dude 
---
I more-so meant the zones/aesthetic, not the music 
---
If they simply released Durotar, Mulgore and the Barrens, they could stress test it simply for levelling.
---
Lol I get a lot more paid time off than my wife.
---
I usually use it to do a a couple major projects around the house (and a fair amount of time spent in "more productive hobbies" like gardening etc.) I have been waiting to tell her that I want to spend like 2 weeks straight playing a video game.....
---
Thats a thought i haven't had actually, what happens when you combine a substance abuse with a psychological one. I doubt its a simple matter of it = bad, but i do wonder now if it has been studied. Short answer is probably not, as there is still so much work left to be done on the subject. The only advice i could give to weed smoking wow players is to follow MoonbeamThunderbutts example and know yourself, and refrain from drawing any easy conclusions to why you're having your issues.
---
haha
---
 fuck
---
 I feel the same way
---
I NEED IT IN MY VEINS
---
I agree, back pedaling is surprisingly useful in a number of fringe cases. However I use my right mouse button ( hold right click) to both turn my camera and character. I’m able to do both ( at the same time obviously) quickly enough to check my surroundings while attacking mobs with negligible dps loss.
---
I think, in classic, your still able to attack mobs while facing away from them at a 90 degree angle. Allowing you to strafe away rather than slowly backing up your character.
---
Holy shit, thats evil and hilarious, I kinda feel bad for the noob though, I was the type that would have fallen for such stuff 😭
---
Top kek 
---
This would be extremely fun. I'm curious to see what the new client does under the stress of hundred players or more. 
---
I was an unkillable god in pvp on my warrior in vanilla.... You must of had bad gear. I was probably in the top 10 heard warriors on my server at all times, I could win a 1v2 most of the time. Dungeon blue kids were one shot by the time I was in AQ. 
---
Warriors are great at PvP if you use engineering properly and have the gear.
---
I don't tell them what dr... games I play.
---
I use a naga and the common QERF with caps(rebound caps to shift+ctrl), shift, ctrl, alt modifiers, basically gives me about 50 keybinds which allows me to keybind pretty much every action. 
---
Holy shit. Poor kids. 
---
Give up on the keyboard and get a gamepad + mouse with thumb buttons. They make mice with 12 thumb buttons, but I always struggled to hit those, the ones with 7 in a circle I find to be far more usable. With (5 buttons under your left thumb + 7 mouse buttons) * 4 keymaps toggled by your left pinky, that's 48 actions you have access to without taking your figures off the movement keys.
---
Move to using modifier keys for downranking. For example rather than separate key binds for rank 1 frost shock and max rank frost shock, I have a macro that looks for the presence of a downrank key, and if there then casts the lower rank. You'll still need a separate key if you want more than 2 ranks to choose from, for example you might want 3 ranks of earth shock: cheap interrupt, threat builder, and taunt/pvp max dmg, so map one to a single key.
---
I find ring menu is really good for managing consumables like potions, even in combat. So for example you run into a mage and want to chug a frost protection pot, it's not too time consuming to just click for ring menu then click on the potion. 
---
Maybe it wasn't WoW ruining my life, but it had a hand in it... And it also helped me identify (and fix!) said problem. 
---
I had a pretty serious anger problem when I started taking the game more seriously (end of wrath/early cata). I'd rage at bad players until they quit, rage at wiping, rage A LOT if someone got me killed during a fight/instance, lose my shit on bad pvpers in RBGs - it was bad. 
---
The straw that broke the camel's back was this brain dead as fuck Hunter we were carrying through a raid (I was a top end DK dps at the time). A 2h strength weapon dropped that I had been looking forward to for a very long time.
---
Somehow, this dumbass Hunter wins the roll, and actually equips/uses it, and I just lose it - I stood up and punched my computer chair in rage and actually fractured a knuckle doing so. This was when I realized that I had a problem and calmed down/stopped taking a video game so seriously. 
---
Btw, even 10 years later or whatever, fuck that dumbass Hunter. This wasn't even a time where the "every weapon is Hunter weapon" meme was around. It was strength and was clearly meant for strength users. 
---
Instead of the shift+ and ctrl+ modifiers I use alt+ didn't realize how weird I was until my buddy asked how come I don't use my pinky for anything.
---
Mad cuz bad to a T.
---
Actually thanks for reminding me. I need to look back into this but I had a guy in my guild that played PvP with I believe 5 buttons. He had them rigged up so they did every ability. 
---
Remember when they announced Diablo for mobile on April fools.
---
Thats a great story, I kinda feel bad too as its really a dick move. I guess we were all more dicks back then
---
I have w3 on my pc but don’t have 1 or 2. Can I skip them? Not sure I’ll bother playing through all 3 if I’m honest 
---
An ex guildie who i did loads of pvp with and spoke with regularly on vent asked for a few 100g loan for whatever reason, think it was a mount, I gave him it then he took a free server transfer. Cheers mate.
---
As I remember it was fairly close but then people worked out a macro command you could put in to set it to be much higher which most people used and then later they patched in a higher max.  
---
It's really not an fps or rts so playing with a high max zoom isn't some huge 'advantage', it just makes some people feel more comfortable. This may be kind of crazy but you know you don't have to have the camera and max zoom out right?
---
He was addressing this first part... and it's not like you negated it further down in the comment.
---
Yeah this is an important concept for melee where you're moving all the time. Get that mouse filled up with abilities that you'll use while moving and allow your left hand to steer unhindered. I'd even do some Shift+(Mouse) since you can hit shift with the pinky finger, which should not interfere with going left. 
---
Yeah it'll be a good option i reckon, wont be many leatherworkers most like (never are). It does fall off later on though as LW is prob just the weakest profession over all. Still, a solid plan with the engineering pickup after.
---
Grenades! They are amazing aye. Judging from reddit and discord everyone will be an engineer xD and i do not blame them, will be on myself.
---
Pv O? Missclick i suppose? O and P are next to each other. Same for me, tho i am considering an RP-PVP as well (should activision blizz show the good sense to add one), as i am hearing a lot of good things that make sense. A more mature community etc sounds like a sweet deal.
---
Depends a lot on when the thing drops. I'll have a nice long break from my studies soon and also have health issues to consider, but i do need to pick it up again in july. So if it june i may go a tad hardcore, otherwise rather casual. We'll see what IRL allows. I definitely dont want to do it fast, but i do want to get to the endgame and relive my raiding days, finish naxx etc. It's gonna be such a surreal experience to be back in that game, i was only like 13 when it dropped.

The defias chain into DM has basically 0 overlap with any Westfall quests, you could easily wait to 18 to head over, do the quest first thing and be ready to run DM then. The chain basically is a simple fed ex from Westfall -&gt; Redridge -&gt; Stormwind -&gt; Westfall, then looking for a single npc on the road, then doing the escort. 
---
&gt; this is effectively a new game
---
That is what I said, I'm aware it's not an entirely new game, but it is an old game, on an entirely different platform and server structure, and based on the bllizzcon panel they have had to do a ton of work to get it working there.  To pretend it's just going to work is what is illogical, it needs to be tested.
---
Interested!

---
Better “effective health” which is why (iirc) they were used to tank the hateful strikes on patchwerk.
---
Warriors have more avoidance and can block which is why they ultimately take less damage over time, but when it comes to effective health type fights Druids are better.
---
Yeah.  What Im getting at is that it would be cool if you didnt have to zoom all the way out to remain competitive in PVP in a BG for example (i.e running around with a micro toon).  
---
If everyone was capped at zooming out to a certain level that still gave you that connection with your toon, then I think it would be a more immersive experience.  
---
Completely agree. I for one am happy that there are going to be various play styles. And as someone who plans on minmaxing I’m also happy that we will be a minority. I can’t see more than 30% of a server being minmax.
---
He only played vanilla, but me and my brother played almost all expacs
---
As far as I know there's still no release date but the rumor is July 16th. 
---
Why? That was when FB started getting popular.. I remember my cousin using it in 2005-2006.
---
private servers do not have legal rights to host the game and can be shutdown without notice or recourse at any point in time.
---
1v1 i would do different but in party like wsg or ab its great for dispelling,manaburning and healing.
---
True, yet ff I was Blizzard I wouldn't want to rest on my laurels. 
---
It's clear that they are going to have to utilise different server technology for Classic, as the modern game is built around sharding and Classic will not be (crossed fingers). For that reason alone having a large scale stress check just to make sure things will run smoothly for people won't hurt.
---
There's also the community goodwill side of things, if they did something like that for us I reckon it would generate a lot of buzz about the game. 
---
But honestly, I simply can't wait to battle it out in Hillsbrad. ;)
---
Here's a dick move, first hand experience:
---
I had a 60 Undead female Priest called Macyrin. I forget which server. I was part of an unstable raiding guild doing MC, BWL, AQ20 and AQ40. 
---
It was a Sunday night. We were either raiding AQ40 or BWL when after a few bosses, the raid comes to a standstill and all the guild/class leaders go into a private Ventrillo server. Two or three of them rage quit and everything quickly spirals from there. Within the hour, the guild was disbanded.
---
So there I was, sitting around Orgrimmar when a guild was LF healers for MC Ragnaros. I hadn't done it that week, so I whispered the person and I was off to MC with this up-and-coming guild. 
---
We take down Majordomo and the boss before him and we set off for Rag. It wasn't an easy fight, because most of the raid had pre-MC gear, but we manage to kill him. Their Ventrillo was ecstatic. This was their very first guild Rag kill. 
---
The leader had loot set to Group Loot and asked everyone to pass on everything and they would distribute loot by talking. Well, I had thought about taking a break from WoW for a while, so I thought, let's go out with a bang. 
---
As the timer ticked down on the loot, the Ventrillo became more anxious and frantic. Who wasn't passing? Who wasn't passing?! With only seconds left, I clicked need as fast as I could on as many items as I could. 
---
The raid leader also had not passed yet, and began clicking need as well. Ventrillo lit up more than when Ragnaros went down.
---
After the dust settled, I had won 2/3 of the loot. I was promptly kicked from the raid and my name spread around to all the other guilds and my ninja story spammed in trade chat in Orgrimmar.
---
If you were the guild who had Rag ninja'd by an undead female priest, I was young and bored and had given up the game, I am sorry.
---
12 or 13 seems optimal, go kill hogger on the way over. Then start the zone normally.
---
They'll pretty much have to tank and heal their own groups. And tank that seems a group going "LF tank and healer" who joins up and sees a warrior and a priest already in the group is gonna peace out asap.
---
Damn that’s dark. 
---
Nice slippery slope you have there.
---
Damn, you know your shit lol
---
Avatar was later knows as Selesnya IIRC? Rerolled a warrior in TBC. But he wasn't a clicker, I'm pretty sure of that. Maybe he was trolling people when he clicked like that in recorded duels?
---
I was lucky enough to play alongside Rynd (before he was known) during TBC's S4 and we lost gladiator by 5 rating. It was a bummer. But insce I started WoW I always tried to keybind and mouseturn. You just lose so much by clicking...
---
I started playing on patch 1.5 so yeah, maybe my "vanilla experience" was your "end of vanilla experience" if you played since release day so I can see why you would say "it was released less than 7 months before TBC".
---
Anyways, good to know some people that played back then. Vanilla-TBC era was trully amazing and I hope I can have as much fun as I did back then.
---
I can eat it 👶🏿
---
Yes, several, that is one of them that they needed player testing to see.  I appreciate you proving my point for me.  Here is the blue post addressing several more.
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-update/113138
---
Classic and the modern game will be running on different server tech so that's really the main reason I suggested this.
---
But in truth I just want to kill Alliance. ;)
---
That isn't summer tho. Summer starts June 21st.
---
A lot of the typical Hunter specs work decently enough for both. BM focused with a sprinkle of Marksmanship is usable for almost all content. 
---
One would think. Kinda cool and a good example how the top guild in BFA required their members to be exercising every day. 
---
Ruin is the best leveling talent, don't @me.
---
I got one that makes furious every time, and that is when people don't queue up for spawning items. Like the quest in Loch Modan where you have to pick up scrap metal, or the one at the starting zone in Dun Morogh. I always made sure people queued up in a friendly peaceful manner and usually help out killing spawning mobs. By doing that everyone got their loot a lot faster. But there's always that one rogue sneaking up and stealing the spawns right in front of people. Rogues are a useless class to begin with, so what do they even win by doing that? Nothing but time and lost trust. They won't get into raids anyway. Time to re-roll class little Jimmy, you asshole.
---
Asmondgold's mom took 50 days played...
---
WASD vs ESDF vs whatever else does not make that big of a difference anymore.
---
It was a bigger deal in the 90s and early 2000s when most mice only had 2 buttons. There was a need to have many keyboard keys within reach.
---
Now that you can't find a mice with less than 7 buttons (2 button, 2 thumb button, middle click, scroll up &amp; down), and some mice that have 20+ buttons, it is less of a need to have your hotkeys on your keybord
---
Stick to whatever you are already used to using. If you are just starting pc gaming then WASD will probably give you the best experience as most games use that by default.
---
This is incorrect. Darkshore should begin around 11-12.  
---
Blizzard won't, but players will. And Blizzard will profit indirectly. Also you won't have your typical chinese goldseller, the players will simply trade retail gold / classic gold between the communities.
---
Player A buys gold in retail through tokens
---
Player B buys retail gold from Player A with classic gold
---
Player B Now buys his/her gametime with the traded retail gold
---
Player A can now buy all his boosts and consumables in classic without lifting a finger.
---
And there is nothing Blizzard can do about that, since they certainly won't monitor the trades of several thousand players.
---
I guarantee you that there will be community-driven gold conversion sites available from day 1. The rates will constantly change, of course. You likely get a TON of retail gold for classic gold in the early stages of classic, but better get used to people buying gold in classic.
---
(And btw, this is not my imagination. These conversion sites exist since ages to even trade currencies between completely different games).
---
I usually switch over at 12/13, by that time you've gotten all the easy darkshore quests done and you're not greyed out of most of the westfall stuff yet.
---
Yes, but where's your sense of duty, sir? There are Alliance out there that need killing. ;)
---
All they said was to get ready for a classic summer. That means it can be before or during just not after. 
---
It's because they are back porting a 7.x client as opposed to using the original 1.12 client like private servers use. They basically took WoW: Legion and deleted all quest, item, spells etc and pasted in the only 1.12 things. This involved building out a new "1.12" database into their new, modern format. A TON of things have changed in the 7.x client that need to fixed to reflect the original game, including movement changes, spell coefficients, models and animations...it's over a decade of changes that need to be looked at. The reason they are using 7.x client as opposed to an old 1.12 is 99% because of security reasons. Anticheat and serverside checks have come a long way since 2006 and it makes sense that a large company like blizzard wants to utilize a more secure version. Integration with battle.net is the other 1%.
---
If blizz used a 1.12 client instead, the server would have been up already.
---
Well historically, RP-PVP did not exist but was retroactively added in Patch 1.8.
---
I would think Blizzard would offer a way out and into RP-PVP if Classic acquires such a server later. And even so, a one-cost transfer of your raid-ready character isn't too painful (and I highly doubt they WON'T offer paid transfers: its still Blizzard).
---
Yeah true, but you're genuinely disadvantaged if youre zoomed in 2ft from the ground while someone can see the whole BG.  
---
I remember they changed the max zoom level at some point.  I just cant recall when and what the plan is for Classic.
---
Link? 
---
TFW you have Carrot on a Stick but no mount.
---
That’s from playing alot of FIFA on a keyboard back in the day. I know, yikes...

Haha, very nice. That was my home Realm as well. I was in Angry Beavers, nice to see someone from BH! 
---
Great video of the kill :)
---
I don't think it had publicly open registrations until September of 2006 (which is coincidentally around the same time the TBC beta opened). Personally I never heard of it until a couple of years later, but it probably caught on sooner on the fatter side of the pond.
---
"Classic would literally take so much time to invest in". No it doesn't. Play a couple hours a night a few days a week. You sound like you have the mindset that you have to no life the game for 12 hours a day, well you don't. Everything in moderation. There are plenty of people who will play, myself in included, who will still maintain relationships, jobs, social life etc.
---
gog.com has WC1 and 2 on sale for $15.
---
Nah, you want to play classic already, we get it, so you are reading between the lines. It's going to be DURING the summer. Worst case scenario is the last day of summer.
---
&gt;P.S. Just roll Orc and you have the most broken racial ever made for PvP
---
Gnome warrior OP
---
The difference is the gold generation model.  Classic's values were far smaller and far harder to generate.  All these people talking about "massive gold" are failing to remember how the original gold sellers made gold.
---
Literally they had to generate gold from mobs, by botting.  Same goes for PS realms.  They had to generate the base economy gold before people could buy it, and if they can rein in the bots there may be hope yet.  Sure people will find ways, but hopefully that's the minority, not the standard case.
---
If we can maintain the core ethos for Vanilla, and have it propagate, people won't accept those methods.
---

Same here bro, as soon as beta was released for wow I quit CS. My team then went and won Dreamhack that same winter, other decent lans all over Sweden etc. 2 made it Pro for a few years.

Skinning is good early on to help you afford your mount. You could also start with either mining or herbalism. It syncs really well with grinding too. Bonus if you keep it to skin devilsaurs later on, which is great money if you can get to Ungoro fast enough.
---
Herbalism works well if you plan to do the inner Mara farm, as there are many valuable herbs in there to pick. 
---
Mining is good to level if you plan to level engineering up later. However, if you level herbalism instead you could just buy the mats you need, which will be cheaper on a fresh server since supply will be low and demand high. 
---
My plan this time around is to start with herbalism and skinning. Drop skinning around 40 to pick up engineering, and from there use the profit from selling plants to power level engineering. 
---
Sure, but a real stress test would be the starter zones.  Plus I want them to test their attempts at high population sharding.  We know that Vanilla could handle 200 v 200 Tarren Mills Southshore, even if BfA can't any more.
---
I rebind space bar to a hotkey, and make jump G. People are always baffled by that, but space is generally my oh shit button, I want it to be easy to hit. 
---
If your T levels are high enough WoW wont get in the way of that pussy na mean?
---
There is always stuff to do even if you can only raid Mc and onyx. Gathering mats for new content phases. Finishing your rep grinds, epic mounts, resistance gear or some outdoor pvp. 
---
My fiance never knew me when I played WoW, but has seen me playing Ingress.  Plus, I'm going to try and get her excited and interested in it :-p

Just read the story of W1 and W2, lots of background for Lordaeron and dark portal
---
Can I volunteer my own dick move? I got tired of lowbies asking me to run them through dungeons, and even getting persistent about it when I said no the first time. So one time I finally agreed, and told them to put me on follow and I'd run them to Scarlet Monastery and we'd clear it. Instead I ran south into STV, took them into the arena and killed them. 
---
I was not nearly as patient or cool with newbies/lowbies as I am now. Just a high-school aged tool. 
---
I love this story.
---

---
For what it’s worth, I could have been in your shoes. I was doing poorly in college and transferred schools. As I didn’t have a computer that could run WoW I took it as a chance to change my life (and I did).
---
Can’t wait to ruin it again though baybee.
---
But that simple flip of a switch is connected to causing one of the highest work loads your servers will normally ever see.  That gives them all day Monday to prep and then 4 works days to clean up any issues.  
---
They should honestly be purple and drop off Nefarian or something.
---
To experience wow classic one needs to experience the wow open world pvp as well. Sure it sucks being ganked for the regular players, but it's also what makes questing out in the open so exciting. 
---
Vendoring skins isn't so bad, you can make decent money with it, especially if you grind in STV. I also found that heavy leather sold decently on private servers but the others were worthless. 
---
Yea I loved the hell out of it on my rogue. On my warrior, eh not so much.

Really depends on if they release a timeline, and whether or not the quest is available at launch or only once DM is out. If I can do the quest up to the DM part, and DM is only a couple of months out by the time I hit 60, waiting a bit more is not an issue.

Biggest thing will be server regions and therefore your latency. No US player gets less than 160 ms in private servers since they are all hosted in Europe. You will also have more consistent "peak" server times and populations; most people will be on at 6pm your time as opposed to 3 am. 
---
Blizzard servers will offer a level of polish that no private server matches. Bugs will be addressed fairly quickly, pretty much everything will work as intended. 
---
You won't get goldspammed every 5 minutes.

Pessimism? How is any of what I said pessimistic?

I’ll let you know how it’s worked out for me. I’ve travelled to over 20 countries, had sex with beautiful women and feel more liberated than I ever have.

Please tell me what is optimism? Lol. So many guys are optimistic and they end up getting cheated on or divorced. Faith is false hope, it’s irrational and stupid. And I have plenty of discipline. 
---
Lol, I’m not naive. This is reality. You’re just afraid of it. How the fuck does this mean I had a stunted psychological growth?? Hahaha.

---
You mean that the mods auto update?  I recall having to copy files into the wow directory haha.  How is it handled these days?
---
yes you can because hypergamy is literally a part of the female human mating strategy.  of course people buck the trend and we repress our nature (e.g. not many men will shag anything that moves despite that being our imperative) but its still there under the surface
---
I would imagine so.  I hope they maintain the ease and quality of use, because its one of the best I've seen over the course of WoW's 15 years.
---
I hope Blizzard release the usable API soon, so that we can start building for it.
---
Github. The source is always best.
---
Well, we already know current systems do not support it. So it needs to be modified and tested. Servers need to be able to handle it lag free.
---
Fury Warrior. Alliance and Horde both take a ton of them.
---
Now adays you basically have a desktop app that has a search function.
---
Find the addons you want, and all you have to do after that is update once in a while when you see things are out of date. 
---
In TBC I used to bop people in the middle of when they were mining so I could steal the node. It was good fun and all is fair in farming epic mounts lol.
---
"Fight my way through orcs and Crocs" my sweet summer child, there's a reason it's called the death run and not the fight run.
---
But yeah I'd leave around 18. Darkshore is really good for xp especially because of the beached turtle quests so I'd recommend not leaving there until you've gotten alot of that done
---
ZBoard!
---
I had one of these as a noobie. It was kind of neat because the inserts were interchangeable so you could pop in a new keyboard theme for different games. I think I only had the default and WoW classic ones. 
---
Warrior, rogue, mage will top the dps charts, warlocks do well in later tiers. 
---
Don't worry you transition back to darkshore later and do other quests. You won't miss the zone. questing in vanilla wow in many ways is like doing all of the quests there is :).
---
In darkshore do the intial wave of quests, that you can do quite easily. then transition to westfall, usually its around lvl13-14.
---
But when you transition to westfall depends on which level you came to darkshore. since for isntance you can easily come darkshore being around lvl12, or 10. 
---
But yea you need to do the initial wave of quests. then you'll see that quests become harder like require you to kill 14+ mobs. and at this point you go to westfall, quests there, do deadmines chain and deadmines run, and come back to darkshore to do the second part of the zone. thats what i usually do, it feels quite efficient.
---
Frostadamus has good profession videos on YouTube. 
---
Blizzard usually does a good job of ensuring that the modern WoW client is at least fully compatible with WINE, but one issue that always crops up is every time they change or update something relating to how the battle.net or game client functions, there's a chance it may break the game and make it unplayable until someone comes up with a hack fix/workaround or Blizzard themselves fix it. The former being far more common.
---
Though things break from time to time it's fairly rare for something to break for long periods of time. It's up to you whether you think it's worth it. In my experience old and new versions of WoW run completely flawlessly on Linux apart from the usual performance hit that comes with using a compatibility layer.
---
When it comes to using Linux, I say go for it. Worst case scenario you can always just dual boot into Windows.
---
They should've put the icon for soul dust on that hotbar.  Also he should be named DoctorRockso or some variation lol.
---
Something many people dont mention or even incorporate which I believe is massively useful:
---
Using double mouse click to move and steer your character.
---
Doing this will allow you to continue moving while you take your fingers off of WASD for pressing keybinds.
---
Another style of playing/using keybinds that is certainly not for everyone but is built into me as a Hunter player for years is to jump in the direction you want to move and while your in the air you can take your hands off of WASD as your characters momentum will continue and you can press abilities in that window. Thats typically what a kiting hunter is doing when jumping and turning in the air.
---
Funny thing is I agree with you. And Orc is better. Which is a testament to how broken it is.
---
Honestly, I would use it any other way if I could. The problem is that I earn it on a per hour basis (50 hour weeks), and the company doesn't pay it out. Because of that, they do not put a cap on it either, which is fair, so you can stack it indefinitely. Due to my 50 hour weeks, and my company not paying out PTO, I have to take off more than 10 hours a week to even be able to start using it. Since those 10 hours a week are OT and on the weekend (I get 10% increased pay on weekends) it would be a substantial hit to my income. I've been trying to save up for a 20k down payment on a house (I want 20% equity on my house with my down payment, to avoid having to pay mortgage insurance, as mortgage payments go to interest before equity). Not that I even really need to explain this to anyone, but I'm far more responsible with this than my post lets on, lmao.   
---
No doubt it's resto shamy for horde. For alliance I'd probably go holy pally over priest but they'd be fairly similar.
---
Fps... max zoom... ?
---
Why would you use addons?
---
Not sure entirely what you're asking but the most played and most recruited class is warriors for raiding. So most slots dedicated to one spec would be fury warriors, most recruited spec would be holy priest/dwarf priest especially. Alot of shamans are fun to have because of windfurry totem, fear totem, and the raid heals look cool.  but it honestly might be more optimal to just run more priests.
---
Thanks. This is tempting since I get to stay in Darkshore til lvl 18. But I might go sooner to actually do some proper questing in Westfall. I guess I will play it by ear. 
---
they already said sharding at the begining...
---
fov is basically the same thing. You get more vision for an awareness advantage at the cost of 'immersion'.
---
Thanks. Guess I could have a look at it. I am not looking for a guide though, just an exhaustive and to-the-point list of every item and advantage you have to take a specific profession to get. Do you know if that in his guide?
---
Agreed, would love to see some measure put in that prevents people from choosing a faction if too many other people have done the same. 
---
Servers with a serious faction imbalance are no fun. 
---
I don't know about Windows 10, but you can stop Discord from showing that. Just look around in the settings.

Good on your dad for sorting himself out. A lot of people chose badly and broke apart their marriages/families in the process.
---
True but in the warriors case have fun rolling against 6-8 people for ever gear piece lol 
---
why can't I touch it?
---
gotta get on the TRT sonny
---
Maybe a feral druid. They get enough tools to do good in pvp when pve feral. Thing is they require a a lot of effort to pull their wait in pve (rotation is quite complicated with power shifting and farming consumables). Hybrid specs just aren't great without lots of extra effort, skill and acceptance of your guild mates.
---
Combat rogues probably OK as well. 
---
You’re not a real leveler until you buy your first Hillman’s shoulders
---
What stress tests? I want to see the server crush... seriously. If at least few servers don't crush then I will be disappointed.
---
Similar situation with Shamans too.
---
Every class is viable for raiding, but not all specs are usually welcome. 
---
If you want to be on the safest side and min max your choice then these are going to be holy dwarf priest (Fear ward is a unique dwarf spell and usually is very wanted, some guilds even recruit specifically dwarf priests for this purpose) and troll resto shaman (Berserking is good for burst heal potential, but compared to dwarf priests it is much less important).
---
Looks like it's time for you to pioneer.

... You're the reason I switched from a helpful support shaman to being a brutal bastard rogue who killed everybody
---
After I met players like you I took the Rex Tiplerson approach of "if it's legal and benefiits me then I do it."
---
Of course sometimes the only benefits was the joy I'd get cacklikg like a mad-man as I would lead the alliance hunting players in the Barrens to where Hunters were farming leather or where certain key raptor quests were. 
---
It’s actually amazing how it manages to always feel like like it did the first time. Legitimately magical.
---
Pretty much what others have said, but also it depends. Raids will take a lot of mages and warriors but there are also a lot of them around. The last server I played on people were pretty down on raiding as a Hunter and when we got to naxx the two that we had been bringing both quit for rl stuff. So we were in the unique position of being a t3 guild in desperate need for any half assed Hunter. I don't think any horde guild I was in ever said no to a decent shaman application. 
---
To everyone taking this seriously. Treat it like UFO video, or a flat earth conspiracy--fun to indulge in, but obviously a stretch of the truth
---
You still misunderstood, have you tried reading the post? He's asking because he wants the max zoom it be lower than retail and want's to know where it is.

Yup, if I join a dungeon to tank and there's a DPS warrior in the group I'm probably not wanting my time. That 30% chance at getting that axe you need off the last boss just dropped to 15% cuz you have to roll against the other warrior for it.
---
If you want to do leveling dungeons it's going to be hard to do them "off-role". You can do your role with literally zero talent points in it if you don't suck and are the appropriate level. I'd make peace with that idea now.
---
I always remembered it being strong on 19 twinks... but maybe that's just because it's the only one most people could get?
---
I was just kidding mate. Your employment contract sounds quite harsh. I hope you at least are paid decently for the hours you put in. You mean you get paid for all 50 hours and get hours off on top of that, or you only get paid for 40 and is forced to do 10 hours OT each week because of responsibilities?
---
Good point, I might do this. 
---
Love the double mouse click to move
---
I remember back in the day I was obsessed with getting a forsaken mousepad but cheaped out on it.
---
I think I feel a wave of spending coming on...
---
The Curse client lets you browse through all of the addons uploaded to their site and automatically updates them for you if you allow it to run in the application tray.
---
IIRC the Curse client also automatically archives old versions of your installed addons so that when you update to a new one there's an old backup present in case you need to revert back to the old one. Pretty nifty.
---
Anyway. It's unlikely that someone will come along and provide a better implementation than what Curse provides because they've spent almost 15 years of research and development perfecting their current system. It's very difficult for someone to compete with Curse at this point because they're so far ahead of the competition.
---
There's no mob tagging in retail any more: if you do damage to a mob you get loot from it. Also loot is personalised now not per mob: if 50 people hit a mob 50 people get loot.
---
The result is in the daily quest hubs you just run around tagging mobs with 1 hit because so many tag it that cumulatively you're killing the mobs.
---
i quit wrath because of how busted disc priests were in arena..
---
Hell yeah buddy, I just finished playing through WC3 ROC and TFT, as well as watching YouTube vids of all the WC2 mission briefings and cinematics. 
---
I reccomend checking out the Abelhawk Easter Egg videos to enhance your enjoyment of the WC3 campaign experience. 
---
I think horde and alliance will be more balanced this time around. 
---
Change to a keypad with thumb stock instead of keyboard, and use the keypad thumb stick for movement. Frees up your fingers for actions. 
---
&gt;  flat earth conspiracy--fun to indulge in
---
I agree that this is about as fun as a flat earth conspiracy. We just have very different definitions of fun. 
---
I know of a bunch of people that had their lives ruined in connection to wow. 
---
Two attempted suicide (one of which succeeded)
---
One had a nervous breakdown and OD'd on coke but survived. When they found her she was living in filth like a hoarder. I remember seeing a picture of the apartment and it was knee-deep in pizza boxes soda bottles and other trash. Don't know what happened to her after that.
---
A wife, who played, cheated on her husband, who didn't play, with her guildmate and left him and their two kids to go live with the guildmate across the country. The husband had a breakdown, lost his job, lost their house and became homeless. The kids were put into foster system.
---
Last we heard about her was that the guildmate kicked her out of the house and she moved in with another guildie.
---
When you do that can you post a link to the text?
---
The only advantages will be crafted items that are BoP or where the set bonus requires the skill.  For tailoring there is an epic chest piece amd the wildvine set.
---
I would suggest looking at databases of all the recipes for each prof.
---
Dagger is a lot of fun. Everyone and their mother will be leveling swords so expect a huge contest for dungeon drops. Daggers is a tiny bit slower, but more deliberate and much more fun to me. Plus, you can handle yourself well in PVP and PVE which is great for leveling. I went with a combat/sub build and loved it. I had all my cooldowns reduced, had preparation just in case, and dropped big ambushes and backstabs all the time. Feels great.
---
I mean I’m a female and I’m not like that. Maybe if you’d stay off of incel forums and actually talk to women, you’d learn that that’s just not true
---
Tailoring - Full set +2% crit bonus on bloodvine. Mage/Priest/Warlock each have epic BoP craftable robes, but you don't need tailoring to equip, just to craft
---
Enchanting - Crafts BoP Smoking heart of the Mountain, https://classicdb.ch/?item=11811. However you don't need enchanting to equip, just to craft.
---
Blacksmithing - Glimmering Mithril Insignia, https://classicdb.ch/?item=10418. Trinket reward from a quest that gives 30 sec fear immunity. Can have situational use as a panic button if tanking certain fights. Requires you to actually have blacksmithing skill to use.
---
Engineering - Way too many to list, this is where the self-only benefits really kick in.
---
Honestly, this is an exhaustive list. Trade skills in Vanilla were far more economic than self-augmenting as they became even as early as TBC.
---
1. Join discord
---
2. Join TichondriusClassic server

3. Join HordeLFG[0-32]

5. 15 seconds later -&gt; thanks for invite, sweet full group omw!
---
Loved zboard. Had all the wow keyboards they sold, even some other versions for fps and such.
---
Probably the worst one of the 400 too.
---
Now you have me second guessing myself. It may have actually been a free transfer from a high pop to a low pop server.
---
Hehe, I don’t mind the running. It’s a right of passage :)
---
Also gives me a chance to go sight seeing around Loch Modan, maybe do a quest or two there. I will roll hunter and I think there’s a good quest reward in loch modan, maybe even a bow?
---
This might be the last time I roll on a fresh vanilla server. I will stop and smell every damn rose in Azeroth. 
---
Let me guess. You'd never date an overweight, unattractive woman despite being overweight and unattractive yourself? 
---
Mouse wheel up/down + shift up/down for charge/intercept and movement break CDs
---
That's still (largely) the same way I install addons, but Curse/Twitch has a built-in feature to their program where you simply just search and hit 'Install' on addons, and it'll do all that for you. You can also auto-update with Twitch Prime (I think it is) where it'll detect a new version, download it, and extract in to your directory. 
---
I still install everything manually, just a force of habit really. 
---
Luffa.....
---
Darkshore 10-14ish, Loch Modan 14-17ish, Darkshore 17-20 with grinding as needed and the head in to Ashenvale.
---
Higher levels tend to have fewer twinks and thus you become more likely to dominate. On a mature server you can end up with more twinks than actual lowbies on BG weekends at 19 and 29 brackets.
---
Had a guildmate back in vanilla make a level 59 twink. He was the only 59 twink I ever saw and he never encountered any others, so he was *always* top of the match.
---
As such I'd recommend 49 if you want to minimise the chances of hitting other twinks, or 39 if you think mounts will annoy you too much, because people *will* start just trying to avoid you in the match.
---
&gt; My 1st rule: Don't tell other's how to play.
---
God, if only League of Legends players could have figured this out it might have been a decent game. 
---
But 54 doesn’t mean 5/4... It’s 5+4 which is 9... 9 is 3x3 or two 3s or 23... The number 23!!! O...M...G!!!
---
Usually healers, sometimes hunters/warlocks/druids if there's only one or zero in the raid. Warlocks on Alliance notably early during MC when more Banishes makes the Garr fight easier. It's honestly hard to guess though, it really depends on the day/time/server/side etc; there's generally a pretty good balance between the classes. Lots of Warriors but you need both tanks and fury.
---
The only classes that get a little congested are mages and rogues. But they're very good DPS classes.
---
So yeah, going Resto Shaman will definitely be needed. And Ally Priest is great too, go Dwarf for the extra viability.
---
Dwarf priest!
---
Right there with you. I imagine I'll naturally level faster this time around but no way in hell I'm skipping the fun stuff to zoom through it.
---
In TBC I was doing combat haste when the meta wasnto strictly ignore Haste all-together and ended up beating several rogues fighting Grill the Dragonslayer.
---
I got this winning the roll Vs 6 other rogues, a Ret Paladin, and 2 very very good warrior DPS. 
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonspine_Trophy
---
During the raid I won that piece I was like 4th best DPS out of the rogues. The next week when I went back in with that trinket everyone was blown away.
---
He's mostly right but this sure as hell isn't the place to bring up what he originally commented.
---
i don't know of any "incel forum", it's my experience with the women i know that has taught me this stuff - that and evolutionary psychology and the experience of older and wiser men.  
---
its quite amusing that you went with the "i'm not like other girls" biggest cliché of all time.  and also even if you are an exception, your anecdotal case doesn't negate everything else
---
have you honestly ever met a woman that married a man who was less successful/shorter/lower status than her?  have you ever met a man that married a woman older, uglier than him and not fertile?  it's incredibly rare, that's just the nature of the mating game
---
you can try and pin shaming labels on me all you want but that doesn't change reality
---
Holy shit it never even occurred to me to do it this way. I'm going to have to try this out and see how it goes. The one problem that springs to mind is that the jump button is also under your thumb by default so you'll have to get used to mixing that up, but that's not the end of the world. Thanks for the idea!
---
I wish someone would come up with a "package manager" type of thing for wow addons to manage dependencies, etc that was all backed by GitHub repos.
---
Yup, AR was the shit back in the day cuz most of the "raiding guilds" on the server were still wiping on one of the first 4-5 MC bosses when ZG came out. I expect there to be a guild or two to have rag down week 2-3 on each server. AR looks like shit compared to a spinal reaper. Hell vendorstrike is better no?
---
Sadly I am afraid so. I still have a very bitter taste in my mouth from Curse back in Vanilla and the whole Recount keylogger thing. BUT that being said.. the Twitch client is pretty amazing and wowinterface, while they have a client, just isnt has polished as the curse/twitch client.
---
&gt; I got to rank 13 and was about a week and half into the last push and my internet went out for 3 days.
---
I can only imagine the withdrawal. 
---
Amen to that!!
---
This made me smile the more I read it 
---
Im right here with this guy. 26 years old and just ended a 4 1/2 year relationship as well. Currently have no desire to go down that path again any time soon and am perfectly content by myself and working on my career. 
---
So WoW Classic and a lot of it for me lol
---
I don’t plan on caring about the lore at all.  I will be rushing to 60 and ganking the people who do care about lore and are still in Arathi Highlands. 😎
---
My man. We are built through the fire and it's what's left after the ashes that... Wait... Alliance?!? 
---
Die scum
---
While I HIGHLY agree with this, you can't beat the ease of the clients. That is if you are a addon addict like me. It's sort of always been one of my wow mini games.. TWEAK ALL THE THINGS!!! :)
---
Dagger or hemo?
---
Bright pink hair or handlebar mustache.
---
I need to know who to focus my gnomish hatred on.
---
I remember Gamestop selling these and I thought they were awesome
---
I’m in the same boat mate. Totally pumped and wish there was a way to search people by the characters they played back in the day. 
---
I’m not a fan of AV 1.12 but other than that party on!
---
&gt; I was probably in the top 10 geared warriors
---
You just made my point thank you. 
---
The OP doesn't want to raid, and there's a big chance he doesn't have enough play time to become R14.
---
He will be one of these "blue dungeon kids" that will be ganked by every raid geared players.
---
Well.... it WAS OP, until it kept getting nerfed over and over.
---
Or you can just wait until I start playing classic and give them away for free. 
---
Assuming it's clean enough for general consumption sure. 
---
&gt; Yeah people are deluding themselves if they think it will be the same as before. Nobody knew what was going on back then, and just playing games on the internet at all was a pretty new thing in the world.
---
&gt; 
---
That's the aspect I'm looking forward to *not* being entirely the same. **I** was one of the people who didn't know "what was going on back then". I had three level 60's, and almost all of them were stuck in pre-BiS Scholomance/Blackrock Depths gear, things I paid specialized blacksmiths to craft for me, and maybe an item or two from PuG'ing Zul'Gurub or something. I spent far too much time twinking, farming to support twinking, and helping out lowbies in and out of guild to actually do any of the raid content. Never killed Onyxia, never finished Zul'Gurub, never did Molten Core, etc. I didn't know what talent specs were viable for what classes for what roles, and did what I wanted.
---
This time, even if nostalgia cannot be entirely replaced, performance-wise, I'm going to know way more about professions/talent specs/gear locations/etc., and performance should increase significantly.
---
&gt; and are almost 100% accurate to the original Vanilla?
---
Rofl
---
Love this! Lezbehonest though it took 50 days because she’s levelling as balance 😜
---
If you get enough honor at 59, you can apparently get the Rank 11 mount AND the champion pvp gear (assuming its not the updated level 60 version in Classic).  Seriously OP for that bracket.
---
That trinket is another on the list of things that I think every single rogue but me had.  It and the Malchazeen are like my white whales of TBC loot.
---
#1 addon I want is TSM / auctioneer instead of Aux... 
---
A lot of those videos have google docs with slides (like the one I linked) that have all the info.  They make it very user friendly and condensed.
---
Interestingly enough there used to be something close. But then back then very few addons where on GitHUB. . BUT. . Curse. . and even wowinterface, although not as much as curse, bitched and bitched because this updater would pull from sources all over the net.
---
Now. . They argued it was because the app took away the ability for people to donate to mod authors, but it was actually because they where huge control freaks and flipped out. 
---
For the life of me my aged mind can't think of the name of it.
---
But I agree. A package manager of sorts like NPM or something similar to pull all the repos and libraries.  
---
This has wholely confirmed for me that Pally and Shaman use essentially the same gear. 
---
I dropped a class I need for the bar exam ... this semester 
---
Sticky this 
---
5K as I said in this thread once already.
---
Raiding is the best plan. Not only because of the gear, but also group play, since pre mades in BGS will roll over you so hard. Wow vanilla rewards interactions, those that help each other will get a huge advantage. Imo there is no way around raiding unless you want to play with a big handicap. 
---
Just asked in the discord today and TSM is a very big MAYBE.. Depending on the API and features stripped out for Classic.
---
&gt; What armor reduction debuffs stack on bosses? Do Sunder Armor, Expose Armor, Faerie Fire, and Curse of Recklessness all stack?
---
As said Sunder and Expose Armor don’t stack, but Annihilator stacks with these. 
---
well i'm not exactly pretty but i'm 6'2 and 85kg so i have a nice lean body thanks to lifting
---
but i have a lot to offer, and would date a woman in the hope of her having more to offer than just her body too.  I've dated 4 women in the last year or so and only one of them was interesting, motivated, and had an opinion of her own.  unfortunately she was leaving the country so it was short-lived.  I found out the rest were total losers after a date or two
---
I hope not/doubt it
---
There is! Vanilla friends.com 
---
I’m a big fan of clearing MC in sub 40 minutes instead of 4+ hours. Really fits in my schedule better
---
No, it will be 1.12 unless they *really* want to stir a commotion.
---
WoW is fantastic as a game, but the lore is kinda poorly written/constructed. If you want good lore just read Tolkien.
---
You and me both my friend.  I am approaching unhealthy levels of hype.
---
Im almost positive it's 1.12 through every content phase but I'm not sure they have confirmed that
---
You can definitely skip WC1, WC2 has some stuff relevant to TBC, but overall they have little to do with the story in WoW. For one, they don’t touch anything in Kalimdor, WC1 doesn’t even touch Lordaeron. It’s southern EK only. WC2 Tides is Darkness has some stuff, but overall the story really gets fleshed out in WC3. Here’s the coles notes on WC1, I’ll Add WC2 later since it’s a bit more detailed. I definitely reccomend WC3. The TFT campaigns (especially blood elf and undead) are more fun than the RoC campaigns too so don’t get discouraged if you feel worn out after RoC. 
---
WC1:
---
Medivh is responsible for bringing the Horde (just orcs at the time), led by Blackhand, to Azeroth. Garona kills king Lane. Lothar is the Alliance’s greatest hero. Horde sac Stormwind, pushing the humans back to Lordaeron.  
---
That’s seriously about it. A bunch of the names of places in WC1 are different than they are now too (sunnyglade and grand hamlet just off the top of my head).
---
WC2 has at least some stuff of note (various different heroes of the Horde, almost all of which die, and various heroes of the alliance, all of whom are relevant but only Uther shows up in WC3. You also get to meet different factions within the alliance —virtually all orc clans get wiped out other than the Warsong clan— such as the Kirin Tor, Dalaran and those damn Alterac traitors to the alliance.) 
---
In fact, I’d go as far as to say this: 
---
If you’re alliance, there’s plenty of relevant lore in Tides of Darkness (less in Beyond the Dark Portal). If you’re Horde though, here’s all you need to know: Gul’Dan betrayed the horde, he died exploring the Tomb of Sargeras. The only notable Horde on the Azeroth side of the portal is Grom Hellscream. 
---
A huge amount of the stuff in vanilla wow is tied in some way to WC3, mostly RoC, (though if you don’t play TFT you’re going to be very confused about who the Foresaken are). So I would highly reccomend you play that.
---
Yeah I’ve definitely checked that out and registered but unfortunately not too many people are familiar with it. Blizzard needs to make a blue post advertising it hah. 
---
I believe we will be pretty set on 1.12.
---
I think I did read (or listened) about it somewhere just after blizzcon.
---
Can someone please confirm for us?
---
Hi, /u/stevebobs93
---
WTB Release Date 
---
We're all addicts more or less
---
Yeah, but on private server, the GMs are not only selling gold, but also duplicating characters and selling them. I’m 100% convinced that some pservers are selling loot drops to guilds. 
---
You forgot the rogues that share a lot of the same gear too.
---
And honor - I don't care much for PvP in the first place but even less so if there's little to no reward. 
---
I agree. This should really be a no brainier for them, as many people will have no way of contacting old guild members. It would surely increase the hype  
---
That share needles 
---
I felt like I read a page from the book about my life...
---
Listing to Vanilla music all day while working. My shits each day at work are getting longer and longer while I sift through each and every post on this Reddit.
---
This summer I will lose my shit. Daddy's back boys!
---
I honestly don't want TSM or that level of economy manipulation.
---
No, this is a shitpost even by april-fools standards.
---
My favorite bracket is 39. There's no mounts, all classes are actually twink viable and everyone has access to 300/300 profession skill.
---
For the first time at 39 the hybrids are actually viable and pretty strong. Plus a lot of classes have multiple specs. From the vast majority of twinks being Priest/Hunter/Rogue/Mage the game opens up to the point where most classes have one if not more viable specs.
---
Players leaving a top guild can have a real ripple effect. On my realm the top guild lost two priests and that upset the market heavily. A lot of the priests switched to a guild one step higher on the ladder. And as usual, when recruiting you take own or two more applicants than you need, so every guild below the top one had empty slots now.
---
The market changed over a week completely. From no slots for priests to six or eight slots in guild #3, #4 and #5. I actually had to heal on my Priest alt and we pushed two new applicants through the attunement quests that weeks.
---
Fun stuff.
---
BoP profession items fit the bill, even if you can continue to use them after dropping the profession they came from. Thanks for the info.
---
Even if this is vanilla, I am surprised there aren't a few more.
---
I do like the state of this in vanilla more than how it was in TBC. I would have preferred it so that there were no profession exclusive benefits at all (possibly except purely cosmetic ones). I'd have professions be entirely optional, and dependent on economic considerations, practicality, and personal interest.
---
Shhhh bro, we don't need filthy humans catching on
---
Shame in playing a game you love? Jesus, most people can barely find half a hobby, they want to spend a minute on a day. Enjoy Classic whilst it lasts and don´t feel ashamed of anything.
---
Well, thats the price attached to high demand classes...
---
You'll get higher chances of getting a spot, but once there, you be rolling against a higher number of players for the loot...
---
WC3 lore is actually pretty good IMO. I actually think the story of Arthas in general is a better story than LoTR (though LoTR was amazing for its time no doubt, I just think the tradgedy of Arthas makes for a really beautiful narrative). 
---
Yeah, I'll have to look through them all, but I do intend putting something on paper, by level, when things become available etc.
---
e.g.   
---
Level 45 - Ungoro safe enough to start mining Thorium.
---
This is an under appreciated comment rofl!
---
Don’t locks and mages as well?  Or do they value stats different enough to avoid that?  Seems like that covers DPS, excluding hunters who fall in to that physical category but also fall under “must not stand in fire and must tranq shot”
---
I honestly don’t know why I do this to myself.
---
I do know that I could not play like I used to without neglecting responsibilities. 
---
Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.

A and D for strafing. 
---
1,2,3,4,5, Q, E, F, S, R, G, C, V, middle click, mouse button 4, mouse button 5. Then a shift variant for all of those, and a ctrl one too. Then shift/ctrl + mouse scroll up/down too. 
---
I'm not keen on using F1, F2 keys. 
---
I actually do know a women who married a man who’s shorter  then she is. I myself have dated a guy who isn’t the most attractive guy in the world just because I liked his personality. 
---
Thanks that answers my question!
---
And yeah I'm defenitly going to be engineer, it's just too good to pass up.
---
Don't forget not having the server hosted in the Eastern Block with a 150+ ping, and 70% of the server not speaking english... with no "off hours" and a plethora of other bs that makes me want to stab my eyes out whenever I logged in to them.
---
It takes some time to adjust, and the jump button is a bit more cumbersome. Also one you get used to it, it's hard to play without one.
---
But having 3 fingers for buttons plus pinky for a modifier like ctrl or shift gives you so many buttons to access! And the buttons are all right there in 3-4 rows below your fingers! 
---
Horde player here, you have BIS bracers that are green ?
---
That was my favorite part of Vanilla raiding over post achievement raiding. No I don't want to do the same content with one hand tied behind by back for a stupid achievement, I want to speed run the place and get it done with.
---
&gt;Humor
---
🤔
---
Ive done naxx of pservers and its really funny how little coverage there is of naxx. You would think that people with all of the " everyone already knows the whole game inside and out for years it wont be a challenge" would be intimate with the knowledge of the most coveted raid in the game lol
---
For me:
---
* Bar mod - I want to have at least two extra bars of buttons
---
* Something to move the default position of the Player and Target boxes.
---
* If the default client doesn't allow it, some sort of Clique or Mouseover activation mod.
---
* Auto-vendor greys
---
TSM or Auctioneer will be there. So its hard to stop it.
---
The auctioning part of TSM is actually secondary for why I want it.
---
The unified crafting experience. Mats tracking between alts. Mail operations to send mats to the correct alt with the need for them. 
---
But then I love crafting.
---
Summer starts on midsummer?
---
Any class is great for pvp if you have engeneering and gear XD. Warriors are the most dependent on it, so if you don't have the gear you are the weakest class, it's just how it is. 
---
In-context that's not very random at all.
---
uheuhuehuehuehuhu, don't let people catch on about barrow dens being a huge waste of time   
---
 either lmao
---
So find players who want what you want.
---
If you want to enjoy the game for the adventure, find players who enjoy that.  If you want to raid hardcore and push to be the best guild on your realm, then you'll need a different mindset.
---
Auctioneer I'm not so against.  TSM is a step above with automation of pricing and manipulation, and external sourcing.
---
Something like the Buy and Sell tabs of Auctioneer, and tracking of the current (or last seen) AH price for something... That I'd expect.
---
Warlock tends to be underplayed on Alliance so there's less competition for raid spots for that class.  
---
If you're a Dwarf Priest the odds of getting a raid spot compared to someone who's not Dwarf goes up pretty significantly. In general if you're playing a class that has a clear 'optimal' race/class combo such as Human + Warrior, Dwarf + Priest etc. your odds of finding a raid spot goes up.
---
I wouldn't be too-too worried about not being able to find a raid spot since the nature of 40 man raiding means there's always someone who can't make it to raids and if you're the guy who's always reliable and puts in the effort you'll get noticed.
---
Or is it cleverly placed? 
---
This is what I don't understand about comments like the OP. At some point something has to happen. After the 6th phase has run it's course, they can either make new content, re release TBC or release fresh servers. All of these options have their draw backs, but the last two are especially bad for the community. 
---
If they say they're going to do fresh servers periodically before the launch of classic, I will not play classic at all. I think this is such a bad, unhealthy idea I can't ever see Blizzard doing something that would continually fragment their community. Moving onto TBC isn't much better. Plenty of people despise it and will refuse to play it. I loved TBC, but I don't want to go back to it. I think the only way to go forward is to add content into Classic like Jagex did with OSRS. Even that is dangerous because of how easily nu-Blizzard could fuck it up. 
---
When you think "damn, this guy can play almost 2 hours a day? so lucky" you realise you're an adult :( 
---
I threw mine out after about 30 minutes of use.
---
I have never had an issue with making dinner, hanging out, and spending time with my SO during the work week even when I play 3-5 hours a night. Like I said I’m efficient with my time, I get home from work and unwind for a bit on the computer, then maybe run to the store and cook dinner togerher. We hang out for a bit and she’ll do whatever she needs to do for the night.
---
We sleep together every night we can, and on weekends we pretty much are always hanging out. Even if I’m on the computer she’ll do her own thing or go do homework or run errands at her apartment. I can easily play 8-10 hours a day on weekends when she’s busier, some weekends I don’t play at all. There’s plenty of time for us to spend together.
---
Now if we had a kid those hours would definitely be cut down but I still think 25-30 would be manageable if it meant something to you. Maybe 10 hours during the work week with longer sessions on the weekend. 
---
Thanks, bro. I've been in therapy off and on for years at this point, looking at my issues in different ways with different therapists. It's definitely helpful to switch therapy types/therapists every so often and get a fresh perspective, imo.
---
I'm not exactly an image of mental health yet, but I was the worst possible WoW gamer stereotype back in vanilla/BC... A fat greasy min-maxer living in garbage, no irl friends, blocking out suicidal thoughts at 4am by starting yet another alt. The Southpark episode might as well have been a documentary aside from the fact I'm a woman.
---
I'm happy with the progress I've been making in my life since then, though, so I think it'll go a lot better this time. Looking forward to being a casual with an actual life this time, lol.
---
Thanks for the encouragement, and best of luck to you on your own journey.
---
I use a naga and have basically everything bound to that, 1-12 with shift, ctrl, alt modifiers.
---
&gt; Pessimism? How is any of what I said pessimistic?
---
&gt; Women of the 21st century are great at the start but will waste your time in the long run. They see us opportunities, not individuals. The idea of real relationships and love is dying due to social media and hookup culture. In other words the nuclear family is DEAD. Get out of blue pill mode man.
---
Trust me, I'm with you 100% on this "red pill" to reality. I understand, I get it... but you reek of someone who came to this realization and went no further. You sound like someone who accepts his fate and "the way things are" and stops there, aka a pessimist.
---
Yes, a lot of things are shitty in our culture now, but by no means is the nuclear family dead or are ALL women (AWALT, i know) seeing us as opportunities. The only people these concepts are gone for is people like yourself who have lost faith. 
---
I know because I was like you before, thinking you have reality understood and know the answers to it all. There's more to life than that, this isn't the first time the world has been "destined for failure."
---
All I'm trying to say is believe in something and don't stop until you get it. The things that have happened in my life should never have but they have and it just gets better every day. It's annoying to me to see negative people egging people on to settle for less simply because they haven't figured things out yet for themselves.
---
An empty spot is also viable in most raids. Just sayin'...
---
We talking stun resist or blood fury?
---
It's honestly something I am expecting and preparing for.
---
Summer starts mid year.

Sort of to deal with vanilla, patch before Cataclysms destruction of the landscape, breaking all the quests and such. Trying to finish the scepter of the shifting sands questline, one of the most badass questlines I had ever done, pretty much every part felt epic to do. Last part I had to do was get the Arcanite Buoy, kill the boss, and go bang the gong, every other part was done. Elementium ingots still going for a mint, like 2k each on my server. Jump into a PUG to do a BWL run to hopefully get an ingot or two, directly ask the raid leader/master looter about the ingots, if they were reserved, would they be free roll, etc and he said they would be free roll. He ends up ninjaing all of them and hopping out, I tried messaging a GM asking if there was anything to be done even will all the chatlogs and never got a response. Never finished the quest, Cata pre-patch dropped ruining my chance at the quest way earlier than I expected (I assumed the quest wouldn't vanish until the actual launch day), ended up quitting WoW pretty much until late Pandaria. 
---
Random internet stranger, I am the conscience of my past experience, here to tell you that her reaction is probably not going to be enthusiastic. Mix it up and keep things spontaneous, and communicate your feelings, otherwise she will begin to feel like a "button" that you press to keep at bay so you can do the things (WoW) it seems you "really" care about. If the foundation of a building is off, even just several degrees, the problems become immense and costly down the line.
---
Or you can ignore my advice completely. Godspeed.
---
Not the same way. But it should be fine. The legion client is more optimized, the world just has way more particle effects, models/items, higher res textures, etc.
---
Certain functionality might be missing from old hardware that might keep the minimum specs higher than they were in Vanilla, but it shouldn't be harder to run from a raw power perspective since they are using all the old assets. 
---
that's great, someone wins the lottery every week but that doesn't mean the odds change for everyone else!  most humans (men and women) are boring, unambitious, self-destructive and generally unappealing but in the case of men, that can be compensated for by improving on the axis of success/status, and for women it's compensated for by beauty and fertility
---
i'm not saying i'm anything special by the way i have my own bad habits and struggle to keep motivated.  the comment that began this whole thread was literally just me light-heartedly pointing out that a woman's opinion of a man's superficial features is changed by her opinion of his status - e.g. most women will say "i dont really like muscles on guys that much" but they will look at tom hardy in The Warrior and get wet panties lol
---
It's not ideal but not that bad since all you really need is the dots and your pet surviving so you never have any downtime with good management of mana/life tab. Imo with sl you lose too much in affliction for the absolute best lvling, but sl indeed is not that terrible. 
---
this is what i do on my tartarus, i was looking into getting an orbweaver for Classic, but then i dont expect i'll need 48+ spells on my left hand with 36+ spells on my right hand haha.  
---
I struggle with the jump button ( can only jump when moving forward with both mouse buttons held )
---
Don't hold your tongue. The TSM team is pretty much against it in Classic so.
---
Honestly I feel like I remember this happening back in TBC or Wrath or something.
---
I bookmark all my addon Githubs and check for updates now and again.  
---
Just found this to be easiest and most reliable. Takes a few extra minutes every couple weeks but it's not a huge problem.   
---
If you got a long commute or can toss in some headphones while at work, check out the Countdown To Classicnpodcast. Episodes cover everything you can imagine with a new one about every week. Really scratches that classic wow itch
---
The random gnome mage that would spam sheep the mob that was attacking you to heal it. 
---
Skills that come from talents are cheap. 
---
Given how we wont have a cross realm AH as Live does I think it will work just like Auctioneer. Which Auctioneer has the same pricing and manipulation as a part of it. Just not as detailed for setting formulas.
---
First we need to see what API is out there. As for external. That could get expensive if they do open up a AH API. An external site would need to poll each server, Horde, Alliance and Cross AH and keep that database for each. It could be done,but I suspect they could hit the API call limit very quickly.
---
Don't mind me. I am thinking out loud again.
---
I don't know, but I'll get back to you in two years or so.
---
How tight do your pants feel carrying around that massive dong?
---
Single dad with a 10 yo 50/50 custody. I think I may just get him a desktop to play with me. 
---
can confirm, i am baffled can you strafe right and jump ???
---
Have you considered Hemo/Mace stun spec?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/AQkEDPHw0ATPjQ8B
---
It has been a while but you can tweak as needed.
---
I can, but generally don’t need to. However, strafe jumping is vital for moonwalking. 
---
I have already pre wanted my girlfriend that I will likely disappear for the first month or two. 
---
No, it's about dick moves.
---
Out of curiosity, how many addons are you running?
---
I developed a severe auto immune disorder when I was 15 which prevented me from going to school. It took years and frequent visits to specialist doctors to figure out exactly what was wrong. TBC had just come out when I got sick so I got to play WoW all day every day for 3 years. Sure, It felt like I had the flu for over a thousand days, but I got a few gladiator titles and saw everything the expansion had to offer. 
---
I do remember some sort of package manager thing back in the day. Everyone thought it has a virus. Probably was lol.
---
Starting zone sharding is 10000 times better than server merges.
---
BC Baby here.
---
Logistically, how did this happen? Could you just run to Undercity and tell trade chat "Put Allporkwieners in your shit list everyone, he's a dirty ninja."
---
It's probably going to show up as just another game in the launcher.  So you'll have to install it separately etc....  
---
Even things like PTR realms require a separate install so it's highly unlikely classic wouldn't as well.
---
The site sounds cool! Any chance you still have the link?
---
I haven't played private servers for awhile and all my WTF and addon data has been lost, but if I had to ball park it, I'd say about 10 or so, 15 if I'm feeling really frisky.  
---
It'll be separate. No reason why you'd need to install 7 expansion's worth of assets.
---
Wait, I have a beard like this dwarf in real life. You're telling me that if I get some sweet shoulders the ladies will come running?? I've been going about it all wrong...
---
I meant the external data dump that TSM does from your WTF files.  Blizzard won't be opening up a public Auction API external to the game.
---
Hopefully you can still see how this is a terrible experience for an RPPvP player.
---
Do you roll on a PvP server gambling that character transfers will be permitted? 
---
If not permitted, you waste months of time.
---
If yes, such an exodus can hurt existing servers and eviscerate guilds and friend groups with some people transferring and some opting to not $$$ pay and stay.
---
Do you wait for the release of an RPPvP server, thinking you'll start when the server opens? 
---
If no such server even opens, you forever missed the curve and fresh server experience for no good reason.
---
If yes, and they offer transfers, then you will be behind compared to people that paid for a transfer.
---
Hopefully you can see that no matter the combination of outcomes, not having an entire server type at launch, ie not even a single RPPvP server at launch, severely hurts the RPPvP players.
---
This is not 2004 and it's not patch 1.8. It's meant to recreate patch 1.12, "the definitive version of Vanilla WoW," according to Blizzard.
---
Maybe in 2004, with ~10 million players, it wasn't such an issue.
---
But if Ion is really concerned about server population health like he claims, and if there really is going to be a "lean server list" in Classic WoW, then neglecting to release any RPPvP servers at all at launch does nothing but hurt any chances at a genuinely healthy RPPvP server and player experience.
---
Just try to put yourself in the shoes of an RPPvP player and see how this is incredibly shitty no matter how things turn out, unless they offer your server type at launch.
---
I would implore that you consider that "doing literally nothing with your life" isn't a statement of fact (with regard to Warcraft) than a statement of values. Values are subjective. Someone out there is training to be an Olympian, seeing how many times they can accurately skate across ice, or wrestle another person to the ground, or swim across a swimming pool. The majority of people on the planet will not stop to care that they've succeeded at doing these relatively arbitrary things, nor would it matter if *everyone* did, to me. 
---
Everyone has one life to live, and enjoyment seems ultimately to be the goal. As long as a person is maintaining the food/water/shelter necessary to maintain their hobby, their hobby is for them to value. If they don't care to focus on finding a mate because it would detract from their hobby input, they are not a "loser" to me if they are succeeding at what they love. 
---
The only time I want someone to get help is when they outright state that they wish they had a way to break free from something they'd consider a lifestyle, yet they seem unable to rid themselves of it. But as long as someone is both 1.) doing a thing, and 2.) perfectly content doing a thing, more power to them, in my opinion.
---
1-6 shift 1-6 ctrl 1-6 Q E R F C V + shift Q E R F C V ~
---
So instead of figure provided by Blizzard that is similar to numbers of massively popular private server that drew many players who never played Vanilla before, you decide to rather trust your gut.
---
And nobody says sharding will stop the exodus. How about you actually look into actual arguments provided by people instead of making up something in your head?
---
Quality content

Happened to me. 
---
While leveling up I met a hunter who taught me how to play a hunter. Once I got to 60, I got an invite to his raiding guild and started raiding with them. That Guild was Warriors of Death. Sadly Grimholtt(the guy who taught me how to play) had back surgery I think it was, and he more or less never came online again. Before he left, he had been the Hunter lead and since the guild was Loot council by class leads, I got a good amount of gear to catch up to the other hunters. Too bad the 2nd in command hunter, Mooster, was an ass and never gave me one piece of loot once Grimholtt left. Mooster took the Helm of Destruction for "PvP" When I had a blue head piece and he already had Tier 1 and Tier 2 head. I was the only Hunter out of the 4 or 5 of us I think it was that didn't already have an epic Helm.
---
That being said I still think Loot Council is on average the best looting system. Before he gained control of the hunter loot. I was the least geared hunter and got the lions share of Tier 1 gear (but not all) to help catch me up. The guild was already farming BWL when I joined, I did not get any Tier 2 iirc
---
Exactly, i think it just goes to show that most info in vanilla is still passed down through word of mouth/direct experience.
---
Amazing, thank you.
---
Classic and the modern game will be running on different server tech so that's really the main reason I suggested a stress test before launch.
---
Not to do with sharding at launch.
---
Yeh, off a guard in DM North. 14 int and +29 healing. Better than anything you’re getting for a very long time 
---
Some people are making characters just so they can rush to 35-40 and then start ganking low levels that have no chance. With no intention to continue leveling. 
---
world pvp is going to be hell compared to launch vanilla
---
I know it's fake numbers for your example, but man if they actually set it to only 20 people in all of Elwynn... haha just thinking of that low of a number is a bit scary. I still want to be fighting over mobs, I just want to be able to get one occasionally. 
---
Depends on server econ though, my vanilla main was a warlock and it cost me in the realms of 550-600g all up for the quest chain. 
---
In saying that, I didn’t hit 60 until the 1.10 or 1.11 patch so maybe a lot of mats from AH were cheaper by then.
---
happy cake day!

Sounds more like a Sims player to me..

The best thing about Vanilla is you reap what you sow.

Now THIS is pod racing.

Srsly :D

I got a 39 twink rogue on a ps just to gank in stv
---
I'm pretty sure retail WoW is still the most popular MMO by a large margin, even though most of it's competition is F2P at this point. 
---
My fingers are on the home keys and i use my pinky/ring/middle finger for movement and my index finger is free to hit R, T, Y, F, G, H, C, V, B, 4, 5, 6, 7 for any skills that i might need to use while moving.  I always put skills with cast times on Q, E, "\`", 1, 2, 3, F1, F2, F3 since they have cast times you wont be moving anyway.  the rest of the F keys i usually put things that i can hit out of combat like Mount/Ghostwolf etc.  I usually put decurses, trinkets, yada yada on Z, X, C, V, B (ones used in combat more often are usually put accessible to the index finger)
---
Also, i have rather large hands so Y, 7, H and such keys are really not a problem for me to hit.
---
Generally this gives me about 28 hotkeys without using shift or control.
---
my Mouse only has 2 buttons which i use for PTT (discord) and auto run, because fuck it.  Never liked mouse over macros.
---
I use a  "Koolertron Cherry MX gaming keypad" which puts the function keys closer to the number keys making them in line and much easier to hit.

This is the best i got for a guide, i made it cause of slackers and trials who didnt want to learn fights in naxx. ultimately i decided that it was unnecessary since our core knew the fights although people on this reddit really liked the format

On my P server raiding experience, a butt load of warriors and shaman, a fair few mages and rogues, then 2-4 of each other class
---
Shift adrenaline into turbo when I'd catch a distract.
---
You can, but it's tricky to time perfectly. But if you were good, you could skip to the end of BRD by jumping in the lava
---
Playing a hunter is my guess :D
---
No shit op
---
External API probably would not be an issue in terms of costs for sites, text does not use up a lot of data. For example, the database for [TUJ](https://theunderminejournal.com/) currently uses 29GB storing 219 million rows of data and has used 347GB of bandwidth in 51 days. 
---
As for rate limits, Blizzard allows 36000 calls per hour and that's way more than you need.
---
Finding Tirion tucked away and not realizing who he was until reading about him was fucking super cool. 
---
Visiting all the WC3 locations is awesome too, particularly where Thrall and Grom fought Mannoroth.
---
Basically Vanilla is a WC3 nostalgia trip with all the people and places you can find.
---
It's probably the time I ran SM with a hunter and priest who had beef. The staff dropped, don't remember the name, but it was the one that had +60 damage to beasts. Both needed on it with the priest winning it. Hunter lost his shit cuz he was about to go to STV after that run. Then the priest disenchanted it in front of him. It was bad. We didn't finish that SM wing.
---
...you saw in vanilla.
---
He's satirizing people who are dissecting blue posts for hints by taking something completely normal, and analyzing in an extremely ridiculous way to come up with an extremely ridiculous answer...that's the joke. 
---
It used to be great. The latest UI update to it made it awful. Because I have ptr and another server client on my PC it detects them and I have to manually change to the live client every time I load it up, and that's after I change it to the mods page and pick WoW. Before it just loaded straight to my Addons, no faff. 
---
FWIW almost all the guilds recruiting on the lfg Monday thread are asking for mages. 
---
No I get it. I understand that it does indeed suck.
---
What I was saying was this situation isn't as hopeless as a private server, where your work literally becomes COMPLETELY null and void when a server dies or people move to a fresher experience.
---
At least if RP-PVP does not exist at launch, transfer or not, your character is safe and sound. Hopefully character xfer will be available for those who need, and when the server comes out, you can either move it or restart.
---
It's not the ideal system. I really hope everyone has their server types they want at the start (everyone wins: it literally can't hurt). But on the off-chance RP-PVP will come out later, your character isn't locked in a void like what happened to *insert private server name here* and unable to ever be played in the future.
---
And yeah paying $15 or whatever because they didn't have it at start would be garbage. Here's hoping.
---
*cold  sweats*
---
I disagree, if they never open new servers it will be way harder for new people to get into it. Who wants to roll on a 2 year old server where everyone you fight is tier 2 and 3? 
---
 From /r/woweconomy's Discord 
---
&gt;Soulmaestro01/31/2019  
---
&gt;the moment classic is avail on ptr and live the chance is big there will be channels for that on this discord - like there was a bfa channel while bfa was still in beta/ptr (but that's more a question for **#meta**) if the question is more about addons used by goblins - auctioneer/tsm/... - that will depend on blizzard and if they provide an ingame api for such addons in classic, and for tsm : if they also provide the AH data on the external API so the tsm servers can grab that and make their calculations on it (but for tsm  **#support** \- or in this case **#discussion**  is more fitting - for other addons **#tools-addons** ) 
---
June 21st is midsummer. You know, from mid (middle) and summer (summer).
---
For starters people might wanna browse the forums of private servers. There have been made some huge additions in form of addons in the last 10 years by private server addon devs!
---
Except that Serpent sting is a colossal waste of mana. Unfortunately it’s about 1 autoshot of damage over 15 seconds. 
---
Blizzard gonna introduce a wow dating app
---
Look just cause we all can’t be Nicklas cage in national treasure doesn’t mean you should hate on the guys findings!

Yea. That is more manageable :)

My current Live install (which I have not played in over 2 months) has 66 addons.  I know. . I know. . Like I said. . its a minigame of sorts for me :-/
---
A few friends and I did the private server dance a few years ago when nost was going strong.  We all got to 60 on a few different servers, but didn't want to commit to raiding like we did in vanilla as that is quite the time commitment.
---
I cannot wait to change that
---
carrion birds n bats r also very good pets
---
Thanks buddy, appreciate it.
---
If you have a paladin or warlock in group you don’t need a key to get into scholomance. Just suicide near the door with lifetap/hellfire or divine intervention and run through the door as a ghost. 
---
Man thank god you're here, they probably woulda forgotten.
---
Not the craziest but this is my story.
---
Started playing WoW towards the end of Vanilla and played pretty hardcore all the way up to Tier 2 of Cata. The more I played, the more addicted I became. Started to care more about my in-game life than my real life and slowly started to neglect everything I had. None of my RL friends played so I became more and more distant untill I pretty much stopped talking to them completely. Stopped caring about my job, showed up late and tired because of late night raids and farming. Stopped putting any kind of effort in my relationship, pretty much took her for granted and just acted like a douche. Eventually I lost my job, then my gf, then I couldn't pay for my appartment and moved back in with my mom and brother. Hit rock bottom, depressed, suicide attempt. I was a mess. Finaly decided to quit the game and get my life back on track. It was a hell of a year to get through but I made it out and learned a lot about myself and life in general. Now that Classic is around the corner, I'm excited to dive back into it but as a casual this time around. Thinking back, playing WoW was both the best and worst thing to ever happen to me.
---
"Camera max zoom" has always and still does read as zooming out. Not once have I ever heard someone say "what's the max camera zoom?" in relation to zooming in, everyone knows it's first person. 
---
Ok so on the ‘burst damage’ slide.  The gloves procs 6 (?) times and he procs either shadowfang or fask 7(?) times.  Yeah this does will not depict retail even SLIGHTLY.  
---
 The Journeyman's Staff or whatever it was on my Tauren Druid is what I remember. 
---
Class mounts don't take up a bag space though
---
thank you very much!
---
Wait? Thats not oke?
---
they were so fun
---
copy that, tyvm
---
Someone on a recent private server pretty much dedicated his life to camping the horde flight master in Booty Bay.
---
....no seriously, he would be there like 8-10 hours a day, EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK, just killing the flight master over and over again, and abusing LoS/safespotting to kill any horde players he could.
---
Such a pitiful creature.
---
thanks a lot!
---
I'm gonna fuckin smash it
---
You guys had me all excited, but when i went to their site it looks like the only client is still the Twitch one....
---
Is that correct, or is there still a standalone app that you can use?  
---
The Twitch one drives me nuts.  I have a few folders for wow on my PC and it defaults to the wrong one (and i couldnt seem to find a way to tell it which one to watch).  Ive also had some times where it seems to start streaming stuff and eating CPU even though i have it minimized to the taskbar, and frankly dont watch video streams on it.
---
darn, to me it's silithus static
---
FOV doesn't help you see over hills/walls like zooming out does though.
---
If you’re trying to be a “hybrid” then I’d recommend HotW. You’ll be able to tank dungeons and you’ll have a huge mana pool to heal with. Moonglow is probably the more raid efficient healing spec, but it’s not much of a hybrid. You’re not gonna have enough of the needed talents to make balance a viable dps spec.
---
Laughs in stealth
---
8 resto shamans!
---
Then I will rush a level 60 just to shit on those guys 
---
hm i do that in a strafe jump. strafe backwards, jump and flip the camera quickly to see if im about to run into anything. my camera also never adjusts so i can keep casting while looking back.
---
In my heart it was bound to Esc
---
Shamans are really popular but raids often need them quite much. Cant really eaid as elemental, unless like shitton of consumables, resto is really the only way to go. 
---
Vanilla is a virus.
---
Main reason why Classic will be 2-3 times bigger than retail.
---
There isn't even a competition.
---
Honestly I miss that a bit. More crudeness, but less seriousness. Easier to shrug off insults or whatever when everyone's talking shit and joking around on the forums/general chat. 
---
Good old Zboards.. I wanted one of these so badly as a kid.
---
I feel this, especially the part about the hype building every day. I was super hyped when it got announced, but lately I've been getting more hyped every day. It must be the recent blue posts which from what I can see prove that the classic team really cares about this game, and therefore it's going to be awesome.
---
It still be part of BattleNET launcher and will likely share the main folder with retail but not require it (as retail is already stored in "\_retail\_" subfolder).
---
I mean...if you get bored of wow you can also just do more coke.
---
If you liked private servers you will like classic officially as well. Thing about classic is that there will be grieving, elitism and drama in 40 man's for sure. But that should't be too different to private servers. 
---
There’s a great Vanilla Book Club -series on youtube that goes through the in game books and lore in them! I’ll post link here soon, I feel like its really good stuff to listen to. 
---
Dropped out of college in 2006 because I skipped classes to play 24/7
---
I imagine it will be lumped, like the subscription, and they will make it as easy as possible to switch between the two. Blizzard is a business at the end of the day and their ultimate strategy with Classic is to pull past players back into the WoW universe.
---
I think you should put a basics for tanking section since a fury warrior who can't tank becomes much less valuable after mc.  You could just list stat prios, link the specs and go through the threat rotation, and that would be all most fury warriors would need
---
I've always dreamt of a blockchain WoW, or maybe a torrent that was constantly synced with character data.
---
In terms of volume DPS makes up the lions share of a raid group. However finding DPS is Easy.
---
Horde Side, Resto Shaman is a good call imo. Healers are always nice and raids do tend to roll with a lot of Shamans for totems. 
---
For Ally side Paladin for the same reasons but blessings vs totems.
---
Priest is always needed and good on both sides. Same with a Warrior, I would say being 0/31/20 Fury Prot gives you the advantage of doing good DPS and also able to offtank bosses/trash better than other Furys.
---
I mean yeah, DST was BiS until like, Sunwell.
---
Except you wouldn’t be installing 7 expansions worth? Just the infrastructure for Classic and BFA?
---
Tbh your mom (partially) made the right move. Theres no reason why your dad should be paying salary to people who spend most of their work day playing wow
---
\+1 for full length cloak. Was about to comment this 
---
I know on retail you can find guilds like this. However with cross realm raiding it's easier to join anybody. With classic not so much. I recommend checking out the weekly stick posts for guild posts. Odds are somebody will have raid times matching those days. 
---
You should list them all and what they do, for inspiration.  
---
Damn, shazam is a great player &amp; seems like a cool dude. 
---
I did it the other way around, started playing CS:S after quitting WoW before TBC came out.
---
Smh, you clearly live in the world of theorycrafting and YouTube videos. I look forward to your palpable disappointment in Classic.
---
Since I've gotten into the Classic hype, I've had the same temptation as you. I'm impatient to start playing again but I don't want to spoil the rediscovery experience with a private server. A friend talked me into trying retail with him and it made me a little worried that I just don't like WoW anymore. Hoping that feeling proves false when Classic rolls around.
---
I have been, for the last 2 months, as well as the discord. No luck.
---
Three steps to picking up girls (played by dudes) in WoW:
---
1. Helmet
---
2. Shoulderpads
---
3. Mount
---
(Optional) 4. Purchasing an ill-advised weapon spec because hunters with 2H axes are badass

You're almost certainly going to be able to find *something* that works. Maybe not in the hardcore guilds, but I'm sure there will be many more casual raiding guilds out there who will raid at least one of those nights.

"What if I told you...you could level a rogue to 60 without ganking lowbies?  Would you believe it?"

Between this and the “How Wow ruined someone’s life” thread this sub just got a whole lot more depressing.

I usually jump to Westfall around lvl 12 or 13, and then knockout Westfall, and Lakeshire.

That will get you to the late teens, where you can go back to Darkshore and head south for the beginnings of your 20s.

Saw this since I was a part of it...

Was leveling with a buddy of mine through Tanaris and we decided to camp out hordes trying to do the mech chicken escort quest. We’d wait by Steemwheedle port for them to almost be finished and kill the chicken. Usually the chicken isn’t attackable. However, if you attack a player of the same faction as the person escorting, the chicken will come to their aid, and you can burst it down before you are killed by the escorting party. People getting that close to finishing the quest has spent close to half an hour walking that chicken straight across the desert. Needless to say, doing this repeatedly started a small faction war around Steamwheedle which quickly spread to Gadgetzan when people started to bring their mains and guild mates. Was a lot of fun!

pretty sure it's an ORCED episode
---
I recall getting some wand as a help from a guildmate. I was shocked to hear that it required no ammo - as there was an empty "ammo" slot.
---
Then, the same day, a similar wand dropped for me... twice. Someone saw 2 auctions of it on ah, and thought that one is my own drop, but the other one must be the one I got from my guild. I got kicked without question.
---
My guild had a typo in its name.I remember they were going to ask a GM to fix it. So, I created a new guild with the correct name, blocking their rename - as a sort of punishment.

&gt; I understand that in PvE I will mainly healing. 
---
That's really only true for raids and even then, it's not a guarantee. In dungeons, feral DPS or tanking is perfectly viable. I don't know much about balance in vanilla, but 5-man content is pretty flexible.
---
I would lean toward HotW if you want a true hybrid, especially for PvP as you'll want the extra mana for all of the shapeshifting you'll be doing. It also gives you the option to either tank or DPS as feral and you'll be a sufficient healer if you have a strong group in dungeons. I did a similar spec for my druid alt through vanilla and I just kept a ton of spare gear to cover the different roles. 
---

Though, there is a version for all popular games.
---
what a nice woman she is and yet asmongold sometimes is the toxicity in person
---
I don't think so. Druids even with all we know now require more work and also a guild that is willing to give the druids a chance. I think most people that never played classic will stop half way through. Getting to 60 takes a lot of time of not well researched for optimal lvling which most people don't do. Raiding is gonna be a whole different lvl with people having to work together, meet up on time and use specs beneficial to the raid and not personal preference.
---
So looking at the extra effort feral druids have to put in I'm gonna speculate that they still will be underdog. A lot also has to do with personal preference for races, class identity. Druids never are the most popular in any fantasy unless they are widely known as op. Same for warlocks I think. They just don't do the dps early on of mages (mainly because of threat management, without threat a warlock could top the meters no problem with infinite mana) and will get to know the rogue plague while lvling which is sure to break some warlocks.

You seem like a Druid.
---
Well you ruined that guilds night lol.
---
&gt;Plenty of people despise it and will refuse to play it. I loved TBC, but I don't want to go back to it.
---
Sounds strikingly similar to the people who don't want Classic to happen; just let people play the version of the game they want. You're literally complaining that people who want to play BC will choose to play BC if they release it... so they shouldn't, because you want everyone stuck with vanilla since you like it more. It's an unreasonable argument and it being "bad for the community" is just disingenuous
---
And yes asking for "new vanilla content" from modern Blizzard is completely nonsensical
---
Need more red pills
---
If your plan is mainly pvp doing pve for the gear, rogue is the way. Rogue pve and pvp gear actually overlap, so you'll have a much easier time gearing your rogue. As a druid whose only doing "some" pve, you're only option is going to be healing and then explaining why you need to roll various items outside of your healing function for pvp...
---
Agree
---
I don't get it, the earth is flat though?
---
/s
---
First off I was mainly thinking immo trap. Either way Later mobs take over 15 seconds to kill especially when you're Killing a couple of them. It's also more Mana efficient then multi shot which is a core part of your rotation anyway. Seprent sting is one of the more Mana efficient dps abilities hunters have.

People are weird about mobs. I remember being forced to steal this Elite from a group because they refused to invite me. They had room. They just didn't want to invite me for some reason. Thankfully a mage helped but I took that bastard down and then smugly looted it in front of them. I wanted to say "should have invited me" but they didn't say anything so I just ran off.
---
If you are in grad school and have a part time job and have an SO, while maintaining 40 hrs of gaming a week, you literally must do nothing besides game in free time and seriously neglect aspects of those existing commitments. 
---
I'm not complaining, I'm just making the point that every option presented is bad in its own way and has negative side effects to the community at large. Some people want TBC after phase 6, some don't. Some people want new servers re-released ever couple of years, some don't. Some people want Blizzard to release new classic style content, some don't. Some people are fine with perpetually phase 6 classic, some aren't. Each option fragments the community in some way no matter what happens in the end.

Yeah, I have a full time job and fiance and puppy nowadays. I doubt I'll be 60 any time soon.
---
if you played rogue before, rogues are quite similar throughout wow, stunlocking, burst damage with cds, stealth vanish, blind all that jazz, obviously vanilla got its own specifics and different, but ya overall its similar. vanilla druids are very different though.
---
if you going manily for pvp, druids are THE flag carriers in vanilla. other roles they aren't so good or excel at. they are good at escaping, surviving and running around. not really damage dealers, and as for healing in pvp other healers are better aswell, druids are good at duels though, cos they outsurvive the opponent and slowly wear it down. 
---
overall rogue is a more stable choice since they are just good, druids is very specific, i wouldn't reccomend it unless you want to specialize on flagcarrying in bgs.
---
Go 39. At 49 you might as well just level to 60, the bracket is not that popular and a non twinked level 49 with some dungeon gear can kill you even if you're twinked. 
---
getting cone of cold at level 26. biggest boner
---
The infrastructure is not the same, and you can't install BFA without installing the other 6 xpacs.

Do you like running away? Because that’s a Druid in wpvp. No one can kill you and you can’t kill anyone. 
---
Lots of fun in BGs though, running flags.

Yep.  My city's alternative sub /r/seattleWA started as a discussion-based off-shoot from /r/Seattle 3 or 4 years ago.  Now it's mostly sunset pictures.
---
I think most people are a little burnt out on discussing the hypothetical “post classic” and are just excited to play.
---
There’s a lot of competing ideas and theories, all have pros and cons. The prevailing thought seems to be, no matter what we wanted classic to begin with and we don’t want to sacrifice the ability to play classic for later ideas. Discussion becomes too nuanced and hypothetical beyond that.
---
Hotw is better for 5 mans. Moonglow for raid healing. You can PvP with both, just ask yourself do you want to be more balance oriented or feral? 
---
Same with Horde and camping the entrance to RFD/RFK/Thousand Needles

I wish I could find an old friend to play with, all of them won't play and my brother doesn't enjoy vanilla anymore :(

Haha, you made me look it up. Good job at making me doubt myself. So, no: summer solstice starts Friday June 21st and ends Monday September 23rd. Look it up in google if you don't trust me.
---
If your Alliance you can get that fire flask trinket from the dude in westfall at level 40. Its my favorite quest chain in the game
---
You can link all text wall you want but my info came straight from Gumdrops on his stream. He said the team wants to preserve that Classic feel but since Classic is building off of 7.3.5 there may not be away to not do it. As far as the API that only impacts the AH download feed and the DBM price structure. You could still technically scan the AH manually just as we did before the desktop addon.
---
&gt; A friend talked me into trying retail with him and it made me a little worried that I just don't like WoW anymore.
---
Dude trust me, even with a private servers hitches, glitches and combat numbers not feeling right it felt absolute leagues ahead and better of retail. for instance twice I found myself getting punished on the Echo Isles, either I was too low or my gear was trash but I was dying trying to Solo Voodoo priests, so 3rd times the charm and again I'm about to eat dirt when a fire balls flys in from the side and blasts the Troll dead! before I can look around another lvl 7 invites me to a group, i thanked him for saving my bacon and he tells me no worries hes having issues here too. We quested together for about 1/2 an hour clearing the isles and a few crab snot quests before he needed to dip. Soon as he left it hit me, thats whats been missing all these years, challenging leveling mixed with friendly dudes helping each other out.             
---
Please dont let that retail trash make you think Classic will just be a reskin of that crap! 
---
STV PvP!
---
A true Huntard.
---
Is it confirmed they will start with those original mounts?
---
Can’t tell if you’re trolling
---
Look at it this way. You will save a ton of time waiting around: groups love druids because they can tank, heal and dps easy without falling behind too much in any aspect. Druids might even be the better dungeon tanks while still bringing tons of utility. Pvp always welcomed as well, either to carry flag in Av, defend a point in arathi is a rogue (good rogue plus druid can wipe a 5 man casual team easy).
---
Farming pummelers isn't that much extra effort. Think about how much time other classes lose not finding a group to do content with or how much quicker druids lvl. 
---
Also think about the fame of being one of the few and leading the first dps charts with pummelers in the early raiding. 
---
Got mine from a water elemental in my late 40s.  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=1315](https://classicdb.ch/?item=1315)

Very helpful. So rogues are similar throughout all of wow, but druids change a lot. Can you explain more on this? Like what the biggest differences for vanilla druid and current druid?
---
Same with quest mobs/items. Nothing like waiting forever for a quest item to spawn, and then after it finally does, four mobs spawn on top of you. Then a Gnome Rogue appears and takes the item while you die and /lol's at you.

Was pretty salty after that. I think I decided to just abandon the quest

I always try to keep similar spells in the same bind for different classes, for example stances or forms. While druid i have shapeshifting in ZXC, while playing warrior i have the stances in the same buttons. This is not always possible.

If the bind have some "natural" feeling for the spell binded is easier to remember. For example I use Wheel Up to some straight displacement (blink on mages, charge/intercept for warriors).

I'm a Horde man but I'm actually thinking of running Alliance in Classic to see the other side of things, so this is good to know! Thanks.

But wat if mage 
---
This was on a Pserver ... but A dick move none the less.
---
Once 60, most classes require the Hearthglen quest to get their BiS gear. The quest involved an getting a magic disguise, an escort and a hard fight, made a lot harder by the buggy nature on Pservers. There was also an assload of pvp in this area... so successful attempts were rare.
---
My group got to the final event and we’re about to finish, when a group of waiting horde decided to gank. I was the groups priest and kept us up long enough to complete the quest and tried to run for my life. A single horde warrior in the group decided to chase and followed me halfway across the map.... a few /chickens, /lol later,  I succumbed to my injuries and died. However, having nothing better to do for the next few hours. I quickly res’d (renewed my disguise) and decided to ‘dispel camp’ the gate to Hearthglen. I didn’t go as far to dispel all horde... just my new warrior friend. His group tried really hard to stop me and successfully killed me a couple of times, but I just ran back and dispelled him inside the keep (they even tried hiding him) Also worth mentioning, the quest has a ridiculously long respawn, so plenty of time to muck around. After about the 5th dispel, the entire group logged and I considered it job done and log myself...HOWEVER! Some time later I log back on to find Mr Warrior and his pals standing at the escort area. Annnd off it went again! 
---
He's always very nice to his mother, very gentle dude and reassured her back then it didn't matter how long it took. He can come of as a dick at times but he's not really a bad dude
---
There will be a lot of friday/saturday raid guilds.
---
Lots of people are busy during the week.
---
What if i told you there is millions of people who all want to play the game differently!? Can you imagine!?
---
49 is a far better balanced bracket. The 31 point talent and access to mounts makes a massive difference in the variety of classes.
---
It unfortunately has been discussed ad nauseam.
---
Generally speaking, half the responses are going to dismiss it as too early to talk about (fair response), and the other half think the idea of rolling seasonal servers are a decent idea as long as the servers are clearly distinct from the infinity servers.  And there's a handful of responses that usually rant about what a stupid idea seasonal servers are that seem to ignore the fact that they aren't required to play on them.
---
lol I still remember seeing ads for these keyboards in Blizzards Product Catalog that was always bundled with their games. Cool to see a real one after all these years.

I want to have Mining, Engineering, Cooking, First Aid and Fishing at max or near cap when i reach max level.

Mix this with some world pvp, dungeons, improductive days... 
---
Oh god, cataclysm will arrive before i can reach max level.
---
Just try and see if you enjoy it 
---
Depends entirely of what you want to do
---
God tier farmers / levelers
---
Pretty good at PvP ( depending on player )
---
Good at pve 
---
That doesn't make sense. They could just run a bunch of the same servers in parallel if they needed to. 
---
The biggest difference from vanilla to retail is that in vanilla you couldn't speak to NPC's whilst shapeshifted. In addition everything a druid in feral could do, a rogue can so better, I even evasion tanked a boss better than our OT druid tank as a rogue. Unless there are changes made to druids and specifically to them in feral you're honestly going to be just trying to outlive your opponents majority of the fights.
---
As a boomkin, you can do some nasty stuff (with gear) similar as resto, back then moonfire did so much damage so you'd literally be hitting and dotting.
---
Compare that to a rogue that can ambush crit from 20ish to chunk 50% or setup a stun lock combo applying poisons and nerfing your healing and movement speed.
---
I personally played both druid and rogue from vanilla, honestly if your main goal is pvp go rogue then level a druid for fun or to heal/raid with.
---
Not a problem, just keep a second gear set for other roles in cases you have to tank/heal after all when you can't find a tank/healer. And don't underestimate 5 man dungeons. Without the proper specs the margin for error is a lot narrower. 
---
I farmed for and upgraded my Dungeon Set 1, did the quest lines for the Dreadsteed, Infernal, and Doomguard.

I did this in early WotLK just because I wanted to. It's all about being a Warlock and repping the class. Gold comes back.

Depressing? I’m all in for enjoying the fun and good times but gotta figure out if it’s worth for me. Not tryna sour the fun for anyone else. Plus the responses have been encouraging for gameplay.
---
But can you link the ruin life one you intrigued me 
---
Ok, upon doing some more research, i found that you are also right. There is the metereological and astronomical solstice and they are on different days. Kuddos for making me less dumb today.
---
Hunters are insane at farming gold. 
---
How they are in PVP is entirely dependent on your skill though, as are all 3 classes you mentioned. No one will seek you out for PVP but if you prove yourself you can fill a role. You will be the bane of rogues’ existence. 
---
On my server(Hakkar) we had 2 hunters gunning for Grand Marshal(Asinine and Fifi) and the rogues on the opposing team would just quit out. I don’t think they ever let a rogue into the Warsong base. 
---
If you play a class that's actually good at pvp. Have fun as a cloth wearer when that rogue steals your herb.

Master comes from the latin word Magister which means a title or form of address given to scholars, especially those qualified to teach in a medieval university. Like a Mage who practices magic.

21 divided by 15 is 1.4

# The Argent Vanguard
---
**DnD style, Argent Dawn-themed Roleplay**
---
* **Region:** EU
---
* **Server Type:** RP
---
* **Faction:** Alliance
---
* **Play Times:** Varied.
---
* **Priorities:** Leveling &gt; Roleplay &gt; Dungeons
---
* **Particular Rule:** Willingness to engage in both organized &amp; random Roleplay.
---
* **Contact:** discordapp.com/invite/BGQ4Z9e
---
# Introduction; In-Universe
---
The     Vanguard, commonly known as the ‘Argent Spear’ was originally    created   in order to allow the Dawn to strike at foes in the farthest    corners  of  the plaguelands of Lordaeron.
---
Over    the  years as they gradually discovered the agents of both the    Burning   Legion and the Scourge have spread to the civilized regions of    the   world, the Dawn started deploying them as an expeditionary   force.
---
Nowadays they are known to operate all across Azeroth. Anywhere evil rears its ugly head, they will be there to meet it.
---
# Introduction; Out of Character
---
The     Argent Vanguard aims to be the premier roleplaying destination  for    all  your Argent Dawn themed roleplaying needs on Classic WoW.
---
We will offer:
---
* Weekly events &amp; multi-part campaigns.
---
* A commendation system for tracking player achievements.
---
* A defined path of progression, with multiple platoons &amp; roles to fill.
---
* Our own, home-brew RPG system for events.
---
* Discord server.
---
Our     Roleplay will be grounded in canonical lore, with our events  taking     place during the Vanilla timeline. This does not mean however  that     concepts expanded upon and introduced in later expansions can’t be      introduced into our stories, within reason.
---
We     wish to emphasize persistence through our Roleplay, so we will   often    spend long periods of time away from major Roleplaying hubs,  even     outside of guilds events.
---
We also wish to manage &amp; maintain a PvE &amp; PvP wing of the guild to fully exploit the content offered by the game.
---
With the Vanguard there will be no downtime, always having something to do.
---
I'm jaded and cynical enough about women that I couldn't give less of a fuck about how my video gaming is going to impact dating.

---
Dear god know. 20-30 was fun. 30-40 was a slog. Arathi Highlands is so goddamn big and boring without a mount. 
---
hots suck, they tick slowly and there are only two of them. 
---
So in vanilla, its yet to become this hotting healer type of  a healer. druids actually more heal with a direct heal in vanilla (with healing touch). Obviously they still got couple of hots  and use them but its not the main accent of the class yet. there is no lifeblooms, hots ticks dont get affected by haste etc. 
---
feral druids - cats are weak in pvp, they squishy (leather armor) they simply don't do enough damage, tigers fury doesnt give you 60 energy, and you don't have berserk, you don't have any combo or energy points regen talents. there is no talent that gives you instant cast after 5 combo points. no cyclones obviously. (druids don't have cyclones at all in vanilla).
---
basically its not that feral cat type of play, it became since wotlk. (actually i mained druid in wotlk and loved it, in vanilla its completely different).
---
Or also there is no maim (combo points stun).  so you can't really stun lock ppl either. so ya cat is very underdeveloped and underwhelming.
---
moonkin probably is the most similar. (you have 2 dots, offheal, and can blow someone up with starfire crit) but as i said you need a ton highend of gear for that to be viable. and again no cyclones so you just spam damage. (ok you get roots)
---
54th day of summer is August 13th (which is a Tuesday btw). Seems like a realistic release date to me
---
I just want to thrive again!! Ugh yes I need this so bad
---
Well I want most people to think like you so I can shine more :p. Min maxing is fun. Strategy and tactics. Just because there were fewer resources didn't mean there was no min maxing back then. As far as raiding goes, just look for a casual guild if you want to be the best, you can't just have fun at the cost of others taking up the slack, don't be that guy. Don't want to min max, don't join a min max guild. 
---
Hunters are awesome for leveling, solo farming and PvP, you are a god before 60 and even early on at max level. Really the only downside is that you dont use many of hunters in raids (5-6 early on and 2-3 in AQ/Naxx). But if you are dedicated and have a group od friends to play with, this wont really be the issue. The class is really rich in spells and and capabilities, it's pretty fun in my opinion. So if raiding is not something you want to focus on exclusively, you should at least consider the hunter
---
Idk I’d really disagree. I have a full time job and I play vanilla wow on private servers and I love it. It’s just a timeless game like chess you can reset the pieces and play over and over and over again. 
---
I don’t see myself getting bored come classic, my wow addiction is too heavy. 
---
how do you feel about twinking? could still enjoy the feel of some classes just not all the way to 60.
---
Yeah, I'm leaning towards rogue.
---
I mean, I plan on making every class eventually just for fun and for twinks and such. 
---
This was more of what class should I main first at launch. 
---
Thanks for all the info!
---
Try the coin flip method. Can’t decide between rogue and Druid? Flip a coin. You get rogue and find yourself okay with the choice, go rogue. If all of a sudden you find yourself wishing the outcome were different, go Druid. 
---
Many coin flips later you’ve got your class hah. 
---
Good work :).
---
Finally getting proper bubblehearth at lvl 50, truly the apex of power.
---
Because of that annoying center screen mouse bug

---
True, but it's access is less of a determining factor. You'd take any shaman, but you'd beg for a dwarf priest. 
---
Warrior, Shaman and priest
---
Its the easiest class to play, hardest to master.  Good hunters stand out for sure.  First 2 tiers of content you do alright, after that it's bad.  In terms of farming, you can farm maura and possibly DM north depending on what they allow.  You can make excellent money this way.
---
In the beginning you can do good dps, but by the end you'll mainly be utility.
---
If you're twinking, you're not looking for a balanced fight.
---
You're mostly looking to pub-stomp losers in leveling spec, and leveling greens.
---
*Huge* is pretty misleading. it's a nice addition, but it's not going to suddenly double your mana pool.
---
Hunter is great in pvp and with a high skill ceiling but a mediocre player will still be good so that’s the floor.  Obviously the floor is the same with any bad player. 
---
For PVE mainly dungeons it’s micro managing a pet to not pull extra mobs, ie tab targeting, jumping down with out dismissing, or skipping mobs with out dismissing. 
---
Also Hunter actually have a rotation and for maximizing DPS the tricky trinket swap. A lot of utility if played right add in Engineering with jumper cables for pve and the added bonus for pvp.
---
Easiest class to level, farm and solo runs for gold.
---
Early on raids you will be needed then about AQ40 and Naxx your still needed for Tranquil Shot, however at that time is rumored that’s when hunters DPS falls off due to poor scaling with gear. Whether or not that is true is a different discussion between Pserver players vs Actual Vanilla players back then.
---
Go Mage your needed for everything from portals , vending machine, DPS and CC. Always in high demand.
---
The pressure of launch will build on all of us. Like a 10 page paper you don't start until the night before when you *have* to commit
---
You are right, but it's that fear that makes them do it. The fear of running into a min maxer in open world pvp, the fear of not finding groups to play. Even though they are the majority. 
---
Troll Shaman, mon. ;)
---
We are all holding our breath until the official stance on this
---
That thing was advertised in the back of every PC game manual and magazine from 2004 to at least 2006
---
Likely you'll have to use 
---
/castsequence Find Herbs, Find Minerals
---
and press it each time you want to switch, as they're using the 7.3.5 Addon API and I think the macro capabilities are tied to that.
---
I have no idea what vanilla is. my best wow memories are from private BC server.
---
I'm only played Horde my whole wow life , but lately I found a new passions in fantasy dwarves. Mainly because of warhammer Ironbreaker. So I will probably play a dwarf warrior tank. No idea if it will be needed. Other option is dwarf pirest. 
---
and verry last option is orc shaman (if I have to play horde)
---
Any tought on those classes on vanilla ? 
---
Do you even Desolace?
---
Having recently mained a hunter on a private server and getting 6/8 T2 with exp through all BWL MC and Ony, I can tell you that in the beginning if you can play the class right you can easily be a top 5 dps. But it’s also easy to fail at them, I’ve seen full t2 hunters consistently do horrible dps. And as far as farming and leveling go, they are easy mode. Once DM is released and if it’s possible in classic you can farm DM trib runs, easiest gold making method I’ve ever found. I had a great experience on my hunter, I didn’t get to experience AQ or naxx tho which is where hunters start to fall off on dps compared to other classes. But overall there is always a need for hunters in raids because of frenzy’s so as long as your consistent you shouldn’t have a problem getting a raid slot.
---
P Servers don't have the same sort of community I'm looking for, so I know they won't work the same way Classic will (or I hope will).
---
If you are trying to decide between rogue and druid. Always pick rogues. If you are going to be a druid you need to be 100% sure thats what you want to be. Other wise you will be filled with regret as you work 300% harder to achieve 85% of the result.
---
What server was this? I was in a similar situation on sargeras but I was in the horde premade. We had Chinese farmers to compete with though.
---
[This far.](https://i.imgur.com/WohfxXb.jpg)
---
I've been playing on a 3k pop server and I can tell you the world feels very much alive. There's rarely if ever a farm spot uncamped. There's always people looking for dungeons in world chat. There's 10ish guilds doing raid content. There's always BGs running, albeit only one or two off peak hours. 
---
3k pop server cap #nochanges
---
I thought we all wanted no changes?
---
This whole question reeks of Retail.
---
Classic is not about endgame raiding.  Its about community, exploration, a million things to do, completely alternate ideas on what constitutes fun. 
---
Some ridiculous adventures:
---
* Trying to find a way into Mt Hyjal
---
* Having a party in Ratchet - Bring your best outfit, beer, and fireworks.
---
* Swimming around each continent.
---
Anyone who is obsessed with the raid content only, and unsubs between raids... should stay on Retail.
---
I had to switch servers like three times because Blizz NEVER merged. It was a strict policy, I guess they didn’t want to even suggest any kind of drop in retention even if they had way to many servers and still a growing population.  
---
That was a long time ago though so hopefully they have a different philosophy now. Then again it’s never easy to try and manage servers the old fashioned way, never really a satisfactory solution. Which is why newer MMOs went with “megaserver” tech
---
Haha that’s why we’re all here for classic! We want to work harder for less. 
---
Hard to say, imo I would go combat because you don't want to respec all the time and will have a bigger loot table for weapons to use. 
---
Hunter playstyle is super janky. Standing still to shoot, weaving abilities and melee hits in-between your shots. If that sounds cool to you, you will like PvE Hunter.
---
PvP is pretty simple. If you hit them at your max range they can either run away or die. If they start a fight at melee range it's an uphill battle for you.
---
tl:dr hit the road
---
:D that sounds really inviting. How do they fare against mages? I always really enjoyed being able to beat highly regarded classes, especially sneaky rogues.
---
What the actual shit :) I am not disagreeing with anything concerning sharding, what are you talking about?
---
The only thing I, and the commenter above, disagree is:
---
&gt; We all wish we could be playing on 10k player servers
---
We don't. Sharding or not. Even if sharding is not necesary/not considered. It was not like that in vanilla.
---
And don't call others morons just like that. What are you trying to achieve with that?
---
On a single P Server with 10k pop, totally see it.
---
On 100 Classic Servers with lower population and far more diversity of player, I don't see the Devilsaur Mafia being strong enough.
---
This is what I was looking for, thanks.  Yeah personally I think this sucks but it is what it is.  
---
People twink for different reasons. It’s easier to get BiS gear on a twink than at 60 and if you choose a popular twink bracket, then it can get quite competetive.
---
This is very common on private servers, but it won't be *as* common on classic because it costs money. It'll still happen but not like it does on private servers.
---
C'thun doesn't drop any bracers?
---
I really want to roll a shadow priest. What do you plan on mostly doing for end game?
---
Only as a custom channel.
---
Though I can't remember which patches the official LookingForGroup channel existed in.
---
Play a priest or paladin
---
The same way everyone fares against mages. If they’re a 3 minute mage with their cooldowns you’re dead. If they don’t have cooldowns you win. If they’re frost it might come down to gear and your spec. 
---
Good to know, thanks.  I dont like the idea of an app in the background auto installing user generated applications.  Seems like it could be abused. 
---
I will probably plan to manually install mods.  Total PITA, but probably safer.  
---
Sucks that spriests go oom so fast and aren’t really good for raiding 
---
Everyone loves a sarcastic comment, such valuable input!
---
I mean it could be fun, but if i make a lets say a lvl 19 twink rogue, it could very easily get ruined if i don't get some items or get too much exp.
---
This is weird
---
Are you trying to tell me that [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room#Rc0z0zJ89czkMVz9m8VOc808Vvh87cVFV808zwK808VFG808Vnf808ozN808VFN87cVPk808VZ2808VJ4808) is not one dapper mother fucker?
---
Twin Emps, my bad.
---
Mages are hunters worst imo... if they dont pop anything you can win but if they're frost and really good at playing your dead zone then you're fucked.
---
Think so? I couldn't get into the sims so I have no clue how addicting it is or isn't.
---
&gt;Do they get their asses handed back to them in pvp? 
---
No they are quite strong duelist and also do well in BG's.
---
&gt;How much harder will it be to find guilds and raids with it?
---
It can certainly be challenging, there's a lot of people that like to play hunter, and only 2-4 raid spots. However typically if you just put in the work required you will find a guild. Get your prebis, be a decent player and all that stuff. A lot of hunters aren't the best of players so to say, so you can set yourself apart very easily.
---
&gt;can you farm gold well with them? 
---
Yes. Amazing gold. First is maraudon which you can solo the last part of, 5 clears of this dungeon gives on average 50 gold, and you can do this in 40-60 mins depending on your gear/skill. Most good gold farming spots give up to 50g/hour so you are doing well. Other than that it MIGHT be possible to do solo tribute runs, which is like 120g/hour, but my bets are this will be fixed in classic because it's OP. Other than that you can farm stuff in the world better than any other class so you'll be fine there too.
---
&gt;How is their skill ceiling?
---
Hunters have one of the lowest skill floors (effort required to play), but also a quite high skill ceiling(maximum efficiency possible), which is very nice, so that's not a problem either. They are actually one of the hardest classes in PVE, and in pvp they ofc have high skill cap too.
---
My problems with hunters are: I find them a bit boring at 60, it can still be difficult to join the very best guilds, because of the limited amount of hunter spots, and they do quite poor dps after BWL is out. If you get a satisfaction from being #1 on meters, don't play a hunter, but you can still outperform other hunters in guild or even in the world(assuming we have a dps loging system like pservers). 
---
I have a shaman and a warrior that I raid on and I can't tell you a single piece of gear they have other than my trinket has the word sliver in it on my shaman. I only know that so I can maintain the crit buff with other people who have it.
---
I can see where you're coming from but if it's any comfort I don't think most players will opt to play at this zoom level at all times. Most of the time I play at about half of the zoom level that I showed in the screenshot and only really zoom out like that when I'm someplace out in the open and need to see incoming gank attempts.
---
If I couldn't zoom out as much as I can, I'd probably just resort to 360ing my camera constantly instead.
---
well when vanilla was an actual thing, i did level a orc warrior to 60 and for some reason i stopped doing dungeons after i was like lvl 45 or so. Soo i grinded and did quests till 60. 
---
I think warriors are good also good tanks, priest is fun if you like healing, which i do like.
---
Shaman i also played a bit, but priest and shaman i only got to lvl 30 or so same with warlock and paladin.
---
Just posting what I found. Do you happen to have a link to that VOD by chance?
---
Thanks
---
Oh I know. But I leaned more towards PvP anyway. Warrior, shamans, and priests are always in high demand. The warrior leveling process is going to be a slog though. 
---
Right. Interestingly, I kid you not, those are my top 3 as well. I want to be able to DPS, and also be able to do something else. Druid can't really do anything great at the highest level, Paladin can't DPS or Tank at the highest level, mage, warlock, hunter, and rogue can only DPS. 
---
So that leaves Warrior (DPS and Tank), Shaman (DPS and Heal) and Priest (DPS and Heal). 
---
Okay good. Let's officially narrow it down to those three, right now. From here on out, you're not going back, you're choosing one of those three. 
---
Next question: how many hours on average will you put in every week? 
---
Management of servers has always been a pain in the ass at scale without fully planning before hand. Why do you think data centers have such a massive stack of SLA's (service level agreements) that they have to prove they did or else they're liable for whatever happened?
---
 There's tons of shit to think about or else you're going to be putting out a ton of fires if anything goes wrong.
---
It's no where as easy as "just spin up a bunch of servers and it'll be fine" or else sysadmin jobs would be dead simple. A few examples would be: 
---
How do you roll out updates to the servers? what if one server goes down? what does a heartbeat check on the servers? what happens if there's an exploit on one or all the servers?
---
I can go on and on but the fact of the matter is doing anything at scale is significantly more difficult than doing one. 
---
If you're still saying its going to be easy then you don't understand the amount work that goes into setting up an infrastructure. Just think about how many network engineers handle the rollout of games yet there's always something wrong...
---
A.K.A. the K***** approach (not mentioning the name, because rules - it's a private server). They're already on third season/iteration, and it seems to work very well.
---
Honestly Blizzard could really learn from them concerning Classic longevity. The server is up and running without problems with population or anything for years already. It flew under the radar with N***, LH and others who just burnt brightly briefly and died.
---
Damn, I guess my server wasn't heavily reviewed.  It shows 35 on Dec 16, then 60 on May 03.  And I know I got to 60 some time in March.
---
What program are you a part of? 40 hours is absolutely insane if you truthfully spend 40 on school a week, 56 on sleeping a week, and 20 on part time job, while trying to keep a healthy relationship with a SO. 
---
I don't have a main myself. On pservers I've played almost every class, most classes are very good and have unique stuff they can do (everyone except paladins they fucking suck, and warlocks are just discount mages lets be real). I wouldn't stress it. Play something you find interesting at the moment, and just stick with it. You cannot enjoy all classes at the same time(or well it's very hard), you can probably only play 2 maybe 3. But beating yourself up on all the classes you could enjoy doesn't help you, just enjoy the class you play even if you would also like to play something else.
---
Sounds like you excluded yourself
---
Absolutely not. In fact, I think that Robe of Volatile Power + Wild Growth Spaulders is one of the best gear combos in the entire game.
---
Clownsuits are one of the reasons why I'm excited for Classic :)
---
Fair enough.  Thanks
---
That is so good to hear! I was afraid I was misremembering because of the nostalgia goggles. I haven't touched the game in almost a decade and it was a while before that when my vanilla / BC guild split. The community is the reason I want to play again!
---
I do not but he streams on twitch regularly and I think he is actually streaming now.
---
Or start a thread on the realm forums. 
---
Knowing that the game the game gets worse with every expansion will change my outlook on the game for sure.
---
Vanilla WoW made me hate rogues so much that I still go on rants about them today. Hell, rogue stealth ambushes made me hate STEALTH so much that I grew to loathe it across multiple games, to the point that I to this very day insist that invisibility mechanics have no place in PVP gameplay. I hate having to play PVP against invisibility classes so much that I judge negatively the quality and character of a person who enjoys making other players miserable in that fashion.
---
Rogues, man. Hate 'em all. 
---
Monday and saturday isn't far off, typically friday is no go. 
---
Have you tried "/console rawMouseEnable 1"?
---
Worked for me.
---
As a warrior hitting level 40 is a huge milestone.  You get a mount after not having any movement boosts till then, you get your lvl 40 talent mortal strike or bloodthirst after basically autoattacking for 39 levels, and you get to switch your mail gear to plate.
---
Lol its all in good fun, I make fun of him for spending a his vacation in Reno gambling, drinking and watching football. Probably creeping out waitresses and night capping with trashy escorts.
---
I appreciate that.  In any event it seems like there hasn't been any official discussion (feel free to correct me if im wrong).  Thanks for replying 
---
No doubt resto shaman, on ally I'd reckon dwarf priest is the winner, perhaps warlock. 
---
When everything sounds fun, maybe you should tie break with things like..
---
-gear dependency vs how much time you will have
---
-will you want to do heavy pvp AND pve with same character? If so will you want to be optimal at both, and if so, are you willing to respec constantly or not?
---
-role you want to fill in raids
---
-role you want to fill in bgs
---
-social aspects (warrior is a good social class while hunter is a good solo class)
---
Can you provide more info?
---
Some more then others lol. I am not farming manual crowd pummelers just to be able to raid. I am dedicated. I ain't that dedicated. 
---
BTW, anyone knows any place, where I can buy cheap isopropyl alcohol in north Iceland, easily? I'd return to that Dark Souls...
---
BM hunters are one of a mages worst enemies. You can keep range if you start the fight far, keep a pet on them and BW out of cc so they literally can't get a break from your pet. Kite + Mana drain their ass.
---
Hunters are awesome in pvp, but they go from 5 stars when you can pick and start your fights to 2-3 stars when you get jumped. Stay aware, and be quick - get tidal charm and consumables to shore up the times *you're* the one being ganked.
---
For this reason, taurens are a great choice - more hp and a stun to disengage
---
*saps you*
---
Coordinating with people is always hard. Just because you have more information doesn't change that. Heck might make it even harder than it was in vanilla, because now people know what to expect of other classes and allow less margin for error. 
---
Got curious after your first comment and had to check it up, yeah twin emps is the actual first non-set healing wrists. First plate wrists is t3 in naxx. Jesus christ that's rough...
---
Demo isn't anything to judge by based off what they've said since then. But I don't see why something like reordering characters would be removed.
---
Well im prob gonna play around 5h per day unless i play something else, but that depends how much i wanna play wc3, halo mcc or 2077 when ever they are out.
---
On weekends it depends, but i could play for a long time. I mean latest game that i played was Sekiro and what i did go to work and then come home and play sekiro (which i now have 50h in).
---
&gt; Tank and healer are neither rolls of a warlock though.
---
But that one raid where there is that one boss you stack shadow resit on...
---
I know. I can't wait
---
I also played Hakkar US during vanilla, I was A Rank 13 Destro Warlock, Kitiarra and fought Asinine and Fifi many times, good/fun memories. Who was your character?
---
Can you provide more info? Do you like to be social or go solo? (Warrior vs hunter) Do you care about Raiding? Pvp? Bgs? Do you want to be able to do both pvp and pve with 1 spec? Do you want to pick a class that will has good itemizationa based on the level of time investment you can commit, and how much time will you have? (For example warriors do well with large time investment, while hunters get good gear early and don’t scale as well as they progress)
---
People will say to just go with your heart and choose what sounds generically “fun”, but you looking at these questions can help tiebreak.
---
&gt;I would have preferred it so that there were no profession exclusive benefits at all (possibly except purely cosmetic ones). I'd have professions be entirely optional, and dependent on economic considerations, practicality, and personal interest.
---
Way to make professions boring as hell.
---
"But beating yourself up on all the classes you could enjoy doesn't help  you, just enjoy the class you play even if you would also like to play  something else "
---
Ill try this, thank you
---
You need to Bravely Default that shit and loop the sap twenty more times to make it accurate.
---
Well said mate, big thumbs up...!!
---
Ya this. I'm thinking it goes the Diablo model with seasonal resets. 
---
The last pre-cata numbers we have tell us that 70% of players never make it past level 10.  That means if we want servers to eventually stabilize to that magical 2.5k-3k Vanilla-like population, they will need to launch with populations of ~11-12k.
---
Imagine 11-12k players all trying to play on launch day -- decidedly *not* a Blizzlike experience!  So what are our alternatives to keep the starting zones reasonably populated?  Early shards fit the bill perfectly and also prevent the possibility of server merges after ~1 month.  Instead of trying to level with 2,000 other Night Elves all in the starting zone at the same time, they can shard those first 5-10 levels or so to not have to screw with dynamic respawns or other non-Blizzlike compromise.
---
Yeah, they're totally going to release the game in a month with no beta or ptr.
---
Definitely.
---
Orc racial is better than und for pvp. 
---
I like to be solo, but i also like groups, i love pvp and Bgs. Raiding i never did in vanilla, so i would like to do it in classic.
---
Nah coordinating 40 people still gonna be more challenge than any modern 10 man raid can provide. And people not pulling their weight will have a hard time finding a spot. Knowing all we know now people will also be expected to farm All the consumables.
---
It will only be easier if you raid with the same guys again and those that are used to it from pservers. I doubt most people will take as much time as back then to teach them their class and role now that everyone can easily find the right info. Although there is also info overload and that can be a challenge for people as well. 
---
May have been TBC. Wrath I barely played.
---
Totally free on Saturday and after 6 Monday/Friday, free till 2/3 on Sunday; zero time on the rest. I've raided in several expansions, but had a different schedule and it was always Tuesday/Wednesday. I could swing 4+ hour raid nights without much problem, my schedule is pretty consistent, but it doesn't seem to line up with most people on here.
---
&gt;Do they get their asses handed back to them in pvp?  
---
[Well played] Hunter's can dominate most people in PvP.  
---
&gt;How much harder will it be to find guilds and raids with it?  
---
I'd say hunters would probably be in the middle of the pack for this
---
&gt;Are hunters a good first choice, can you farm gold well with them?   
---
They are a good choice as you can be a very fast leveler and start to get things setup. Pets make doing higher level things and elites much easier. They are arguably the best gold farmer in the game with Tribute runs, and one of the top with princess runs.  
---
&gt;How is their skill ceiling?  
---
They have probably the lowest (highest?) skill floor, as in their baseline is extremely easy, while also having the highest skill ceiling IMO. There is extremely nuanced things you can do to edge more out of your character that other hunters wont put the work into to learn or master.  
---
&gt;Are hunters frowned upon by the community? I really disliked to be called huntard   
---
You'll probably be called huntard. Especially if your pet pulls something in a dungeon, or you take a melee weapon. Just play well, and people will appreciate you being there, even if they joking call you a huntard.  
---
Classic may provide these answers for Private Servers to fill in the guesses. 
---
What valuable input could anyone even have about this pointless ass post? No fucking shit they’re going to test their servers. 
---
Nobody takes us so we have to use every advantage we can get :(
---
I was leveling an alt in Dustwallow Marsh and this lvl 50 Ally hunter started following me. I /pleaded and said /no to him not to gank me but he did anyway and corpse camped me a few times until I got on my main and went back to the zone to find him.
---
I killed him once, then did /plead and /no then /waved just to let him know it was me, then I logged off. I get back on my alt and he ganked me again, so back on my main i went, but he was gone.
---
I figured I would teach him a lesson so I wrote down his name and guild and created an Ally toon. I applied to and joined his guild. I started talking to him and asking him questions about his life so I learned his whole schedule and when he had time to play.
---
Every day I would log on to the ally alt, see if he was online and where he was, then I would log onto my horde toon, find and kill him repeatedly until he wouldn't rez anymore. I would then get back on my ally alt and listen to him cry until he logged off.
---
He even created other toons and I would use a different horde alt to kill those too.
---
I did this every single day for months. It got to the point where I would know exactly where he was in Stormwind and every once in a while I would gank him on my rogue in his own city just to prove a point.
---
For all I know he could've switched servers, but his main was level 59 the day he quit the game.
---
I don't like the dungeon finders that literally does everything for you. Like sign up for group and suddenly it pops because you found 3 dps 1 heal and 1 tank. No thanks to that.
---
But something like a place where you can see who is interested in this and that dungeon and you can whisper them if they want to join etc. I don't think that does any harm to the classic experience, all it does is that you read that, instead of looking through a wall of text in general/trade/lfg etc.
---
It's actually pretty sweet. The green bracers are comparable to druid/priest T2, but they drop from a dungeon boss who can be easily 2-maned. 
---
There's a difference between full, and completely over saturated. We want stables servers in the 30-60 levels and the play through to be stable at all times.
---
Starter zones are naturally a funnel, by nature, and so you get such numbers where a 2hr 1-10 leveling experience could be dragged out to 4-5 hours due to complete lack of mobs to kill, and in turn, quests to do. 
---
It's best for everyone to *be able to play* than to strong arm #nochanges
---
Like I said I’m efficient with my time, that leaves a few hours a day for me to devote to my SO. I also sleep 6-8 hours and find that fine, my average is ~7. I make my own hours at my part time job, and some weeks there’s 5 hours of work sometimes up to 30 depending on the season. 
---
It’s a good program, small but somewhat well known. 
---
Honestly people love to be martyrs and say they can’t do shit but it’s just all excuses IMO. If you want to do something you can make the time for it, and you have to not sit around and waste time.
---
I hope it works.  We all want to relive the glory days, but folks are older and times have changed.  
---
Only time will tell if going back will be a success.  I'm hoping, but Im not convinced just quite yet.
---
I'm still doing lots of research to find out if I should commit.  I really want to haha.  
---
I mean if you think Blizz hired an entire dev team just to duplicate content already on private servers, youre the dreamer.
---
Hunter is, ironically enough, one of the hardest classes to master in classic, they got a bad rep because there were a ton of people jumping into them because lotr, cool pets, you name it, add the fact that everyone was kind of doozy in vanilla and you have a big overlap and a bunch of the so called huntards, but to progress, to get rhok delar, to reach the potential of the class you need to saddle the fuck up.   
---
  There's a billion things to take into consideration, you need to follow a certain tempo to squeeze as many auto shots as possible, this means moving, using abilities and EVERYTHING during the tempo downtime so you don't waste anything, you need to micro your pet, you need to possibly squeeze in melee hits, possibility of nightfall, you need to use tranquilize, swap trinkets on feign death use which must be coordinated to avoid aggro, kiting, etc, compare that to a mage spamming 2 spells.    
---
  And this is just on pve, hunters also require you to carry ammo, know your pets and what you're using well, carry food, constantly train the pet with higher spells which require new pet taming, all just for the usual day to day.  
---
  For pvp, hunters can completely decimate, their pets give them a lot of leeway and with some beasts like the zul bats or broken tooth, you can completely ruin casters day, your kiting, traps and beast mastery means you're always a threat one way or another.  
---
  As for gold, it's one of the best, you can solo things like no other and even sell runs through things like maraudon, you can get a big amount of gold just doing stuff over and over again.  
---
  Trust me, if you play learn to play the class it pays off insanely well and ANYONE that looks at you will be able to tell immediately you know your stuff and the people that will call you a huntard will do it only out of rage, jealousy, whatever.  
---
  I recommend [this guide]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOcqrIfi0qI), while long it gives you great info and good luck if you decide to join us, just know that to be a real hunter you need to put in work.  
---
I dropped out of college because I spent all my time playing TBC, but if it wasn’t WoW it’d be something else, I was miserable at the time.
---
Wrath being such absolute shit was a godsend, got me to stop playing entirely and I focused on my career instead.
---
The short version is it lets them overpopulate a server at launch, to then end up with a healthy population once the "tourists" leave.
---
&gt; All sharding does is put you onto another server. Every server will have a full starting zone
---
And while this is *kind of* true, if they implement it the way we think they're thinking (which is only the starter zones, and only for a week or two), then you'll only be put into a separate bubble if you're in a starting zone, *and* the starting zone is overpopulated.
---
So once you level up a bit, and/or go to a main town, you will not be sharded and so can interact with people on the "true" server you're connected to.
---
Thus it should only impact community and meeting people for the first few levels of the game, and well before any dungeons.
---
-------
---
**TL;DR** It's supposed to be a balance between community disruption and tourist/population disruption.
---
I think it's the least worst option personally. I'd rather they do this than have a random chance the server you pick dies within a couple of months of launch and free transfers are needed.
---
The problem is that if you shard the level 1-10 zones, the 11-10 zones (barrens, westfall) etc. will suddenly have the same problem the 1-10 zones had. People will fly through the first few levels and then all get bottlenecked after that. Whatever zone you end the sharding with will be full of people.
---
I didn't keybind back in the day when I was a pre-teen but on private servers I taught myself to start doing it. I'm not a pro binder by any means, but I use these:
---
1-2-3-4-5 
---
Q-R-T-F 
---
plus shift and control modifiers for all those, except for shift-1 which is difficult to reach so I replaced that with shift-C.
---
Now that you mention it....I don't even *remember* farming for the epic mount in retail....Last time I can recall is WoTLK..I skipped mists entirely, the majority of WoD, played legion, and I don't remember farming for a mount period. 
---
I remember farming for my first epic mount and first flying mount like it was yesterday though. 
---
2,000 people competing for a handful of mob spawns in a very small area might not be a fun experience for most people. Since it will be at its worst in starting areas and early levels, the argument is that playing with sharding for a little while is better than effectively not being able to play the game at all.
---
Personally, I'm with ya - I'd rather see a day of absolute madness and creative leveling. The starting areas would probably cool off naturally within a few days. 
---
&gt; if they implement it the way we think they're thinking (which is only the starter zones, and only for a week or two), then you'll only be put into a separate bubble if you're in a starting zone
---
Isn't that more like Phasing? Didn't they specifically say no phasing?
---
Truth be told the IT sector is a match made in heaven for a gamer tho. 
---
I would be surprised if even half the population of people that never played classic will stay around to hit max lvl. And the dedicated, experienced classic players will make it even harder on them in open pvp, premades or just raid progression, pve grinding spots, gathering nodes ect.
---
People fool themselves with all this talk of how easy classic will be because of all the info. Wow classic will be more hardcore on pvp servers than it ever was, since more people know the "secrets" so time invested will be even more required to stay ahead. 
---
And I don't see casuals staying around for long once they get rolled over again and again in pre made BGs.
---
Nineteen if you have more vanilla stuff from SH, please post it!
---
I know this post was from a long time ago,  but I wanted to chime in to help your decision making process. Although alliance locks have to deal with wotf, keep in mind horde locks have to deal with paladin spells and fear ward. Obviously thats more pvp based than wpvp, but something to keep in mind.
---
Yeah, at a certain point we're all just going to have to face the music.  That's the question I'm more interested in an answer to, personally... where is Blizzard going to choose to draw that line?  They aren't going to make everyone happy regardless of what they choose.
---
Instead of having every single person on the same realm(on pretty much one large shard) you split the realm(shard) into several shards and in every shard there's let's say 150 people or whatever. Even though the server running the realm has the same amount of power, it's way easier for it to process everything that is happening when every person is not stacked at the same place.
---
Crossrealm and that stuff is confirmed to be in classic at all.
---
Nope I knew a girl 16 who moved in with our guild officer who was maybe 30 at the time, turns out she was completely off her fucking rocker and he lived in some state with squatter rights so it took weeks for him to get rid of her.
---
I would not say I’m a martyr defending those with excuses for not enough time, but I do look at things in a realistic sense. I also graduated with a masters degree, while maintaining a part time job, while having a girlfriend, and also working out/playing video games in my free time...BUT, saying I played 40hr/week would be absolutely insane to me with my previous workload. Good luck. 
---
You know april fools was yesterday right?
---
Dont skip Ashenvale, searing gorge and badlands. Those are the generally skipped ones with good stories.   I also like to run to wetlands just to do the raptor area quests because they give a great wand upgrade for that level range... it's a small albeit fun quest chain but it's a very long way to run just for that.
---
I have a suggestion...pick up a hybrid class, because hybrid class has many roles in game, when you will get bored with the first spec...then go and respec into something else, for example if you choose from the Alliance side (PALADIN) you will have the privi to have 3 roles ( TANK \~ HEAL \~ DPS ), also same thing with the Horde side (SHAMAN)
---
ps: the people who can't decide what class to choose this method solves everything.
---
I had this piece of trash... switched back to my Logitech keyboard after a couple weeks of use.
---
Thanks man. I will keep my ear to the ground then.
---
It's not that I didn't believe you. I just like to research research research. :)
---
Whether we say it or not, we're all at least curious what may happen after naxx progression.
---
Tbc doesn't interest me or any expacs. 
---
Best scenario imo is focus on classic, see where / what the community wants as progression and the forum between community / blizzard continues
---
Its up to the individual I think. I know one thing that burns ME out is doing the same thing over and over. That and I have an aversion to playing on a pserver.
---
What can I say. I am a paladin at heart.  :D
---
Oddiz nailed it - we’ve handed out some for free for people to try out first. 
---
Compared to other classes you have tried, mainly mage and rogue, what did you find the most interesting to play at 60? That may be a dealbreaker for me. If you've played something other than mages or rogues, that interests me too as I am still really open to what I'm going to end up with.
---
The problem: Overpopulation
---
 We all know classic launch will be SUPER hyped, everyone in the fucking world who's interested in any kind of wow will probably play it. Most of these players won't stick around. That's fine, the game is not for everybody and people just want to try it out and see what it's like. This overpopulation means blizzard has to compensate by allowing all these players to play in the limited starting zones, and blizzard needs to be prepared for these players to leave after a while, meaning they want very high caps on the servers, so they don't die out after a while.
---
How does sharding works:
---
So sharding works by splitting each server into shards, they are duplicates of the same server that people jump in and out of. It basically means there is x subservers for every server, but it's a lot more fluent as people can jump in and out and the amount of shards of an area depends on the amount of players.
---
It fixes:
---
A) Being able to complete quests / kill mobs. On launch with millions of people in the starting areas, this allows people to kill mobs and do stuff, without having literal 10 man groups around a mob spawn. 
---
B) Lag,  showing thousands of players on your screen at once not only lowers your FPS by a gazillion, it also burns up the servers. Believe it or not, but splitting the server into shards actually increases performance even though you have to control the mobs/objects once for every shard, because the multiplayer part of the game takes way more resources than controlling mobs and objects in the world.
---
C) 
---
That's not been my experience.
---
The 49 bracket is a way to enjoy PvP that has mostly the same feel as it does at 60, but it's vastly easier to get BiS gear and compete.
---
But.. But.. ARCANITE REAPER HOOOOO!!!

Whelp, I'm a derp and mixed up terms and definitions. Gonna go ahead and delete the OP now.
---
Until you want to respec from healer to dps and then to tank and so forth.
---
Well I have a suggestion then...pick up the hybrid class (DROOD), because hybrid class has many roles in game and that's fun in my opinion.
---
ps: the people who can't decide what class to choose this ''hybrid'' method solves everything.
---
Beautiful.
---
Okay, I'm gonna do you a favor here that you're not going to like, but I feel like in the end it's worth it.
---
Congratulations! You're going to play either a Shaman or a Priest!
---
Do you want to hit level 60, explore the horrors waiting in the deepest depths of MC? Do you want to join your guild as they climb to the top of the ancient fortress of blackrock spire, and take on Nefarian himself? Do you want to not get bogged down in the levelling process, lose sight of your goals, and become yet another player who created the slowest levelling class and then couldn't make it? Then you'll love either a shaman or a priest! 
---
I just feel like overall, if you're like me and easily distracted, then it's better to stick with a class that it's okay to get distracted because they're fairly easy to level, easy to gear, and can find groups easily. Warrior meets most of those criteria but not all, and so we've cut them from the list. You gotta make a choice sooner or later right?
---
Okay so next question (also I gtg soon so I might not reply for a while to your answer to this). 
---
It sounds like you've played WC3 before, so tell me what are your top three favorite campaigns in WC3 and why? 
---
Yep.. I get it. And keep in mind I'm not saying it isn't happening. All I'm saying is that Gumdrop stated that the team would like to preserve the Vanilla feel.
---
Sekiro, fgo, warcraft 1-3
---
this made me lol irl. seriously fuck everyone
---
Holy shit lol
---
If only you went orc warlock (I like UD aesthetics and racials for pvp anyways) that would be really cool and fun to do the trek to tirisfal at level 1.
---
But you can do the opposite. 
---
I think lorewise, tirisfal is more interesting. 
---
Then ashenvale as there's much more going on between horde / alliance, and the creatures / demons that are taking over are awesome.
---
This extends to stonetalon mountains as well.
---
Desolace, I never found to be gripping but some people like the open gray deadness that is the zone. It's like a gloomy, massive shimmering flats in a lot of way, infested with demons.
---
Stv is unavoidable and really cool, but basically just a giant hunt led by the infamous nessingwary.
---
You'll really have to do a lot of looking and grinding to find paths that don't overlap. Stv, barrens, these feel like entirely unavoidable zones.
---
Lol there’s zero debate retails trash Classic isn’t.
---
I like it! Some people who are smarter than me could probably create an app/website of some sort to have one big, shared shitlist for each realm.
---
Exactly
---
Why are people always claiming you need to spam trade chat? Did everybody forget about the /who function.
---
Can a Blacksmith with sufficient skill attach Mithril Spurs or Thorium Shield Spike to an item another player owns, maybe through the trade window? If the recepient does not have Blacksmithing, will the improvements still work for them?
---
Mayor of Redridge?
---
Imo it makes it harder for the vast majority. Guilds will tollerate slackers less, only allow for hybrid specs for people that can actually use them well. Farming all kinds of consumables all the time. Only the Super dedicated people will have it easier. Sure the content itself will be easier, but the expectations to perform better will also be higher.
---
Actually nothing will really change, the most dedicated will still get the best loot and the casuals will still be stomped by premades. Only now the hardcore players will have it even easier to get an advantage. 
---
I know for a fact in Black Morass in TBC I could pull the whole place on my prot paladin by riding around on my mount and literally never got dismounted. Despite people going "oh no you fool you will get dismounted your plan is bad!".
---
I don't know for certain it was defence rating but it seems like a good bet.
---
Looking forward to cheering you guys on :)

Outfitter

God I had no idea people were so bad at planning and organization. Seems like people just roll their face on the keyboard and use that for bindings. Here you go OP, this is how a hardcore progression raider and PvPer binds their action bars. Spells with a cast time should be on 1-5 since you'll be lifting your middle finger off W to stop moving. Letter binds are perfect for instant cast spells since they can be pressed comfortably while holding W with your middle finger. Remember it's not a competition to see who can contort their fingers more. It might be easy to hold W and press 3, but it's not necessarily comfortable, follow me. Other than that concept, and having auto attack/ pet attack on mouse buttons, I would say my biggest suggestion comes down simply to the bindings. You'll notice the 1-5QERFCXZ fills an action bar perfectly and all the buttons line up and encircle WASD. Complete. Full. Perfect.
---
We don't know honestly. I hope they allow it like it is in the live server. It's just nice to be able to let your OCD work a bit ya know?
---
I play D&amp;D twice a week -- as a player on Tuesdays and as a DM on Thursdays.  Really scratches the RPG itch.
---
Other than that, I'm the same boat as you bro... F5'ing /r/classicwow/new waiting on a release date or watching Classic WoW content on YouTube.
---
The #Nochangers are pretty toxic when it comes to minor details like this, I wouldn't be surprised if a few haven't sworn to kill themselves if this exists.
---
That's why I was curious to know if it was in the demo or not to plan how I'll create my characters that's all.
---
Combat daggers. Adrenaline rush backstab spam is incredibly fun in pvp/pve
---
D&amp;D and Hearthstone work well enough for me.
---
Somewhat true. However there will be a spread of different times for people reaching the next zone. I can level a hunter to 10 and get him in the barrens in about 2 hours on an average population server. I've seen other players who are new to vanilla take 8+ hours. There will of course be an average leveling speed where there is a huge clump of players arriving in the next zone at the same time- but it won't be as bad as everyone starting at the exact same point in the same phase. Sharding allows the faster players to make a break away from the main group. The slower players are probably more casual and won't care about breaking away from the main group as much.
---
Casually catching up in ESO for the Elsweyr expansion and also planning on finally playing all the borderlands games since 3 got announced. 
---
"Let's add another class that does everything every other class does... but different!"
---
I think you're in the wrong sub.
---
Just skip STV, whatever you do. Every other zone is pretty fun. 
---
The only debate that exists is between the true Classic supporters and the moronic retailers that spend every moment begging Blizzard to change the game to make it “better” for them and trying to ruin it for the rest of us like they did retail. 
---
We don’t want your stinking QOL changes, RAAAWWWWRR!! Lol
---
What wishdoctor said. If you specifically want this tunic go and do the chain and VC. 
---
Westfall is a slow area for levelling thanks to how far apart everything is. 
---
Try Darkshore - Westfall - Redridge - Ashenvale
---
My experience has been that as soon as Blizzard introduced the twink/non-twink split BGs, all of the twinks stopped playing.
---
Which is pretty telling.
---
If anything they should be begging Blizz to make retail more like Classic lol
---
Tips ? Never heard of her
---
Do they have access to the original 1.12 client as well or just the data?
---
DETHECUS FOR DETHECITES.
---
(lol I xferred from Archimonde)
---
There won’t be elves in the horde and thrall is warchief... that’s all I got
---
I already saw you comment on another post regarding hunters in this thread :D Ty for your input.  
---
If its not too much to ask could you tell me about the upsides and downsides to mages, comparing them to hunters? This may be super vague, but I'm not looking for very specific answers either.   
---
The playstyle of a mages for example, I hear its like a turret, deadly if left alone. I feel like a hunter is more agile, and by kiting and ccing you can play around your enemies. But there is no playing around a mage if he can outdmg me by a large margin.  
---
My first ever wow experience is from wotlk (and the majority of it too), and Vanilla seemed, from what i gathered from pvp vids and raids, to be a different game. I really enjoyed the wotlk hunter playstyle both pve and pvp and it was probably my favourite wow experience. How similar, if you have knowledge of this, would you say Vanilla and Wotlk hunters are?  
---
Thank you for your guiding words :D
---
Hi
---
I’m looking for a us raiding guild that aims to compete on the top level. I’m an 18 y/o that’s been playing vanilla on pservers for the past 3ish years. I’ve cleared all content as a rogue and priest. 
---
I have around 200 days played total. 
---
Don’t care if it’s ally or horde, pve or pvp. I get shit done.
---
Yeah, and you'd be a moron to take one.
---
I think it's pretty obvious they need to shard at least till lvl 20. Lvl 20 is a pretty significant investment in vanilla, most casuals won't get there in a weekend. 
---
Hi, /u/Jester2008
---
If he wants the node then why is he attacking mobs instead of mining?
---
It is known
---
I don't remember that ever happening.
---
I played the 49 bracket extensively during both vanilla and TBC and it was always full BGs of twinks.
---
Very popular class but mediocre damage at best in raids. It's mostly a utility class (tanq shot, buff melees with wolf) and there's no real benefit from having more than 2-3 in a 40man, especially post Lupos nerf. This leads to a pretty rough competition for raids slots as every hunter will want their T1/T2 sets.
---
It's hands down the easiest and fastest class to level and solo content with. You can solo Mara with minimal gear in stage 1 and later DM in stage 2 to generate liquid gold. It's also a beast in PvP if played well. 
---
I've played rogue and mage actually, but this is probably not accurate to you since I've played a bit too serious in a minmax sense.
---
For leveling I enjoyed mage a lot with aoe farm, it's difficult and rewarding. Rogue is slow in way that is actually kinda rewarding, but hunter being able to kill anything and speed level is a lot of fun too.
---
In raiding I enjoyed both rogue and hunter, I think rogue a bit more because of the high dps and being melee. But hunter was also very fun trying to minmax with keeping the buffs on your pet alive and I could actually pull some pretty high numbers when I did it right which felt nice. Mage was pretty boring in raids, many bosses are literally just frost bolt and use CD's the right time. Even going into AQ as fire didn't change much though it was definitely an improvement. AoE in raids was pretty boring as mage because of lag spikes doing it(I think that's because of threat and damage meters), keeping mana doing a speedrun was kinda fun in a sadistic  sense trying to abuse potions and drinking tricks(if you right before mana ticks you get the big mana tick and then you can move until next tick). 
---
For gold farm they are all good and fun. For dungeons I enjoyed hunter a lot, they can do a ton of stuff with pulling, sometimes I failed and my tank hated me but it was lots of fun. Rogue is pretty fun too. Mage would have been fun but honestly as a mage you just farm gold instead of doing dungeons for prebis which I really disliked.
---
For pvp they are all pretty damn good. They are certainly different playstyles but they are all nice in their own way.
---
Well yeah? The game had just come out, for some people just playing an online game was a whole new thing. some people were still on dial up in 2004. She couldnt just google how to level like we can now. Neither was mmo gameplay common place.
---
My question is would I regret choosing hunters? I doubt it, Hunter is fun!
---
Do they get their asses handed back to them in pvp? Not at all, they are quite good PvPers given a certain level of skill
---
How much harder will it be to find guilds and raids with it? Shouldn't be too bad, all guilds need at least 3 hunters on average for Traq Shot. They do better in the early tiers and kinda fall off on dmg in AQ40 and Naxx
---
Are hunters a good first choice, can you farm gold well with them? A few good first choice. THe best leveling speed of all classes. Great gold farmers!
---
How is their skill ceiling? VERY HIGH. A skilled hunter can do some insane tricks in both PvP and PvE. 
---
its inside you
---
I've known a few people that 'work from home' but just spend all day playing games until a ticket pops up in their queue.
---
Makes me mad jealous
---
I mean i did level a warrior to 60 in original vanilla, but stopped doing dungeons past lvl 45 because?? So i just did quests and grinded mobs to lvl 60. So there is that, but to answer to the question.
---
My fav campaigns are ROC orc campaign, TFT UD and orc campaigns.
---
in ROC, well the whole thing started with orcs with Thrall seeing the vision and then went to kalimdor and friended taurens and whatnot. 
---
in TFT it was nice to see what happened after ROCs ending and to follow Arthlasses journey in all its glory. 
---
The orc bonus campaign was nice to see what happened to thrall and as he build orgrimmar, plus it was different than usual, item drops were cool and all that stuff. 
---
It was even more cool when i made my orc warrior back in the day and actually went to the places i saw in wc3 and to orgrimar and Thrall. It was so nice feeling 
---
(im going to sleep tho, so also won't answer until i have woken up.)
---
You’re pry gonna have to wait till much closer to launch if not after launch itself.  Most guilds will not form until then and many of the ones that have been advertising for months may not transition for whatever reason.  
---
Or people can.. wait for it.. play the game like they want to play it? It's a hard concept though since not everyone plays the game the same way and has different priorities
---
Nostalgia is a part of it to be sure but it in no way as much as some of the haters will shout from the rooftops. It genuinely was a different game bk then, and that difference is what i genuinely Miss, in wow and any other game.
---
&gt;outbid mages on Azuresong Mageblade
---
You mean the Azuresong Paladinblade?
---
How realistically is that any different than farming consumables for any other class? 
---
Upvote, upvote, upvote this dude! Lol
---
hah that sounds like me and my team being 5 rating from glad. The team above us got it, we were the cutoff point - rank1 duelists.
---
Are you playing on a pserver yet to get a feel?
---
I’ve met a nice group of people but they’re going pvp. I might have to dip out. I don’t wanna deal w this shit. 
---
MT is usually the dude making the calls, usually someone that 'runs' the guild, a leader. so I can see why they do it but rofl it's a video game what the fuck, these bitches are crazy
---
No im not, im currently playing wc3 and sekiro 
---
How many "let people play how they want!" comments does this thread need? 
---
I mean, it's free upvotes I guess.
---
Redundancy is something this subreddit excels at. 
---
Atlas - all versions so loot tables, dungeon maps and quest lists 
---
Would like the ability to move ui elements as well.
---
Classic is too hard. Quests don't show up on the map! How am I meant to do them now? 
---
What do you mean leather items are BIS for warrior I wear plate! 
---
I died because I over AoE'd before the tank had aggro, noob tank vote kick! Wait what I was removed from the group! REEEEE
---
Most of these are pretty tame.
---
The worst I saw, bar none, was the people that rang the AQ gong either before other guilds were ready, or transferred to other servers and rang their gong.
---
You can find another herb node. You can't find another gong.
---
I hope you're correct about toggleable graphics; OG all the way.
---
SM-ruin warlock
---
Druid has several hybrid specs
---
The standard hunter pve spec works great for pvp, if you wanna be a bit spicy you can take imp concussive shot instead of the mana reduction.
---
You can go winterchill frost pvp mage, it's not 100% optimal for pvp but it's the best a pve spec can do for mage.
---
Shamoon you can go 30-0-21 if you guild is cool with that(it does hurt healing performance a fair bit). Else you can go healing spec and still be fairly useful in pvp.
---
Paladin pvp healing can be done just fine in raid spec.
---
If you like rogue or warrior you are out of luck. 
---
I bet you will be able to find a fri/sat guild somewhere. Maybe closer to launch when recruiting really picks up.
---
Worst case scenario you can roll a high pop server and be a weirdo freelancer. Pugs, pvp, gold farming, alts, etc, isn't such a bad life.
---
I bet the release date happens suddenly without any explanation... on July 15th... release date?.. July 16th.
---
This is why I will have my 60 ret paladin show these fools the light.

Yep, a huge company like Blizzard needs to take technical advice from reddit hahaha
---
I have basically nill wotlk experience. I have messed around on a DK a tiny bit is about the extent.  
---
Both hunter and mage are turret like, more damage if they can stand still and damage away.  
---
I'd recommend looking up clips on youtube of what you want to see (BGs, duels, open world, Raiding, Dungeons, etc). There is tons of content so you can see what they are doing.

Oh you dont understand that I listed ooc regen as the most important thing because they literally found nothing important from feedback?
---
All the items listed that were fixed would have been noticed internally, but they get to tell the community they helped so much!
---
I always level to that 40 with my friend for mount and then gank STV for days on end. This time as rogue and mage. Usually hit 60 with 3k HK's.
---
well at least every 5 minutes the 3 min mage roasts him/her-self ;)
---
Save it for Goldshire.
---
Sharding isn't planned to be used outside of starting zones for the first weeks so not in capital cities either so your entire argument about the downsides is completely invlaid
---
In 20 minutes.
---
I did it on my latest playthrough. It's more than viable if you use the succubus. 
---
You end up with 13% extra damage from all sources (wanding, fire dmg, ect) instead of 10% to just shadow damage from shadow mastery. 
---
Typically you just dot and wand with no downtime between mobs. No need for shadowbolting. You also get seduce for pvp jumps or pulling extra humanoids. 
---
I've seen two dick moves on the same server:
---
The first was a small raiding guild that I joined.  The GM was mouthing off on the forums about being first in MC, yadda, yadda, yadda -- and well, he was lucky enough if we made it fifth on the server.
---
Oh, he had the whole gambit of 'followers' (this was a re-roll server) and had set up class leads, loot council, the whole nine yards.  
---
We proceed into MC, second week, the Eye of Divinity drops, and of course, it goes to the priest lead.  Third week, Domo's down again, and again, it's the eye.  Even though I had best healing stats of heals and low overheals, it went to the other 'follower.'  BTW, they both had farmed / purchased the Eye of Shadow -- so all they had to do was finish the quest.
---
Week five comes around, neither priest has the Benediction, can't seem to finish the quest, and another eye drops.  Again, I'm told through loot council that I have to wait.  I pvp'd and dungeoned with the MT and two of the DPS warriors -- and they questioned me why I didn't have the Benediction.  I said that I had 'passed on it' so that the other priests could get theirs first, that I was easily healing and getting good mana regen from the old "staff switcharoo" when not in combat.
---
Week six -- and NONE of the priests have their Benediction.  I'm staying silent, just having fun in the game, enjoying the PVP and the twice-a-week raiding of MC.  Finally, someone says something on Vent as to "Why don't our priests have the Benediction since over three eyes have been handed out..."  It was then explained that the quest is glitched, WoW knows about it, and they're waiting.  They've tried the quest as a group, helping each other solo -- and just can't complete it.
---
Finally, another eye drops -- and yasssss!  It's MINE.  I have the Eye of Shadow stashed away, have all the mats for my spirit enchant, have the oils / buffs, etc. for the quest.  And off I go, die once to Alliance, wait two hours, log back in late, late at night, and complete the quest with about 160 health.
---
I immediately enchant it, pack it, and get to gettin'.  Raid day comes, and it's equipped as we go running into MC, and you can't miss that spirit enchant and those floating gold bubbles and glow -- you just can't.  Guild mates whisper "congratz!" to me, I do the undead happy dance, and just get back to healing my tanks, melees, and tossing a renew on my special hunter friends and their pets.  (Yeah, I am *that* priest.)
---
Seems there's gonna be a discussion in Vent as we're working to Domo, and the lead brings up who else needs the Eye of Divinity, discussions on the hunter's leaf, etc.  Then the MT breaks in and simply asks... "Why after all these weeks in MC, does only one of our priests have the Benediction -- and it's the LAST priest to receive the Eye?"  
---
I'm not saying a word, I'm just buffing, getting down to business, because frankly...  I don't care.  It's evident this is a 'clique guild' and that there are two factions that were created by the GM and his followers; and "we the second class" were just gonna have to wait.
---
What we learned was...  It's not the epics, it's the skill.  It's not how well you perform for some guilds, it's who you know.  But in the end, it all come out in the wash.
---
Through our PVP, two of the warriors and myself were asked to do a try-out with one of the better guilds who were clearing BWL.  We knew we weren't as geared, but man, we were ready.  We left the old guild, joined the new guild, proceeded to clear BWL, worked our asses off for AQ to open, cleared and had a BLAST in AQ20, AQ40; and also got to clear up to the Four Horsemen in Naxx.
---
Our old guild kinda dissolved, all those class leaders decided to roll another class on another server and start up another guild, doing the same shit as what they did to us.  And we didn't care.  One of the other priests did app to our new guild, and we were all pulled into a room on Vent and asked about him, his skills, how he was as a team player, yadda...  And we were honest.  He got a try-out, but didn't get an invite as a raider.
---
Moral of the Futz' story -- go out into WoW, play your best with the gear that you have -- and have fun.  Skills are far more important than gear (to a point), and you can have TONS of fun being a good player that doesn't need to broadcast his/her accomplishments.  Be honest, be fair, and have some fun in one of the best MMO's every created.
---
&gt;That is until she packed her shit and moved to the other side of the country to live with her fucking guild leader she met on the internet. Who lived at home with his parents. Who didn't have a job. She told him my brother was a violent, abusive thug that hit her and the kids, which isn't true at all. She'd been trying to hide her online affair from her friends and family by convincing us raiding with her guild would suck. They were divorced a few months later. WoW destroyed their marriage.  
---
&gt;Silver lining, she had to move back here to attend the custody hearings and the custody arrangement makes it difficult for her to move out of state with the kids.  
---
&gt;WoW also almost ruined my life. I was spi
---
Not really WoW's fault though; she was just a terrible person
---
I'd love a guide this detailed for every raid and boss in Vanilla. Will really help out!
---
Shadow priests are just wpvp 1v1 gods, except against hunters, mages and warlocks. Not desired by anyone for organized pvp in bg's.
---
I have written some guides over at [https://classicguides.app/](https://classicguides.app/). Hopefully you might find some of them useful :)
---
Also sharding is incredibly dynamic. Areas will ONLY shard if they need to be. So 3 hours after server launch there won't be 10 almost empty barrens, there will be one barrens with a couple of players. That's the biggest difference.
---
I'll be honest with you this similar situation has repeated in my head that if I ever get a girlfriend that I want to marry I **never** want them to play online games with me for the sheer fear that something like this is possible. Then I remind myself that if she's crazy enough to leave me for a loser living with their parents still and has never met them irl than I am probably better off without them. 
---
Consider your brother lucky he got out on her behalf as the court could hold it against her and that it's unfortunate he didn't discover this side of her sooner. 
---
What didn’t you like about wrath?  I’m curious, since that seems to be a lot of people’s favorite expansion. 
---
I think the last Q&amp;A they actually said going forward they would look at classic for ideas as to improvements in retail. Don't quote me but I'm almost positive that was brought up by a YouTuber in the last wee
---
Wow that.. is awful.. and I want it 
---
I'm enjoying playing FTL: Faster Than Light right now. Good game.
---
Any healer- basically healers were desperately needed in both PvP and PvP so most groups didn’t discriminate about your spec if you were going to heal.
---
Holy reckoning- as long as a Paladin has illumination they can basically do whatever they want with the rest of their points, reckoning is awesome for PvP cuz u just heal till it’s fully charged then one shot bitches, and you can tank 5 mans in pve
---
Ele resto shammy- you lose the mana totem, but basically gain 80% of the benefit of an ele shammy.
---
(Haters are gonna go ballistic over this next one but...)
---
Arms warrior - fury has always been better single target dps after a certain itemization threshold, but arms is perfectly viable dps too.  
---
Arms is less gear dependent (less hit gear required),
---
The healing debuff is useful for a handful of fights if your group is sloppy (healing drake from bwl) 
---
2handed tanking is awesome when you are speed farming 5 mans (emp run brd)
---
MS lends itself slightly more to off tanking then fury does
---
And aoe dps is superior.
---
Don’t believe me if you want, we will just have to see how min max oriented the community is at launch.
---
To anyone who says they remember their first green, if the answer isn't malachite, you are wrong :-P
---
Yeah, I'm really hoping I'm remembering that right 
---
as I started reading this my trigger finger was trembling on the keyboard.  After reading, I now have a strange boner
---
Retail and pserver addons WILL NOT work.
---
There will most likely be addons working with the launch, it is possible some addons might not be available yet, but it's not gonna be zero addon launch that is for sure.
---
There's an app out there called KOS -- Kill on Site.  When someone would do that to one of our groups, we would 'advertise' on the forums to the alliance that if they gave us at least 3 screenshots of XXX player, some gold would be available through the AH.
---
Worked like a charm!
---
E3 2019 seems perfectly possible, but I doubt they'd announce it there. My guess is we get a simple update on the official forums sometime in late May to late June.
---
No thanks
---
You could have been like us -- the water never fully appeared on our screen, and when the screen loaded -- we were all dead.  :)
---
More like Ensuresong Rageblade.
---
Craft arcanite reaper like a true pwner.
---
You will want to do a fuck trillion ton of dungeons for your raiding dps, raiding tank and also your pvp gear. They will be some items that works for 2 sets some for 3, but there will be items you specifically for one of the things too.
---
you most likely won't be able to do BG's or rank on server launch so you have to take your time to get prepared with gold and items.
---
No one can deny they fill a much needed niche role in the ERP community
---
Don’t base your decisions on how other people portray their characters and skill. Each class in vanilla has its special niche. I played hunter in vanilla. 
---
I think nowadays, people are so FOTM that they never develop a connection with their character. There is a reason players today can remember their toon names from 15 years ago. You will figure out what you like and stick with it. 
---
I have wanted an official classic server since wrath, when we all believed it wouldn’t happen. I have yearned for that feeling of accomplishment again that I had back in 2005. Can’t wait! Just do what you feel is best, and not what someone else influences you to do. 
---
While levelling and in crappy gear sure. By the time the mage is in half decent zg/blue+ gear BM isn't going to be much an issue anymore. At high end gear levels BM is just kinda a joke, pet still does same dps as it did the second you hit lvl 60.
---
They do not disappear with log out on 1.12 no. 
---
The game is using the legion client so this is unlikely to change
---
As far as I understand it:
---
Phasing is where there are multiple versions of an area which are *permanent*, and are based on some material change in story/quest progress. Like you complete a quest where a town is now on fire, you can't have people being in the same place with people who haven't got to that point yet, it makes no sense.
---
Where as sharding is purely based on population, and is random. There's no set amount of instances, and no reason which one you end up in, other than population. And each instance is the same, just segregated.
---
Retail isn’t trash, it’s just a different game. In a lot of ways, Vanilla was actually trash and retail has fixed its problems.
---
* Class Fantasy - the poor itemization and implementation make this a joke for some specs in Vanilla. Want to be a holy warrior? Enjoy auto-attack for weeks, very few upgrades, and a huge hybrid tax. The only way to get the best ret gear is to heal! That’s awful. Enh, Boomkin, Arcane, and others can relate.
---
* Dungeon finding - in retail, if you wanna run a dungeon, you can be grouped up in minutes. In Vanilla, you have to spam /trade, which is supposed to be for buying/selling, or spam /World, which makes no sense in terms of immersion.
---
* In Vanilla, only a small % of players saw upper-raid content. In retail, even a casual can view and play the top-level raids. If they want to be hardcore, they can even do harder versions of them.
---
* Creating a class who relies on DoTs, but telling that class they can’t use them on the toughest bosses is objectively bad.
---
Don’t let the Stockholm syndrome of Vanilla blind you to how much has been improved over the years.
---
...nah, I’m just kidding. f retail, I’m excited for classic lol 
---
Eh.
---
In pvp gear with plenty of Stam, a BM hunter will still be a pain to frost mages. you're tankier than other specs, and in many ways have even better kiting, since your pet carries that dps
---
Anything full BWL and more, sure, BM loses a ton vs marks and survival, but many players won't get there. Its meme, but it's very effective vs frost mages
---
I confess I love that shit
---
I was too poor for such keyboards (well technically my parents made me poor, as they didn't want to allocate more budget to 13 year old me). So I had a crappy Sweex that looked like [this](https://imgur.com/mdhFNkH) (but grey/silver).
---
Your friend wanting to look cool and doing 100 runs is no different than me wanting to have a prebis item and doing 100 runs.   If that's what I find fun.     
---
Now I can see your frustration if your getting judged because u dont have the items.   
---
But at least in my experience a guild wont deny you a raid slot as long as your making an effort to get a piece your missing. 
---
People have fun in different ways.       I wanna be at the top of the dps meter. I find that fun.
---
Yo that's what this time now is for. Roll a few classes to level 20-30 on Northda1e and see if you get a better feel.
---
Right. Those classes are desired by raiders 
---
On the contrary, no matter how hard I planned, my choice remained.  
---
  I only played a shaman during vanilla, afterwards I went full on hunter, which I played to death until I quit, I decided this was the class I was gonna play forever.   
---
  Now come classic, wanted to play shaman, I planned, theorycrafted, wanted to go enhancement, read up on everything, planned leveling routes, what gear to go when, etc.  
---
  Only to decide for hunter again, it's just too fun and has too much variety.  
---
Oof
---
To your premade BG point, I really hope Blizzard implements cross-server queueing from the get go sincebit technically was in Vanilla. No one wants to waste 30-60 minutes waiting for one to pop
---
fuck asmongold
---
people like him are why wow is the way it is now
---
They hired a dev team to recreate Classic WoW. Once it is released, the game will go into maintenance mode. The Classic WoW devs will be reassigned to other projects. If they decide in the future on Classic TBC, that team will be formed at that point in time. The Classic WoW devs may or may not be on that team.
---
he's a spoiled shithead what do you expect
---
Because they don’t understand how vanilla worked. You’re one of the deluded people thinking they’ll be 60 in 3 days and full t1 in a week. Dream on
---
Clearly you've never made a dungeon group as a dps before
---
Its where all my repressed rage stems from (:
---
We had a warlock and couple guildies that would jump their way into hyjal and go to the bottom of this water source there. It was so deep that you would drown even if you started right as they summoned you. They would charge gold for a summon and more gold for unending breath or let people die. 
---
the 24 hour binge was for starcraft 2
---
Its reaaaally easy to just travel and gank. I rarely had issues with 60s back in the day because i wasnt a griefing piece of shit. Id kill you twice, maybe 3 times, then move on and kill someone else. 
---
Brutal.
---
Who can forget that guy?
---
I don’t want to diminish video games ability to hook someone like your friend here but I just want to say that your friend would likely have been struggling with something else eventually. Maybe drugs, who knows. Neither outcome is preferable obviously but this really took a dark turn and it’s likely he was unhappy in ways that weren’t apparent. 
---
As someone who played TBC as a kid, but never classic, what should I expect?
---
I've also played various WotLK private servers throughout the years, never made it to 80 though. Played spriest/arms war. Long time lurker of this sub. Plan to play a lock when classic drops. 
---
it's deep
---
So he should leave darkshore at 12 or 13, travel to kill hogger and go to westfall to do the defias brotherhood quests of running around lakeshire and darkshire, just to be too low level to do the rest of the quest? A lot of running just to run back to Darkshore, doesnt seem too optimal, sparky.
---
"At least I won't parry gib myself!"
---
😎
---
I'm sure there are literal 10s of us!
---
So many tragic attempts at LARP, though
---
Nope.
---
Having your favorite meal on top of having free beer for life vs. Eating an actual plate of dog shit:  The Great Debate
---
Well, I have evidence and you have....well, nothing.  So, I'm gunna stick with the evidence.
---
I started on a p server when classic was announced. I had such a positive experience that it made me feel like classic IS going to be amazing. The community acted more like vanilla than like retail, and it all felt great!
---
For every amazing world PvP moment that I've experienced or watched on PvP servers, I've suffered 20 times the amount of ganking and corpse camping (everyone's definition of ganking is different, I define it as killing someone who has no chance).  
---
I might just main on a PvE sever, but I'm definitely getting at least one PvP character going, those rare experiences where world PvP is amazing are hard to let go of.
---
that be him
---
He is still there to this day
---
2/3 of the DPS are Fury Wars
---
My first blue was the 2h mace from the Deadmines, First epic was Bloodrazer off a random mob in Sunken Temple, and my last green was replaced with an epic shield from the bosses you could summon in Silithus. Good times. I was probably the shittiest warrior until about level 30, but I had fun and that's what really matters.
---
I was so obsessed with getting a full length cloak ever since I started leather working and though that the bear pelt would make a cloak that looked like the dwarf in the cinematic. After that didn’t pan out as expected I remember working so hard trying to get a full length cloak. It really took some time because I could only play for one or two hours a day tops but finally I built up to it and it was the biggest rush. Must have taken over a hundred screenshots that same day. 
---
Play a private server 
---
Lmao you had me for a bit 
---
You could dip into a pserver just to get a vanilla feel again. I couldn't wait so now it feels like planning the route for the future.
---
People who do that are retarded.
---
I honestly hated Tirisfal Idk why
---
When were dishonorable kills added? What are they? Is it from killing a gray player or faction npc? 
---
Thats because pserver tend to die out as soon as naxx releases. There are simply not enough people who grind naxx long enough to make guides for it.
---
You should probably go with your 2nd plan and if you can make changes you get a bonus.
---
Still guessing August.  Summer doesn’t even start till the last week or so of June.  
---
LUL
---
Fuck I'm so jealous, as a kid I always wanted this keyboard. 
---
Indeed. Obviously not interested. 
---
That's because OP is french
---
july 16
---
This deserves more upvotes 
---
I know that a group of players have led multiple guilds through the content. Im just wondering where they learned the ins and outs. Probably from their retail days or someone who taught them from their retail days.
---
didn't happen
---
50 days played to 60. Brain melting levels of difficulty.
---
That’s the power of marketing my friend. It didn’t live up to the hype at all.
---
Looks like they strafe right even more than they retreat.
---
its a fact
---
Apex is keeping me satisfied for the time being. If you like BRs then you'll probably enjoy it.
---
Destro, warrior. 
---
49 is the most fun I’ve ever had twinking. Most dynamic competition. Felt super rewarding to gear out at this level, while still avoiding the 50’s grind.
---
I keep hearing that with zero justification. Evidence? 
---
from pserver PTR i would guess. Big guilds have usually their own servers to test things out.
---
Yes, you attach it through the trade window in the "will not be traded" window.
---
Well, in Vanilla, mining and engineering are a perfect profession combination for hunters. You can get most of your engineering skill ups by simply making ammo that's actually better than what you can get from the vendors. And a trick is to have 1 stack of powder and 1 stack of metal in your bags. Those 2 stacks of mats are effectively 20 stacks of ammo you can make in the field for whenever your ammo bag gets low.
---
The code doesn't work, but seems like it doesn't give the "Code already used" message anymore?
---
Never ever skip STV. It's the most fun PvP in the game!
---
I am typing this comment from my 14 year old one as we speak.  It is so much easier to clean this than any other keyboard.
---
nvm, looked it up.  That's super super thin.
---
I doubt it works since anyone can make a free account and level to 20.
---
I leveled a rogue just so I could screw with low levels. I would just follow them around and every time it was off cooldown, hit them with Distract or Sap them. I never actually attacked anyone, just messed with them. Eventually, some 60's would show up and I would go find a different zone to be a trickster.
---
I like to tell myself the reason I didn't reach level 60 before TBC is that I was just a kid back then.
---
The real reason is that I tried being a twink at level 19, was a twink at level 29, decided world pvp was the best thing from level 30-45, realized I had outdated shit gear because I had no money because all I did was pvp, started to pve, realized rogue wasn't fun unless I pvped, and then I started my shaman.
---
[How has nobody mentioned this yet?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEpv7YxnLCQ)
---
It's funny because it's the exact opposite for Diablo 2. 
---
I had the Zboard Merc which you couldn't change the button layouts, but in my opinion it was more comfortable. I picked it up open box at Best Buy for less than $20 if I remember right. I retired it during Cataclysm, but could convince myself to get rid of it. I found it in a box when I moved into my house 2 years ago.
---
Lol that's great
---
NO CHANGES
---
I’m making a guild for Friday / Saturday late night raiding.  Like 11pm EST to 3 am.
---
Oh, yeah, there's little actual evidence.  But I still like to believe.  
---
No long, interesting story, really, but I did quit college when nostalrius re-launched in december(?) 2016 (I hadn't played original vanilla).
---
3 years later I'm still NEETing. 
---
I was planning on starting school again in september this year but man thats like right after official classic launch... hopefully I will be stronger this time
---
*Woosh* you seemed to have missed the point completely buddy. OP's post was asking about what sharding was in general and I was giving that answer and replying to the commenter above me. Obvs it's only in the starting zones, and I wasnt arguing against that
---
I have no issue with keeping that quest in, like you said it has little to no impact on the flow and law of the zone.
---
that is hilarious
---
Was this on Stormrage? A very similar thing happened in my guild.
---
How do you communicate something as in depth as leaving your guild through emotes?
---
Play WoW. But in moderation. Why needlessly sacrifice one of the greatest pleasures in life to your lack of control, when you could instead use this opportunity to improve your self-discipline and have incredible fun simultaneously?
---
WoW is not a drug. It is more like whiskey -- too much can ruin your life, but a small amount every night provides remarkable health benefits. In this case, the benefit would be to your mental health and happiness. 
---
Michael Jordan confirmed for classic
---
Uhh did you see the demo?  Former CM Ythisens said it was very helpful for feedback and testing
---
&gt;My fav campaigns are ROC orc campaign, TFT UD and orc campaigns.
---
Shaman it is my man. You're obviously a proud member of the Horde, you shall follow in the footsteps of our brave warchief Thrall himself. Commanding the elements, you can DPS, you can Heal, you can PvP with impunity. You shall not have a hard time finding raids, and the variety of playstyles available while levelling will ensure that you do not get bored. 
---
Now, if you're saying to yourself/me "NO! I refuse, I made a mistake! I love warriors!!" well then, you have your answer. Otherwise, welcome brother, to the proud and noble life of a shaman of the Horde!
---
Would that be something they could simply turn off for people once they leave the starter zones? Excuse my ignorance, but that sounds like it could be even more intrusive than sharding. 
---
You could type "/e tells you he wont stop until you leave your guild" and it would show "JackDonaghy tells you he wont stop until you leave your guild" for both factions. Right now it would do that for your own while the opposing faction members get something like "JackDonaghy makes some strange gestures".
---
Who in vanilla Barrens had 8g lying around?...
---
I was playing on a PvE pserver which shut down/was absorbed by a PvP server just before my only toon hit 30.  I was a little ticked at the time, but I'm glad they shut me off.  Otherwise I'd likely have 3 or 4 60s and might be half-way burnt out on vanilla before classic even goes live.  It felt great being back in wow, but I'm more interested in the official version where progress will be less fleeting.
---
Hell's yeah
---
Oof.
---
what bracers are these?
---
It's all for show, he honestly seems like a nice dude irl.
---
I'd say a month would be ideal in order to preemptively address the overwhelming rush at launch. I wouldn't go further than that, though.
---
TOTEMS! TOTEMS! TOTEMS!
---
D&amp;D MMO is pretty fun, not a major time sink like wow but it's simple and nice, can be played with a controller. 
---
I had so much fun pvping as a hunter in classic. Jump shots, feign death combat trapping, track stealth, scatter shot for the deadzone. Giant owls flapping in to distract people. I may not have ever had great gear or topped boards, but particularly in battle grounds I felt like no one had more options when defending a point. If you fancy it there is a lot of scope for fun. 
---
Pretty sure that will not be a thing. Don't recall that ever being a thing in pservers or the majority of classic.
---
The edgyboi persona is just for show you know that right?
---
Lmao imagine being this triggered by a dude and his mum.
---
That would be really cool.
---
N yea, I'm going horde druid... 
---
This is just a more user friendly but also limited way of using the site's standard item searching options. I'm personally disappointed.
---
I agree, I think video games can act as more of a catalyst for other addictions, especially drugs or drinking.  I went several years of my life just playing games and getting messed up on prescriptions, couldn't hold a job etc.  Looking back, yeah it was fun, no it was not worth it lol.
---
Not sure why I’m being downvoted, but thanks all for the thoughtful discussion!
---
Same problem for me, I think I’m leaving towards priest so I can heal, I’ll probably play with my newbie girlfriend so will make it easier to find groups. 
---
I would really like to play a rogue/mage/warlock but I think I need the flexibility of being able to tank or heal. My first 2 level 60s in vanilla were priest and warrior so I’m basically just going to repeat myself. 
---
I think I will regret if I roll a rogue and then struggle to find groups at 60 because it’s such a crowded class, but man it would be fun for that 1v1 pvp tanking goodness. 
---
That was actually my play style, and vanilla WoW was the best MMO for that play style that I ever played.
---
To add to what other people have said, if you want to see the world and aren't in a rush to level then rogues' abilities to stealth and pick locks (of doors and gates as well as chests) are cool.  Also, hunters' ability to tame most of the animals in the game and use them as a pets, provided you keep feeding them food they like, is a fun mini-game.
---
Lower Black Rock Spire is the most atmospheric dungeon I've ever played in.
---
Yeah fuck school we all have to crowd the Sarkoth spawn and wait. Exams exshmams
---
What was your alias? I would probably recognize it, I was pretty into CSS back in the day
---
Potato
---
I plan on playing an alliance character but also want to have a horde character, are you still able to mail and share items with each of your characters or do they have to be in the same faction
---
My guild at the time was the first guild on our server to get the scepter(or whatever it was) to open the AQ gates. It was a big deal and a lot of the server helped and participated. We set up a time and date so that everyone could gather while our hunter class officer opened the gates. 
---
We hearthed. 
---
Went back that night by ourselves and opened it while no one was there.
---
Bro we already cracked this mystery, it's going to be 3rd week in June. I have a work trip that week so it's likely to drop on that Tuesday
---
I feel for you. I probably gained about the same amount. Right now, I'm looking for a laptop stand to put with my exercise bike and only play while riding. 
---
You will be able to find a fri/sat guild don't worry
---
almost gave me a heartattack boi
---
Can confirm, my girlfriend is like this, luckily I have great shoulder armor.
---
Long time ago, I think while vanilla was current maybe, there was a website where people would post their stories about how the game had negatively affected their life. A simple 2000s era site where you could post a block of text and visitors scroll down reading through the different accounts. There was definitely a lot of ruin in those stories. 
---
On that topic, what were the PvP kings back in the day?
---
 I remember being afraid of rogues, but I was shit back in the day and so my perception will be skewed. 
---
Nov 23, 2004 baby
---
This guys got a point. It’s only like 98% of women, don’t be trying to make any blanket statements you misogynist pig.
---
Seeing as the mount will cost around 700g anyways I'm probs just going to get a orc wolf mount for my orc lock
---
Lol! 3. Is the best.
---
yes
---
My absolute favorite quote from when i was playing nostalrius launch:
---
"Why aren't there any mother fucking cactus apples on these cactuses" 
---
Agreed
---
&gt; I just want to kill Alliance. ;)
---
+1
---
only during mind control if at all.
---
I see it
---
&gt; we can safely exclude anything after July, can't we? You know... "Classic summer" and such things.
---
August is a summer month though. :(
---
I had a kill list when Nostralius was up for whoever ganked me "unfairly", like when I'm fighting mobs. Safe to say, I never got to take revenge on any of them :(
---
Low pop server would make it even easier to lock down devilsaurs. 1 hardcore guild with a group of 5-10 decent players will control it easily.
---
Just flow chart it man. That way you only have to decide between a max of (3) classes.
---
1. Horde or Alliance? 
---
* Removes Paladin or Shaman obviously
---
2. Do you want focus on **serious** raiding? (Ie. No *weird* specs)
---
* Leaves you with 9ish viable options 
---
3. Do you want to tank, heal, or DPS?
---
* Brings your options down to 1, 3, and 5
---
4. If DPS, do you prefer ranged or melee?
---
* Down to 3 or 2.
---
5. Do you have a favorite race?
---
* Could bring it down further
---
Sounds great. 
---
1.) Hunter can feign death to pass the aggro to people trying to steal the ore nodes the hunter was trying to clear the MoBs for
---
2.) Hunter can potentially feign death and then use Goblin Jumper Cables to revive the healer, thus salvaging a wipe
---
I like this.
---
I read it all. I liked it. 
---
15/21 is 15 divided by 21 though...
---
Yes, and midsummer is June 21st. Midsummer is in the middle of summer is what I'm saying.
---
I do like RBGs quite a bit. The first couple clears of a new raid. Hard to get a guild that's cool with me showing up two weeks every 6 months though.
---
You're swinging one extreme to the other.  5-10 players can't lock down every devilsaur 24-7
---
At 20 i walk around heavy alliance zone as a undead priest, with my buddy whose a 30 rogue invis. Fun times. The look when they think they have an easy kill. Priceless. 
---
Good job spreading fear about sharding for no reason 
---
They might make larger servers since tech is better now to handle it but who knows. 
---
I can reliably assume that everyone I interact with will have English as a first or second language. 
---
They have to be the same faction (circa 2006). The only way to transfer items was the neutral AH, but even then, you needed another account to buy it for you (you werent allowed to buy your own items off the AH, it was account wide, I tried it myself back then)
---
When an alliance tags a mob that isn’t a quest mob, it still faction tags it.  Sorry I didn’t specify, but that is what I was referring to.
---
haha, me and my brother had those too!
---
You are missing the point of no changes. If you want to see the memorial go and check it out on retail.
