oh yeah def. its very satisfying to fill so many roles. right now im going the heart of the wild &amp; natures swiftness build. lets me tank just about anything and also heal if need be. druids are the true hybrid class

I remember in WOTLK, while loot was being handed out, I would begin casting portals, and I would put all of them in one spot, and they way the fluctuated, it would be a random hit when you clicked.
---
crime of the century.

innocent mooncloth accident or the revenge killing committed on a whistleblower exposing the degenerate underground sex and gambling ring in Storwind and Ironforge, ran by the Goblin Cartels?
---
That's a naive way of seeing things. There's a shitton of people who lack principles in the world, and who will fuck you over if they can. It's not just that, but also that even someone nice will possibly fuck you over even if they don't want to. What if the dude you just funneled gear into decides to leave to join friends in another guild ?
---
Don't take me wrong, there are no guarantees, ever. But there are more guarantees that someone who's been with you for months will stay with you rather than a newcomer whose first raid it is.
---
I'm not "treating real person like objects", I'm treating real persons like mature adults who can take a hit or two for the sake of the guild. *That* is what a raiding guild needs, not kids who will start drama as soon as you take their candy away, but mature individuals who understand that sometimes, they have to sacrifice for the guild, and that eventually, it will pay back.
---
Now for OP's situation, it's his fuckup, I agree completely. If your loot system is just "roll if you need", then the 58 had all the rights to roll on all those items and win them. If there's no fine print that says "maybe if you just won 3 items you aren't allowed to need anymore", then whoever thought of that system fucked up and should've known better. This is why I love loot council and am glad that my guild is using it. Randomness is neither fair nor efficient.
---
If the first timers we invite to our raids either can't understand that "loot prio to deserving raiders" means they will eventually, if they do their job and stick around for more than 2 weeks, become the most deserving and get their items, or can understand this but don't plan on being deserving of items and want to get carried, then seeing them go will be no loss.

I know you cant switch in combat but the trinket second wind is amazing with innervate, make sure to pop it at the same time for uber regen.
---
People who rush the end and ignore all the objectives are basically griefing too.
---
Look, rewards define what winning actually is in an open ended game. The way ur saying it, that just isn't reality. If raids didnt drop loot, most people would only complete a raid once. Thats just reality, rewards are actually an important part of the game, they arent just there by chance. The rewards were LITERALLY intended to be goals, thats why they are there.
---
as a horde player, thanks for this post and guiding all those lost players on alliance and i recommend that "fu to horde" strat which is essentially how horde plays and if alliance play that way then the games will get real.
---
What I did was bound devour magic to Ctrl-Mousewheel Up and Ctrl-Mousewheel Down. Mousewheel up casts on my mouseover target, while mousewheel down casts only on me.

Naturally these drops come not long after I purchased my own pattern for the robes.

Throwback to when I saw the Mooncloth Bag pattern drop in Scholo the day after I purchased that pattern, too.
---
Hell im really not in to art but this looks amazing I like the colours so much.
---
the old system is a more realistic and thematic approach which is why they chose it.
---
Makes sense to have your mount choice be an important one.

Warriors are leaders, laaaawl

The WoW Diary says that because something like a_cute_bunny was at the top of the sprite list the designers used them for everything - invisible rabbits launching off hundreds of in game effects.
---
Gathering professions are always the best default money making professions. Crafting professions only really make money through having rare recipes. For example I've made about 1350g since classic launched through my tailoring profession, 1200g of it has been made through selling felcloth gloves on the ah and charging people to craft them. If I never got that recipe I would have made about 150g off my profession only.
---
Only a warlock or shadow priest can face roll their keyboard as far as I’ve seen anyways
---
There's some argument to be made about obstacles and direct routes, but mostly it's just fun.
---
For Alliance this is just false and will never be true without changes. There are these things called premades. They win almost every game in around 10 minutes if they are good. The rest of the games are getting slower, those just wont.
---
As far as BWL, people know the difficulty of the raid if things are continued without retuning. thats the things about re-released content, people already know it will be a joke if it isnt retuned, you dont need to wait and see, private servers already have.
---
well he takes his time even getting to what the problem is lol

Lol dude I play a lot, I have 5/8 tier 1, t2 helm, rank 6, it’s not like I don’t play. My post is about huge queue times and how they aren’t necessary. It’s not to bitch, it’s to gain traction so we get some sort of hot fix like same faction BG’s. I have never played retail and stopped almost immediately when WOTL was released. I have no idea why you are so hostile.
---
As a fury warrior, how much should I value additional hit after hitting the cap for yellow attacks?
---
Haha I knew this was coming!
---
What’s on Christmas?
---
i made a key for portals and mod for shift/alt so its one slot for teleport and one slot for portals :D
---
Can you teach me about the stock market. I’d like to own a house.
---
My understanding is it's 'spending mana'. For instance, casting a spell that costs no mana' (such as priest clearsasting) does not reset the 5 second rule
---
Shit, he's too busy to even finish this post, I'd tap out too.
---
Oh yeah you’re right I’m sorry I ready it wrong OP
---
Can’t this be done cross faction? It’s not like the inability to talk in game is hindering anyone from colluding over discord right now. Someone else mentioned this, please explain how it’s difference from the current situation.

Sinisterly Satanic!

Stabby Stabby stealy stealy.

Warrior, level as prot.
---
If you want more details, you might wanna provide some first yourself.
---
OK boomer
---
Herod is extremely horde dominant, while Faerlina is balanced. However Faerlina tends to attract streamer orbiters (mostly on Alliance), but still many horde, so keep that in mind.
---
Not when you activate it 100ft in the air lol.
---
You gotta time the blink
---
I do for sure, but I really miss coordinating with my PvP squad in WSG. Those 3v4 situations, I miss them.
---
where is my boy ahab at. beautiful drawing as always, though!
---
What mouse do you have? Wireless mice are even used by some pro e-sports players these days so that statement is kinda ridiculous.
---
If your warriors aren’t leaders, your raid is handicapped.
---
That's before all the traffic starts!
---
not the best person to ask because I don't have experience soloing extensively with a shield after 30ish. What I did was still use axe mastery (for 2H axes) while always being on the lookout for the best/fastest 1h axe I could find for my level. You won't match in dps, but you'll still keep the 5% crit bonus with your tanking gear. This allows for better rage generation and damage while using 1h+shield. I believe 5 pts are better spent here than imp battle shout. If you stick w/ axes, axe spec is as good as Cruelty.
---
The few times I do solo w/ this setup, I am for sure not in defensive stance. I stick w/ battle or berserker stance. So points in imp revenge and shield block would be wasted. If I were to take a guess and compare efficiencies, maybe I take half the damage per mob but kill 1.5-2x slower than w/ the 2H. But my 1h is currently a higher level than my 2H so it might be break-even at best, if they were equal. I also have zero points in prot , so that is also a factor (shield spec would help w/ efficiency). I run more or less with a standard arms spec w/ the rest in fury.
---
He is asking if there is any speculation about changing it to the system where you don’t have to do that.
---
[removed]
---
Of course they want, unlike retail where they can make a lot of money off expension sales and in game shop from whales, to make money with classic the players have to stay because sub is their only income.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
They just underestimated the success of classic so they put minimal efforts tog et everything and every detail right but for sure they want the players to enjoy it.
---
They only planned to have 3 phases at first and they moved to have 10 so they're making a lot of effort those phase 1.5 and 2.5 weren't planned
---

"***By level 60*** I will have gone back to the Prot tree to get 3/3 Imp Revenge" - this is half-hearted. If you know you're going to do something less than optimal, at least you should get the stuff that makes what you're doing fun. Improved Revenge is amazing (45% chance for a nice stun) and will make your whole experience a little more fun, if you're committed to this shield thing. Also, the dps talents in prot are in the last 6 points, so it might make sense to go for 31 prot first.

Report the scammers, sure. Reporting people for betting 5g on a dice roll?...Why?

That's not hard to get. My warlock is level 53 with 265sp from gear and i still got more to put on as i ding 55. All the Av gear and omnicast boots.

Am i really already geared enough to farm when i ding 60?

RP really does make the world a better place. Even the world of warcraft.

ur gunna be exalted for ever so if you decide you want therazines as well you can pick it up later on, personally i only got tomb of the icelord to replace aquementas in pve as i use fire ruined grimore in pvp for all the int and stam
---
It's been answered above. Someone said TradeLog
---
Note: For all of the following damage and DPR calculations, we will assume P(Crit)=0.3, P(Dodge)=0.6 and 305 weapon skill.

I guess you mean P(Dodge)=0.06?
---
What does this macro do? Why does stopattack make slam better?
---
Its hilarious how ally can only win 1 in 10 games now that horde stopped letting them win 😂
---
Don't you worry about [Exciting World PvP], let me worry about [Blank].
---
What does this do exactly?
---
That’s not really the same thing as what he’s saying
---
Is it still worth taking alchemy on my lvl35 alt purely for selling arcanite transmute cd? Or have the demand for arcanite bars significantly decreased/will decrease from now on?
---
He has the axe which sells for over 4g. But I agree the average is meh.
---
Agreed. Like, stop and smell the bodies every now and then.
---
As a mage 100% do +8 dmg
---
I've tried that but it didnt work, the file still gets overwritten
---
I lived in a house with a few friends and it was a constant LAN party. A buddy was in SSC about to pull Hydros, but went AFK to use the bathroom. We fucked with his keybinds for WASD to be reversed and then rebound ESC to autorun.
---
When he tried to move around he noticed the keys were fucked and tried to open the menu to fix it. That's when he autoran into the boss and pulled. The guild wasn't very happy with him, but they were all laughing when they heard what had happen.
---
interestingly enough, sappers are getting cheaper since they aren't used as much anymore, everyone sitting in cities for PvP instead out outerworld mass scale. Most people already got their MC/Ony parses so no need to pad your numbers with sappers.
---
Your answer is like someone asking why planes fly and you say because they're filled with helium, sure it works but the comment was asking for evidence, not an unsourced explanation. Items could also be tied to a DB and as the DB gets updated, the outcome of disenchanting the item is updated alongside the DB, creating a situation where the property is drawn from when the action occurred and not the creation of the loot.
---
Best trick i know is to be kind and respectful to people you don't know and you will quickly find yourself surrounded by friends.
---
This is a poor analogy.
---
DM E lasher runs for me.  With 15-20 min queues I can get 3-5 packs down before match start
---
This is for all the people complaining that WSG is not meta. With this one weird trick, you too can fight mid and ignore objectives, just like you would in warsong gulch. The rest of the teams hate him!
---
what are "1.12 stats" ? stats didn't change
---
For itemization they didn't add any items that wasn't at launch, they could have just put everything inro the game it could be much more. What we got was pretty much 1.4 patch for itemization because that's when most changes were done, not 1.12. (reminder ragnaros world first was 1.4)
---
My favorite zone :)
---
Dam son he charged 1g for only 2 stacks shiet i atleast fill the trade window up for 1g that mage is a tight ass
---
Fuck paladins. Broken ass class.
---
Let me get this right...if we don't let you win, you're taking your ball and going home?

mara is easy enough to go in with 0 spellpower. The goal here is to get around 325+ so you can add rotgrip to the other 2 bosses.

spam that macro while you run around, not hard

We once had our friend's GF fly him to Kargath (With his Hearthstone and all his gear in the bank) Then took all his money so he couldn't fly anywhere. He was not happy when he came back from getting take-out.

As a shammy u can farsight around corners and blind spots by far sighting from a spot you alteady farsighted. Nice for wpvp recon

Are you talking about the cooking recipe vendor in the upstairs of that Old SW bar?
---
3400? Oof. Ill stop complaining. Ty blizz overlords.
---
At least with mages you arent usually the only one in raid. Resto druid is the only one that ever talents into MoTW so I can't split groups with another one usually.
---
Probably just your server, or time of day.  My server is slow until about 4pm or so and then org is booming until midnight or so.

---
For ZF, literally pull the whole thing except the boss at once.
---
Kill both pats.
---
Mount in circles along the perimeter, run onto the altar (I have epic mount so the low time near altar allows me to not die there).. let mobs pull mobs, but you gotta run through them on the altar.
---
Keep running in circles until they're nice and stacked.
---
NEVER, I repeat NEVER run towards the mobs to frost nova. Run as much away from them as you can while still maintaining they're the right distance away. Leeway will murder you.
---
Always have gems made.
---
If one resists it's okay. Ice Barrier and tank it. You'll almost get 2 blizzards off still. CoC nova it back into the pack. If more resist reset.
---
If for some reason you're running low (didn't make gems, unlucky hits on tanked zombie, didn't get max range for blizz), nova and get 1 or 2 ticks from evocation and blizzard some more.
---
To get max range I like measuring distance in jumps. I jump four times and run a little. Run then jump on the last one so you can easily aim your blizzard in the air during your jump. You don't wanna be running or you've gotta whip it good.
---
There are some pats you can pull with them all (just not the ranger). Also the timing of the pat can allow you to skip killing one. Just depends.
---
Have a friend reset you and drink and eat while you log.. saves a solid 20 seconds a run.
---
That's about all I can think of atm..
---
I play on Herod so the vast majority of names are using special characters. We just right click them in chat and go on with our day. The ones in guild make a note for themselves with the alt code for their special character if they care.
---
Otherwise, barely an inconvenience at all.
---
Fair I guess, but I just customize it to show buffs my class can cast so that's all I really need.
---
Our Christmas guild celebration was gimped by this. We wanted to give away several real life rewards that were wrapped. We were going to use the plain letters as the placeholder for the real thing.
---
Just find a YouTube series that you like and if you think they class they are playing is cool do that
---
Lol, “shaman - I can’t think of anything, just put all types”
---
I said it's not a meme spec for pvp tho. In pve its just as bad as any other meme spec. In pvp you have great offheals and burst.
---
A boomkin is a meme spec. It can't pve or pvp very well. Elemental is a meme spec. It pvps very well and is horrible in pve.
---
Fury warrior is fantastic in both pvp and pve, hence not a meme spec.
---
You understand now? Obviously ele is amazing in pvp, but no one in their right mind would take an ele dps to a raid over a warr / rogue / mage / lock.
---
So far this year I've tested
---
* Logitech G502 Lightspeed  
---
* Logitech G903  
---
* Logitech G Pro
---
* Corsair Harpoon  
---
* SteelSeries Rival 650

* Razer Basilisk Ultimate
---
I've used each for approx. 2 months each, 6-12 hours almost every day.
---
Thing is with wireless mice is that you can't just use them for 50-100 hours and conclude that they're always going to work fine because it can take a while before flaws show themselves when it comes to these models.
---
If you depend on comparable performance to wired mice, wireless just isn't there yet.
---
Focus is wayyyy cheaper and better for casters
---
You can gimp a dps, or take an already gimped dps that also competes for the same gear as warriors.
---
Focus seems like the go to. Thanks for the replies!
---
Honestly with the GUID thing, most melee should just stay in. As long as the tank knows to taunt and dump their pooled threat after Wrath, rag will die pretty fast.
---
I don't understand, both raids and dungeons drop static loot, are you talking about crafted gear? cause thats about the only thing thats not static stats.
---
I would love to use Linux, sadly most of what I do is game. Although doesn’t a ton of development happen using Linux anyway?
---
FYI, SGC is 2% crit plus like 25 agility so it's more like 2.75 crit
---
Yeah, they'll end up with other memespecs and underperformers stuck on bwl.
---
Tauren. This is a really good question, OP, since there are multiple factors to consider. The first thing is the 'ready' stance or how your character stands when you right click someone and without a doubt Tauren is #1, they hold their 2H upright and look intimidating due to their size. Human male does so as well but their size isnt as big. Orc is also great.  
---
  
---
After that you have to consider when you use an ability and once again, both tauren and human have an awesome animation as they both hop then swing the huge weapon downward. Orc again is third, gnome gets special mention as they do a jumping spin attack.  
---
So id rank them Tauren &gt;= Orc &gt; UD &gt; Troll. Human &gt; Gnome &gt; NE &gt; Dwarf.
---
We have 3 just in my guild that does 1 MC per week. Still haven't seen the force reactive disk tho
---
Special characters are obnoxious and tolerated is a good word.  People have trouble whispering you and they can’t target you easily.  
---
That said, most chat options let you click on a name to invite them or it auto fills the name. 
---
Best option is Romaní.
---
This sounds pretty cool... Does anyone else do this, running herb-mining and just tapping key as they run around?
---
Like I said my role as healer is to heal. I've never told my party or any members that I would not heal them because my responsibility is to ensure their survival. I'm sorry you've had such shit experiences.
---
Did you pick Romani because of the Wanderer meaning of the word? if so there are other names that have that meaning, but yeah, just pick a different name if all the alt forms are taken
---
I feel lost on swing timers for swing timers for wow classic.   (I main a fury warrior) Can anyone advise on what to read on them?
---
Its PvPvE
---
Oh yeah, that's not poaching at all IMO. If they're not raiding yet you're only helping by offering a spot. Poaching is stealing active raiders. Good on you!
---
It doesn't affect each other though.
---
For mages, you can swap weapons when you cast evocate even in combat 
---
Swapping to the ZG panther boss staff with a spirit enchant on it add about an extra 1200 mana or so 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=19909
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=19448
---
imagine this below is your swingtimer:
---
[----------------------------[slam cast 1s]-]
---
because of spell batching, if you align your slam with your swingtimer, you dont reset your regular swingtimer and the white hit comes out immediately after the slam. so you can basically autoattack twice per swingtimer with slam. keep in mind slam is shit when youre hit (spelldelay) and when you have to move a fuckton.
---
unfortunately it still fails on black lotus occasionally.
---
i still remember the day 2 ally were just sitting at bl spawn and watched me pick the herb twice and fail twice and then an herbalist showed up and i got the 3v1 beatdown as i was about 70% through my 3rd try.
---
a horrible day indeed.
---
Nah man. It makes a big difference. Every little thing matters.
---
Neither
---
Demand for arcanite bars will potentially increase come the release of phase 3, as that is when you can get the remaining mats for thunderfury, that being said, some may have stockpiled bars for phase 3, and prices will actually fall as a result.
---
We had one like that until someone started posting racist comments anonymously. Always gotta ruin a good thing.
---
This. For me, *it looks* like the pickpocketing "fails" since the pocket window opens for like 0.2 sec but you can get what was in it by looting the corpse a second time.
---
We get hit in the head a lot.
---
Glimmering Mithril Insignia is pretty rad though. But if only in it for the cash, then go herbing. Pick up gathermate or a similar add on so you can record all herb and vein locations and just alternate tracker as you move to whats closest.
---
nice
---
I've read that greater fire protection potions will still be used for BWL. Also depending on your guild, you may be required to use your respective flask for progression.
---
I agree on my paladin : Hates to lose :
---
They could just turn group loot on for greens  and up
---
Haha you wouldn’t if I was just allowed to cast my shield on you, but noooo you need rage...
---
Oh i didnt mean the actual name is Romani, i meant Romani-like. Gypsy-like.
---
Its funny given the amount of mechanics in vanilla compared to even a normal mode raid in retail.
---
Blessing of Sacrifice in any sort of group pvp situation can nullify Seduction/Blind/Sap/Poly/Frost Trap/Scatter. 
---
BoP and bubble immune fall damage.
---
Due to spell batching, if you use Divine Favor quickly enough after finishing a heal, it will proc and consume the DF buff for that heal - instead of the intended usage for your next heal. You can game this the other way too, by using Divine Favor, casting a heal, and spamming your Shock to go off right as the hard cast heal finishes both will crit. Can use DF for a free HL, or a chonkier FoL, followed with a DS to yourself or another target or for some quick burst double crit heals on someone being focused or to something hitting you that isn't getting peeled.
---
Well on Windows I hit play and everything works fine.

Linux is like that dude who gets jacked, but stays at home every weekend instead of going out and meeting girls.

Source? Patch notes only say:

&gt; The riding skill has been changed. A riding skill of 75 is now needed to ride level 40 mounts and a skill of 150 for level 60 mounts. Those that already have mounts will automatically be granted the appropriate level skill.
---
*worst fixed it for you
---
That's were Chribba comes into play
---
Just right click and invite the person
---
Allows you to go directly out of shapeshift forms into caster form. Otherwise you have to manually shift out before casting.

Zone in and run right.    
---
Mind Soothe all Ogres.   
---
Kill 3x Bug packs and the Warpwood pod.       
---
Go to your rock/mound and SWP all dogs right next to the rock. Jumping up onto the upper area where the bugs were to reset their pathing. Basically you want to run them both ways in very quick succession and then jump to get them to run the other way. **You shouldn’t aggro the Boss in this step, if so you’re letting the dogs run too far**. Repeat until dogs are dead.
---
Run to the ramp and pull the Boss, then retreat to the same spot and wait for the boss to come back to where those dogs were getting kited back and forth, then do the same with the boss. You don’t want to run him up and down the ramp as there’s a patrol there eventually.
---
someone is selling pots lol
---
I love your art so much
---
F
---
Bro, he’s saying forget about grinding honor.  It’s not going to happen.  Just forget about it and have fun with the game elsewhere.
---
You can’t just choose to un-learn the efficiency you’ve been taught between old WoW and Classic. You can try to ignore it, but it never goes away.
---
Awe is someone made now? Go cry somewhere else lol. I'm so sick  of the whining ever since  classic came out from little bitches like yourself. Shutup play the damn game, and enjoy it. If you cant enjoy it dont fucking play it plain and simple. Dpnt expect blizzard to change to a dumb ass mechanic like same faction pvp just because of faction poor faction balance on your server.

This is vile
---
Great job Drem, glad I sold ya the trinket that helped make this possible
---
Home, home in Muglore, where the kodo and plainstriders play
---
Where never is heard, any more kolkar words
---
And the Earthmother shows us the way
---
Have N64. Can confirm. Freezeezy peak
---
Where are the great lifts?!
---
Your level 40 plus specs must have a level 40 talent choice as a warrior. Ms/bt/ss are instant attacks that provide more damage than any other talent choice you make.  There are lots of interesting builds for 40 to 60 you can use, but all of them take a 31 point talent.  If you want to level with a shield I would probably take bloodthirst or shield slam, as neither are weapon damage dependent.
---
People knock on RP a lot but I dont think they give it enough credit. Sure, theres the oddball, weird RP that everyone jokes about regarding servers like Moongaurd, but if you get involved with the right guild and really throw yourself into it, it's some of the most fun you could have in the game. Back in WoTLK the top RP guilds on my server would fight for territory and every weekend we would host guild wars to decide which guild would own that specific area. It gave an entirely new twist to PvP.
---
You're the man!
---
NOT playing WoW.
---
Oh that might be something I should try then. Right now the flame for classic has gone down a bit as im having trouble leveling. Like I end up with 2 zones with superhard quests that I bruteforce, meanwhile people are like 10 levels higher than me.
---
Every time I bubble hearth I feel like I had a spectacular victory.
---
Slap on +4 stats aswell, for 19 agility.

No, now you continue your journey!
---
Special characters are a pain. If you must do it out it at the end of the name because you cannot /who easily. Two people with special characters create an absolute pain in the arse when neither can find or whisper the other.
---
Would love to see what you could do with the opposites of this.. Maybe Icecrown or Firelands...
---
Looks amazing!
---
Thank you, it’s beautiful &lt;3
---
I'm a mage, is this strategy still possible?
---
What do you make with alchemy to make money?
---
It's the payoff for having better racials.
---
Spell damage is massively more important than int for PvE, absolutely go with focus.
---
Doesnt look like it
---
The way I heard it put, the tank and healer are the mommy and daddy trying to herd a bunch of rambunctious children.
---
What server are you on and how’s your raid progress?
---
🤢
---
hi its yah boy Cóld lolololol
---
5 set bonus is deece
---
Litteraly everyone was bitching about NO CHANGES for years that's not blizzard's fault
---
Also classic is not intended to be the best game, it's intended to be a museum to replay an old version of the game.
---
If people want changes and make the game better then ask for classic+
---
Not when a party member tells you to invite their accented friend
---
*hey dude inv Łégóláš, we could use a hunter*
---
I was while leveling my warrior with a ton of alt gold. Play 2-handed majority of the time but single target is better with 2 swords.
---
not to mention my 10 man premade was sitting in Que for an hour.
---
You’re my favorite kind of priest
---
How so? If both factions would rush &amp; horde uses backdoor. Alliance would still win &amp; backdoor has always been an option, so it's nothing new.
---
Alliance is just pissed because Horde doesn't roll over &amp; they no longer get their instant gratification.
---
Backdooring doesn't win you the game. Wiping/slowing them at Galv does.
---
Can’t lose time on world buffs if you no longer have world buffs *taps head*
---
So one benefit of leveling with a shield, at least until pummel, is you can actually interrupt casters without having to do weapon swap macros that can feel clumsy.
---
AV gear helps a ton obviously but like others said, need more hp (and still a little bit more sp) to survive. Also I would argue against doing rotgrip, but I havent *really* done the math on it. The reason id say skip rotgrip is due to how much extra time it takes.  
---
If you do mara with herb+mining and kill princess/goblin, you should be around 13-15 mins a run. Doing rotgrip would add around 3 minutes and the axe has the lowest chance to drop and its the big money, but after time that extra 2-3 mins adds up to being an entire extra run.  
---
Up to you if its worth, or maybe someone else can chime in who's done mara for at least 20+ hours and if they say its worth it. I just think that by the time you have the sp necessary for rotgrip, you might as well do DME which is vastly superior to Mara.
---
I mostly did it during BG queues, before xrealms, they were often a lot longer. BG queues are getting a bit longer, so it might pick up a bit, but i cant imagine theyll get very long with xlrealms.
---
Theres also the "people use to play for fun" factor since dueling doesnt have any tangible rewards.
---
Lastly, nore knowledge and experience i suppose. I used to play Paladin and loved beating people in duels, but is there really a point if i know i massively overgear my opponent, or i fight against a Priest and the only way i can win is if my opponent is absolutely trash? Not really, hard to find even matchups.
---
Based on your comments you seem to have something against warriors. 
---
Least they don't wear a dress.
---
Let me rephrase. Is the game better with AV giving the most Honor per hour by a considerable margin? Or does that make the game worse? I'm not asking if you can pretend the honor system doesn't exist to have more fun. I'm asking if the current rewards are structured in a way that make the game better or worse.
---
Anathema is dead. I made a toon there to check it out. If you come to Whitemane there’s tons of people all day. Hell even at 3am. And I haven’t had a queue in weeks. Also world PvP has died down so it’s much better now.
---
Please don’t tell people this. Why would you tell people this? To discourage people from playing the game? Hey OP, this isn’t true, the world is a sandbox, very different from retail. Do literally whatever you want.
---
&gt; I rarely see ranged players
---
Given how low priority ranged seems to be for both heals and fear ward, I'm definitely going to try this out next Onyxia. The fear is by far the most annoying part of the fight if you get chain feared and can't really do anything about it.
---
There aren’t enough talent points to get both dark pact and ruin, and ruin is pretty much a requirement for a viable raiding spec, so that eliminates dark pact as a possibility right there.
---
Awesome! And love that you included Mazzaranche in this. Best pink chicken ever. 😋
---
jesus christ this is amazing holy shit
---
You have good intentions, but have trouble expressing them in a way where you don't sound like a dick.
---
You mention using Ironfoe, and also fury tanking, so I have to question which faction you are. 
---
If you're Alliance, you don't need to fury tank (or roll on BRE outside of PvP purposes). If you're Horde, you shouldn't be using Ironfoe (proc rate isn't what it was on pservers).
---
If you're Alliance, hopefully you're Human, so you can use Vis'kag+Brut Blade as dps. Otherwise you'll need Edgemaster's. If you need to tank, just go mitigation gear since you guys have Salv and no WF. Threat usually isn't an issue.
---
If you're Horde, get some Edgemaster's and gear like an Orc. Get Deathbringer/Flurry Axe. If you can't get that, get Frostbite/AotDW. If AotDW is too pricey, use BSH in your OH.
---
Doordash
---
I switched skinning to engi at around 35 when i first enteted stv. Had a lot mined up and i leveled to 175 for nades in one sitting. Iron grenades were sooo good when everyone was low level and the actual damage component of the grenade was relevant.
---
Something between 10 and 15 as human.
---
Kay now I want to make a RP character.
---
Why didnt I do so to begin with?
---
I right... friends i dont play with wanted me to roll pvp on stalagg...
---
Fuck
---
Wow!  Arguably my favorite zone and you've made it... so much more than it is!
---
Not into art, ain’t that something
---
Wow give me some psych analysis you fucking pseudoscientist. Thanks!
---
Priests don’t have to wear dresses btw.
---
Probably didnt stop u from down-voting lol
---
They just did a recreation of the final(1.12) version of the game, and they did it very well  I don't see how it is bad, you just don't like it.
---
You’re my favorite kind of warrior bby
---
Ok...yeah this is for the days we’re playing.
---
Evil, haha
---
Damn cheap ass mage make it 1 gold per stack !
---
Go heals now, spam gorshak. You'll be 60 in two days
---
Accurate.
---
Yea less than an hour will you there too.
---
I went pack at 40 then filled out furor doesn't matter much after that. I respec resto for dungeons around 54.
---
I never fight with my healer as a tank, but playing dps on my alt shows me that healers and tanks are like a dysfunctional marriage, but they both still yell at you together.
---
This one time at Bandcamp...
---
Warlock and paladin just happens to be my two favourite classes.
---
Exactly what I did, I thought it was some meme post about how Plain Letter is the most broken item in the game or some wack
---
why? you don’t pay for any of those things?
---
how so?
---
Don the shield
---
care to elaborate on why?
---
&gt; Although you can right click and invite someone to a group or whisper, you cannot right click and /ginvite or add as friend - right?
---
You can type /ginvite and then shift click their name and it'll add it to chat.
---
gtfo... fr? all this farming i been doing for gear is useless when i could have greens.......
---
In the snow!
---
Wow, you’re stubborn. Enjoy being dead wrong.
---
This person tries to make people aware of an exploit being used by less than 1% of the player base but is negatively affecting everyone and just gets trolled about writing que. Reddit is such a fuckin cest pool sometimes
---
Enemies cant see custom emote text, just FYI.
---
Yeah I've ran ony with multiple guilds and pugs and usually only a couple other players realize that this makes p3 so much easier for everyone. Just watch out that your not so far north that you take breath damage, as it makes it a bit easier
---
Amazing! That is also where I started my fishing journey. Chilled there for an hour.
---
Consider not turtling every single AV, you may find that queues go down!
---
Joke is on you, my friend.
---
I've never even bought the TP to Darnassus.
---
Its been my experience.
---
Ikr I’ve always been competitive in my life and took forever to learn how to lose without being butthurt. I play lock and pally lol
---
Let's be real, is a mage's iceblock ever *not* up?
---
In several days /played, I have never seen windfury proc off hoj or hoj proc off windfury. They can both proc off the same basic attack, but all extra attacks (except sword spec) cannot proc any other extra attack.
---
Just tank for a weekly pug until they ask you to tank it full time. We had a weekly pug going the first couple weeks of classic that turned into a guild.  Just go for it.
---
I still play a lot of EQ1 on Emu servers and I tell you what, WoW graphics look amazing by comparison.
---
Man if only those starting zones didn't feel so dead. I'm not sure what it is, maybe that everyone is rushing to leave, it being the starting area and all.
---
You generally don't stand on these because if Onyxia targets you while on the raised section she evades and regains health.
---
So I've seen the ice lord summoned many times. But only the tree lord once.
---
Any alliance here tell me why you guys never go for him in those turtle games?
---
Level fury until 40, then respec to mortal strike and put the rest of the points back into fury until 60.
---
Tanking is more difficult until you get the stance-swapping rage retention talents, but you will be fine.
---
Securing your safety and denying a horde player some honor all the while spamming “you lose” is 100% a victory in my eyes
---
I appreciate the explanation! I’ve heard about things taking up buff/debuff slots before but didn’t know the buff cap is 32. that’s a shitload of buffs lol but I won’t worry about that for now
---
Mulgore is bar none the best starting area.
---
Theres a few caves for mining. Herbs everywhere. Sooo many mobs. Quests are meh but the tauren are a lot more fun to read than the orcs with just "kill kill kill" at least the tauren talk about the thrill of hunting etc.
---
And I love the plains that seem to go on forever. Like the barrens but more green and without a giant road down the middle.
---
Mulgore truly feels like the start of an epic MMO to me. Followed closely behind by the dwarf starting area.
---
This reminds me of an old super detailed dinosaurs popup book I had growing up. Magic and wonder! Seriously. This is beautiful.
---
&gt; So CHT might have good stats, but If it’s a tossup, i rather go with Swords. And i won’t anger the Rogues as much.
---
You will 100% anger rogues more going for swords than daggers lol
---
More like a bunch of spoiled rich brats that were dropped once or twice as babies...
---
It's the final version with content locked. A new player in 2006 would have a very similar experience to classic if you exclude ZG.
---
So what do you expect blizzard to do better ? 
---
\-Have each version of the game for each patch would actually be much worse, it wouldn't be much harder but 100x more broken and imbalanced. 
---
\-have changes and  retune everything ? with the No changes mentality this would have been an absolute disaster and the game would have been a massive failure.
---
Retuning classic might be an option when it's over and people want something fresh and if you leave normal classic servers available. 
---
It was just not doable for the release the community was overwhelmingly against it
---
You have seriously missed what this post us about. It's about classes being suited to playstyles. Raid leader is a social role. You've completely missed the point. Of course raid leaders are leaders ?
---
i am more geared for healing on my server than prob 90% Of other healers.. and i am a tank.
---
 exorsus raid tools doesnt show small fire prot pots as consumables so they are still fked
---
This is “working as intended” it happened to me too, super funny stuff.
---
Paladin: For people who hate to lose
---
As a Paladin main, this couldn’t be further from the truth
---
This no longer works unfortunately
---
1k ice barriers with just pre-raid gear, done right that can be 3k in 30 seconds.
---
Bubble hearth is the ultimate victory.
---
I’d argue the descriptor for rogue player personalities is more apt for warriors.
---
I didn’t miss the point at all, you just missed my point and your reading comprehension is bad.
---
Warrior players aren’t automatic leaders.
---
Try the deviantart link
---
Private Servers are not accurate for any kind of testing at all. Ever. Period.
---
we had it last week and me and the other druid on our team both of us tanks.. just rolled for it lol. we both have full druid sets basically lol
---
Yeah it is. They choose where to go. The party follows
---
 Other members don't generally start fights with mobs if they don't want to die. As such, tanks as shotcallers/leaders, unless someone else steps up and verbally directs the group.
---
this is how it should look ingame..
---
Nobody:
---
nobody at all :
---
Classic reddit: JuSt TaNk OmG HoW DaRe YoU TrY HaViNg FuN

fucking same
---
/smile
---
/wave as I initially said
---
Leadership is literally in their description still:
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/classes
---
You are not right.
---
4 Rogues already have brutality blade, and i don’t intend on chasing the first Vis’kag either :)
---
So that might obviously be situational, but in our guild, not so much (we’ve had 0 CHT, 1 Perdition).
---
Combat rogue in PvE with Sword is the shit, but no one wants to play it in PvP, so they keep drooling over the daggers.
---
I can’t say If Sword or Dagger rogue is better or worse than the other in PvP, all i know is that Sword is supposedly very boring in PvP for Rogues.
---
It’s literally talking about player personalities, not characteristics of your de facto role in game. I’ve never had a warrior tank actually lead a dungeon run, and being a meat shield isn’t a leader role. It’s a brainless role.
---
Stop stroking tank egos, they’re not de facto leaders.
---
*cries in Taurache*
---
Then understand why other warriors dont want you in their group.
---
Warlocks can use Rank 1 Curse of Recklessness to thwart runners in dungeons
---
Now you raid log for 3 hours every week
---
I also played horde on azuresong, it’s a dead server for horde. Switched to a high pop server, the game feels so much better with so many more people
---
Rogue class:
---
1. You can use your vanish to immune anything. For projectile type spells (all kinds of bolts, death coil, pyroblast etc.) as soon as the animation goes off, pop vanish and you will receive no damage. For the other spells, you have to predict when you're gonna get hit and react with vanish. Stuns, fears, literally anything, and this is a key mechanic in PvP. Can even vanish falling dmg.
---
2. Pre kick- Often in PvP when you fight a caster they will constantly move and only stop to cast a  non instant spell. Therefore you can use their movement as a reference point to react with a kick and interrupt their casting so fast, that they don't get to fakecast. Also don't be afraid to pool some energy if you expect a cast and be ready. Really powerful move against healers like druids, priests, paladins.
---
3. Distract in pvp- few ppl know how much fun this spell actually is in some circumstances. Until now I made about 20 mages blink the wrong direction, often making them blink straight into me. In brm you can make ppl fall off the chain by distracting on the side. Distract also stops jumping velocity, so you can catch players jumping into lava for MC/brd and make them fall on the rocky part. In AV you can distract ppl off the alliance base bridge and can defend the base like that with a handful of rogues and no actual combat.
---
Gonna lose? Bubblehearth.
---
Gonna wipe? Bubblehearth.
---
Can't lose if you run away :D

How to be rich in classic wow as a blacksmith
---
1. Craft Lion heart helms
---
2. Put it on AH for roughly 6x's the mats cost (seriously, its bis till naxx)
---
3. ?????
---
4. Profit
---
It’s lonely up here at the top
---
Those soft ass alliance using a handkerchief to wipe sweat
---
may as well throw that action bar in the centre.. and make it atleast twice as big.. easier to *click* right?
---
Yes all the time lol. Though I'm sure they've run into some pissy healers who don't like drinking to make the dungeon go quicker so thats probably why they're shy.
---
I’m not crying! You’re crying!
---
By that stage hitcapped for sure
---
&gt; Let’s us ponder on this.
---
That's where I stopped reading, geez
---
Blacksmithing prints good money. Inlaid mithril cylinders, moonsteel broadswords, thorium shield spikes, dense sharpening stones, steel weapon chains, elemental sharpening stones.
---
Just to name all the non-epic pieces that make me decent gold. Netting anywhere from 25-50g a day selling those alone. Very little effort to make too. 10-15 minutes a day at most.

Not quite. The aforementioned greens are expensive af. They are often not on the AH or hundreds of gold.

shadowmeld drinking is the hidden pvp racial
---
I'd offer an explanation and apology afterward, and expect my guild to be pissed but understand/get over it. But if family shows up at the door with a surprise birthday, with all the cake and singing and hugs or whatever, I don't think I could politely slip away for 30 seconds to /logout before the game client does it automatically. Like if I'm on my way to the restroom, bladder bursting, when a group of family show up with food and embarrassing singing, etiquette demands I smile, greet, thank, and make small talk with each and every one of them from downwind, as I will have no choice but to piss myself.

Also the extra reason for the mount change was because it was meant to prepare for BC with the addition of new riding skills.
---
Oh sorry, didn't mean to word it like that
---
Cud not be a linux thing. U might be editing the wrong config, theres 2 config files
---
&gt; distance isn’t a determining factor.
---
I've actually found that it is. If I'm MVing a far-away target, and want to MV something even farther, when I break the channel upon starting to cast the next MV, there's a brief loading screen bringing me back to my character, and then it just stays there, on my character, channeling on something the game no longer recognizes.
---
Put the special characters at the end of the name so the auto fill can still pick it up quickly

Reversed on Zandalar Tribe. :c

My friend.. literally third world countries have kids in neighborhoods without electricity or running water playing soccer.

If it’s your first time playing going in blind will give you the best experience for your $ but if you really want to try and put in minimum effort for maximum results there’s a discord for each class YouTube videos and many other helpful guides including Addons to help you with you day

I once had a mage tell me he required 2g minimum and then gave me 2 stacks............
---
Jesus, these are really Nice! If I can get hold in some big as printer I final have something Nice to hang on my dead Wall!

Thank you for your service!
---
Serious truth right here.
---
u right
---
There a lot of parodies about WoW. But they are usually uhh... more mature.
---
But your comment made me thing a World of Peacecraft would be pretty fun to explore.
---
Go around doing non-violent quest, meeting people, traveling long distances, more role playing elements, more focus of crafting and building instead of destroy.
---
Basically a WoW themed Stardew Valley.
---
lol @ shaman as strong melee.
---
Spot on!
---
I play a priest, but this was fabulous.
---
They became an instant attack instead.
---
Allies can by queuing up at the same time. They are in a big discord and then call out their matches. When there is one AV that like 20 people got, they join, the rest will simply requeue until they get it fitting.
---
The tank friend doesn't want to compete with you for loot.
---
It's called imorph and there is a discord for it with lots of guides. It's really easy to use and really fun. No one has been banned in over ten years BUT keep in mind it does break the terms of service, no one can see this morph except yourself.
---
If i were discussing PvP, i’d be quite off by discussing Fury in the first place.
---
Where did i state that i wanted to PvP? Where did you even get that notion?
---
I said most Rogues already have Brutality blade, and thanks to that are chasing daggers because it’s more fun in PvP (for them, apperently).
---
If they wanna respec every now and then to have fun in BG’s, let em.
---
So no, i was not even treading remotely close on the topic of me doing PvP.
---
I mean sure, If i did not have Ironfoe, getting Edgemasters or the Corehound gloves would be optimal, and get daggers for maximal TPS, but i thought the inclusion of mentioning Ironfoe would clear the thought of my desire to get daggers.
---
So yeah, no PvP.
---
Not if you have a 60% mount and you are up vs 109% mounts of alliance.
---
I agree with this, but I’m sure a magician never shares their secrets.
---
If you still play those classes can we really say that you have learnt how to lose?
---
I posted this twice before, so sorry in adv if you read it before. Hope it helps!
---
First question was about putting talent points into Feral Instinct while leveling for threat. The second question was about when to change specs I think.
---
1. Not important at lower levels. Even at 60, you can do without the 15% threat until you start getting geared dps that do 250-300+ dps single target. You can respec into 15% threat once you're closer to 60+ content. I didn't need it until 2-3 weeks of being 60 and grinding out pre-bis gear for the guild, so I don't think you would need it if you're leveling through tanking dungeons with similarly geared partymembers.
---
2. Level to 60 committing to deep feral, then respec once you start maintanking dungeons or entering raids as a MT/OT more than questing. I started this transition around lvl 55 for BRD/Strat/Scholo.
---
Generally, Druid leveling talent progression starts with b-lining to Feline Swiftness for the 30% movespeed for questing QOL. I'd go 5/5 Ferocity &gt; 5/5 Thick Hide &gt; 2/2 Feline Swiftness. The reasons why you'd go Thick Hide for the 10% armor over the 15% threat are 1) you don't need the threat at this stage and until post-60, and 2) you benefit from the 10% armor both while questing and dungeoning. The extra reduction in stealth detection that comes with the 15% threat frankly felt negligible to me. I never felt like I really needed it, whereas the 10% armor is always on and always in effect when you need it, and you always will when you're in combat, questing or dungeoning.
---
From here, there's mainly two options:
---
a. Continue to invest in the Feral Talent Tree and make a b-line for Faerie Fire (Feral), which frankly is both a DPS increase and a QOL in one.
---
To do this, I'd go 3/3 Sharpened Claws &gt; 2/2 Blood Frenzy &gt; 1/1 Feral Charge &gt; 3/3 Predatory Strikes &gt; 1/1 Faerie Fire (Feral)
---
b. Switch over to the Restoration Talent Tree and go 5/5 Furor, maybe throw in 1/1 Feral Charge for the utility as well before or after the 5/5 Furor.
---
I chose to go with option a, and kick the 5/5 Furor can down the road.
---
If you chose option a as well, then you have to ask the same 5/5 Furor question after reaching Faerie Fire (Feral). It becomes another two options scenario:
---
a. Continue through the Feral Talent Tree to make a b-line to Leader of the Pack.
---
To do this, go 2/2 Savage Fury &gt; 2/2 Primal Fury &gt; 5/5 Heart of the Wild &gt; 1/1 Leader of the Pack
---
b. Switch over to the Resto Tree and do the 5/5 Furor first, then go to b-line to Leader of the Pack.
---
I chose to go with option a, again. It was cumbersome not having the 5/5 Furor for the starting energy/rage, but it was something I was able to work into my gameplay style so that I can reap the earlier rewards of the increase damage output from investing in the Feral tree to reach Leader of the Pack.
---
At this point, you can switch over to the Balance Talent Tree to make a b-line for Omen of Clarity:
---
To do this, go 1/1 Nature's Grasp &gt; 4/4 Improved Nature's Grasp &gt; 5/5 Natural Weapons &gt; 1/1 Omen of Clarity
---
By now, your talent tree should look something like this: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/014005001-5000521303222151-05](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/014005001-5000521303222151-05), leaving you 3 points.
---
I chose to invest the 3 points into the Balance Talent Tree's 3/3 Natural Shapeshifter. I think the manacost reduction to shapeshift as a druid tank is invaluable for my playstyle, since I macro shapeshift pots, innervate, holy water throws, after pulls I heal/hot my partymembers (especially life tapping warlocks), etc.
---
At this point, you're pretty much full bear-tank mode with the ability to still dps in cat form. To fully maximize your bear tanking talents, you need to take out the 2/2 in the cat-only talent points from Blood Frenzy, as well as the 2/2 in Feline Swiftness. This means respeccing time to reallocate 4 talent points, with the optional 1 talent point more that I personally pull from Thick Hide.

So, I took 2/2 out of Blood Frenzy, since I don't cat dps, and put it into Feral Instinct to get 2/5. I also took out 2 points from Feline Swiftness as I didn't need the cat movement speed anymore and put it into Feral Instinct to get 4/5. To fill up the remaining 1 point of Feral Instinct for the 15% threat, I did a lot of research/calculating, and ultimately pulled 1 point out of Thick Hide and transferred it over to get 5/5 Feral Instinct.
---
I actually took another 1 point out of Thick Hide and put it in the Restoration Talent Tree's Improved Enrage to get 1/2. I like the extra +5 rage you get when popping Enraged, which I use on CD every fight. The +5 is significant for druid tanks, as you get +10 from Furor, and popping Enrage with +5 gets you to 15 rage, which is the cost of your AOE Taunt/Challenging Roar.

My end build that tanks ALL MC bosses and also solo-tanks Ragnoras is:

Blizzard is making the game. If they make poor choices that is Blizzard's fault. The community isn't making the game, it is not Blizzard's responsibility to make a poor game just cuz the community asked for it. Fortunately this can mostly be fixed. But that requires Blizzard actually putting effort into fixing it.

Not saying your server isnt dead but inwould imagine being 60 would be more active
---
I've been 60 for a while. Still need AV rep, doing wsg is fun as hell in Classic, and there's always something to farm or grind whereas in retail I never had the drive to farm anything but a flask, food and potions.
---
For classic, I'm farming arcane crystals for future nightfalls and thunderfuries, mats for onyxia scale cloaks and enchanting mats for em while at it, there's tons of consumables...
---
Sounds dumb, but I feel there's more to do in classic than retail at cap. I did enjoy m+ quite a bit, but that'd be about the only thing I miss content wise. The rest is mostly obsolete, unrewarding or fluff.
---
Sulfurus. This is the way.
---
FFS people. They’re ***free*** and don’t share a CD with health pots. Use the fucking things. Use them when you think you might be in danger of potentially being in a position where you could possibly dip below 50% health.
---
Hunter: 
---
Feign Death + food doesn't restore health in combat, since it buffs your regeneration and you usually can't regenerate in combat... Unless it's percentage-based food, like christmas fruitcakes or conjured harvest bread. Then it absolutely works. Useful on a very few specific boss fights which have short downtime phases, or if you take a few hits during the boss of solo tribute runs.
---
Melee and ranged attacks operate on separate swing timers. If you're fighting two targets, you can melee one and shoot the other. Useful on most bosses with adds, or on the non-elite blue dragonling packs in Winterspring (some whelps are ranged, others are melee, it's an easy place to practice). Melee weaving like this on a single target isn't too great yet, but it's expected to become better in BWL when we get slower weapons.
---
Lei of Lillies is basically a free Night Dragon's Breath every hour, but stronger. And you don't have to go to Felwood to get it. Just don't forget to swap back to your main necklace afterwards.

You can use a mouseover macro with Scatter Shot to easily CC enemies in your face while you're shooting other enemies far away.

Imagine how it would read it it was actually something that was gameplay related, christ.
---
Leadership is about the person, not the class. Granted, in many groups the leadership *role* falls on tanks (not warriors, tanks) for a variety of reasons, one of which is pulling and another of which is people generally want the least responsibility so the role falls by default to the tank.
---
&gt; Lei of Lillies is basically a free Night Dragon's Breath every hour, but stronger. 
---
Good tip here. Literally every player in the game would appreciate having one of these necklaces. It's saved my life so many times.
---
You can put a quiver in your bank bag slots FYI.
---
I've only seen below level 60 scammers. And I've seen my guildmates gamble with 400+g rolls.

Goblin Mortor is one of the strongest Engineering trinkets/items in the game and not enough people know about it. It's a 35 yard range, INSTANT 3 second stun. The stun has travel time, but it cannot miss anything inside the radius of the attack once you cast the spell.
---
You get 6 charges before you have to remake it with 1 Mithril Bar + 3 Solid Blasting powder, so I made 3 of them to swap around so I have to recraft less often.
---
That's cool but let me show you this picture from my phone of the time [RARE ITEM] dropped and someone rolled a(n) [NUMBER], someone else rolled a(n) [EQUAL OR HIGHER NUMBER], and a third person rolled a(n) [EQUAL OR HIGHER NUMBER].

I thought it was over at that point but then I managed to roll a(n) [EVEN HIGHER NUMBER]!
---
Witness me.

Thats sick

It's actually spelled qyueuueeueew.

Don't approach. They'll approach you when they're ready.

Don't use lobotomizer in raids because it takes up a debuff slot.

And still have the attitude/outlook/maturity of a 20 year old fresh grad. Least they have an excuse.

Holy shit this needs a TLDR. 
---
I still dont know why I should care about this so I dont.
---
In my experience my healers are always involved and really good, or afk half the dungeon.  Had a guy admit to dual boxing and running mc on his main while running his alt in my dungeon. Like no wonder I questioned whether you were here or not the whole time
---
Ahh, well i can see what you mean, but that would be the Rogues, not me, but i got it.
---
Well, ive already ignored 4 brutality blades, and i’m willing to let Vis’kag go to someone else first aswell.
---
So i guess we’re all in the mentality: We’re not gonna see Vis’kag anyway, so might aswell chase other weapons in the meantime*
---
If that’s the case, i kinda figuered Rogues would choose CHT over something like Mirah’s song, since it’s a better stat stick, and you could Ambush Clothies in BG’s.
---
Optimal, maybe not, but we’re talking about 25-35 Onyxia kills, 0 swords/axes, and when it drops, the chances of an individual to get it is not High.
---
It’s not like we’re drowning in dagger loot either though, but i rather see someone pick it up, and enjoy it, more so than it just goes to someone ”just because we must roll it out” :)
---
Which is why i’m willing to let the first few Vis’kag go to other people, since pretty much the majority of our melee DPS is wielding Brutality blade + Mirah’s song xD
---
/u/CudgalTroll on reddit, you are a crybaby.
---
Good to know, I was under the impression they could. Sword spec still seems to be able to

Minus the part where you kill about a hundred thousand people on your way to greatness.
---
Old av was around for most of retail :/
---
They share cooldowns with mage stones. I really appreciate the gift but on most raid bosses I'm using stones on CD so I can die and do piratically no damage.
---
Ah thank you!
---
No, I found the one comment mentioned normalisation not working how you described it and he was right, but even he didn’t mention heroic strike isn’t normalised.
---
So if they allow this, does that mean I can start a casino again without getting banned? They cracked down hard on casinos initially in Vanilla, but this is basically the same thing so if no one is getting banned for gambling it might be an option again.
---
haha epic funny and original joke
---
No I guess not. You have a point.

Awesome work

The only surplus my AVs have is morons.

The Great Vietnam War of Phase 2.

Question about point 3:
---
A couple weeks ago I got killed by the same rogue like three times throughout the day while I was questing. It happened the same way every time. I was running on my mount, holding W, and suddenly my mount would turn around and run the opposite way (towards the camera). Before I had the chance to fix it I'd immediately get stunned to death by the rogue.
---
Was Distract making my mount turn around?
---
I recently found out about deathrolling from a friend that I level with on classic. 
---
Done got my ass addicted. 
---
My luck is so-so though so still not enough to convince me to gamble IRL
---
I mean some stuff makes sense to loot prio. I'm a healer and my BiS neck is the neck off rag. My guild only let's casters roll on It right now because it's only a small upgrade for us atm. Makes sense they should get priority over us healers even though its bis for both of us.
---
If you just straight up use slam with no macro, your weapon swing timer will reset when you cast
---
Now I want a love action movie
---
I mean do you actually have data to back up these claims? Plenty of tests out there that say otherwise.
---
How would you explain the results in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orhb7Njj3h8)?
---
This is what you get for picking the pvp favored side.
---
I ran it again and player 1 won 24949162 times. Player 2 won 25050838 times.
---
All and all that's 100 million trials, player 2 still yields a slight advantage.
---
You just need to stack more spirit.
---
Instant spells like Fireblast and Arcane Explosion have very low spellpower coefficients so it would be a minimal increase.
---
https://gist.github.com/jtstein/eba0ab41fa4cff08e57cb38189b33af8
---
Good question 🤔
---
&gt;you have to prep that outside of raids with worldbuffs etc which cut into pvp time
---
My guild hasn't been bothering with Tribute or Songflowers since BGs were added. I have thousands of gold worth of consumables already made and stored on an alt so I literally have zero prep needed outside of raids. I'm also in the fastest clear time raid on my server compared to all the other bracket 14 players who raid in slower clear time guilds.
---
&gt;Otherwise they are most likely, if horde, abusing the prequeue bug.
---
I have all of the top honor farmers added. They almost never log off and only do AVs. They aren't abusing the WSG queue.
---
In your example what is the % difference? 0.001%?
---
Wonder why
---
It’s a game that people are free to play however they want. It astonishes me how people live in your head rent free.
---
Brave genius intellectuals...? ok i just saw leaders... and "grunts" 100% infers a lack of intelligence which pretty much 100% infers you resent us.
---
I don’t think blizzard mind in game gold gambling. 
---
In retail there were/are addons for it. As long as no record of real money transfers are happening I would like to think your okay! 
---
Keep in mind - asking a GM if it’s OKAY regardless of what they say it doesn’t mean your safe.
---
(25054261 - 24945739) / 50000000 * 100 = 0.217044%
---
They're crippling themselves in gearing because the "smarter" alternative is doing what you did which you admit was slower and required you to BiS a different spec first.
---
Yeah ok.
---
Of course the first roller has a lower chance of winning that depends on the starting Max number. Imagine starting from 2, for instance.
---
Really? Mana per second doesn't work with innervate?
---
Yes.
---
What’s special about gorshak?
---
RWT?
---
I doubt the going to add appearance changes to classic because they weren't available in Vanilla and #nochanges.
---
Everything is 50/50. Either it happens, or it doesn't

---
dude whatever shaders you are using look like garbage, it looks nighttime in the middle of the day
---
Player 1 will always roll 0.5 times more than Player 2, on average.  From 1000, player 1 rolls 4 times, while player 2 only rolls 3.5 times (again, on average).  
---
The smaller the starting number, the more that difference matters as each individual roll has higher odds of being 1.
---
My gripe with loot council is that people with shit gear get upgrades when people who spent time getting pre raid bis are waiting for everyone else to catch up. I get it helps the raid out but I'm at 12 raids and 1 drop
---
Yeah, that frees up another 2 hours to sit in av queues until p3
---
It's not the middle of the day, it's early morning, sun isn't all the way up in-game it's only just coming over the mountains.
---
I agree 100% i rolled human male and regret it big time. The female animations are way better imo :/ but yeah i feel like it wont happen for a very long time
---
What does a stack sell for on your server?  Either it’s really cheap on my server or I’m just not catching many.
---
Probably because they would be called rancid corporate shills more then they usually are. Blizzard would deep down love to charge 5$ to provide a service that’s available in their base game for free.
---
Gods of Attrition Warfare, Love to Win. Yep.
---
Naw it doesn’t... wf is way better unless you wanna get 1 hit on the pull because EB gives a ton of threat and is just a waste of RNG in raids
---
Its pretty easy with ISboxer to do follow/stopfollow stuff. Plus (most people don't realize this I think) follow range is something like 20-25 yards.
---
And I do believe there is interact with target in classic wow. I've seen people doing 1shaman 4 warrior multiboxing
---
Group 1 is in a WSG. They have alt 1 and 2 queue starting group 2.
---
Group 1 finishes game, leaves the game and group. Alt 1 and 2 (who have been queued) invites members of group 1 to their group (2), new group 2 members inherit the queue alt 1 and alt 2 have been in. Alt 1 and 2 leave group you bring in the rest of your team and you get a short queue.
---
In other words the pvp group effectively DO NOT HAVE A QUEUE. All the other scrubs have a 30 minute queue (twice as long).
---
"If you want to be up for priority items you need full pre raid bis like everyone else did".

Huh? I’m getting the same rank while watching what ever I want lmao

I mean you should know this information beforehand if you're going to be raiding.

---
It’s a joke.
---
Your arguments have nothing to do with what I said. But that's ok this is reddit.

Looking to get back in classic wow after 10+ years. Anyone here would guide me as to which server &amp; horde/alliance they rec? Looking for a cozy guild mates to grind raids with down the road.

Yup, that's distract!
---
You need closer to 6k plus I’d really recommend inner focus and power infusion. 
---
Bring lots and lots of mage water. Do not move unless you have full mana.  Have to be hyper vigilant about patrols.  Herbalism helps a lot but sometimes they Diane in places too close to mobs.  Know where to check for dusty tomes.
---
Hey I made 2 staff of Jordan’s yesterday off death rolling.
---
Yeah I do know rogues and hunters go after Master Dragonslayer's Ring. Why would a rogue take a QSR or Ring of the Qiraji Fury when they need the hit from their rings?
---
Probably the same amount of time you wasted typing this pointless comment.
---
It's not a priority debuff spot so it doesnt knock off anything worthwhile
---
&gt; retail mentality
---
Lol, you act as if the Classic Boomers are fucking saints, get real. This shit has been happening since real classic. I've seen far less "greedy ass retail" players, than I've seen greedy ass clASSic players. 
---
Every dungeon group on clASSic is "LFM XYZ, need Healer/DPS. EVERYTHING IS MINE, NOBODY ELSE GETS SHIT, ALL MINE...pst"
---
Yes, but the first was out of 4, as the post above said. They're right, the chance of 8 2s in a row with that is 1/512
---
U can use HOTW/NS to offtank anything, even main tank. Threat generation isn’t a problem for druids. If u’re main tanking a boss, pummeler once and you’re set. If you’re offtanking you don’t need threat, just mitigation, since noone will be hitting your target for a while and HOTW build gives all the mitigation you need.
---
If you don’t wanna use pummelers, just a couple of powershift for free mauls get you ahead, or just starting with both your HoT on yourself does the trick as well.
---
This is awesome! Makes it look more populated than it is.
---
Okay boomer.

When you order a kids meal and a kids toy you have to assume it's a wow player.

Get furor for pve and get a powershift macro. Turns mana into rage.
---
Every god damn pull in MC, all healers on comms, whispers etc. "Hey maybe you should spam some lifetap so i can pad heal" let me just do DPS instead you healing crawing addicts :(
---
Yes, and that's exactly what changed it. There was no long Horse, Ram, Tiger, etc Riding. Instead you just trained Journeyman or Apprentice riding and you could ride all mounts of that class.
---
my life is suddenly incomplete, what realm
---
The helm is bugged. If u have furor (q point even) it gives 10 rage instead of just the 5
---
Is there a mobile version of this? Looks nice keep it up!
---
I was pugging and it was early in classic so not many people were well geared, including myself. Prot increased my survivability and threat. I did cripple myself in dps-gearing-up speed but it was my preference to not roll, and made some cool friends on the way.
---
Had one chase me all the way to the flight path.
---
Great editing! Enjoyed
---
This is such an underrated post. Gold.
---
Not wasting a 3min emergency cooldown on a lifetap lol
---
Honestly don’t understand the gear head mentality of leaving/booting to optimize away from loot competition. When groups take upwards of 30 minutes or more to form respect the fact that someone wanted to go. I’d take a 50/50 and not afk-ing in IF over a 1 hour fill that may disband before getting all 5-10...
---
It's realistic? I was born with a natural ability to ride a Horse because I'm human? Shit
---
What's the lockbox thing about?
---
Also, that means you die 100x easier because you have no stamina. You also run out of mana way easier because you have no int or spirit.
---
On a farm-level target, frozen wrath is great because no one is dying and the fights last like 45 seconds. On a progression boss, you're going to be holding everyone back by dying and running out of mana.
---
A lot of it could just be how fast your guild kills things. It's a lot easier to get 800 dps if you're cleaving lucifron and kill him in 20 seconds than if you kill adds one by one and it takes you a minute.
---
Damn, we get an eye like every other week
---
Top tier play then on your part. Didn't realize this would have been launch rush basically, definitely a good idea to respec for the survivability if most healers aren't too geared yet. I main a warrior so basically choose not to tank unless it's in my favor (i.e. no other warriors as horde or no war/pal as Ally) and I dont think I've been kicked from a group due to comp yet, but I must be of the lucky minority.
---
Honestly 90% of pre-bis farming for warrior should just be gold farming anyways,
---
Bds shoulders, legs, boots
---
Range weapon from av 
---
Edgemasters/devilsaur gloves
---
Quest 1% crit belt from attune
---
Trinket from attunement quest
---
Buy blackstone/elvin rings
---
Quest necklace
---
Lionheart helmet
---
Only things you need to run are ubrs for weapons/belt/painweaver/bracers
---
Strat ud for cape
---
Then sgc grind
---
If you buy krul MH and do the quest for mirahs most people won't care about a dps war in ubrs (especially if you say you don't need truestrike either) if you're an orc farm av for frostbite and then pick up flurry if it's cheap or boneslicer from strat ud
---
There’s a couple things that have an absolute enormous effect on your dps that a lot of people don’t think about:
---
1) kill speeds. If you’re a good warrior in an average guild your kill speeds are still going to be 2-3x slower than tryhards, which is going to have a huge affect on your dps
---
2) level of world buffs (self explanatory)/consumables
---
3) cd timing/usage. Getting the most out of deathwish/reck/MRP is enormous.
---
I was unclear in my idea here. At level 40 I would have the choice to proceed down arms to get Sweeping Stikes, or prot to the Imp Revenge, or Fury for more dmg/rage generation. I dont't necessarily have a plan for which I order. I agree Imp Revenge is really good, and might be worth getting earlier on. 
---
Thanks!
---
Damn did they just update? I did it not too long ago but haven't had a need in a while
---
It's not a huge increase but it definitely helps if you're ever not super focused on anything else. More offhand hits = more rage generated and more chances to trigger Flurry. If you're sword spec then there's more chances to proc extra attacks which also might trigger flurry, etc.
---
Oh we got a psychologist in the thread
---
LF invite, frost mage currently hovering bracket 7
---
Honestly, as a mage, even I feel like it's always up. Fearless is right, ice block has a hidden passive that increases your confidence by 56% (affected by permafrost)
---
In what weird sensitive world do you live in where these situations are remotely comparable
---
I had a few friends tell me it doesn’t work anymore. Tried it anyway about a month ago and sure enough I was hearthed to where I was trying to set my earth. (Aka didn’t work)
---
As if being lt commander means you are skilled at the game
---
&gt; If you're sword spec then there's more chances to proc extra attacks which also might trigger flurry, etc.
---
Sword spec is arms
---
&gt; but I heard it was minimal dps diff
---
You heard wrong dude. Also since you're human, are you using a sword/mace?
---
I'm not into probability but something tells me that the increased percentage for a win on player 2 should scale down towards 0 with the base 2 log of the starting roll
---
Tank strat live and res the first orb.
---
We've had something like 6 bre drops and other two handers also train from the sky. We've got sad casters though.
---
I chose a PvP server and fondly remember two fun encounters in the open world where it ended up with small scale PvP between a few players while levelling :)
---
But I would never (re)start on a PvP server at this point.
---
Because I also remember two days ago getting ganked by two players. Rezzing. Getting killed by a 60 passing through. Logging out for two hours. Logging in again getting ganked immediately by someone 5 levels higher. 
---
It's rarely that bad. But sometimes it is. You can expect a corpse run every few hours while questing unless your server has a small pop of the other faction. 
---
So unless you actually enjoy ruining other players fun by ganking them it's really not worth it. You opt into a few hours of additional corpse runs in exchange for a handful of fun episodes of pvp, and that's pretty much it.
---
If you really want to experience it go for it! But just be aware what the "PvP server experience" actually is.
---
then why would they change it? they didnt have to change it
---
I use sword of zeal and the proc rate is seriously insane and LOVES to proc on my first few attacks. I am pretty much guaranteed a proc the battle starts
---
I see so many warriors just walking into mobs in defensive stance. People miss so much rage without berserker rage, switching to battle stance and charging, then switching to defensive stance. Like you said, you can pop berserker early and then it’s hardly even stance dancing.
---
Is there a version without the text that I could use as a screensaver?

It's about how this guy lets his DPS drop marginally in order to maintain hit cap on his ALT which raids with his guilds ALT group. Also, you come across as having a stick up ur ass.
---
I am a night elf druid and am now level 19. I love the class fantasy and looks. Is it normal that I sometime struggle against same level mobs? What kind of spec should I go for since I mostly play solo but would like to try healing in dungeons? Also what stats should I be looking for on items? And lastly, I have done almost every quest in Auberdine and the surroundings, what should I do since Ashenvale's quests are level 20-25
---
Yes, it’s very easy to see:
---
Who’s gonna do more damage, the warrior where deathwish/reck is up for 75% of the fight or the warrior with deathwish/reck up for 20% of the fight?
---
Let's say you have 2 raids. One kills bosses in 30 seconds, the other a minute. Assuming you use all your cooldowns, Death wish lasts 30 seconds, mighty rage 20, and reck 15. In the latter raid, that's 30 seconds without deathwish, 40 without mighty rage, and 45 without reck. Of course your overall dps will end up much lower.
---
its around 60-65s per fish (raw or cooked) on my server. I haven't figured out which times/days are best to sell yet but that's the average I'm seeing.
---
The other important trick is that you have to fish them between 12pm-6pm. Outside of this window, you get a significantly reduced drop rate and it's not worth the time to fish.
---
It takes 30 minutes to form for DPS - A tank can take their pick from any group and get going within 2 minutes.
---
Had a 25 min queue today.
---
I recognize your name, and your guild's name. Did you play on Destromath in Vanilla?
---
Thanks for the info!
---
If you are a tank then groups do not take 30 minutes or more to form
---
Well you did say performance, not annoyances. Signal interference shouldn't be an issue as long as you keep the receiver close. Battery life I can understand but that's more of a preference. Personally I find dealing with wired far more annoying than dealing with a battery.

how about your chat window set up? and addons used there?

There are a few that show up in AV with Hand of Rag.

Right? I feel jipped

On a "2" deathroll, player 1 would have a 50% chance to lose right away, then another 50% chance to have a 50% chance to lose. Player 2 should have somewhere between 50 and 75% winrate. Looking at 4 coin flips in a row, you have 16 (2^4) permutations.
---
8 cases player 1 loses on the first roll
---
4 cases player 2 loses on the second roll
---
2 cases player 1 loses on the third roll
---
1 case player 2 loses on then fourth roll
---
1 case no one has lost.
---
in that one case you can run 4 flips gain. 
---
This Player 2 at least a 10/16 or 62.5% win chance, and at most a 11/16 though more closely examining it it becomes 10/16 + (10/16)/16 + ((10/16)/16)/16
---
The limit appears to approach 2/3
---
So on a 2 death roll the first player has double the win chance.
---
Repeating again for a 3 death roll:
---
1/3 Will result in player 1 losing on the first roll
---
1/3 will result in 2/3 chance for player 2
---
1/3 will repeat with play 2 having these odds
---
so 3/9 + 1/9 chance of player 1 winning, the remaining 5/9 grants player 2 the 4/9 chance, in that remaining 5/9 chance player 1 has a 2/9 chance of winning, and another 3/9 chance of the initial chance again.
---
Adding up to above 57% chance.
---
On So we're seeing a pretty rapid degradation towards the mean. 
---
You have a 1 in the roll amount chance of losing before the other person even has a chance to roll, but by rolling first you presumably lower their roll which increases their chance of losing before you can roll again. At anything other than very low numbers it becomes fairly minimal. 
---
Tl:DR Run a few sets of 10000 rolls at amounts of 10, 100, and 1000 and see the odds at each gap and you can find a general curve for your odds.
---
i want your monitor!!
---
U don’t need HS.  You’re returned to TB after the match.  So loop is:  queue, fly to feralas, run to DM and kills as many packs of lashers as possible before game start then rinse repeat.  With 20 min queues and 30 min games I don’t even have to reset instance half the time, but make sure to check before you jump obv.
---
If you approximate the stdev here using a coin flip with 5M trials, it would be result +/- 0.0002%, which would indicate that a difference of 0.2% is well outside the expected norm.
---
Correct me if I’m wrong, it’s been awhile since stats.
---
Westfall US East Coast has a lot of Alliance. If that’s your faction our guild would love to have you. We help people level and raid on the regular.
---
We have/had 5 druids. 3 of them don't show up and haven't logged on in a month. I assume they're all dead and we'll never see them again. All have almost full t1 and druid gear just keeps dropping. 
---
We had a new druid show up... teenage son of another new member. Don't think I've said 4 words to him it or his father by this point and I shit you not the First week he got 4 T1 pieces. Second week he got another 3 and we "shared" 2 druid things that him, the other resto, and the bear have. Dude hit 60 and had 6/8 T1 and T2 helm. He's the only person so far to go under 1 EP/GP.
---
You can cast a heal on someone while spamming drink and drink in combat in PvP. As a night elf druid you can do regrowth + rejuv + drink + shadowmeld all at the same time and get full mana back in stealth. You just need to be out of combat when you start casting.
---
Nice. Good to see some of the old OG Destromath peeps are back for Classic.
---
Yes, it's very easy and makes farming significantly more efficient. I have this on a rogue and I run around WS from cave to cave, tapping the macro. And most gatherers should show both types of nodes at the same time, so it's really easy to plan out routes.
---
Interesting, though I'm not sure the 100g to unlock my last back slot is worth it for 16 slots of exclusive ammo storage
---
We got the priest item at Majordomo chest and wanted to give it our benched priest (he said he won't pug anyway so he can take the ID). Our lootmaster was too stupid to get how giving people chest items works and gave himself the item and tried to trade it over...
---
Jebedias, gnome mage! I'm pretty sure I distinctly remember getting crushed by you a good bit in AB.
---
Rogues barely take falling damage from it though, it's not bad at all
---
I switched to Atiesh and I found a great guild, always people on, always people looking for groups to quest, run dungeons, whatever you’re tryna do!
---
You got a macro with either “/use 14” or “/use 15”?
---
Lol no... in your typical raid the rogues and warriors are not geared to the teeth yet even now cause there lots of competition. Also not everyone goes full DM buffs and onyx buff etc
---
faerlina has stacks and their bracket 1 is 1.2. Whitemane is 1.5+, why? Right, because they can't trust randoms not to break 1.2.
---
It knocking off corruption is super annoying. We had a lock that kept spamming shadowburn to up his dps, and it did to an extent, but it was not worth it when everyone’s corruption had a chance of getting kicked.
---
Yes, mobs in classic are much harder then retail. Often you can only fight 1 at a time
---
/use 14 or 15 is the macro
---
Ohh god this is awesome
---
How do you run a casino in wow
---
With an erection!
---
/use 13 and /use 14.
---
How is alchemy good? What do I even sell? All high level elixrs are fucking useless because they don't stack with buffs. I just end up making low level potions to my alts, Still could just buy them for a few silver. Feels like a pointless proffesion
---
I was a proprietary trader that traded e-minis (S&amp;P). That is an entire futures stock market.
---
A workaround for this is to use a crafted item as it's says "crafted by "name" on the item.
---
Who knows? I understand why you want it changed back, but it doesn’t impact the core game at all
---
Your farm gear isn't preraid bis. 
---
Focus on high int and Stam items over spell power, healing power, and Mp5. 
---
Get sound 6k Mana.
---
Why you so mad? Lonely Christmas?
---
Love it.
---
Also to add to vanishing death oils, you can predict when they do it by counting the lock's globals. Most of them will get all their dots out first while running away, and jumping 180 coil next global. It makes it easy to vanish because chances are you aren't gonna be fighting a lock good enough to 180 fake coil to get your vanish.

Because most turtle games are Horde offense Ally defense, so even when we pool the resources to get him, the escort usually dies before she reaches Fields of Strife.

I am about to get my shaman to 60 over break and I already have a 60 mage. How can I convince my guild/ a guild to help me get sulfurus?
---
Transmutes.
---
"just get rank 11"
---
hmmm
---
Probably never tbh. You're not likely to find a tank spot on raid teams at this point. If you do I'll likely be OT and they'll want you to be fury prot. You generally don't need prot to tank 60 dungeons and prot damage is way, way, way below fury/fury prot.
---
Respec when you get a raid spot.
---
What? You can vendor items and just get them back eventually?
---
All good! Just wanted to share it to a friend, I can wait till your edits are done though!
---
All fun and games until you are a clothie and tooling against people who have different armor classes available but *wah, it's BIS for me!!!1*

Nobody reads this shit or listens to this shit pre-game or mid-game. You just come across as a hall monitor, players minds are very much made up before queuing. You're not gonna change anyone's mind, let people play the way they wanna play
---
It really comes down to random roll games.
---
Offer roulette, people trade you their bet, pick a number and roll 1-38. If they pick the right number, you pay 35 times their bet to them, otherwise you keep the bet.
---
Offer a straight roll game. Player trades you their bet and rolls. 1 to 65 loses and the casino keeps it. 66 to 95 (sometimes 98) wins back double the amount. Anything above that pays triple.
---
You can also easily do a version of craps with 2 to 12 rolls but it requires a lot of trust from both parties, moreso than the others, because depending on how deep you go it can be hard to keep up with.
---
I play shadow on stalagg and raid with my guild.
---
big mad
---
Nature's grace is also pretty good, same row as moonglow.
---
Eh I just have a gnome tank so I can pick him up and throw him at what I want dead.
---
Curse of recklessness prevents mobs from running. It also overrides fear. So if a month is running and your warlock does not stop them, your warlock messed up or is not aware of the interaction. While running Scarlet Monastery I'd be tossing curse of recklessness on any mob at &lt;20% and at risk of running into the next room over. Normally I wouldn't have to do this but my tank just didn't want to constantly walk backward away from the other mob packs while fighting (you know, literally hit the monster while slowly walking backward, so as the fight progresses you are further and further away from the other packs, without losing any "dmg output" or aggro), so it was convenient to just give the old "lolno" to runners directly.
---
Immunes mobs from fear, including running away. If a mob runs away and looks like it's going to cause an apocalypse, you can quickly curse him to make him come back. Same thing with judgement of justice (though it doesn't make them immune to all kinds of fear, just running away).
---
No.
---
For real, Druids got the shaft in this thread it feels like. I go in to fight the monsters of lore in nothing but my fur and these warriors are getting the glory?
---
Personally, I came to the comments to find out what it was about I was reading through it and then skimming because it took awhile.
---
I've tried bug on this but yeah. If recommend fucking a concise tldr next time.
---
Your bold lines didn't:
---
This is a big deal indeed
---
We need those letters back
---
Act now
---
Just don't criticism for future posts
---
That is assuming that the chance is actually 50/50. In reality, since that this is the case, player 1 will roll &gt;0.5 times more than player 2 on average. As starting numbers become closer, the number will become closer to 0.5 and the probability will become closer to 50/50 of who wins the game.
---
You have to pay for the riding lesson.
---
Which in 1.12 for some reason costs 100x more than the huge fully grown and trained animal.
---
Warriors (and other melee) make awful leaders. Obviously the main tank should have some leadership capabilities, but trying to correct the positioning of pugs while maintanking ony is very difficult, compared to a healer or a couple of ranged dps officers.
---
Herod probably?
---
I did it a few days ago and it worked for me. I think I timed it as the cast completed like at 10.1 seconds after cast started
---
Shadow Priests can be viable in raids like have like 4 or 5 Warlocks because of shadow weaving. Your damage never will really match the other dps, but you residually add dmg by buffing all other sources of shadow damage. If you do decide to try and do raid content, please at least read up on how to itemize properly, while also coming prepared in preraid bis gear.
---
Most of your bis items overlap with mages and warlocks, who do make better use of them tbh, so don’t get discouraged when you have to wait a while to get some stuff. The class is insanely fun to play though and wish I could do the same with my own priest.
---
Where is moonwell in stormwind? I always went to boat then auberdine lol... so much time wasted
---
Warlocks will love you, your able to help with dispells, extra silence, another rezzer.  They bring alot to the table other then dps.  Its worth going after imo. But be mindful a raid group usually only needs one. So find a guild without one yet if thats possible for you.
---
Most of the time I get into a dungeon group it’s one that my friend and I make, so I’ve never had this problem. We only ever pass lead between each other, and we’ll give tanks assist. Sucks you’ve been dealing with that. If you’re the one forming groups you’ll never face this problem again!
---
Dude - incredible. I'm going to print this out and frame it for my gaming room!

When do quests start to open up in Hinterlands?  I am Alliance level 43 and I completed quests around my level and then they jump to 48.
---
Interface -&gt; keybindings -&gt; scroll all the way to the bottom to TrinketMenu bindings
---
Hate to break it to you but this is not news to any semi-competent guild.
---
Not about a class, but a little trick about hearthstones : you can change your hearthstone location right before the end of the cast. You will hearthstone to the first hearthstone location and your hearthstone will be set to the new one. Very useful on shamans for moving around the world quickly, but tricky as you could end up wasting your hearthstone if you're too fast.
---
There is no greed mentality in retail. Everyone has personal loot. If you play 5 warriors in a dungeon you will still get loot for yourself.
---
It would be pretty funny if the devs legalized roll casinos in TB
---
Yes, go to my patreon.com/imadreamwalker and download it free! :3
---
Instructions unclear.  My /cancelform /cast Shred macro doesn't seem to do anything now!
---
I have. Hopefully this was just a bug.
---
He’s probably run with the kind of tanks I see *all the time*. I love when a tank steps up and leads because it means I don’t have to. More often what they do is run in where and when they feel like it without marking anything and everyone else has to run after them to keep them alive and clean up.
---
When you have a tank that takes charge themselves? Breath of fresh air. It’s definitely easiest when the do (for 5 mans, I find a DPS, preferably ranged is better for leading raids. But more often than not I end up marking targets and calling out where to go and what to do with pug tanks as they show no interest in it.
---
Holy! thank you mate for that awesome support! &lt;3

This is how you play AV.

I’m BWL?  You used to be able to aggro Chromaggus with pets.  And he’d bring the dragons you hadn’t killed yet.
---
The legion of never blinking, never sleeping ALWAYS shadowmelded Night Elf Hunters.
---
Most guilds will want you to heal. The best guilds do not DPS on their shadow priest, he applies 5x weaving and heals. This is because a shadow priest does not do respectable DPS in raid. 
---
Shadow priest is a very powerful PvP spec, and if you like to run around killing people solo, its top tier for this. SW:P does a tremendous amount of damage over a long time, and for most classes, it feels like the shadow priest never dies. 
---
Unfortunately, there is not a lot of good shadow priest  loot available in raids until AQ, and Naxx in particular. Choker, mantle of black wing cabal, ring of spell power, and other caster gear without crit is ideal, unfortunately, most guilds doing efficient clears of the weekly raids will prefer to give this to their casters, or their longtime shadow priest player (you won't see efficient guilds taking more than 1.) The loot that is pure shadow damage will likely make its way to you, even as a healer.
---
Positives: powerful PvP spec, if you really love to PvP you can get to the higher ranks and find high stam  gear with good spellpower completely on your own.
---
Negatives: unless you're in on the ground level of a guild, you'll likely have trouble running shadow as a main spec in raid. If you have to time and commitment to find a guild that will take you, and clear to AQ/Naxx, you can gear up this way. Also, I don't know why the raid DPS as shadow is appealing to you, you have no AOE and mostly stack weaving as quickly as possible.
---
If you have the determination and patience, you can find people to raid with. Just be aware that superior play in raid would be you healing after weaving, to keep an extra spot for a proper DPS class. I would be highly cautious of guilds running ferals, rets/dps shaman, shadow priests, and not having their melees and casters on mandatory PvE specs for raiding. Raids like this end up struggling to clear content week by week, and usually bleed players looking to save time on their weekly raids after they get a piece of prime loot.
---
Hello mate, thank you for the words! ;D
---
I'm a warrior tank and for raids I agree with you. I actually think it's better to have a ranged DPS class as leader because they have the ability to see everything that is going on and off they're a mage or a hunter or something their dps rotation isn't super taxing.
---
However for parties in dungeons it's way easier for a tank to lead it.
---
I have the icons keeping so I just check if healer and mage are above 50% mana start pulling the target that will be skull and as my note draws I mark all the targets.
---
Makes it super smooth.
---
But yeah for raids ranged dps is the optional raid leader imo. Of course you also want competent tanks.
---
Found the RuneScape player
---
Thank you peanut bear! i appreciate it :3
---
Man. That sucks. I must be lucky until now, but all groups I have been in were relaxed, patient skilled and alot of fun to play with.
---
There are raids later, is it Naxx? Can’t remember and not sure if it’s even in vanilla, but I raided shadow and mind controlled one elite in a three group boss fight.
---
thank you! :3
---
That makes me smile! :D
---
Well we cleared MC and ony in 2.5 hours with 27 people this week so it’s fine there. We are on Westfal

Are there any high pop EU PvP servers with good faction balance?

Nah, this was MC. We didn't think it was possible, he didn't know how it happened.

[PRINTS!](https://society6.com/imadreamwalker) :D
---
If you are an alliance druid and you want a fast way to the hunter camp in northern STV just fly to Sentinel Hill and then hop into the river with aquatic form and speed south to the camp!
---
You're right, yeah.  Probabilities aside, Player 1 rolls more because there are only two possible outcomes: Player 1 loses with one more roll than Player 2, or Player 1 wins with an equal number of rolls.
---
This pretty much answers the question, nice work
---
hahaha :D
---
Nothing says "get back in there!" like a bubble,renew, and PI

Pretty sure theres a 20 minute video on the lore of duskwood.. DUSKWOOD! Nobbel87 has the best lore videos.. Thats probably the best place to learn about the lore. Pre WoW they put most of the lore into the game manuals of the warcraft games
---
Bless the Lord! thank you man :3
---
Enjoy it! &lt;3
---
&gt;  and the Fury tank can simply try to compete with the Rogues in DPS instead.

please don't be a tank

Thanks for the info, with my luck the first person I offer roulette to would win and I'd be in huge debt

Piggybacking off this.  I haven't tested this as I play mage, but I heard cancel aura HP pot and back into bear form in one macro works for tanks and with spell batching makes it impossible for you to take non bear form damage.  Hope this helps somebody out there.

Piggy backing off this. Is Brutality Blade and Mirah's Song better than Dal Rends set? Thanks.

Could I get some macro assistance?

I want a one button macro that casts arcane shot and multi shot whenever they are off cooldown, but the following only casts arcane shot, it refuses to cast multi shot:

/cast Arcane Shot
---
/cast Multi-Shot

Not sure what I'm missing..

I'd also love a macro that casts concussive shot or wing clip (whichever is available at the time).

Your raid leader has no idea what he's talking about. Orcs with axes need 6 hit%. Characters without +weapon skill need 9.

A lower tier guild will take you. And if a guild wont take you because you shadow and they belive you hinder progress  that guild have bigger problem than a shadowpriest.

You must start with a fuck ton of gold then because if they hit just a 10g bet you are paying out 350

All the good players have joined premades.  After a week of telling people to go farm their 100% mount instead of being a leech in AV, Alliance decided they were fed up with it and now exclusively play with other non-leeches.  The premades win in 10-15 minutes with a 95% win rate.
---
Usually, we have the buyer ready outside when we're on done with golemagg. After loot on golemagg is distributed, one of our raiders logs out, and we invite the buyer and tell him to enter MC so we can summon him. We then kill Majordomo while telling him to just stand and way on the side or run into lava to die quickly and if the item drops, we take the gold from him and give him his item. If it doesn't drop, we tell him to come back next week.

What consumables are rogues stacking for raids ?

Mongoose, fire prot, firewater, and what else can I stack with these to increase my offense and defense while raiding.
---
Same with boars
---
The difference between slow and fast OH is that you'll be getting rage in faster (albeit smaller) intervals, allowing you to get a cast off on every GCD (better for execute phase, and for furyprot tanks, HS/sunder spam).

To avoid this hold down both mouse buttons while mounting and they'll try to distract turn you with no effect. You'll turn for a millisecond then keep going about your day.
---
I didn't downvote you, and your opinion is valid -but i just think your missing the real reason why we keep playing WoW. Saying "once you hit 60 all thats left to do is raid, and farm stuff for raids" is really not giving the experience the credit it deserves. Even if that was all there was, there's a lot of room for adventure within those two activities.
---
Some of them are like skilled play but others are just obscene at lower levels
---
1 shadow priest per 40man raid. You will still be expected to heal in harder fights later on if you intend on doing AQ/Naxx. Just roll warlock.

Moonglow is by far better, if you want to change to a more fun spec u could go imp regrowth depending how close ur raid plays to the buff cap

People kept messaging me telling me I was going to get banned.

8g for a level 1 gnome is a lot :)

My one is from Vanilla. We had a 1% wipe on Twin Emps and i was the tank that f*cked up my positioning, got knockbacked by the caster twin and couldnt be healed. So when i died they started healing and the wipe was a fact. This was when we hadnt killed them at all.
---
Fun thing is the week after we got back to them. Raid leader said to spare pots as we were gonna do a "first test try". At 50 % all were alive and raid leader starting yelling in Ventrilo: Use your pots nowah !!! And they went down, that felt better :)

If you have rogue and warlock both 60, how would you distribute professions? Currently I have herbalis/mining on rogue and enchanting/alchemy on warlock

It is though in the case of Stalagg, and would be for any server (inevitably) if they don't have a hardcore guild that attracts people to transfer there

But you are kek
---
Im making decent buck still selling devilsaur set at around 30g, to even sometimes 50g profit. And it sells well, like 2-3 sets a day. Hide of the wild moves slow but has a bigger margin. I make around 80g profit. So i guess im still keeping LW.
---
Mage or warlock afaik
---
While leveling solo u use ur wand so much that 25% more damage is just a much smoother ride.
---
But if you feel like the 0,5 sec casting time reduction is more usefull because u spend more time in dungeon then by all means go for it. Its ur talent tree, and nobody can inspect it.
---
Mage
---
+ Gold-savings on food/water (it adds up to an insane amount over a lifetime)
---
+ Ease of access/navigation to the wider world (for you and your friends)
---
+ You're a (relatively) top performer in both PvE/PvP
---
+ It's pretty hard to play badly
---
+ You're pretty much one of the most in-demand classes for any general circumstance at all times in group content (only beaten by Tanks, Healers).
---
You only need 6% hit as a human with swords
---
Yes. This was in my mind too. Stack crit instead. 😊
---
I like to see how close to 0hp I can get before I block.
---
Beautiful.
---
Or let person play class that they enjoy? Tanking in classic is complete shit and I understand why many warriors prefer to wait 30 minutes instead of tanking themselves.
---
Fast weapons do not provide greater rage generation and it's be great if people stopped spreading this
---
Warlocks - add weakaura icon when you get renew/revju so you life tap
---
How dare he play the game with it's default settings.
---
I say this as a fairly serious raider and an evangelist for keybinds, macros, weakauras and so on; get off your high horse. Not everyone needs to play keybind piano to deserve fun in this game.
---
He's not gonna lose half his DPS just because he probably clicks a shout every 2 minutes.
---
I’m a graph man. Everyone else came in here with a shit ton of words. This is how you present data people.
---
In the Park
---
1) Your macros are god awful. Nobody is going to read them. Way too many words. Understand you are being annoying to begin with.
---
2) You are awful. Those armchair AV generals are cringe enough as is. I can‘t fathom why u not only participate in this but encourage this.
---
Good macros have much clearer instructions. Are split into multiple messages. Use numbering. Use very vocal, concise and convincing arguments (need 1 more to cap X with me. X = 125 rep!)
---
You act like you have something important to tell. You don‘t, though.
---
Did this to a rogue mate once. We were ragging on him for never interrupting in raids.
---
Rebound every action to kick.
---
Took him quite a while to figure out why he wasn't doing proper damage or getting any combo points.
---
Yes its a bug happening on every server
---
the hell am i even looking at? can barely read the low res and also the player achieved high warlord which hasnt happened in classic yet lol
---
&gt; With proper armor gear + SL/Void, it is 50%+ damage mitigation with pretty good hp.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; However, does the Searing Pain really generate enough threat?
---
Yes, it surpasses paladin tank threat and almost eclipses shaman raid tank threat.
---
Pollution in the southfury river really be out of control huh?
---
That and he's an asshole.
---
It‘s easily the best shit ever if you spend non-negligible time in world. Only beaten by actually having engineering, which is the most useful and fun profession in both pve and pvp each. Just not as profitable.
---
And some things that aren't technically *spells* but cost mana will put you into the 5-second window, like Stormstrike or warlock/paladin quest mount.
---
Amazing post lol please put this to the top. like playin too. I'm a fucking warrior. You need a tank? I got you
---
It’s been happening on every server as far as I know. I’ve also had bad experiences questing/playing within that glitched zone to include a 10 minute DC that read “That character name already exists” every time I tried hopping back on the character that was playing in that zone. Blizz needs to get this stuff figured out lol.
---
If you hate the idea of healing, don't roll a class that can.nit WILL be expected of you at some point. If you're fine with healing every once in a while but mainly want to play shadow, go for it.
---
Try almost every single raiding guild with perhaps one or two exceptions leaving, what do you think then? By new years stalagg will be a ghost town.
---
Rumour is incendius
---
Exactly. You don't get to decide if other people are playing the game right or not. What a fucking joke.
---
It's cause a Premade q'd and decided not to go to that one and left q. So their spots were open
---
Same over in STV also crocs
---
It does not really matter that much for PvE since you get 305 sword weapon skill from talents anyways, and the 300-305 boost is what matters the most. 
---
As a human you can push a little bit extra glancing hit penalty reduction to the 308 wep skill (which is essentially effective wep skill cap) and put the extra talent point left somewhere else.
---
Thanks for the clarification. I get it now.
---
Nah Mate. All good here. Its just as I said, big effing sword, world dying, and we fight each other. Well .. not anymore but still, nobody seems to care.
---
This was my main gripe with the guild I joined.  They were putting way too much weight on who it was the biggest upgrade for because they still have a green item in that slot or w/e.  I got promoted to an officer and my first order of business was getting the other officers on my side about how stupid it is to reward people for not grinding their bis and essentially punishing those who do, so next meeting there would be a lot of voices to back the opinion.  That got changed real quick.  It baffles me how many LCs do this, especially when you already 10/10 MC and 1 shot Ony and progression isn't even an issue.
---
You download a swing timer and make a macro for Heroic Strike. I forget the exact string but on the first click, it will queue Heroic and on the second click it will cancel Heroic Strike.
---
You put the macro on your bar and queue Heroic Strike at a point where your offhand will hit before your main hand. Due to some internal "feature" this will allow your offhand's hit chance to match your main hit chance, which is much higher. It requires a lot of micromanagement but gives you free attacks you normally wouldn't get if you didn't do the trick. The damage isn't huge but a higher chance to hit means a more consistent flow of crits and more crits means more flurry uptime.
---
If you need the rage for an upcoming Bloodthirst, you just hit the Heroic strike macro again and it will un-queue Heroic Strike so it won't consume your next main hand attack.
---
George L coming for yo ass
---
I made moste og my gold from tanking dungens, when I hit 60, and doing the few quests I had left, I also farmed elementals and still do. Elemental fire go for around 5.5g each. 
---
Would do jump runs but can't find a healer, did a lot of 3 man jumps the first week.
---
You just queue from Org, join group, go to RFC, drop group and in a minute you are in Karg even if your HS is on cd.
---
As a fully MC tank this is pretty much what I do on mail and plate enemies that insist on making me PvP them in AV. I will not get blown up by them, I wont blow them up either, but with my shield, defense skills, constant revenge stuns, shield slams ripping buffs off, and me dropping their armor by a few thousand, I can usually wear them down. MS doesnt matter, I wasnt planning on healing anyway; kite me all you want, you better have 5-6k worth of damage in your mana bar; stun away, you better have perditions or be ready to pop consumables. I usually hate PvP, but it does feel nice when you get a few healers, and can literally hold the line because people will insts on fighting on enemy rather than just mount passed that guy.
---
Red tide
---
I probably should not
---
&gt;	So while you are correct in saying a 2.8 weapon with higher top end will always hit harder than a 1.8
---
No. Slower speed does not mean anything unless dps is not close enough.
---
Another no: Higher top end does not mean something will always hit harder. It just means it sometimes hits harder.
---
A third no in the same point: Higher top end does not even mean higher average damage.
---
&gt;	it really just comes down to the top end.
---
No no no. It really doesn‘t. Your 150-1050 damage weapon would be much worse than my 600-700 damage verson, despite the 50% higher top end.
---
You then proceed to repeat this... 3 times?
---
What matters is *average* damage. You can call it swing damage. Or damage range. *just not top end*. That means something else. This is also very relevant when comparing leveling weapon upgrades as a warrior. So *quite* relevant.
---
You beautiful sadistic bastard  mages and druids make me want to go find someone coming up for air and sap + crippling poison them so I can laugh as they choke on water lmao
---
My experiences have been totally different from your's. In the AVs i've been in most players are happy enough to just follow the majority and not think about strategies themselves.  
---
Unfortunately it always goes wrong when several people spam different strategies and people end up all over the place.
---
She can also melee you 
---
She has randomly smacked my mage
---
Stomping pugs as a premade is the entire reason why premades are a thing.
---
You would have to change a fuck ton about the honor/bg/pvp system in order to make such a drastic change.
---
is baron rivendare on live or undead side of stratholme?
---
Cape of the black baron is bis for both rogues and hunters this phase over any epic item. Shrouded mists is a PvP cloak for them.
---
Tanks always needed for dungeons,  some early tanks are going to get dps gear and respec,  if you're good, dedicated and find a chill guild it's possible imo
---
No queue time on alliance side so a quick loss still means good honour followed by another AV immediately.
---
I'm not a fan of it myself but a lot of alliance players spam 'do NOT defend, just rush to Galv and Kill LTs'
---
Warrior's charge can prevent fall damage.
---
Most of the spots he leveled in at are highly populated at this point.
---
Yea still hs
---
Pretty sure they upped the spawn rates by an insane amount so nobody could lock down the dinos
---
Or they could introduce both in classic, where people can just choose either.
---
Wow... Just wow
---
If we don't get to decide that, then he doesn't get to complain for getting kicked.
---
Deserved for not tanking the dungeon yourself
---
Can also just go SM/DS for DME. Don't even need any set pieces. If SM/Ruin? Yeah, pretty hard without better gear. But again, DME is much more a skill check imo.
---
Was gonna say, some high level came back and got his revenge lol.
---
If you have a swing of 3.8. and you have 4/5 imp spam. Making it a 1.1 cast. 
---
So you wait until your swing timer is at 2.7/2.8 and start casting slam. It will finish at the end of your full 3.8 swing timer and apply slam and white hit damage at the same time. 
---
Now slam resets your auto swing. But cause of the macro, cancel attack, the game says your not in an auto attack rotation so it doesn't reset your auto swing timer. As you have told it to stop the auto attacks. 
---
This is only useful in raids. In dungeons its awful as a burst can be anywhere between 3-6k in that second and you will Rip agro and thus can't use slam AS effectively when you got a mob hitting down the cast bar. 
---
1.5k white hit, 1.8k slam, 2k blood thirst.
---
One of the other problems is with the honor system.
---
The sort of people who survived through long queues at launch and then a month of P2 gankfest are the more hardcore players. Casuals took the free server transfer or quit. That means, if you stayed on one of those imbalanced/overpopulated servers, you're ranking against a population of competitive players without a casual base to bolster the numbers.
---
Ex: I got 200k honor last week, at rank 5, and made almost no progress toward R6.
---
Spending Christmas with family - it's great, but I'm a few 100 km away from my PC and some WoW on the side would be great.
---
You play for me too man, and I'll have a beer for you! Enjoy :)
---
Super easy, barely an inconvenience
---
This is very interesting and I learned a lot. Is the goal of death rolls to hit 1 or not?
---
is it normal to run oom as a mage before phase 2 in Onyxia?
---
As someone who played a warrior willing to tank the first time around, and am now trying to gear up a hunter; let's not ass ream the guy over this, he's already picked a fitting punishment for himself in the form of dungeon wait times. That should be plenty.
---
Are the echo isles and Mulgore ones available without the name text anywhere? Really love them but preferably without the text
---
Remove trinket menu and replace it with Itemrack.
---
Open character panel and ALT Click the trinkets to create a button for them. You can bind them in the itemrack settings at the bottom.
---
You can set up itemrack to automatically change to another trinket when the current one is on cooldown.
---
What a nice feeling!   
---
Even its all random \^\^ But congrats and Marry christmas!
---
that is true \~ its a cycle. people who serious focus what is "it" at the moment, now its AV and honor system. soon enough people will max out their rank and the paste of PVP will keep going slower and slower. same what happen at the start of the game .. many people playing  and leveling as fast as they can. and now it's at any normal paste of leveling for most of the people. its a more of a downtime for the PvE content
---
Atiesh is solid. Higher alliance pop, busy at all hours (except maybe the asscrack of the morning)
---
Yes. I think they're also an essential class to naxx trash small group farming. Afaik these are the only important farms that still have yet to come out.
---
you only need 12 points into combat to have sprint break root
---
You just described cannon fodder, not some glorious commander.
---
Yeah, as far as I know, it doesn't work like that and you need to have the person inside the raid for them to be able to loot the leaf/eye/sinew. 
---
This is not supposed to work like DMN tribute.

Or if you’re horde on Nethergarde Keep (EU PvE), send a mail/whisper to Twnk (no i) to join the Indestructible twink guild.
---
I usually run with a healer who can DE, a DPS who can herb, and I mine. We greed anything less than 30g to just sell, anything over 30g we split, and we split all the mining/enchanting/herb stuff 3 ways at the end of our session. If we get more than 0 but less than 3 arcane crystals, I'll pay out 1/3 the current price to the other two guys
---
Mind soothe is actually insanely good and lets you skip a lot of packs. Every 5man pug loves it when I do it.
---
It’s better than nightslayer if you don’t have another source of dagger skill though (DD or ACLG).
---
Finding it hard to settle on a EU PvP server to make an alliance character, stuck between Firemaw + Mograine.
---
Looking for high population with a reasonable faction balance.
---
Had a game earlier today like this. It was long.. a full two hours. Resulted in an alliance win but it was an even 20/20 distraction north and south. People were getting 430+ honorable kills. With rep turn ins and galv, the rep was insane. Took me back to 2006, for sure.
---
I never realized how empty the game felt until I saw this image.  Not enough town npcs that just...exist.  Bloodhoof Village is especially low on roaming npcs.  Most are static.
---
If you get cht and don’t have aclg, then you’ll need muggers belt, you’d do worse dps otherwise
---
Its a sign you should have been Horde all along !!
---
I bet we can't find out ur name! Oh wait...

From the Wowpedia :
---
 The serpentine naga \[...\] They were transformed into naga by the [Old Gods](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Old_Gods), more specifically [N'Zoth](https://wow.gamepedia.com/N%27Zoth), and now haunt the [seas](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Sea) of Azeroth building [a great civilization](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Nazjatar_Empire) on the ocean floor. 
---
More recently naga have begun to reappear around the coasts of the world 
---
 Naga can breathe water or air, and some naga have recently emerged from the ocean's depths. Yet most naga have continued to dwell in the ocean's depths.
---
There is a little difference between a wolf needing to drink water to survive and an entire population building their cities underwater.
---
Looks like someone just trying to complete the durotar croc quest. Nothing abnormal here.
---
Doubt any premades care about winning
---
i dont think I've ever seen so much miss information in a single post.
---
also impressed by how many you said "I've seen other people say..." "according to other people..."
---
so im gonna give you the best tip possible: never talk to those people again. or read anything they say.
---
Flash bombs, rocket boots, any stun grenade, world enlarger, discombobulator for dismounting enemies.  Parachute cloak has its uses.  None of these take up a gear slot.
---
DRUID = You like purple gear and are probably a furry.
---
HUNTER = You like technical gameplay and enjoy ass pulling and making dungeons take longer.
---
MAGE = You want an ez game, ez life and don’t care if everybody thinks your a turd.
---
PALADIN = You like feeling more important than others despite pressing a single button.
---
PRIEST = You like being everybody’s helper bitch and/or being a spooky ghost that murders everybody.
---
ROGUE = You’re a dick. 
---
SHAMAN = Your easily impressionable by PvP compilations that mislead or you like lasers.
---
WARLOCK = You like farming and running errands for people, only for them to never actually use the fkn Healthstone.
---
WARRIOR = Your compensating for something’s small size irl and want people to think you’re tough.
---
I had commented earlier, but exact same deal. Total destruction of all alliance bunkers and horde towers. Managed to have all 3 aerial turn in masters and summon everything including an Ivus vs ice lord skirmish. The rep for these type of matches can sometimes reach 1750 but the downside is that they take  hours to finish
---
Psh, unreal.
---
In oder to hit the gong you need to have completed the quest in order to get the mount?
---
I played in vanilla and I thought it was just the people that caused the event that got the mount.
---
First of all, if you are replying to my whole comment then you don’t need to quote me. 
---
Wow again.. and whats the point? Do locks allow dps to damage without worrying about threat?
---
You're fucking stupid dude. It averages out to being a 50/50.
---
Who would have thought.
---
Organized group of 40 wins over unorganized group of 40. More news at 10.
---
Thank you, reddit
---
Yes, they are hosted in Sydney
---
Hell ya brother. I’m a hunter, you need a.... uh, top dps in group I got you.
---
Yojamba is one of the popular ones, although no rp servers
---
 If my playstyle matched my personality, I should be a hunter.
---
But then, I play games to do those things I can't do irl. Like turning into a bear... and facing my problems head on.
---
Just wait man! Horde have it super easy when it comes to bags and quest. You can lvl from 10-20 in the Barrens alone! No more cross country travelling at low lvl!
---
You too! &lt;3
---
Yea but the issue is since all good players who try to win are in premades only the not well geared and motivated players are left playing in PuGs.
---
In all technicality the entire Undercity is the sewers of Lordaeron Keep above if I recall correctly
---
I play Paladin and warlock, didn't know I hated loosing that bad.
---
At least on my server, focus is also better for the cheaper mats! Libram of Focus is ~40g whereas Libram of Voracity is 100+g!
---
As a fire mage, I don't even have iceblock.
---
I'd be happy if they just capped respec at 5 or 10g.
---
I think there is some worth on creating resistance between being both specs but right now I'm not pvping as fury prot because I love being arms. Would love to respec now and then as arms.
---
Snowballs should be year round in av
---
Looking to start a Horde toon on an EU PvE server, anyone can recommend one?
---
Bit late to the party, but as a paladin, never underestimate how effective strange and unusual spell chains can be. A few examples:
---
"Aura dancing" (weaving aura changes in around your swing timer and cooldowns mid-fight) is completely free other than triggering your global cooldown, and can drastically increase your effectiveness, for example by quickly switching to Concentration Aura to heal yourself and then back to Devotion or Retribution. While it's less common to see in groups, especially if you have multiple paladins, it's shockingly effective in PvP and solo PvE, and can significantly improve your ability to handle encounters alone. Even bad aura dancing can be useful, and a skillful dancer can weave their aura changes into their rotation without ever creating so much as half a second of extra downtime. 
---
"Seal twisting" (switching seals right as you hit so that both effects happen) is extremely mana intensive and somewhat tricky to pull off, but can really save your bacon if used effectively. A great example is combining Seal of Justice with Seal of Command - if you time it correctly, you can switch at just the right moment and get both to go off, leaving your opponent stunned, beaten, and in perfect position for an even more painful double-damage Judgment of Command thanks to the stun from Seal of Justice. Done properly, and with good luck for both to proc on the same hit, this can lead to a burst of nearly 4x your normal hit damage. There are a ton of other applications that I'm not skilled enough or knowledgeable enough to comment on, it's a really crazy technique.
---
Finally (and this goes for every class, despite the paladin-centric examples), I'd just like to say that you should never discount any spell in your toolkit, even if it seems useless. Seal of Justice seems super situational and kind of bad, but it combos perfectly with Judgement of Command's bonus damage to stunned enemies, and can be super helpful in managing those annoying runners when trying not to attract everything in a half-mile radius. Seal/Judgement of Light and of Wisdom seem silly at first, but can make a huge difference in your sustainability in longer fights, and can even benefit your allies when playing in a group. Turn Undead and Exorcism may have target type restrictions, but when you get the chance to use them, they become monstrously effective. The list goes on. You have every ability you have for a reason - don't throw any of them in the trash, because you never know when you might suddenly realize you wish you had them ready.
---
Rouge is 100% correct. Undead rouge on a pvp realm
---
So you are both "afk" great job buddy
---
Can you re-edit and make it just the Twochoppas kill over and over again for an hour?  Thanks.
---
Ended 1st anyway.
---
RPPvP server?
---
I miss phase 2. Menthol harbour was the greatest PvP area of all. Town, wharf, ocean, boats, always active action, water walking, hydrocanes, azure silk belts, all came into play.
---
Ghost town now
---
All I see is two dudes in a cave
---
Arugal was one of the last servers to go to one layer (meaning biggest) out of all US / EU / OCE servers.
---
Very active player base and many hardcore and casual guilds on both sides. Larger amount of horde but world roaming and PvP feels good at the moment as Alliance.
---
Would reccomend.
---
Well, if you queue it before the MH hits, it will just get consumed by the MH hit. The idea is that you want HS queued while OH hits, and the only way to do that us Queue -&gt; OH hits -&gt; Cancel

End game is 99% of the game. I have 2x played at60ll 60 than levelling and we're still in MC. Going to have a lot more played when I'm doing more raids a week.
---
Macros use their own syntax which is essentially a list of commands to run in the game console in order. Anything you can do in a macro, you can do by typing the same command in chat. However, the `/run` or `/script` command allows you to write semi-arbitrary Lua code to be run using the game's API. It's really unwieldy to use, though, so for anything complicated you'll probably want to make an addon, since they don't have the 255 character limit that macros do and don't have to be condensed into one line.

I never understood tanking. You know, I know warriors very well. They're noisy. They kill the mobs. You want to see a mob graveyard? Look under a warrior some day. You'll see more mobs than you've ever seen in your life.
---
That is a bit outdated vision. Warriors might have been restricted to tank in early Vanilla. But current classic patch they are top DPS in raids. A tank and DPS warrior should roll on their main spec lot and coexist fine in groups. I mean, DPS warriors are more in competition with rogues really on the loot table pre-raid.

I mean that's wrong, Horde can solo pull Vann using the prospector

He made himself a target when he posted that video in the Fairbanks realm forum of him camping level 30s as a 60.

By the very top % of guilds yeah. Most fell apart before or during naxx
---
Shitty trick for rogues, always keep a copy of each boxes that you can unlock with shitty loot inside, when someone ask you to open boxes for them, look what's inside, if it's something good keep it and give them the one with shitty loot.
---
Keep up the good work, fellow brother!

Instant attacks on demand are really bloody useful. I'll even sunder the shit out of clothies to keep their cast bar resetting

Now this is how wow 2 must look like!
---
It's normal because alliance players have stratified. First, there were a high amount of "elitist" players pugging. Everything was fine. Then the "elitists" got exalted and stopped queueing AV entirely. That left the serious ranker people and everyone else. The serious ranker people need to optimize the crap out of their honor per hour, so they formed discord premades. Now the only people left in there are the general population, and people who're trying to be serious pvp-mates but can't get into a discord for whatever reason.
---
This doesn't happen to horde, because horde can't premade, so they're forced to mix in rankers and gen-pop.
---
Haha I'm glad man :D hope you have a good Christmas!
---
How does it Work?
---
From my childhood :D
---
Merry bloody christmas to you as well, bet youre fun at parties.
---
The sad thing about all of this is that both horde and alliance are capable rushing and winning the game within 8min. None of this is necessary, it could just be a DPS race. Some horde certainly do that, the russians are well aware, for example
---
WOW is an rpg, there's a pretty clear rp in there
---
Mograine Bis
---
Various sources, mainly youtube or I use Shadowplay to record
---
Well, you can do the same as fury, with the added benefit of dealing more damage as a raid dps.
---
Best comment EVER!
---
It's advanced trolling.
---
Baffling people is the point.
---
There’s STILL queues??! Wow. I’ve never had a sub so joining a guild for the first time is gonna be so cool. ty for the info
---
Mirage Raceway is a decent EU server, nice faction balance and active community. 
---
I also GM a casual/social Horde levelling guild, so hit me up if you decide to roll a toon there.
---
Heres a link to a reddit post the collected all the In-game books into a single document. They might have some lore you're interested in:
---
 https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/azo0t3/wow_vanilla_all_50_ingame_lore_books_printable/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Are you not gonna provide any context? Gear? Buffs? Debuffs? Consumables?
---
Usually they don’t survive long enough. It’s a race to kill boss before he kills the LTs and subsequently your entire raid like a slaughterhouse
---
Come to Azuresong, we have cookies =)
---
I’ve simmed many different setups, keeping in mind 6pc SC. There is no combination for the 2 non-SC pieces that is better than muggers + whatever else, if you don’t use dd or have aclg
---
The arugal queues are only on like weekend evenings and are very short but they are there still.
---
This is useless without having a comparison with another dps
---
I don't want anyone that wears fingerless gloves going anywhere near my heart for surgery.
---
Additionally you get more crusaider procs with a fast oh, which is quite nice too
---
No.  Just use auto attacks and go all in when Phase 2 starts.
---
I sent you a PM
---
Binding toggle autorun to middle mouse button is pretty convenient and also allows you to bind move forward button to something else.
---
You can get other blacksmiths to install them for you. I'm an armorsmith on my main, but sadly, I can't drop that since i'm the only fire resist crafter in my guild.
---
There are no queues for Arugal at the moment, might change when BWL goes live, but even then only on Wednesday at prime time. All 3 pvp servers favour horde, felstriker is by far the lowest pop, would choose from the other two if your new or Remulos if u want pve.
---
To make any meaningful statements about DPS we have to simplify. 
---
* LB spam vs. a level 63 boss without nature resistance
---
* Mana Spring is always up
---
* Typical 30/0/21 spec
---
* Full pre-raid BiS
---
* Reasonable raid consumables (no flasks, Onyxia, Warchief buffs)
---
* Full Mana Potion, Dark Rune rotation
---
The Y axis should be multiplied by 10 for remaining mana. At this time there seems to be no way to avoid a DPS dropoff 100 seconds into the fight. Flasks prolong the fight a little but not enough to solve this issue.
---
What would this plot look like for your class?
---
And to extend a bit further, top end is only really interesting for pvp when occasional bursts of damage might be what breaks through healing, so you might find that lower average damage is a worthwhile trade-off for higher top end damage. But for pve, it's all about the average damage.
---
Just dont tap to 1%, i heal locks if i have spare mana/cast time, ifnot i let them sitt low and take care of themselves.
---
Idk if I would concider frost nova, blinking away and iceblocking when people get too close «fearless»
---
I think people use boomer in two ways. The first way, it literally means baby boomer, in the other way which is sometimes used online, it means someone who is around 30.
---
which 3 bosses? shazz'rah and geddon and sthg else?
---
Tanking as warrior, esp. as dps warrior is amazing though!   
---
infinite rage, high damage and fast pulls, nothing you couldn't like about tanking yourself as warrior!   
---
I started tanking strat with 2hander at 58 btw, yeah need a weaponswap macro for tough pulls but well, it's really fun nontheless.
---
It’s a reference to the OSRS sub lol just look at the minimap
---
Tried BGs yet? Esp wsg. I feel like I'm a frost mage with no ice block. Admittedly ice blocking ridiculous shaman burst happens in the first 30 secs of a game it feels. 
---
But overall, in wsg I feel like ice block hardly up
---
"Why is my DPS in MC really low?"
---
Good to see someone with absolutely no clue how things work is looking for an excuse to complain.
---
Physical activity promotes serotonin and dopamine levels, seeing results from hard work promotes self esteem.  
---
Being able to flex some muscles in the mirror sure helps my self esteem in the morning, even though I know it's monkey brain  behaviour.  
---
it's not rocket science. You can add in some pseudo psychology in there like pushing your bondaries and having  structure in your life(people who work out daily have better grades than people who do not, but that's pretty much just correlation).  
---
Being fit is far healthier and prevents health problems later on, being able to use your body as a tool sure as hell helps in every day life  
---
You have nothing to lose other then time, and even then it's a negligible amount of time if you structure correctly, work out before/after work. a full body program costs you about 8 hours a week, including shower time.  
---
Sounds like you went in there for dem sick gains on a pure aesthetical view and then figured out how retarded that idea was, congratulations on your confirmation bias.
---
I remember seeing your Westfall one and thinking it was cool then I seen this one and thought he’s done it again! Very nice! Then I clicked on your username and seen you’ve done lots of these and they’re all absolutely fucking brilliant. In awe at all of them
---
And then suddenly all your MTs wanna roll fury tank and loot all the weapons in raids :)   
---
Better be a tank and switch later :D
---
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you someone who doesn't rebind keyboard turns.

Doubt it, I still get 1-3 from low level herbs in starting zones

Private servers don't use the same language algorithms.

Miners make more with a single arcane crystal.

Focus for PvE (+8 spell damage / healing) and Constitution for PvP (100 health).
---
Is trump on reddit now
---
Can be a bit of luck depending on what items the bosses drop. If you get lucky and get the dagger + plate chest from the last boss that’s 2g 75s, nearly 15g if you get that for 5 runs not including anything else. You can also get quite unlucky and just get helm 5 times from the last boss which is only 2g 50s. Perhaps I should have been more clear in the video about the potential low ends, you appear to have gotten pretty unlucky however if you got 17g total for 10 runs.
---
Slight correction on the paladin, we like feeling more important than others despite mindlessly pressing two buttons in a 10-second rhythm.
---
I love the tauren. By far my favourite race. Unfortunately I play alliance, so I have to play as a racist jerk instead, which is fun as well I guess.
---
So i really want to play a paladin in classic, cause I never played one in classic. I also like dwarves starting zone, are dwarf paladins good?
---
Enjoy your time off, Merry Christmas 😀
---
Please follow this enh shamans. I rather see you interrupting a spell every 6 seconds instead of being oom 100% of the time using SS and max rank shocks

Q is Eviscerate, and E is Kidney Shot. Really hard to spam those :(.

On my shadow priest it used to be that my shadow wand refreshed shadow weaving debuff timer but now it doesn't seem to do it anymore.
---
Was this an unannounced nerf?
---
They should have just put best ranged dps in the game.  I love getting chain lightning/ES crit for 3k+ every 3 min
---
Doesn't really work when your raid leader has an addon to highlight specific buffs and will call people out and tell them to drink potion now.
---
This is absolutely amazing! This is brilliant!
---
Any plans for Stormwind? Perhaps with a guard or two. :3
---
shaman dies super fast. Zero defensive cooldown and no mobility. Warrior already truck a resto shaman fast, enh just gets blown up in premades.
---
Death Stranding
---
I'm triggered that the bars are not in the center
---
&gt; Literally every player in the game would appreciate having one of these necklaces.
---
Sadly it shares a cooldown with mana gems, so it's not much use to mages.
---
not exactly as mages are often on decursing duty on 3 bosses deflating their overall DPS but quite a bit.
---

This is exactly what I'm doing, unless I'm running aoe farm groups or I am under leveled for the instance. Then I use a shield and spam sunder/revenge to try and hold mobs under the aoe. There will be a point where I cant hold threat any longer. Then I switch to my 2h, pop a rage pot and start sweeping strikes and cleaving to finish the mobs off. Lvl 35 atm.
---
Word my gender pronouns of your choice. My sibling of another parent or guardian, our respective upbringings may have cultural dissimilarities, do you understand what I am saying?

Purge is such an under rated skill. On my shaman i have it bound to z and always try to spam it.
---
&gt;the website either has instructions 
---
On Windows you can just hit "download".
---
&gt;It literally can't get easier, no visiting websites or searching google for download links like you're required to do on Windows.
---
It's faster to type in the application name and hit download. Plus you don't have to worry about if it's added to the repo or not, it just works. Download and go.
---
In this case it's the group's decision. Fuck one dude over to avoid having to wait any longer for a tank. It's still shitty, but somehow less shitty than one dude imposing his will on the group, or I should say coercing the rest of the group.
---
I would love to see a landscape of Black Temple + Illidan wallpaper

Nope pvp, I’ve off the bigger guilds was doing a present giveaway, greens blues n purples!
---
We don't know about trading in zg and aq20, which are full of rare items, but also ubrs is a raid full of rares that aren't tradable. I'm curious what rare equipment drops in MC/Ony atm that is bop. I can't recall any, but that doesn't mean they don't exist.

On my server there’s plenty of those runs, “angerforge spam/runs”

Yo &lt;3

That's enough out of you retard

Goodbye
---
"expected dmg per cast time" wtf is this? also your math is WRONG. you are losing 1.5s that you could've been casting more than half of a shadow bolt, so the "expected dmg" for the shadow bolt you didn't started casting surpasses the shadow burn.
---
Mograine seems to be the most chill and fun server on EU.
---
Im playing hotw, and think its really fun. Its good in pvp and solo content, and also works fine in raids. Played moonglow in my first months of raiding, but its much lower DPS solo and not as fun in pvp in my experience. You can do more with HOTW. Havent tried regrowth build yet, but its the best for getting good parses in pve, but also requires alot of consumables compared to moonglow.
---
Whatever laptop you buy your brother, make sure to get a cooling pad with it as heat is a major issue when it comes to gaming laptops.

Don't worry if you don't get, it's not funny.

Hot take, does this make you an afker aswell?
---
There is something I missed about UW that makes it ppm?

Because even if it's not a lot, is still more rage with more hits.
---
Hey that's great advice for marking. I'm going to try that.
---
No
---
For what? Maybe firemaw but I don't remember anywhere else that would benefit.
---
I got it, but had to double check from the comments if it was as funny as I thought.
---
We ran uldaman last night. There was some ally standing by the summoning stone then also at the entrance. We had to kill you guys to get in, was that you? I was the lock.
---
Bahaha saw you walkin around at midnight boyz, merry christmas
---
A shadow priest can do every farm a lock can+ solo DM Tribute pretty much at the same speed as a hunter.
---
Someone is having a very ‘Merry’ Christmas, a pint of what he is drinking please landlord!
---
only worth doing if you are fighting and resing at the cave constantly
---
Do you use AH addon?
---
Hey, cool vid, what's the add-on that makes your buttons and enemy frame border darker?
---
Then you have to upload the image elsewhere though
---
yes. they are on the oceanic tab.
---
1 pve and 3 pvp.
---
Depends on the server. Some ah bots will always steal those good deals from you. I've done similar though. I bought stacks of engineering components for copper and sold them piece by piece for over a gold each.
---
Pure Angerforge runs are rare. A usual setup is "Arena/Anger/Golem", where you also do the Arena (for the Gladiator chest), Angerforge (for HoJ) and the Golemlord (for healer gear). 
---
If you are a rogue, you can also solo Angerforge, I tried it myself, it's super tedious though.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2pLuST9mcA
---
sure is the classic community in here, dozens of comments blaming you for scummy shit happening to you. happy holidays nerds
---
It's more efficient for the lock to tap and get healed.
---
It's less efficient if it means I empty my mana bar and need to sit for 30 seconds between pulls, while the tank and crew run on ahead and engage the next pack while I'm halfway through drinking, and well out of range, which puts me in a position where the tank is half dead by the time I get there, forcing me to use holy light and dump mana like no tomorrow. Rinse and repeat.
---
Intercept also works for this.
---
Get punted on rag? Hit intercept and you’re back in the game.
---
Winning vs losing is a difference of 2 handins, so ~260 honor.
---
This is already a thing on most servers. Definitely works but you missed phase 2 which woulda made you rich.
---
Hit is fantastic for threat and tbh that is the primary reason to have a feral tank.
---
I sit at about 5% and do just fine. It’s a lower priority for me cause there isn’t really a fight currently where it’s a real issue. Come bwl I’ll be defiantly bumping to 9% 
---
With the stats you have above you should be fine.
---
Shadowmeld = Pause button for non-stealth classes.
---
it doesn't charge you for HS/Cleave until your next attack though, does it?
---
Sell your tank services to pugs
---
Consider your life well spent! Now I know I can make moon cloth in SW and stop making trips to places like darn and dark shore every 4 days
---
Yeah retail has better graphics, but while fighting you can't see anything because of the cluster fuck of aoe spells haha
---
Assuming a warrior tank doesn't want dps loot
---
Rebuilds the game on new client. Keeps *all* the old graphics.
---
When people question if a class is viable they don't mean "can you clear the content with this class". You can clear all of the content in vanilla with 39 people. 
---
In classic viable means being able to pull your weight.
---
It's called base damage and perhaps I didn't write it out very well but I wasnt talking about average damage just purely which would have the harder hit. Ie my 150-1050 weapon will always hold the record for hardest mortal strike over your 600-700 damage weapon.
---
Got any link to said premades?
---
I am editing the file located in the WTF folder, World of Warcraft/\_classic\_/WTF/Config.wtf. Is there another config file?

People shouldnt be questing and leveling completely unimpeded. Casual skirmishes over resources if PvE server stuff
---
Fuck yeah man, am a hunter, if you need me to daze every single living being with aspect of the pack I got you.

Honestly shut the fuck up about Bitcoin.
---
During my dungeon-gearing phase refusing to group with non-guild dps-warriors was less about loot competition and more about:  
---
A) every warrior should be able and willing to tank if needed. Our guild dps warriors usually got no issues with that either.  
---
B) Pug DPS warriors are the worst spec to tank for. They charge in, whirlwind and take away all your rage and then the healer ooms or something runs and you have to pick up the pieces. You can't even do proper LoS pulls because they overwrite your battle shout and even if they didn't, they'd probably charge in and/or whirlwind the pull anyways. They are literally just shitty mages but at least mages either step up and succeed at kiting or have the decency to die if they're bad.
---
Can confirm jump runs are a very good money maker. I do it as a lock with my guild's main tank. You can still do it if you are not fully geared it just takes a lot longer.
---
I would say so yes
---
&gt; switching to battle stance and charging, then switching to defensive stance
---
Not every warrior has tactical mastery.
---
Find a lock that is not quite geared enough to do the jump run solo and duo it.
---
Love this screen..managed to get the tree?

Ty I’ll check it out, might have a friend there

It is shit, try not to give lead and ask peoples names to inv in future.

Is it possible to do instances while leveling? My main concern

What about S!

Thanks for the counterspell info I'll have to feed my felhunter some shadowpriests :)

Funny story: When I was doing this quest I joined a group with 2 other players and we were looking for two more to fill the group.
---
And suddenly they actually invited a characer named "Barov". 
---
Of course I immediately berated them for not properly reading the quest text and explained that we were supposed to reduce the number of remaining Barovs by one - not somehow find a third friggin Barov.
---
Talk about failing a quest in the worst way possible :)
---
Dps race is like 90% in ally favour.
---
It sucks but it's part of classic. Just like everything else that gets fixed in future expansions.
---
PvP is not my main concern but I’ll keep it in mind
---
dwarf and daggers baby
---
i haven't tried, but i don't think you can tank endgame dungeons with fury spec and leather gear.
---
You can say the same for spriests dispelling on lucifron, shazzrah(he applies a buff on himself for 50% magic damage reduction that the spriest usually dispels) and Geddon
---
Thanks, the picture is proof of what I was saying. Thank you for finally understanding how wrong you were!
---
Burn it....
---
BURN IT!
---
But seriously, this is fantastic!
---
Thats... Alliance?
---
For rogues (mainly combat swords):
---
Sword of zeal + mirah is the best preraid sword combo unless you have BOTH rend swords or teebu and often costs less than krol.
---
Try to stack all your cds on top of crusader procs in raid bossfights, unless the fight is long enough to use cds twice you can be pretty patient with this. 1 cp snd -&gt; 5 cp snd -&gt; energy pooling until proc or nearing max energy seems to often give me the opportunity to stack the cds on procs. If you get a double proc at the energy pooling stage you have a very good chance of getting #1 on the meters. This of course only really works in fights with no mechanics (garr, golemagg). If you time it well you can also manage to squish in a thistle tea without much loss even when adrenaline rush is up.
---
Distract patrols if you're already in a fight (dungeons).
---
Instant poison doesn't work on Garr and Rag so you should use sharpening stones instead.
---
The 1% haste enchant for legs and head is equivalent to agi in pve but only costs 10%. The 1% haste enchant to hands is bis.
---
Pickpocketing BRD might not net you what is promised in some vids, but if you do it efficiently enough you can get an average of 45-50g per hour (my own stats). Respeccing, enchanting boots and going naked (aside from cheap enchanted boots) with empty bags allows you to risk deaths and go longer without selling. The best route I've found is swolebenjis.
---
You can solo angerforge for HoJ. Do it before they change it so it drops from emperor.
---
Level ranged weapon skill by going to one of the boarguys camps in durotar (for horde). If you kill them continuously they respawn fast enough that you never run out of mobs in range of your weapon. Works with many different mobs to froce faster respawns but I used these specifically.
---
Gotta go for now, hope any of this helped.
---
Mmmmm Drain Life, give me that sexy souls shard
---
Fuck everyone telling you how to play. If you rolled dps warrior because that's what you enjoy then you do it. Never let someone tell you how to play YOUR character.
---
Downvote me all you want, but this isn't Skyrim and we are not modding the graphics. I do too know what I am talking about.
---
No, it's horde side chat.
---
I believe the raid leader of method is a mage.
---
Have you tried downranking lightning bolt in the oom period and spitting out max rank for clearcast?
---
This is classic though and the elitist trolls won't allow a shaman in their raids unless they are resto.
---
Yep, still will do much less damage so irrelevant here.
---
&gt; allow your offhand's hit chance to match your main hit chance, which is much higher.
---
Slight correction: as soon as you start dual wielding, your miss chance increases from 9% to something like 26%, for auto attacks from *both* the main hand and the off hand.
---
Your special ability hit cap stays at 9% while DW. For some reason while HS/Cleave is queued up, your auto attack hit chance matches your special ability hit chance.
---
Yep horde seems to win 70-80% of games.only lose to those damn premades when they gather like 30+ppl from same server
---
Atleast he's got chicken
---
Fuck off idiot, everyone IS free to do whatever they want. Stop trying to impose your vision of things.
---
9500 dps for patchwork is that all that’s needed?  30 dps doing at least 317 dps each?  Most of our raids in some MC gear does over 300 dps by the time people are in bwl and aq gear everyone will be over that no problem why wouldn’t someone bring a Ret boomer and feral dps or shadow priest
---
You took elements from it and went to an absurd extreme likening content from 12 years from now to be in any way relevant to now.
---
R14 gear literally becomes obsolete in phase 5 and is essentially the same as bwl gear in terms of stats and unless you’re min/maxing to (cringe) parse in classic wow, it’s objectively a waste of time and effort. I’m sorry that hurts your feelings.
---
Shaman: "strong melee". Okay then.
---
They should be penalised with small cd when leaving queue
---
I never thought it is being dick. I just never assumed anyone think that I will roll defense items only. I tank because other’s don’t do that and I want to finish instances. I also try to eliminate competition if something bis drops from that dungeon, I mean I won’t invite a dps warrior as warrior tank, so usually no problem with the loots.
---
I'm going to guess there are 3 levels of explanation to this problem:
---
Newtonian: "it's 50/50"
---
Einstein's theory of Deathroll: "the full explanation requires an advanced degree and only matters if you're Deathrolling on a cosmological scale, so let's just call it 50/50"
---
Common sense: "If someone tells you to put a gun to your head and pull the trigger, the correct reply is 'you first.'"
---
I can send you our guild's values after I get home from work if you want
---
Sometimes i have the feeling i am the only one healing as lvl53 ret pala while there are always about 5 lvl60 retpalas that refuse to heal even once. It's infuriating.
---
Thanks for the feedback :D I'll keep that in mind for the next one :)
---
Seems like novice trolling is more about being a douche than a trolling.
---
ok boomer
---
Well theoretically you could have them both be in the same instance (with another person being in your group to invite them). Thus your warlock could solo the dungeon then your rogue comes in and picks it clean.
---
Tldr
---
This. 
---
This is how I got my epic mount on my paladin.
---
We had this all through vanilla. I can't tell you how good it was just paying 1G and getting summoned to Duke Hydraxis after every MC raid for quintessence.
---
It's also a card game called Suicide.   [https://www.pagat.com/invented/suicide.html](https://www.pagat.com/invented/suicide.html)
---
The way my guild/friends play - I have to get drunk after every run- 
---
Sincerely,
---
Resto druid
---
Can you solo the small adds after? 
---
Thinking of doing this for that damn Milking Quest :D
---
Hots don't stack so you usually only want one resto druid in a raid since their non-HoT spells are pretty inefficient compared to alternatives. Thus you will fill the remainder of your healers with priests, paladins, or shamans.
---
Ah okay.  Thank you!  On my server, I kept seeing them roam around but there were also no one farming them so I couldn't feel the change.
---
It appears they nerfed it yah, but I still get 1-2 gold worth of trash and a green or blue maybe 1 in 5 runs.  Lasher root and serrated petal are like 60-70s silver each from vendor.
---
Please stop spreading wrong information. For good dps it is quintessential that you use bloodthirst every 6 seconds and stack big cds for execute phase.. In both scenarios heroic strike is super low priority, even with the "queueing trick" you should only ever use it you are in danger of capping in rage.
---
Hunter has a few advantages:
---
* Fast leveling
---
* DM Tribute runs provides both gold &amp; pre-raid gear
---
* Very easy to gear up with T1 &amp; Rhok
---
* T1 actually outperforms T2 if another Hunter in your group has T2, so coming in late actually benefits you.

Cool macro's. Im still very novice with coding them, but think I now understand the way spells are chosen seeing @mouseover inside seperate brackets. I knew the contidions are AND-ed and seperate brackets are OR-ed, but I havent really tried to set @mouseover and @target in different brackets.
---
Theres this warrior macro I have that switches stance or casts charge. But I noticed it casting charge without a target selected:
---
    /cast [noform:1] Battle Stance; Charge
---
I want to be able to spam it in PvP, but in dungeons I have carelessly charged random mobs when I didnt had a target. Does someone have a better solution than what Im coming up with now?
---
    /cast [noform:1] Battle Stance; [@target,harm][@mouseover,harm] Charge
---
I did not, but let's consider two cases. Case 1 is where we spam rank 1 LB (which is possible to sustain indefinitely with our passive regen) for about 50 damage. Every 10th global cooldown we get a proc and cast CL and do ~ 800 damage. That's (9*50dmg + 800dmg)/15s  = 83 DPS.
---
If we don't cast at all with the 229 spirit I've calculated with, we get about double the mana regen we would normally get at 27 MPS rather than 15 MPS. During those 15 seconds we could have regenerated an additional 180 mana which is good for a rank 8 lightning bolt for 586 damage or 39 DPS. 
---
That means spamming rank 1 LB is roughly 45 DPS better than idling. Should raise average DPS by a little so I might add that to my sheet!
---
Just kill the boss in less than 100seconds. Easy.
---
&gt; It's almost just as fast to type in the application name in a browser, enter, and hit download
---
No, it's really not.
---
&gt; Don't have to worry about drivers, don't have to worry about any configuration or display settings, don't have to worry about GPU support, nothing. It just works. And it looks good.
---
You've clearly never tried to install anything other than AAA games. I'll let you continue to think you know what you're talking about though, buddy.
---
With 400 spell damage, an average Shadow Bolt does 823 (481 + 0.857 \* 400).  It takes 2.5 seconds to cast that.  So, it does an expected 330 damage per second of cast time, or 494 damage over the 1.5 seconds it would take to cast Shadowburn.  Shadowburn, with the same spell damage) would do 659 damage (488 + 0.429 \* 400) during that 1.5 seconds, around 30% more.  It gets a bit less with ISB and crit, but even with those Shadowburn does more dps than Shadow Bolt for attainable gear.
---
I’ve been using the term “expected damage per cast time” to most talk about DoTs, so it’s not really neceesary here.  Corruption deals ~111 (without spell power) every 3 seconds for 18 seconds (for a total of 666 damage).  “DPS from corruption” can be ambiguous because the spell itself only does 37 dps, but you are doing a total of 666 damage with 1.5 sec of cast time, so your “expected damage per cast time” is 444 (again ignoring spell power).  Since Shadowburn and Shadow Bolt deal direct damage, that ambiguity doesn’t really exist, but that’s why I’ve been trying to use the term.
---
You have mean friends
---
Yes, if you have full hp/mana and some cds it should be doable. As I was farming the boots I found it more efficient to just die and reset the dungeon as I was running back (in ghost), then go again. The loot would pay my repair bill anyway ;)
---
I would say no. Leveling a class to 60 is a large time investment for most players. You are better off playing a class which you can see yourself enjoying all 3 specs.
---
I have 230 sp and i easily do rotgrip. I even did him without problem below 200sp. So 325 is a but over the edge
---
Oeb because you can stack more damage rather than hit
---
Priests have a variety of heals as well as the highest potential single target healing. PoH is a massive group heal as well although not always really necessary. It’s just their toolkit is so diverse that you can excel at any type of fight.
---
And where is the gameplay? Ill just see some critluck.
---
Priests don't run out of Mana as quickly as druids do in raids, on top of that druids hots don't stack so if you cast regrowth on a tank that has regrowth already on it, your Mana effeciency goes down by a land slide. Also your heals get sniped by priests because they can get flash heal off faster than you can get healing touch off.
---
Ubrs follows the rules of lbrs
---
For mana, I am assuming using a rune and a mana pot, which puts you around the 7200 mana you’d need for that fight, but I get that it is tight, I just wasn’t sure exactly how tight.
---
Please make 144p video with Drowning Pool in the background instead
---
Came out just after Cats launch.
---
Gotta wing clip those birds so they don’t hit your whirlwind.  VERY EXPENSIVE!
---
Yes.  Because its a 30 second CD on those snowballs and it takes several to knock them back far enough.  You're not contributing to the actual match, effectively an AFKer.
---
You unfortunately cannot transfer from pve to pvp servers specifically because of how easy it is to level on pve servers
---
Same dps, but SP is more bursty. But look at damage output of SP 600 vs 1100 mage does. SP just dries out of mana quickly in fights that last more than a 2 minutes.
---
I never get mad when this happens.
---
All this is confirmed?
---
You can transfer from PvP to a PvE but not the other way around.
---
I agree, but also, what have you done? Do you know the level of wrath you’ve unleashed upon yourself? Good luck, friend.
---
He was in a group that was looking for a tank for half an hour.   
---
In fact the 3 DPS were looking for a group to begin with.
---
If I join a group and I see a warrior, I establish what I need and if the warrior needs the same plate and mail items, either I'm out or he is. 
---
I have to expect the warrior to be a lazybum or a noob, because he refuses to tank himself.
---
I’d rather want a Paladin healing me 100% of the time.
---
It’s gorgeous.
---
Because it takes several snowballs with 30s CD to knock someone out.  Effectively, the person doing this is not contributing to the match either.  They are an AFKer in a sense.
---
Lol thanks.
---
yes
---
Selleneos is a notorious cyberbully, please downvote this trash.
---
It will keep happening, because warrior are *the* most disposable class in 5men dungeons. You have warriors and rogues who make up 35% of most server's populations. 
---
If you have a warrior in your group, you can kick him and find 10 rogues wanting his spot. 
---
DPS warriors in 5men dungeons are nuisance to the tank, if they roll on gear that not wearable by a rogue, but by a tank.
---
This was why I didnt play a healer this run around. Healers need arguably the most consumes, but have the hardest time farming gold
---
Poetry is, indeed, a form of art.
---
Hots don't stack and at the high end tanks have so many buffs that they don't want hots for fear of reaching the buff cap and knocking off a different buff. Spamming healing touch is really all Druids do.
---
Druids are great! But they are arguably the worst healers in the game. Priests aren't nessacerly the best though, a lot of people feel Paladins are. As someone who rerolled from shaman to paladin, I think priests and Paladins are tied. All healers are great though and each have their strengths.
---
Priests: most unique heals and situational abilities of any healer. 
---
Paladin: best mana effientcy by a large margin, most survivable.
---
Shaman: weakest raw healing but brings best buffs and chain heal is a very powerful spells.
---
Druid: innervate and battle Rez are worth having on their own. Hots make great raid healing when there is consistent raid damage happening.
---
Well, hunters pretty much shit on everything in the 19 bracket so... make two.
---
You can transfer if you’re on the same server via the neutral AH :)
---
Oh, you definetly can play Fury and still tank dungeons, Arms is just awesome because you have SS pretty much.
---
That skill's fun as hell *and* crazy effective at keeping AoE threat
---
&gt;As a tank you have free reign of groups so why take a group
---
What?  Says who?  People with that mentality are part of the problem.
---
I have a pretty good one. check this out
---
     #showtooltip
---
     /use [mod:shift] Cleave; [mod:alt,stance:2] Taunt; [stance:2][combat] Heroic Strike;
---
     /use [stance:1] Charge
---
     /use [combat, harm] Bloodrage
---
     /use [mod:ctrl,stance:1] Defensive Stance
---
     /use [mod:ctrl,nostance:1] Battle Stance
---
what will happen is, by default this will be charge. once you charge in, it switches to heroic strike. Bloodrage will auto cast on the first heroic strike because you're not in combat when you charge. This stops you from using bloodrage before you're in range to charge Using shift will cast cleave. Holding control will stance dance you between Battle and Defensive stance. Holding Alt in defensive stance lets you Taunt
---
Good riddance that there leaving. The server ain't dying, people said the same shit when ppl left to heartseeker...
---
Don't change anything, just pickup a shield and sunder armor. I believe in you!
---
Then I haven't done my job right.
---
By what people in this thread think of you, to hell?
---
Read a post about how the ranking system works.  Your first point may be true but your edit does nothing to bolster it.  If you’re on a high pop server 200k is literally nothing.  I, a true casual, got 80k the first night of AV between work and bed.  And several guildies with jobs got 500k week 1.   There are definitely no lifers out there who got a million+.  And you have to be ranked against them.
---
I know this is fake because nobody would pick Uldaman as their favorite dungeon
---
So my friends and I just don't use tanks anymore for dungeons. I just heal the dps through it.
---
And realistically a warrior tank without a 2nd warrior in group can roll on:
---
\- PvP plate gear
---
\- DPS fury gear (including leather and mail)
---
\- DPS plate gear
---
\- resistance gear
---
\- tank gear
---
\- shields
---
\- the odd 2hander that he "needs" for PvP
---
There really is no reason to have a warrior in your group contesting your loot if the rogue only can contest your 1handers and leather fury DPS gear
---
I'm not a fan of such questions. It's a silly fun quiz I get that, but there you're not really testing a players knowledge of the subject. 
---
Additionally those of us with reading difficulties or dylexia are basically boned on that.
---
Prove?
---
Check out this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccxosl/dives_drain_tanking_guide_for_warlock_leveling_in/
---
Love it ! Should have used slow fall and then reindeer's at the end :D
---
Until zg releases*
---
S. Priests probably can’t solo it until BWL, but once they get some more gear it’s game on.
---
I figured that was only for items??
---
Then again 99% of dungeon tanks are just raid fury DPS in disguise. And these 99% will roll on DPS gear even though they are tanking for the group.
---
 A *real* hunter, ladies and gentleman.
---
Yeah, with bad rune and mana potion procs you'll be forced into life tapping, which is a massive loss of dps.
---
Haha just checked his ui is so gross
---
wow the locks on my server charge thrice that amount
---
I prefer the dot dot fear method personally. Or you could just dot them up and wand. But yeah, once you're high enough, siphon life, drain life, keep the voidwalker out, heal him if you need to, dots, fear, etc.
---
Yep, I'm certainly overgeared by now, but everytime I tank for somebody I'm around 800-1200DPS with my trusted BRE and MS or 2h fury spec. 
---
Warrior tanking is superior to bear tanking for me personally, because you can come back with brutal gear later on for gold, carrying fresh 60s etc and basically tear the dungeon apart with only your resto shaman healer while having 3 DPS tagged onto you. 
---
I can clear most dungeon 2men by now with my buddy.
---
Oh interesting I did not know that. Closing this garbage post ASAP.
---
Does it happen to you too that after being at full energy for a while it's inaccurate? Happens to me all the time in cat forn
---
"so anyways, i starte pewpew'ing"
---
I didn't mention queue time once in my post, you comment is totaly irrelevant , who hurt you ?
---
Ok so what’s the macro your the 3 person I’ve seen talk about this heroic strike cancel trick.
---
/start autoattack
---
/cast Heroic Strike
---
/stop autoattack
---
??
---
Bet it was hunter or rogue who won those rolls, right?
---
While I've not leveled thru this instance myself, I did (and am still doing) lots of runs, never seen either drop, nevermind Ironfoe.
---
I get drunk and yell "IM ATHENE, BEST PALA IN THE WORLD!" "HOLY CHACK!"
---
Roll a lock then. Shadowpriest is technical but the dps is just not enough to justify that you never need to heal. For example you will sometimes need to heal while applying shadow weaving. Its just how shadow priest is. You could argue with your guild "but i have a flask buffed and elixirs buffed" all day and they will still say okay but you gotta heal and dispel this fight. You HAVE to basically waste at least 2 talents into threat talents or else you basically pull threat too much or youre waiting too much and your dps looks dumb. I will say on trash though you can have really good dps.
---
Whole point of a shadow priest is being able to quickly lose form to heal in emergency situations too, this is what makes a shadow priest really good in pvp or in dungeon groups. If you never want to heal, hate the idea of healing, and just hate paying attention to your teammates then spriest isnt gonna be your thing.
---
Or play a gnome and go raid the Orgrimmar Orphanage
---
Did this before 1.12 to farm my wh boots back in the day.
---
I'm listening
---
Also the vast mayority of warriors I've seen while levelling in dungeons are completely awful in dps roles(arms=no rage unless being hit) , so if you're a warrior you better tank or get ready to be kicked of the group
---
No, you're not. As a tank that frequently asks to need trash, I make sure to let everyone know I'd like to do that before we set out. Doing it after the fact is an asshole move.
---
You're not the asshole. Unless it's stated before the dungeon that tank can take whatever the party doesn't need, then it's standard greed etiquette.
---
Or your UI is hideous 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
unbreakable
---
Go for spell power over +healing in order to utilize both Anathema and Benediction equally if you want the happy medium
---
Tanks pretty much get to choose what groups they want to join due to being in such high demand. It's one of the benefits you gain when you spec into a spec that makes you nearly useless when you're alone
---
Oh yeah sure, whatever excuse suits you in order not to elaborate. Calling people who disagree with you morons oughts to be enough.
---
DMAB. Best guild on skeram
---
Since you're at the Grand Exchange. Might I interest you in doubling your money?
---
Power Word: Shield yourself, use Shadow Word: Pain and wand the enemy down. You can occasionally mind blast and keep mana to heal yourself if needed. Also keep up Inner Fire,.This tactic is complemented by Spirit Tap which will help you keep up your mana and reduce the downtime you would need to drink water between enemies. 
---
Holy Fire and Smite aren’t worth the mana in my opinion, unless an enemy has a decent chunk and they’re running away from you at low HP towards an enemy pack, Mind Blast is on cooldown and they need to die ASAP before linking another enemy.
---
I’m level 36 so far with my priest and my rule of thumb is to always make sure I have a quick 1.3 to 1.5 speed wand that’s updated frequently.  I’ve had no trouble dealing with any enemy my level, even if I accidentally pull more than 1 mob. 
---
Hope this helps, I’m having a blast leveling my Priest and I can’t wait til 40 to go full Shadow!
---
No you are not the asshole here. 
---
No special treatment for tanks, unless its agreed on beforehand.
---
Runes are 5-7 gold on my server. Flasks are 120+.  And this is just MC. Your consume list doesnt get any bigger with fight length increasing.
---
Why do you want that set though? There are better options?
---
And warlocks are 90 % of times on banish duty in MC lol.
---
Yawn, going with the age old crap just because you're too lazy to write "ret" on the sub, gud one my man.
---
Anyone putting out reserves in PUG dungeon groups is the asshole - just my opinion.
---
get yourself libram of rumination (150mana) cost you 30g and 1h :D
---
Get discord and go to the cross realm premade channel.
---
Join a specific bg instead of first available
---
Be fast 
---
Coordinate
---
Nice UI
---
Sounds like he was hoping for a specific drop from the dungeon so it’s not like he was just doing it as a favor to you either.
---
Yeah I have done the same thing myself. After spending 30min looking for a tank and only finding tanks demanding no other warriors be invited to the group I will ask the DPS warrior I already invited if he can tank instead.
---
If he cant, then I will just replace him and get the other warrior because the alternative is calling the run.
---
I am actually on the way to Exalted with ALL the Horde factions just grinding AV.
---
The stuff you can give (Blood, Armor Scarps, Meat) turns in for +10 Org REP and 2.5 for ALL HORDE.
---
Yes, is grindy but at least gives you something do to in the endless AV grind, saves you around 800g+ (just for one faction ofc) of Runecloth and is not that bad tbh.
---
You're welcome :D
---
Holy fire, then SW:P. Another wise this is really normal. If you have the space, you can scream on casters to interrupt their cast and keep them moving. Also, as I mentioned earlier, when you ding 22 you'll probably be three shotting casters with mind blast and smites.
---
Dirty workaround might be: chattr +i config.wtf
---
Could fuck up future updates though
---
good luck generating threat if you don't hit shit.
---
People could live off rabbits like that
---
such a clown, blackstone also gives hit
---
The UI + binds were horrible, sorry. Am I bad in this game now?
---
"keeps 1 to = bound"
---
What should i use as my next keybind... Idk hitting alt 1 to 5 seems hard maybe i should try ctrl.... Idk still hard to pinch my hand together like that... Oooo what about the F keys!!!! ... But i dont want to JUST hit the F keys... Lets toss Ctrl back in the mix... PERFECT
---
-op probably
---
Yeah, probably.
---
Seriously if you're a under 60 warrior and can't tank, you're doing WOW wrong
---
GCD, popping tap won't let you cast anything for 1.5 seconds. So you only tap when you absolutely have to.
---
Pvp or pve?
---
The more you talk about it being a dead server, the less inclined people are to roll here. 
---
Yes, there is extraordinary faction imbalance. No, that does not make the game impossible to play. 
---
We aren't still dying multiple times to enter BRD, in fact 80% of the time Horde will straight up ignore people in the open world. Ironforge isn't empty like org on flamelash, it has a healthy amount of people in it. 
---
Yes, GRIZZLY and some other guilds have left. You know what that means? Room for others to step up and fill that spot as #1. GRIZZLY was one of the top performing guilds on Classic, and now that they left, it would be a great opportunity for other hardcore guilds to roll here and show off their stuff.
---
Lol made me go check your profile for pictures of your UI now, not disappointed
---
My favourite part is he disnt just bind them to base F keys, but added CTRL as if the rest of his options were taken
---
Was rocking the 6set bonus for pvp until i got something better (which wasnt difficult to replace).
---
Mind if I get as well, made a wrong decision by creating female instead of male troll ^_^
---
Youre closer than you think.
---
May i direct your attention to article 1: Stance bindings on Ctrl-F1 to 3
---
Except the objective is to snowball afkers out the door. If you ask me, I see 38 people NOT working towards the objective.
---
Except it just got nerfed hard
---
Sure, if you just dont count the other races :D
---
More like get 5 people to do it and it takes 10 seconds. But that would require 4 more people who aren't pigheaded morons :D
---
&gt; elitist trolls won't allow a shaman in their raids unless they are resto.
---
I'm defending the "elitist trolls." Elemental shaman doesn't deserve loot, the healing shaman should get the elemental gear because he fulfills a powerful roll in raid, and deserve to be rewarded with PvP gear.
---
Yes and its pretty long iirc.
---
Something like once a month but the number of items restored is not limited. History only lists last 50 tho so be careful.
---
I'm not crying because i loose.
---
I'm crying because i can't play with a group and the other faction can.
---
Btw, hord have to deal with afk too
---
As a hunter, you can attack with your pet while drinking. Excellent for dungeons with a fast moving group, especially as a BM
---
everybody have repair bill, but the tank's repair bill is 10-25 time higher than yours.
---
If the tank is there for an item (the bow in this case) and nothing was agree upon before hand then you are not the asshole.  That tank was way out of line.
---
Are there any decent guilds out there that exist in classic that are not private server guilds? I kind it kind of funny people talk about losing ToW like its some big thing, they were always a middle of the pack guild on private servers.
---
They might have server transferred, if you can't find anyone.
---
One guy on our server has a warlock summoning service at duke hydraxis.
---
If you find hard to get to places or places that take a long time but are often needed to be visited by level 60 players youre golden.
---
Higher levels tend to tip more too, so yeah.
---
Thank you!
---
Effect #2 on that wowhead page directs you to  [https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=4076/roach](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=4076/roach) . Probably just the Roach
---
that only work when there's not 300 people waiting in queue already.
---
i was in wc with some spanish guy on my 18 hunter twink,and he said smonething what i translatd as "dude u should leave dungeon and enter only when we kill boss so u dont get exp from trash bcs u want to be  perfect 19"
---
is there any diference if i get all my 19 bises when i am 19 0% or 19 99% ,if my only goal is to spam bgs ?
---
There's a difference between showing an answer and explaining it. This graph literally just shows us the results of a calculation with different values for n. We don't get an explanation for why it trends towards 0.5, and we don't even see the formula. An analysis does both of those.
---
The graph is very good to show us the answer. It's just not as simple as "graphs are better than analyses", they serve different purposes.
---
Arugal is Oceania’s toxic waste dump, well at least it’s where the worst of the worst scum horde players reside, so perhaps it’s a great place to play alliance, making those salty bucket shitters cry would be good fun.
---
Ugh man I knew something felt wrong when I was doing it the other day
---
Well as a tank when I do runs and I dont need anything from there I always ask for all the bop and unwanted boss loots basically only need or pass. I think its fair, they do run and get gear and I got atleast my repair cost back.
---
Curtis. Curtis Bigrod.
---
But the game is not hard and neither is any raid up until AQ/Nax, so why do they need to be resto? Hell throw a damn ret pally in there too. 
---
My point is that people are trying to hard for a game that is no longer hard since we know what we are doing now.
---
As someone who tanks a lot of 5-mans, you’re NTA, he definitely overreacted.
---
Yeah the half second it takes to push them back in, and then return to battle, and get a new person in who is probably not afk.
---
People who AFK battlegrounds are very defensive though.
---
Yup, blizzard's weak ass attempt to curb extreme inflation via raw gold
---
If he dies he dies..
---
Well if you are of a mindset that you do not want to play unless you are entitled to as much loot as possible, I guess you are right. Makes me happy I leveled with friends and guildies.
---
Alt up and down already does this though?
---
God damnit. This photo just made me resub. Zug zug, bros.
---
Eh, if you were playing horde on Bloodfang EU, my guild would have taken you as pure shadow for raiding with offheals/dispels on very few select bosses.
---
You absolutely should level one even if you aren't interested in anything but shadow.
---
No, but accidents happen.
---
I don't know what your spec is, but I highly suggest a fury/prot or arms/prot build while gearing. This gives flexibility to dps when you're able to, and straight tank (sometimes better than prot spec'd folks) when needed.
---
Yeah and at that point get told by the class leaders nuh uh, not happening. We have those roles covered. They could if they really want to, but they will be benched as second choice to the current core team and DKP reset for their new role.
---
Healer consumes will still be dirty cheap come p4 (when we finally get an elixir and weapon oils). The materials can be stockpiled now at barely any cost.
---
But even as a healer, we can make solid gph. That guy is just fucking lazy.
---
Just stand there and absorb the damage! :) 
---
I typically refresh the shield when it goes down and pop a renew or heal on myself if I’ve taken a bit of damage. Priest is pretty comfy face-tanking with the armor bonus of inner fire up along with the shield.
---
Druid. You can be what you want to be. Resto can hold it's own. Hybrid build is awesome, I can tank dungeons and heal raids and pvp without respecting, just gear swap. Cat dps is decent. Boomkin is there. Not saying it's good, but it's there.
---
I'm guessing you haven't had experience with many good war DPS.  I recently respecced out of arms to fury since I got hit capped, but arms fucking kills it in 5 mans.  Charge in and get a single hit in, get off sweeping strikes, swap to fury, bloodrage and whirlwind and watch that DPS meter light up like a Christmas tree.  I had no issue constantly running as top DPS as arms in most 5 man dungeons and would consistently be in the top 3 in UBRS.  Warriors just do a shit ton of damage in this patch, be it in arms or fury, you just have to know how to play.
---
The last couple AV's I have been in the alliance has full on turtled at SHGY with no intention of trying to go forward for objectives. I would love to understand the thinking behind that strat.
---
So, 50/50 is not a "balanced" split, because Horde play more aggressively.  
---
Both Firemaw and Mograine have 40/60 Alli/Horde split, and that's quite grim situation. 
---
Why not Ashbringer? It have slightly more Alliance, that compensate general Alliance passiveness)
---
Even the Mount Icon's eyes
---
Baron, Shaz, Rag. Every other boss melee are top. So no.
---
Nothing like a good defense :D
---
On the flip side, we can see from a terrible UI that you're awful at the game...
---
... And you have a terrible UI too!
---
At this point most healers that have been 60 for a few weeks no longer need loot from golemlord. Just bring one of those healers and skip that boss.
---
If it's for the chat function ingame, the default shortcut is to hold Alt and use the up/down arrow keys. Do not think it stores 100 for default tho. Best of luck with your next add on, keep up the good work.
---
Yes and that's not aproblem, but they should let groups of same server queue up to a 5 man group
---
If you have improved wand talent and a wand, you should definitely use it. It's fine to holy fire/mind blast/smite when you have max mana but else I would just cast one spell, SWP and wand.
---
What about the awful economy? The lack of new players to fill raid spots as people leave or quit? The torture of trying to form dungeon groups? The honor brackets being literally the highest in the world? We can walk around in the world but that doesn't solve the other problems
---
How about you deactivate 2 accounts and use that $25 monthly to buy gold? 0 effort, same effect.
---
How about Priest Heals (shield, fort) and Pally tank (salv, good aoe aggro) :).  Druid tank also good.  Just speaking as a mage in 5-mans.
---
Best horde starting zone 100%.  Been horde forever. Main Undead and had a troll/tauren alt.  And no contest the bes starting zone! 
---
I just recently started an alliance caracther for the very first time in 15 years, a dwarf.  Now level 17, and I have to say... the zone are so beautifull compare to durotar... It's so green, blue, full of trees, houses, it is very very nice to level in this environement.  I actually have trouble to come back  on my horde mains to farm some lotus (and of course never find any)
---
Nah they didn’t do an offer of DKP just said to roll on it bc only like 4 people needed lol which is why it was annoying but is what it is
---
&gt;I think its fair, they do run and get gear and I got atleast my repair cost back.
---
do you repay priest or druids for using mana pots to heal you? Or rogues for using blind powder/flash powder/thistle tea? Probably not. Every class has cost, including repairs. To be honest the cost of just your repairs is less than the cost of other classes have to buy reagents for their spells and abilities along with their own repairs.
---
Priests itemization is OP. In MC you have access to benediction which is on par with BWL weapons well before any comparable items get added. Ontop of this priests mana regen is absolutely busted. My bis Druid has about half the MP5 of the priests in my raid. Also a bigger mana pool. Druids have comparable regen if they innervate themselves but why do that when you could innervate the priest. Flash heal has a 1.5 second cast time where regrowth is a 2 second cast and it's more mana efficient. This means priests can snipe heals from other healers more effectively than other classes. Bubble is great utility that can prevent deaths if used properly. Aoe heals are irrelevant. Tranquility is a garbage spell you should almost never use and prayer of healing (priest aoe) is also bad. The only aoe heal worth using in classic is chain heal(another stupidly broken class).  A skilled Druid can compete with priests but in a vacuum assuming all players of equal skill priests and shamans should be at the top of the healing meter always.
---
Seems interesting! can you share your macros please?
---
Never used a mouseover macro. Can you explain how that works?
---
Very cool! Do you have a guide or walkthrough on how to get started with wow addon development?
---
Nah they said since only around 4 people needed it to just roll. Annoying but just means I’ll have more dkp for shit later on but yeah it was kinda wack
---
I mean what I have seen is horde gets annoyed and groups up near balinda's area and just sits waiting for the alliance to push forwards but the are commited to the turtle and wait. That is where I am confused like we are letting you go with 0 resistance but it appears the only objective is to drag the game out.
---
Cries in 31 arcane raid spec.
---
How does it feel to lose every World pvp ever? Sincerely - Horde from Mograine
---
Do you want to
---
A) give raids foods, drinks and buffs, then proceed to spam 1 button
---
B) give raids summons and healthstones, then proceed to spam 1 button
---
Or
---
C) give raids totems to buff them, then proceed to spam 1 button
---
In PvP
---
A) CC and use spells to do damage
---
B) CC and use spells to do damage
---
C) totems and use spells to heal and do damage
---
Anywhere where I can find pre raid BIS gear? Will start chasing it down
---
I mean, fair enough. But, just because you can rationalise it, doesn't mean it's an expected part of the game for the average person.
---
I still think it's just basic decency to let the group know you'll be rolling on dps gear imo.
---
Thank you for your service
---
Different groups have different rules for it
---
Shadow priest was the best leveling experience I ever had while still being a viable healer up to around 50. Now I‘m heal specced but still have fun. With so much healers around though you can still easily stay shadow and go raiding etc.
---
Also just random crap like shirts.
---
Just a few of the cons.
---
Cons: pve
---
Guilds only take one normally. Often they will have a discipline priest go 31/0/20 and keep shadow weaving on bosses whilst healing.
---
Some players have serious problems with giving caster loot to non-mage/warlocks from an efficiency point of view, since shadow priests have terrible mana problems. Also, you dont need crit at all since mind flay and swp cannot crit, its absolutely a wasted stat. So this makes a lot of gear kinda crap for you.
---
Set gear doesn't exist until phase 5 for shadow. Unless your getting pvp rank gear.
---
Mana issues. You will be out of mana if the fight lasts roughly over a minute. This is including mana pots and demonic runes.
---
Cons pvp:
---
Really immobile. You have no way to increase speed and this is a bit of a PITA for pvp. Particularly chasing EFCs, dismounting enemy players, and trying to kite anything. You have to stand and fight as a priest there is no running
---
If you're alliance WOTF means your first fear is always pointless. If you get to the second you will kill them.
---
Mana issues. Your oom, a lot. You will need to horde the mana/food buffs.
---
Your buffs cost approximately 4k mana. So after reviving and buffing you will need to drink or take the mana/food buff from the huts in wsg. 
---
If you're alright with the cons then just be prepared to blast people to oblivion and be one of the best pvp classes going.
---
It's fun when we take you 3v5. Haha try hard horde can't even pvp
---
What does the game look like with it?
---
&gt;everybody have repair bill, but the tank's repair bill is 10-25 time higher than yours.
---
warriors don't have to spend money to cast their abilities. Every other class does.
---
Go to interface --&gt; Raid Frames --&gt; and shrink them, can also remove the border to make it look cleaner
---
Love classic so much, rekindled my love for wow, a game that has been part of my life throughout many phases. Classic makes me feel a certain way that retail will never be able too. Merry Christmas!
---
Like I said, faction imbalance is not a concern, it's not about queue times or anything in your petty little argument, it's the simple fact that people should be able to play with friends. This ability should not be exclusive to alliance OR horde especially when one faction can EXPLOIT the queue system to queue in cross server premades. We should be allowed to play AV with our friends and I don't care if you're the majority or not that option should be open I don't care if there's 30 minute queues for horde I'm actually A okay with that cause it gives me time to farm some herbs and such. You are very narrow viewed here. "Horde tormented me on my PvP server, they shouldn't be able to play with friends like we can"
---
Ok let me rephrase: for anyone who knows what a deathroll is, has a very basic understanding of statistics, and can read a graph (which you would expect from anyone who would click on this thread) - there is know further 'analysis' required than simply showing them this graph.  It's fairly obvious that in a game where 2 players roll increasingly small numbers until one rolls a 1, the probability of winning would approach 50% with a large starting upper bound.  The only interesting 'analysis' to be done would be "how quickly does the probability approach 50% with an increasing upper bound for the first roller" which is demonstrated in entirety on the graph provided.
---
Who cares about the difficulty? Do you want it to be like live when a group of the best players need 100+ attempts to kill a boss?? That boring and sucks. Raiding is supposed to be fun. The challenge in vanilla was getting 40 people together and working in unison. Not from boss mechanics. 
---
PVP premades are good? GASP! Premades ruled vanilla. If wanted to me a rank 14 you had to join the rank 13 group and they decided when you got rank 14. That's how it worked back then that's how it'll work now.
---
"I don't like this person not contributing so I'm not going to contribute"
---
Dunno, we always rush galv-&gt;lts-&gt;drek. It's either a lot of people stalling mid, or a lot of people rushing into galv room after we get in, or big turtle at IB GY, or tons of recallers when drek is pulled. Against Russian servers there is usually no resistance, which is a nice change of pace (even had a 6 minute loss against Russian premade that skipped balinda and went straight for vann).
---
Kromcrush is very balanced server imo
---
I'm the MT for a raiding guild that frequently does Arena runs and I haven't even seen Gorosh since my mid 50s. I don't even want to think about how many runs I've done in that time.
---
Mankrik was right, there is some weird Orgrimmarian fuckery going on, i demand answers from Thrall
---
There is no way this post isn’t sheer drama and hyperbole.  Stalag was one of the first servers I was going to roll on and it had massive queues.  The realm and game are far from dead
---
I love how all these warriors like to ignore that deathbringer is a thing. Let the littl rogues roll on viskag pls.
---
Then you haven't played any other week. 8 minute matches are still very common
---
Playing a holy pally? Use divine favour, max rank holy light and spam the shit out of holy shock, it's a 100 % chance to use the divine favour buff and you'll have a crit holy light and holy shock. It's the amazingly shit server tick rate actually helping you.
---
&gt; I have to expect the warrior to be a lazybum or a noob, because he refuses to tank himself.
---
This is always a big red flag for me.
---
How do you not have a shield and a few plate pieces from questing?
---
No blue post i can find but thousands of player reports confirm that the xp and grey rates have gone down substantially since the BG patch (they were also nerfed back in vanilla)
---
Gotta get in those premades man
---
If you really want cash, then solofarm bloodvine for a few weeks straight on a stealth char once ZG opens.
---
I mostly agree with you but why do you think the snowballer is hurting the team more than the afker? They are both doing the same amount of helping.
---
&gt;10-25 times higher
---
Yeah, that’s completely false.
---
I think it's like 29 agi = 1 crit + 29 AP. Seems like the 24 AP would be better here.
---
Me too. Netflix farming.
---
But it's the never thinking about others that's the dick-ish move.
---
You shouldn't assume just because you are fine with it, that it makes sense to you, that it's obvious to everyone. 
---
If you aren't w/ anyone else that can use the gear sure, there's no issue - and no reason to tell the group. But rogues and druids can also roll on dps gear since it's not exclusively plate e.g. HoJ.
---
Resto shaman is the best 5 man healer, change my mind.
---
When you are left with 5 rugged leather, runecloth gloves, and 299 tailoring.
---
Whilst I don't know the specific answer, I'd say that agi is always better unless the 2 items are way off, in this case they aren't.
---
PEONS LIVES MATTER!
---
Like waiting for lfr ques and do world quests?
---
Merry Christmas fellow Mograiners!
---
That's what I was thinking just wondering if there is any math for equivalent raw ap to agility
---
Fuck, man, I envy you. I’m a feral tank and I constantly get whispered to HEAL dungeons.
---
Spoken like someone who doesn't know the situation on the server
---
I don’t know if anyone else noticed this or not but the same thing happens at the base of thunderbluff. None of the mobs despawn and if I kill stuff there for a few minutes I inevitably desync off the server and have to alt+f4 and log on my main until my alt disconnects. It’s happened twice to me now. It’s like the Bermuda Triangle of wow
---
&gt; (especially back then) 
---
I think you have this backwards.
---
fyi, dps gear from dungeons usually ain't plate.
---
Oh ffs shut the hell up. You're not even on topic
---
That must be alliance AV in a nutshell
---
I do hate that one guy that is recalling though. It's people like that that fuck up my stealthy solo Aid Station capture...
---
Yup this guys keybinds are shite.
---
Id say nothing about this cus his ui is like anybody elses, fitted to suit the player.
---
But on his next post he said that the players calling him out on this thread are probably bad haha.
---
Honestly dude, learn how to keybind,
---
And theres no need to obstruct half of your screen with "common" spells.
---
Barkskin-&gt;hibernate all-&gt;ghetto hearth maybe?
---
It does take longer though since you're then coming from the nearest inn and not thorium point
---
UPD: i fycked up(
---
You dont have a clue how queues work. This is literally impossible with 20m+ queues.
---
Probably killed all of them and still no fucking medallion.
---
Where's the color?
---
Quite simply, being fury/prot isn't a bad idea regardless of faction. High threat gen, plus way more fun than standard prot.
---
Since you're human, and have an Ironfoe (kinda jelly, ngl), I'd 100% test out using Thrash blade as the OH. Yes, it is a slower speed wep than your MH, but the proc may make up for it.
---
One thing to keep in mind is that raw stats scale wit buffs like Blessing of Kings (and Grace of air?) while +so doesn't.
---
It's just an hour
---
Pro-tip: execute is flat damage. Use two fast weapons to get rage faster to execute more instead.
---
Yeah, tapping is the last thing you wanna do. Which is why using runes and potions, as well as casting them early (in case a fight should allow for second pots) is very important. And also a big thing for warlocks specifically : Use runes!
---
Alts. Many alts. Left side. Handle it!
---
Way easier to chuck a banish than decurse everyone
---
Wtf who cares it's just a piece of mail
---
Sure, it may be more expensive but not 25 times higher:
---
800 km distance for me. On the one hand I'm happy to be on holidays, on the other, I can't wait to get back.
---
Mostly to see if I could do it,  3k latency spikes meant I gave up after 1 game.
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure this is a troll post considering you've never heard of Prayer of Healing apparently. Not to mention we also have the less efficient, but also an AOE heal, Holy Nova.
---
I'd also like to throw in, that Pallys might be the best healer (output wise). I literally watched one of our top guild pallys chain cast flash of light and her mana went UP. It was kinda ridiculous.
---
Looks like Horde propaganda to me.
---
Sounds like the person they wanted to have the item probably had the least amount of dkp. Four people going for an item can be normal. Usually if it’s a silent dkp bid and day two people bod the same then they would do a roll for it.
---
Because you'll take dmg if your tank is shit, because your healer is oom, because you want to do a swifter run so you use them as free hppots. Why wouldn't you use them if the alternative is you dying?
---
Business major?
---
You're seriously going to argue Shammy is a high skill class to play in pvp?
---
Yup, The Alliance doesn’t believe in defending “better to lose fast” so, when our Galv/Drek Zerg fails, and the game turns to shit, I go farm harpies.
---
Considering how fast MC bosses die I think Elemental could actually work for MC ... but after MC, it goes back to being worthless.
---
I just hit 60 as a warlock on Earthfury. I've seen soloing Mara and DME mentioned as potential gold farming methods. I'm currently running SM/Ruin and it looks like you really need to respec to solo DME properly. I'm wondering if it's worth it to do that? The economy isn't great on this server and I wonder how viable it is to farm herbs from the lashers in DME like this.
---
the last person of b1 dropped to the first place of b2.  that means everybody else in b2 needs to either grind up to just under the leader, or basically get b3 rewards
---
The people trying to organize brackets on servers with 10,000 people created a garbage meta.  I  totally understanding wanting titles and gear, but at this point you're just clocking in for work. GL to you.
---
Who spends money to cast abilities??  Reagents costing like 50s a dungeon?  Big deal
---
List of gear with dungeons/bosses they drop from  
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/fury-warrior-dps-gear-bis-classic-wow
---
You think you want to play Shadow, but you don't
---
Yeah, I actually managed to catch someone on our TeamSpeak channel. Many quit, some of the remaining started horde on another server....
---
im guessing you're not drunk.
---
Well, theres buying epic mounts for alts as well.
---
treejus/iceboi won't move out of the field of strife for 15 min after being summoned... during which time they are ridiculously weak.
---
if you manage to keep him alive for those 15 minute, anyone can kite them into the entrance tunnel, where the elite NPC will quickly kill them... or kite them into vann/drek + warmaster/marshall.
---
summoning them is a waste of time
---
this
---
The DMT chest is better too, no? One of our hunters replaced his SGC with tier chest I think, and that made me a bit sad. For warriors it is BiS until phase 5 or so, for hunters it could be replaced in the first raid.
---
how do people know what server to go to, and how do they even know their server is bad?  All the polls i see are from the first week of the game, and the "realm pop" websites all show different results.
---
is there an agreed upon best website to check realm stats?
---
So somebody broke the rules of your artificially-established honor mafia, and now you're sad.
---
That's not what bothers me, what bothers me is that you could farm NPC harpies in a cave, all day, on your *phone* ... and get rewarded with the most PvP honor on the server.
---
Yes you will see people in LFG saying something like  LFM BRD ARENA/ANGER SPAM
---
That’s against the rules :)
---
As more phases come out, will we see more Ret Paladins + Shadow Priests? are they needed in greater numbers for later content? or will we mostly see them as healers?
---
remember, few months ago, when people were happy about classic classe knowing their hybrid could fulfill multiple role without swapping specs?
---
yeah, turn out that was a lie.
---
And it's fairly obvious that the first player has a disadvantage in the first place. But apparently the person OP discussed this with didn't understand that. The graph does nothing to explain why the first player has a disadvantage.
---
Thanks for the compliment! I’d be honored if him or John Williams noticed this.
---
Omg I saw this too!!! It was SO weird!!
---
Definitely horde. Then people get so pissed when you cap a different GY. 
---
Some people forget it's just a game...that's why I'm becoming more of a troll now-a-days
---
I like the architecture and enemies in there, but the level range is atrocious.
---
For example those cloth pants from Ironaya are for level 37ish, then we have Grimlok dropping 42ish stuff, and then we have a whopping level 47 Archaedas. So if you want to reliably hit Archaedas, your level will be around 44, meaning that like 50% of the dungeon is green for you.
---
That's the main reason I dislike Uldaman. It's a shame. BRD at least is so big that you still can kill quite a few bosses at like 52, just no bosses near the Emperor. Uldaman on the other hand...
---
There's no point at which entering Classic would be "behind".
---
MC and BWL are doable (especially for a DPSer) in pre-BiS. And even if you don't raid BWL upon release, you can take your time to level, get pre-BiS and then find a guild to raid with.
---
Can't tell if serious.
---
The vendor trash and runecloth was the answer I was looking for
---
Raid spots aren't gonna be an issue imo. Not everybody wants to shell out 25$ because their guilds leaving. Plenty of now guildless 60s to snag.
---
They drop vendor trash and rune cloth? Blizz patched that out of the game. AV Harpies only drop coin. Unless they changed it in the last week. All the harpies I killed getting to the banner for the quest only dropped coin.
---
Drunk mages and locks tend to roll need (and to win) gear with +healing stat. Wrecked ninjas, you can't even be mad at them, they were wasted that much 🤣
---
&gt;If not for the nonsense pre-Vanilla with the Centaur clans attacking them, the Orcs discovering the Tauren and aiding in their defense and this triggering a blood debt to the Orcs, the Tauren would live in blissful neutrality in Mulgore, Feralas, The Barrens and Thousand Needles and spend their days hunting, fishing and feasting under the moon.
---
Kalimdor is a savage land full of warring tribes. The Tauren were too good for their own good - Without the Horde, they'd be wiped out. Prior to the Orcs, Mulgore was Centaur and Harpy land. The Razormanes, Bristlebacks, Windfury, Kolkar, and Tauren tribes have pretty much always been at various states of war. Tauren value the Land that gives life more than individual life itself.
---
&gt;The idea of a life and nature focused Native American inspired culture like the Tauren welcoming the evil rotting murder zombies Undead into Thunder Bluff is positively ridiculous. They’re literally reanimated undead humans bent on developing biological weapons to kill everything. The Tauren would be revulsed by them.
---
The Forsaken are VERY good liars. The Tauren accepted them as victims of horrible circumstance, trying to find a cure for their plague and the blight. The Tauren saw past the horrific exterior, saw the horrifically wronged citizens of Lorderon they were, but didn't see the darkness actually corrupting them. The Tauren were not going to ostracize them.
---
Make sure you look under the tree!
---
not a troll, my max priest lvl was like 22 so i didn't know they have AoE heals
---
Meanwhile, I have seen the icelord solo Vann multiple times. The ice lord have single handedly ended turtles for me multiple times. And it's 10 minutes not 15.  Don't listen to this kid.
---
Don't bother unless you're decked out in raid gear, have an epic mount and are specced for your classes PvP meta, you'll get denied otherwise.
---
Leeeeeeeeroy Jenkins!
---
Good tip, i pulled out the OEB thinking I’d have more damage compared to Quel’Serrar and Mirahs Song
---
Side note, if they release TBC that'll be up your alley. Shadow priests are very desirable there
---
dungeons mostly, you should be working on your prebis in the 50's
---
You're welcome. Awesome pic
---
Ya, its real risky as a  twink to be that close, bit of explore xp can push you over the top, happened to a buddy of mine.
---
Mine was BiS Rogue at 19, when BC hit and they buffed a bunch of dungeon gear, i couldnt risk getting any of it becaise i was 1.5 bars from 20 rested.
---
told you so
---
I’ve never asked for greens to vendor while tanking, but I could see why he would, I suppose. Us warriors have the most shit money making methods; and yeah everyone has a repair bill, but shit...  compared to when someone is a clothie mage and can go aoe farm for easy gold...  in this case tank should have discussed it well before even joining your group. 
---
Tldr is you are not the asshole, the tank is the asshole lol.
---
So the pvp system has something called brackets there are a maximum of 14. If you kill 15 people a week you go into bracket 1, and the more honor you earn the higher of a bracket you climb. Bracket 1 usually has 5-9 people depending on how big the server is.
---
You get a maximum amount of Rank points(RP) depending on what bracket you are in which increases your rank on tuesdays, the higher the bracket the more the rank points. Low brackets might actually even loose rank.
---
This server is bracket stacking, basically they set a hard limit for bracket 2 to not pass so bracket 1 stays the same every week till they hit Grand marshal/ high warlord, then bracket 2 becomes bracket 1 and every one shifts up.  
---
What happened is some one from bracket 2 pushed into bracket 1.making brackets 2 cap now much much much much higher than it was. Bracket 1s honor cap now became bracket 2s honor cap and every one now has to farm much much more honor.  
---
Also OP got knocked out of bracket 1 for the second week in a row.
---
for me it woulda not given me a skill up...
---
might be even more than that if your tank is epic'd out, especially when compared to range whose repair bill are basically 0 if the tank hold threat.
---
I don't think people realize that a BWL-geared tank would lose gold by doing 5-man if he doesn't win enough greens.
---
Ok boomer. Reroll.
---
Why try to convince this group, when there are 10 more groups waiting for him? It's not worth his time to cater to the hurt feelings of people who he won't get along with anyway. Dropping right away kills the chance for building resentment later in the run.
---
Ok dude don’t go keyboard warrior on me here.  I just said there’s more than just spamming CL.  It’s not like mages or rogues are amazingly difficult either.
---
So they only want to use DKP on highly contested items?
---
That's a recipe for disastrous drama.
---
Reroll alliance. problem solved.
---
It’s the same exact thing
---
Nah. I can just use my Mage to port a warlock to a big city and farm soulshards. Set hearthstone in a near town for the warlock .
---
That was good 3 months ago when you could be one of the 2-3 crafters on the server.
---
Right now pretty much everyone that's serious about warrior already has one and you're competing for the rest with plenty of other crafters.
---
I bought mine for mats + a 250g fee in mid-September, nowadays the fee is 20-40g
---
wow, what a cancer.
---
&gt;What? Says who? People with that mentality are part of the problem.   
---
Says supply and demand.  Tanks are the hardest class to find for a dungeon.  Therefore people are much more willing to entice a tank by giving him/her loot prio on certain things.  Dont like it?  Roll a warrior so you can add another tank to the ranks.
---
Agreed. I’m here for my rep then I’m out.
---
If there's a nearby town, sure. But some places are really far away and involve a long corpse run.
---
I wrote a post about this topic with some (I think) cool liking graphs the other day
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/edvjop
---
You might want to check it out :)
---
Also someone wrote a nice mathematical proof showing that is slightly beneficial to go second, actually. It's hard to get the number right from simulation alone because of variability.
---
if you face opponent who are so dumb they can't kite the icelord away or have 1 healer watch vann while he's handling the icelord's ass, you didn't need the icelord in the first place and should've won before he moved out of the field of strife
---
icy veins and wowhead both have lists, just google.  
---
There is also a bis-tracker addon that shows said list in the game on your character panel.  This addon shows what each item drops from (dungeon + boss) and the % drop chance.  Very helpful.  Atlas Loot is another addon that shows all drops from all instances for extra stuff you may want.
---
Dumb ass kid over there
---
I was really hoping it would be Alexi and Weldon together. Weldon hits like a truck, I've heard Alexi is easier.
---
That medallion drop is rough.
---
It this supposed to be a GoT reference?
---
Didn't you guys ninja loot a world boss kill?
---
How do you fit 30 games into a single day? Every one I get into is an hour long turtle into a 100% loss.
---
It's 685 total healing over 15 seconds. Aside from the fact that it's an incredibly small amount of healing for a level 60 character, it's not even instant. If someone needs *so little* healing over such a *long* period of time, they really don't need it at all.
---
You wouldn't want a mistake to happen.
---
Spanish dude knows his shit.
---
I tried once to queue as a group, individually at the same time. We ended in each our AV.
---
Of course, our single attempt is no hard evidence against the possibility, but it argues against that it's easy
---
Nice counter point.
---
I didn't play since WOTLK aswell I was really Amazed by how great Classic is. I'm having a blast. People keep making ALTs so there will always be someone to play with.
---
AEP (Agility Equivalent Points), which was a stat weight popular during Vanilla, says 2 AP = 1 agility.  
---
1 Agility equals (pick 1):
---
- 1 Stamina
---
- 2 Strength
---
- 2 Attack Power
---
- 0.1% Crit
---
- 0.13% Hit (assuming at hit cap)
---
- 0.2% Dodge
---
- 0.13% Parry
---
- 5 Weapon Skill
---
- 4 Any Resistance
---
- 5 Health/5 Sec
---
- 50 Armor
---
Oh, yeah, I agree, the system is stupid.
---
Yes for sure. But if I have 4x soul stone bag fully stacked it’s fine to do the corpse run semi afk once a while
---
Do Robes of Winter Night require tailoring as a profession like the Robes of the Void do?
---
I know Robes of the Void require 300 Tailoring.
---
Please correct me if I am wrong!
---
You only need to do the quest once.
---
If you want a paladin, always go with human.
---
Their weapon racials will provide a much needed boost for white damage while leveling and at 60.
---
I like prot pally since it's such a fringe spec. I already have a hunter (Tauren) and warrior (Orc). So I decided to play the ultimate meme spec on my pally.
---
It's fun (if you have another main).
---
Why would the tank in my group decide that he didn't want to tank anymore ? Who even does that ? And why does that matter ? Are you trolling or do you really not grasp what I'm saying at all ? What I'm saying is playing war solely as dps is not a wrong way to play or a "waste", unlike some people might claim. I'm not talking about someone who'd join a group as tank and then decide ... not to tank ? What kind of situation is this ? How is that relevant ?
---
As for your question, I have already answered it. It would still be shitty. It would still not be justifiable. That's my opinion, at least. That's my values and principles. If you invited someone to your group and had them wait 30 minutes in hopes that the group would eventually be full and you could all run a dungeon, you don't leave them behind when a better opportunity arises.
---
There's a shitton of situations like this, all the time. I've led several low level dungeon groups, as a dps, searching for a tank, and seen "LF1M dps" messages, and asked myself if I should just jump ship. And I didn't do that, even if I really wanted to, because that's just dishonest and disrespectful to my groupmates, somehow. They might be strangers, it might not make much difference to them, but ... idk, I don't do it on principle.
---
Same thing here, I wouldn't do what OP's tank did, again on principle. As for the whole group jumping ship, I can't say that I wouldn't do it. Right now, when I'm in armchair moral compass mode, sure I wouldn't do it. But in the heat of the situation, with peer pressure and the promise of a full group versus sticking with the one dude and having to find 3 more all over again, for maybe 30 more minutes if not more ? I can't say that I wouldn't do it, because I know how easy it is to be shitty sometimes. I try to be honest with myself. Still, that would be shitty. For the dude left behind, at least.
---
Like most people, I operate on "don't inflict on others what you wouldn't want inflicted on yourself". I wouldn't want to be that single dude left behind forced to make another group all over again. I would feel let down and isolated, and it would take the fun out of the game. That's all I can tell you.
---
Nothing, I hear it’s a very healthy server
---
No said it didn’t have the same meaning.
---
The hunter quest alone makes you hype as fuck. I respect anyone who’s got it and especially those who killed the silithus demon w/o a warlock. 
---
Shit was so satisfying to complete
---
And yet no iron drops
---
It didnt give me a point( Needed more 2 tries
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
Capping IB and SH is the point of AV - if you're trying to do 5 minute pve fiestas, you're the one doing it wrong :D a long drawn out lovely pvp turtle fight is the best AV has to offer. That is pvp as it should be.
---
You mean win / honor trading with &lt;Washed Up&gt; and colluding with world bosses? Yeah, fuck them and WU.
---
Sl warlocks are the best 1v1 class, they simply do not die. No class can beat them.
---
Regeants are optional.  Except being battle rez and portal.  
---
Buffs don’t have to be given with regeants
---
no, they can be purchased/used by anyone, as they are a BoE item, whereas robes of the void are BoP.
---
People don't report ppl for no reason. GG.
---
Human Paladin is pretty fun just play as a paladin tank, I had a blast with it. Use your first 11 ranks to get consecration then go deep prot lost and lots of stuff to pop, oh and remember engineering and mining so you can throw dynamite at mobs for pulling. Have fun pick what race you want
---
As a Horde? No. Delete all of your characters. As an Alliance? Yeah, there is a shortage of Shadow Priests.
---
I mean I definitely agree with everything you said but maybe if you dont put things in your macro talking shit about an entire guild they wont report you. Obviously the whole win trading thing is scummy and I wouldnt say they dont deserve having shit talked to them but you are still putting a target on your back.
---
Just do it anyways and keep it quiet. Don’t advertise a huge casino.
---
Hey, I am sorry for the harsh remark I made in a previous comment. Hope it didn't affect your intention to submit the bug being discussed. Thank you for this and Merry Christmas!
---
Yeah every roll have different perks and drawbacks. This tank was not tanking for gold. He needed the hit crossbow so he had every incentive to do LBRS.
---
I have much harder getting into groups. Do tanks pay me game time for all the time I’m wasteing?
---
You did
---
Awesome work again!
---
Muggleore?
---
Alterac Valley
---
Human warriors usually don't go for deathbringer because it is an axe. Viskag and BB are BiS for fury warriors and warriors &gt; rogue dps. My guild allows rogues to roll on it but warriors have way more DKP cause the lack of dps plate gear in MC/ony.
---
Nah you're not the asshole, and you tried to remedy it yourself without the party. Find yourself a druid tank. My preference for any 5 man. Then save them on your flist for future, or any cool warrior.
---
Never had a warrior complain about a repair bill. But I'm also a healer so I rarely wipe. Except when I was doing BRD at a lower level, but everyone knew the risk!
---
Yes.  SPriest is fun as hell,  and outside of some serious tryhard guilds you should be able to find a raid spot. You'll likely have to be comfortable healing a bit as well to make your life easier finding 5-man spots, and you'll have a ton of fun in PvP.
---
Paladin: buff / heal people while leveling to make friends
---
Lock: debuff already tagged mobs, give out healthstones to make friends
---
I love helping peeps while out and about.
---
Not an asshole. But not nice either. Its whatever. Personally would have said yes, since you were doing multiple runs. At that point i feel like stuff like that should be a given as you are all sort of temporary buddies.
---
New to Priest. When are some good/fun times to use Mind Control in BGs? I know defending LM and making people jump off the side, but we don't have AB yet. Anything else come to mind?
---
Lesser magic wand at 5 and greater at 13, you’re correct!
---
With the proper route you can do Rotty with minimal SP
---
It's the best game I've ever played. Its a shame blizzard is such a trash company now
---
You know I beg to differ personally. Given having 4 different lockouts in toc/icc was a lot of raiding I didnt mind toc at all. Having no trash and a raid that rewarded you for not wiping with extra bis loot was a cool idea. 
---
I also have some really good memories in playing cata up until firelands. Near the end of wotlk as a healer mana wasnt an issue at all but early bwd heroic I felt like I was pushed to the limit. I suppose you could say that about any expansion when it's new but I enjoyed it. 
---
To say the least I'm hopefully of going through the iterations again as I personally wasnt able to raid much in tbc.
---
In open world pve I never used shadowbolt.   Just keep a decent wand and you’re good.  Your shadowbolt will take to long to cast, cost to much  mana (more downtime) and can be delayed when hit.  Wanding you can facetank and put out consistent damage.
---
Only time I would shadowbolt is when you’re in an instance and the mob will die before your dots.  You’re better off just casting shadowbolt and skip the dots.
---
Your imp does decent damage.  Between corruption, agony, imp and wand npcs just fall over.  I learned syphonlife but in most cases it’s not worth using because it costs more mana then health your getting back.
---
CoA (start moving) &gt; corruption &gt; (stop moving) immolate &gt; wand
---
My guild is great! They're about 50% pserver folks and mostly Canadian if that matters. We're getting boxing day presents and as an American i have no idea what that means!
---
Personally, I think everything except AQ and Naxx content should have been in game since day 1. Would have given plenty to do, less wpvp grief-fests to drive the minority faction away, and the commonly agreed hardest vanilla content to actually look forward to. I never cared about having things phased in, and I care about it less if they aren't going to do it exactly to the letter.
---
It is a similar topic so I will ask my question again here.
---
I have Brutality Blade, mirahs song, and stormstrike hammer from AV. Human warrior with 6% hit.  I am MH brutality blade and OH the hammer. but sometimes find I do more dmg on trash in dungeons with mirahs song. little confused what to use.
---
Yeah but do you really wanna waste your 20 minute wait on a stomp from an alliance premade to get virtually no honor or rep?
---
It's fine, PvP is fun! Merry Christmas!
---
If you are on an RP server, why would you want the same name as someone else?
---
go to incendius, go to incendius!!!! lol
---
Love the nod to OSRS with the mark outs.
---
true evil
---
This assumes you start with snowballs. You don't. Sometimes it takes 6, in which case you are shit out of luck. Best case scenario, it realistically takes 3.5min to kick out an AFK.
---
I dOn'T hAvE tO eXpLaIn JuSt LoOk FoR tHe AnSwErS yOuRsElF bIg MoRoN
---
Love it out west sooo much.
---
I do this too, it’s fun and since I’m level 55 I think I’m contributing more to the game like this.
---
Nah. You horde deserve this. Seeing these posts daily is really satisfying.
---
Saw that coming - yellow doesn’t guarantee level (orange does)
---
Paladin as a healer for sure. Beats every other healer and can be geared to be a dual twink (DPS and heal).
---
Hunter then, because no one can really close the gap easily at such an early level. They'll melt any other class with ease. And your pet can be a major pain in the ass.
---
Rogues are famous at the 19 bracket. Because melee enchants scale at an insane rate (fiery does insane damage at that level, and crusader gives 100 str, which is crazy). But they're not that efficient since they're best at surprising the enemy, not charging into them.
---
Im playing witb an integrated graphics laptop from 2008 and getting 10-20 fps.  It works for leveling lol
---
They can't. You don't need to verify your identity for a new account. You don't even need to pay with a payment method that offers your identity. This guy is exactly correct about how stupid it is to delay bans, I wish blizz understood this
---
You can also play prot.
---
Dude, I know people in guilds that still take 3+ hours to clear MC. It's wild.
---
Nah, that's a "tactical retreat"
---
I don’t remember exactly when repair costs were normalized but they really aren’t in classic. As a mage, I can be fully broken and have a 5g repair. My mom plays a warrior and will have a 5g repair after only a few deaths.
---
If there's 30 people playing the fast game, and one dude trying to turtle, that's shitty. I'm totally down to turtle it up every once in a while, dont get me wrong. But when the raid decides to rush, that's a democratic decision and when one antisocial person proudly and purposely sabotages that mission, that's shitty.
---
No, people that play on PvE realms are typically awful at the game.
---
I edited my comment
---
you're exactly correct. not sure why blizzard can't figure this out. they basically create a circular economy of guaranteed profits for botters by the stupidity of intentionally delaying bans
---
Edited my comment
---
That’s not really how it works. Smaller servers have smaller brackets too.
---
Does anyone care?
---
Why is this being upvoted..
---
Meanwhile most warrior players sound handicapped so...
---
You take it back
---
Wasn't conveyed very well.
---
BWL would be a trivial dungeon for the top guilds, they’d already be done with it and everyone would be screeching for AQ and Naxx early. 
---
DM was released at a good time, gave the economy a chance to develop before flooding the market or further trivializing MC. 
---
Honor could’ve been in since day 1, I agree
---
The main thing is that no matter what (solved) content you give this player base, they will chew through it at lightning speeds and accelerate the death spiral that will occur post naxx
---
Dwarf here who used to be human: fuck humans.
---
The stone skin has saved my ass so many times. Scorpids that stack poison ? Stone skin. 
---
Rogue Blinds or cripples you ? Stone skin.
---
I pretty much use stone skin on CD since it’s up again so quick.
---
And treasure find is great too.
---
Repairs cost the same per pt of durability. Plate has more durability. If your tank doesn't die, they aren't spending much on repairs.
---
Druids can essentially swap between offtanking/dps/healing on each fight with a gear swap. They just fill in the gaps of what the raid needs for each specific encounter.
---
If any ally are looking for a place to xfer to definitely check out Kirtonos. A bit Horde favored in the world but overall getting more balanced. A couple guilds on Alliance would go a long way.
---
I'd say look into moving to another guild.
---
You don't wanna start looking for a guild when yours explodes. There would be too many people looking at the same time.
---
And a guild can't survive if it doesn't respect its own loot system. Major drama will happen in a couple of weeks.
---
I know that I have gone against the same group of horde on multiple occasions who always have the same strat. (They hit DB early with the same 7-10 players). Next time I see them together, I’ll screenshot names and you can ask how they’re doing it, because the odds of these guys hitting the same AV multiple times seems less like random ques and more like coordination.
---
Check out zeroji on YouTube for a sub 7 minute tribute run. Doing that consistently for 5 runs 
---
 is another thing but it’s at least possible.
---
A sub-group of the guild did participate in the devilsaur mafia, yea.  
---
Sinew and eye I'm not aware of.   
---
I've been there for the majority of world bosses that we've participated in... Where does this selling world bosses stuff come from?  
---
And you'd need to elaborate about wintrading honor. I know there were some people who did duels and shit which would look like wintrading, but again I'd need to know more about what you're talking about.
---
What's the addon for the weapon swinger. It seems less obtrusive than the other one.
---
Big facts. 
---
They act as if  blizzard made Stalaag just for them lmfao fuck em. 
---
It’s great to have these cheating losers with multiple accounts off the server
---
Well that entirely depends on whether they were discussing a practical advantage or just an advantage, period. I assumed the latter.
---
Anyway, this whole thing is in response to the "Everyone else came in here with a shit ton of words. This is how you present data people." comment. I didn't think that was fair. They weren't trying to present data, they were explaining the reason why the first player had an advantage, which would settle the discussion.
---
You may be right, I can’t really tell what I’m looting from my phone, which is the only time I’ve been in the cave
---
Have done it. Thanks for pointing it out! Be sure to submit the bug and bump the topic. Merry Christmas!
---
This is what I use to use/cancel Heroic Strike. Hit it once to activate it, and hit it again before it goes off to cancel it.
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /startattack
---
    /cast [@mouseover,harm,nodead][]Heroic Strike
---
    /stopcasting
---
If you pair that with an all in one warrior weakaura like:
---
https://wago.io/9EBTx7-J0, you will be able to actually see on your swing timer/rage bar from that weakaura if HS is toggled or not really easily (or just look at the icon on your bar assuming you're using the default, should light up when active).
---
You can do the same thing for cleave too (cast/cancel with clicking the same button), which I find really useful to cancel if I no longer have 2 targets to hit.
---
Don’t have to worry about people being picked off when 35/40 of the group is from a premade with all epic mounts. ☺️
---
Greater Heal with talent is 2.5 seconds as compared to Healing Touch which is 3 seconds with talents.
---
Flash Heal.
---
Bubble which is amazing for any mage/lock aoe situations.
---
Holy Nova is amazing for aoe situations plus aoe grinding with locks and mages.
---
Prayer of Healing has no cooldown vs tranquility which does and mostly sucks and should almost never be used in combat.
---
Renew &gt; Rejev because you get an extra tick from it which makes it more mana efficent.
---
Regrow... is really awful.  Super costly which makes it not spammable if you need the quick heal end of it.  In raid, the hot portion can be overrides from other druids making it even less mana efficient if that does happen.  If you downrank regrow, both the direct heal and the hot portion are way too weak to be worth the mana.  This ability flat out sucks in a raid.
---
Ya was thinking the term "Divas" would be a more apt description of warrior players tbh
---
Lol
---
I don't think DME is as good as people say. I ran it a lot over the past two weeks making my Sulfuras but I was only ever making maybe 30-40g/hour. I can make that at some other spots that I know. 
---
I think the reason is because there aren't that many people buying consumables right now, so the prices for herbs are low. I couldn't make any profit selling potions on my Alch alt so I started just selling the herbs, and they weren't that profitable anyway.
---
This doesn't answer your Warlock question but I guess it may give you some insight. If you can make 30g/hour soloing Mara, I'd stick to that. Don't respec for DME specifically.
---
Updated it, check at the top, please.
---
Healers drink, hunters smoke
---
Spellpower is not +Healing tho.
---
Its only Spellpower
---
You could use greater arcane elixir on healers if your statement is right. But i dont think so
---
well, the teleport in itself cost nothing so the margin is 100%
---
I ran almost exclusively arena/anger/golem 55 until 60. Was lucky and managed to get the chest and trinket.
---
I reserved the trinket (felt a bit cheeky reserving both) as I’d done so many runs for it - nobody minded.
---
The mission then becomes reforming these 30 infidels playing the game mode wrong. 
---
Playing the fast game equals pveing AV. That's a firm no go mate.
---
I sabotage each and every rush no matter what. I will ALWAYS cap the GY so we get a nice pvp match.
---
It's a way of life, and it pays off. People end up committing to actually pvping and it's lovely.
---
I suspect by Naxx most of the people in between casual and hardcore will be gone, leaving only the goofballs with like 30 level 15 toons, and the super neckbeards who will quit after clearing Naxx. Part of me is fine with this, and although I loved BC, I doubt I'd hang on for that ride twice.
---
That was funny one. Please check the tl;dr though.
---
Fun, I soloed the first boss in DM N for awhile as a warlock. So stressful but worth it.
---
walk from Morgan's vigil to blackrock depths at 9pm on a weekday and count how many people you see of each faction
---
Scholo is a good one to charge for since there isn’t much tank gear to lure them in but have a lot of bosses for loot that DPS classes need.
---
And once I’m exalted with Stormpike I’ll be doing exclusively WSG premades form my honor farm, because they’re more fun, and if you can win, better honor.
---
Please check the updated tl;dr section.
---
You can't prove that unless you sign
---
Yes, if it means not waiting 2h+ for a pug queue
---
Its worth elevens any class and spec you want. Stop playing by the meta and play how you want to play.
---
:horde: :shaman:
---
Based on the reactions here? Huge divas.
---
Spriests can solo Princess? How do you trigger Dust Cloud without a pet and without getting brutally murdered?
---
You can turn them off completely. I think if you expand that thing on the left there are some toggles.
---
Reroll the faction you most likely joined in on roflstomping while outnumbering them.
---
These que times are as long as they are because of careless horde players who rolled for the zerg under the guise of "pvp". What comes around goes around, enjoy the long queues. :)
---
As a warrior, how do I best solo farm gold? =\
---
Shhhh don't trigger their precious fury feelings!
---
I had a standoff with a group last week. They needed a healer for strat live, with first orb on res for tank. I started spamming, healer LFG strat live, no res, orbs RR. Neither of us got to run it
---
Ttt
---
&gt;effective and
---
Please check the updated tl;dr section and be sure to submit the bug or bump the official forums topic. Thanks and Merry Christmas!
---
No need to manually switch/tab/click someone and lose a autoshot swing.. With a mouseover macro you just "mouseover" on the model/character you want to CC or put a spell on.
---
In open world (pve/pvp) if you find yourself in a 1v2, just @mouseover scatter the other one while you maintain dps on your main target. Do a mouseover macro for your vipersting too
---
I care.
---
Consider using A D to not only unlock Q E but Z X C as well
---
No need to be rude Mr. Kalki - just general discussion. RNG isn't a kind beast while farming black baron, at least hasn't been for us. No need to find a new guild over a cloak where there are options... I imagine that would make for a tough classic experience being guildless any time a drop was questionable.
---
yes and that requires the player to use some of his attention on the combat log, thus giving that technique an added difficulty.  The addon is basicly track humanoid on any class ... it's cheating.
---
Banning in waves is exactly why botting is so rampant in classic. A grind bot will generate about $250/mo at current gold prices. If blizzard waits 3 months to ban, they made $750, spent $45. You won't find profit margins like that anywhere. If they increased the risk of botting by issuing bans immediately or with random delays, it would totally change the incentives of the botters. Blizzard knows exactly how these bots are working. They are using LUA unlockers - easiest type of exploit to detect. Waiting accomplishes nothing other than creating a circular economy of guaranteed profits
---
If you are a troll you need 6% hit, any other class 9% raiding without the required hit is a dick move.
---
If you have the hit without the enchant dont get it. If you dont have the hit you need it.
---
Because they don't know what makes it good, either. I don't blame them; it's not their job to know - they're not game designers.
---
At this point, I don't trust ATVI to do anything right either, and I don't want THEM in charge of the changes. But to just blindly chant "#NOCHANGES" is a dumb position to hold.
---
No way! I like being able to keep track of raid HP, and i don’t want to look too far to the left lol
---
Hell ya drunk priest healers unite!!
---
The minute you think healing is easy, don’t worry, you’ll group with people who think pulling aggro is what makes it fun!
---
Mine has 2-3 resto, 1-2 enhance, and 2 ele shaman. In a 3 hour block we've been able to down rag from a fresh run. 
---
I know that isn't super fast. But just started to be able to run as guild only for about 2 weeks. (New guild.) Of those we often have 3-5 slots open due to the time frame we raid at which is 10am server time. Some little mistakes here and there still occur slowing the runs down along with people still getting gear for pre-BiS. 
---
Should be much smoother this week since last week was killer on weapons.
---
I am one of the ele shams and currently able to hang around in the bottom of top 10-15 DPS depending on the fight. Nothing amazing but still respectable numbers.
---
As an ele shaman. I am enjoying my life. Me and the enhance shaman both got huge upgrades this week. He got Crown  of Destruction and I got Deep Earth Spaulders. My second week raiding i got staff of domination.
---
It comes from people watching you collude  and sell bosses? Azuregos for 700g doesn’t ring a bell to you? 
---
It’s not a random notion that EVERY alliance player has. You guys are not randomly shit on in world chat and trade chat, it’s for a reason. That reason being cheating players that team with horde on an already imbalanced pvp server
---
Don't feel like tanking a lieutenant? Fine. At least hamstring the fucker so the guy with aggro can kite. It amazes me how many warriors don't think to do this.
---
Ty for your help. Much appreciated. Going to mess around with this.
---
Just throw the big heal here and there while smashing heads with your hammer. Can make a huge difference. Tbh ret palas suck in BGs anyways, imho.
---
This is how some multiboxers level. You can level with rested XP by just killing mobs and it's actually really fast. A multiboxer can have 5-10 toons in the area constantly pulling crocs and one shotting them with 1 button. None of the toons are in a group and he alternates the tags to get each one XP.
---
Yeah but the dynamite cost piles up.
---
I just have a macro telling my group nicely (but sternly) to let me have the mobs for 5 secs before they DPS. And that they can AoE if they want after those 5 secs.
---
Those who ignore that request don't get invited to future dungeons. No fuss, no drama.
---
Let's all have fun, not just the DPS.
---
It’s easy enough to afk out and fly to thorium point to get more honor from solo world PvP than it is to sit in the damn turtle. 
---
Why any Ally would sit in a 30+ minute match is unfathomable to me. Just leave. It’s faster, less stressful, and more honor. 100% of the time.
---
Yeah, ebbs and flows as content is released, it’s not a bug it’s a feature. 
---
If you need content for 16 hours a day, try chess or BroodWar.
---
This is an inspiring one. Will definitely try something like this. Do you have any screenshots? I am curious what were the riddles.
---
No you acted appropriately - everyone has various costs of various kinds and differing levels of ability to farm for said gold. Tanks need to get off their high horses demanding shit left and right to tank. It's toxic and not something they have a right to anyway.
---
Hell yeah! Enjoy the break from monotony and the return to Azeroth.
---
If they are not 60 is for xp
---
but getting a similar amount of honor equals a higher rank, no?
---
Yes that's why they bot. If you buy gold from a chinese gold seller, chances are you're buying botted gold and your account is at risk. If you're going to buy find someone you're confident isn't botting the gold
---
Imagine leaving now that WPVP is completely dead and most hardcores are just raid logging or living in the AV cave.
---
What’s good about engineering for goblining?
---
I mean that’s purely an opinion, it’s one thing to fix a bug, but this is asking for a visual change that isn’t breaking the game by not being fixed and was never intended to be apart of it. So saying people are dumb for not wanting that to change is kind of wrong
---
And a large portion did aswell. The whole no changes thing is stupid, as there have been numerous changes to classic. Anyone who still backs the no changes deal is delusional.
---
so if someone has two subs and plays both factions and uses both to control a area to farm is that against tos and if so can you post a link
---
I’m pretty sure it is from Quartz, i love the style of the bar
---
Oh yeah, im always waiting for someone to finally tanking that sucker. They probably assume nobody heals them, which sadly is true. Can't heal them alone with my 250hp flash heals lol.
---
As mentioned previously, this is an one video fits all classes video. You can probably get to 8/9 days /played especially with a mage.
---
This is what you get for roflstomping the enemy faction while outnumbering them like crazy.
---
What comes around goes around. :)
---
If the que time really is too much for you to bear, reroll.
---
I see the casuals are downvoting you. 
---
100% of Ally rush strats are ruined if too many people have slow mounts.
---
yeah and in pvp you become a juggernaut. I got 4500 hp unbuffed and a hefty amount of resist and armor. Most rogues give up after they open on me and I've had mages go oom trying to arcane explode me to death with a single viper sting as they break the gap.
---
That's a nice set up! Thats where I am right now but wouldn't be in Berserker for tanking but otherwise it all makes sense... Still farming SGC. What a pain.
---
I play only shaman so that's what I can talk about:
---
Flexible: Can heal and/or deal damage. (Tanking is... tougher and probably only viable for dungeons, not raiding). Have a lot of abilities: 22 or 23 totems, 3 heals (and as healer you may want to use downranked heals too. I use 6 healing spells). 5 damage spells, two of which you may want a rank 1 version of too (earth shock, frost shock), resurrect, ghost wolf for travel and a few rarely used utility spells.
---
Pro: flexible, lots of abilities to use (but in raiding you'd use few at a time. In PvP your best strength may be that you can play on your opponents weakest sides).
---
Con: levels rather slowly. Rather bad at soloing stuff. In raids shaman can be an excellent healer, but elemental and enhancement specs are... perhaps dubious)
---
In other words: of you want a class that needs only a few abilities or that solos fast then shaman may not be for you.
---
Actually, for a lot of time in history, commanders were expected to also be accomplished warriors and lead from the front.
---
Doesn't OP just need to re-pass the guy who pushed into bracket 1 though? The brackets are % population based right?
---
Depends on the clothie. Healers have a hard time making gold and have plenty of other things to spend it on. Tanks at least can get instant dungeon invites to farm for the gold they need.
---
As a healer who never played vanilla before its more like the blind leading the blind for me. 
---
People look to me for guidance and I barely know these dungeons. I end up saying "I think its this way" and they all follow me even when I'm wrong 50% of the time. 
---
Usually the tank knows the layout by now so I can just follow like a sheep too. But in the early days I definitely got a lot of groups lost in dungeons. But thankfully if I ended up with that responsibility it meant no one else knew what to do and they were all pretty chill about it.
---
Please don't
---
In the time it will take you to get SGC you could level 2-3 Warriors from 1-60. lol.
---
Just noticed the ice lord in the background.  I think your comment sums up the situation perfectly.
---
if you can't go on vacation just drink until you don't know where you are anymore.
---
Ah, never really paid attention to the direction macros were read in.
---
Sounds like a ROOKIE casino ;)
---
It is not an easy task to write a big post. And one doesn't even know upfront if it needs to be big or not. In my defense, its initial version was far, far worse.
---
Updated!
---
they sell the fish to the tourists :P
---
They probably want to find an easier server to rank on.
---
Dude, I got you. I will even roll on maces and call it a missclick.
---
How is he "amplifying" ? He is essentially just afk himself. If by "amplifying" you mean "the snowballer is another afk player" then yes. But they are both doing the same damage. None more than the other.
---
H.ghghhhhguuu
---
&gt;effective
---
What else do we get?
---
If you're defending in AV you can mind control the enemy tanks into the boss' room 1 at a time and watch them get wrecked by the lieutenants.
---
Making people jump off AV bridge or MCing people into drek/van is always fun!
---
AV on the bridge to make people fall to their deaths. Or near NPCs like the Mines to make them aggro multiple NPCs. Or WSG when someone comes into your base (stand in the LoS area).
---
But be careful not to waste too much time MCing and forget to heal.
---
Congrats!  You've won an entire weekend of essence farming!
---
I know very little of the situation on your server. I imagine your guild also causes Baron Geddon bindings to drop less frequently for guilds on the server? :p
---
Imagine giving a single fuck about in game plain letters.
---
Did anyone's cursor size explode with the most recent patch 2 weeks ago? I'm on a Mac and I can't tell if I'm going crazy or if it really changed.
---
I think it may be a Mac only issue though. Anyone with Mac experience this issue?
---
Wouldn’t the xp be almost nothing since it’s a raid group?
---
This. So much this.
---
Seems kinda random to me, feels like some items green is still a good chance for lvl up, while sometimes yellow can be worse chance than green, could just be bad luck.
---
I care
---
Nothing better than viper stinging a mage til he’s oom and hitting em with that AS
---
Isn't flamelash dead though? I was curious about you putting those 2 servers together.
---
Ygw0pouti tuywurqwf
---
That's not what I'm saying at all, though.
---
I'm saying that there are definitely some changes that would improve the experience for the vast majority of the players. There will always be some people who hate whatever change is made, true. But disliking *a particular change* is very different from disliking *any changes whatsoever*. That's what I'm saying is dumb.
---
No I didn’t lol
---
Could you shed some light on why GTG came out to be the winner? 
---
The way I see it is Pagle won when RI lost their control.
---
same issue, not sure what is going on
---
I think it depends on the group of players and their willingness of involvement (and their skill level too).
---
I played 3 AVs last night. 
---
First 2 AVs. someone was trying to instruct with no one even typing in raid or /say at the battles. Clearly no one cared and just wanted to be mindless sheep. Ally easily zerged and won.
---
3rd AV someone used macro's instructing everyone through out the game on defense/offense when events occured. Many people were communicating positions, health's, and their intention (recall, sitting on tower, moving to stormpike, etc) and we won without the Ally even getting a tower in base...15-18 minute game. We killed all LTs and tower's.
---
We killed Belinda and LTs (while rogues stealthed to Ally base and got tower + GY). Aoe/hunters recalled. CPL guys sat at tower's. By the time offense showed up and DID NOT pull all those stupid Ally NPCs by the aid station. We started pulling Marshal's ... Killed them right before GY capped and then killed Ally boss.
---
Run back? Just have a friend invite you but not be in an instance. Then to 'reset' log out first and have them reset the instance. When you log back in, you *should* spawn back at the entrance with a reset dungeon.
---
Come to heartseeker!!!
---
I think I can top this. Until the BG patch hit, my quiver would stay visable on my back while doing an emote or talking to an NPC. Now it disapears and is only ever visable when I have my bow out. I hate it! Id like to be able to see my quiver all the time. 
---
Oh and also, tabards clip into male dwarf legs and it drives me insane.
---
Done? Are all reputations at exalted yet? Do you have an epic mount of every faction? You’re never done in classic 😜
---
For rogues you get 1 ap for 1 agi. Skarmtank has a great detailed breakdown of the stats each class benefits from here - https://youtu.be/nxZOOXLuGdo
---
At this point you’re going to want to get creative with it. Most, if not all, servers have this service already so I would suggest something like a punch card, after so many summons purchased you get a free summon, or give them some mage food/water with every purchase. Just something that will make you stand out a bit more.
---
You notice it! sweet :D
---
Yeah, Flamelash is dead. Mirage Raceway is mentioned all the time by people who play on it as a generally great server with a healthy community. Just 2 contrasting options.
---
The dumbass is the guy claiming he's seen the ice lord solo van, the boss summons and faction bosses will never attack each other, they're not hostile to each other
---
You’re so dense. Why should only one faction be able to play as a group? 
---
And please spare me the “I’m a poor alliance on a pvp server and the horse ganked me” speech
---
Alliance sulfurious has a guild called the late night crew who run raids starting at 12 server. I know this isnt exactly what u want but they are active and could be useful for ur nights off as well as n active guild for ur early morning post work gaming times.
---
This is wrong. https://youtu.be/nxZOOXLuGdo
---
Merry Christmas!
---
This seems like complete trash lol
---
Me too. Priests,mages,druids'? Can also buff
---
Dire maul tribute? I personally don’t think so. Everything has has 1% crit while SGC and the blood guard chest having 2%. T1 doesn’t even have that. I wouldn’t trade them for t1 unless I had the full set.
---
Get into a AV discord, at this point 85%+ serious well geared good players with epics mounts are. Regular AV ques are filled with afk and shitters or games with less then full raid b.c the premades dropped que to get a better player comp.
---
Leveled 51-60 doing brd three boss, and well past 300 pure arena runs still no SGC....
---
Galaxy brain: theres no difference.
---
I was gonna say, airplane wifi is *awful*. Last time I was on it struggled to even load youtube videos. It's great to still be able to text and shit from the air and reddit but that's about it.
---
idunwanit
---
this is nearly every fucking week at this point, this is the huge deal for a lot of people, but fuck them though, you know they are just a small indie company and they dont have the funds of the manpower to keep a 15 year old game running.
---
Hes going holy prot so massive mana pool. I run this spec and in pvp gear I have 7k mana
---
Wrongoo. Why do people assume I am even on a PvP server lmao
---
Thank you! :3
---
Yess! Vindication. My friends told me I'm losing my mind. I found a post about changing it on the retail client. Gonna give it a whirl when I log on next.
---
&gt;The only setting that changed for me logging into 8.2 was that my cursor was now HUGE, so in case that happened to others as well with this patch, here's how you can change it:
---
&gt;/console cursorsizepreferred 0
---
&gt;Change the number at the end to any of -1, 0, 1, 2 for different sizes (-1 is "auto detect" apparently, 0 is smallest, 2 is biggest).
---
Why did honor not roll over?
---
Thank you mate, happy holidays! :D
---
Oh nice! Get that to 275 so you can mine Rich thorium nodes, and you can mine out in the world ([scroll down to the 250-300 for some mining routes](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/mining-classic-wow-1-300)
---
Or, if ur in a guild make a friend with a shaman and do some DME jump runs as there is guaranteed Rich thorium nodes at the end of the instance. 
---
We are in a pretty similar boat, as I'm relying on mining for gold atm. Also do endgame quests as most of them give 3-5 g at turn in, which adds up. Notably, the Duke Hydraxis quest line is really nice with the gold turn ins, and prepares u for MC as well.
---
You know, after getting flamed the 17,000th time for calling for the mob that is fighting at stone hearth GY to recap the towers, or the mob at FW GY that has been stalled by a Horde turtle to send 10 people back to stop the 8 Horde from back sporting our base, frankly, I’ve given up.
---
But by showing how quickly the practical advantage disappears, it logically follows that player two only has an advantage *because of the first roll.*  
---
I think the comment was criticizing the lack of conciseness that others were demonstrating.  you could easily explain it by saying: player 2 has an advantage because player 1 rolls first and therefore has an "extra roll".  That's as concise as you can be with words, but some people still won't understand.  summarizing data points in to a graph is a much better medium for portraying the necessary information for understanding this concept.  It's also much easier to look at than a wall of text.
---
Ah what? Noooo haha I didn't know that. Well then I guess it's not really an addon, but I still learned a lot and it felt good when it worked :)
---
If you have any idea on how to extend the functionality that is already in the game to actually make it an addon, let me know
---
1) DM E soloing only shines when you can mine the rich thorium veins after the last boss for those arcane crystals. Herbalism doesn't add nowhere near the gold amount that mining those veins does.
---
2) Warlocks don't really farm lashers in DM E. They go straight for hydrospawn -&gt; zevrim -&gt; alzzin -&gt; mine -&gt; repeat. Optionally add up to 3 hellcaller packs for demonic runes/felcloth. If you won't be mining, don't do alzzin and do Lethtendris instead. 
---
3) It's a matter of practice and gear. Better gear = more room for error. I would not recommend to do it as a fresh 60. People can farm DM E as SM/Ruin, but you're going to have a bad time with not much experience and a low amount of health and spell power.
---
Ok, should I just be farming the bosses in Mara or is there trash I should be go for as well?
---
You put it on Warlocks in 5man dungeons because you can keep it up continuously without it affecting your 5sr.
---
So I've reached level 58 and I've done almost all quests in eastern and western plaguelands and wintersping. What to do now? Should I do Scholomance or Stratholme as level 58 to level? Also does AV grant any experience?
---
The general consensus seems to be ~20-22 AP = 1 crit, meaning 24 AP is about the same or slightly better than 13 agi.
---
There is lots of gear though that is mail or plate that is used by warriors in other aspects of the game.
---
I cant really tell a warrior to back off my Eldritch Reinforced Legplates or Vambraces of the Sadist. They are marvelous PvP items, but a rogue can not wear it. Any sensible DPS warrior would bag these items for PvP purposes or general use in dungeons in which you often fight lvl 56-59 mobs who only need 5% hit. So you pack some plate gear to be able to tank damage when you constantly pull aggro with sweeping strikes + whirlwind crits.
---
I tell you, there are a lot of items that have uses outside of raid DPS that warriors would want to roll on and compete with me.
---
warriors do big damage
---
https://youtu.be/4kB7N8Up_Hk 6:53
---
You don't want those shit heads on your server.
---
I don't, but I did laugh at this
---
I did that shit 15 years ago. I’m not doing it again. I’m functionally done lol
---
Oh sweetie, are you really attempting to say that GCDs are an excuse to click?
---
Are you really that special or do you actually believe the things you type...?
---
Organizing 40+ people in any activity amd doing it well is a skill though that makes guilds stand apart from each other. And if they transfer to a more alliance balanced server even though lotus is still heavily contested there’s a higher chance of alliance getting it and it ending up on the alliance ah for better market supply. Given the sotuation on stalaag i wouldnt be suprised if horde had complete control over the spawns and alliance is starved from even purchasing any.
---
This is badass, so many good parts. Love all the kills, deaths, sound fx, music, noises, extreme zooms, random texts. 
---
Fkn awesome video and not just a "look at me kill ppl".I need to watch your others.
---
Lol. Why are you mad that you're bad at this game?
---
It seems maybe more horde populated but out in the PVE world seems like ally is more.
---
Can a macro Target someone that whispers you? Looking for easy Power Infusion selection/casting. All my searching just yields the cast *then* whisper msg. Thank you.
---
I dont care if you click or use a weird center brick UI. But being all "im better cause I click" is just too far dude lol.
---
You aren’t an asshole. He overreacted. He would eventually win on enough greed roles to cover his repair cost. 
---
That being said, I’m a tank and every time I die it costs over 1 gold towards repairs. I was at 25% durability yesterday and had a 9 gold + change repair.  Just shedding light on how expensive repairs can be.
---
It really could've being communicated better. 
---
But seeing how the warrior is level 58 and wears a crappy lvl 52 leather head (Ghostshroud), the warrior probably didnt even bother as the lowbie warrior wouldve needed on everything anyways (Reiver Claws, Ribsteel Footguards, the Nicker for PvP, Blackcrow of both PvE and PvP etc.).
---
But yeah, was kinda douchy to just kick him before talking it through.
---
So what's the counter to elemental shamans?
---
What are some changes that would definitely improve the experience?
---
The lack of new players will eventually become a problem on every server. Of course there are new players trying WoW Class for the first time but their numbers are magnitudes smaller compared to the user growth 10+ yesrs ago.
---
&gt; Renew &gt; Rejev because you get an extra tick from it which makes it more mana efficent.
---
Going to disagree here. Renew has an extra tick, but it scales worse per tick. Both get 100% coefficient, but one gives 25% per tick, the other gives 20% per tick. If you keep HoTs refreshed, Rejuv will significantly outheal renew.
---
To be fair your fur is thick AF
---
Oh how the tables have turned, get gud mate.
---
That’s how it works in retail, but we have yet to see a blue post confirming or denying how it will work in Classic.
---
This feature already exists. You simply need to surrender before you queue.
---
Doesn't really matter, whatever server Grizzly goes to will be a higher alliance population where they know they can dominate. Stalagg only has 4 Bracket 14 slots right now, assuming the guild is committed to supporting the rankers in it, it makes sense and is in the best interests of the guild to transfer somewhere that they can achieve that goal faster.
---
Trust me, many of us wish we could too, the problem is the itemization still sucks at this point in the game, and to get hit capped, especially pre-raid, we don't have many options.  One of the things that makes me a successful DPS warrior is knowing to let the tank get aggro and knowing when to slow DPS so as not to pull aggro.  As any DPS warrior should, I pay way closer attention to my threat meter rather than my DPS meter.  I am, though, very much looking forward to getting my lionheart so I can at least toss out some of this leather.
---
It's so strange. It's like reading fan fiction. I wish we were as powerful as some people seem to think we are.
---
Single target healing vs raid healing, are they both similar in terms of difficulty? I am trying to choose between Pally + Priest, will choosing one of the other mean I am more likely to have to single target vs raid heal?
---
Waste of gold. You could get 300 tailoring free making runecloth bags.
---
What do you think about fire mages and the ignite debuff that only one mages takes up? It feels kind of bad to me. When do fire mages get relevant? Am I forced to go fire when this comes in?
---
&gt;I am almost friendly
---
Casual crying....
---
At least you *get* whispers. My realm is packed with tanks and healers. Everyone is always looking for warlocks and hunters and mages.
---
Hey now I wasn't mentioning any names!
---
Ranking isnt calculated at reset and never has been. Its calculated like 1 AM on reset day
---
You are not behind the curve. It is reasonablly easy to catch up.
---
But if you are a pure pve player (I was in tbc/wotlk) pve is pretty lame in classic honestly. Everything is just way too easy and simple.
---
But maybe it gets more fun with bwl. Which is comming soon.
---
takes a while when you never win any of the matches, and they always end up in turtles.
---
I even did all the quests for extra rep and I am human xd
---
That's a hot take coming from the clicker with that UI pal. Come back when you can write a mouseover macro.
---
Oh and please say you are on US servers, stay out of my AV games!
---
so the people who have less honor then i do but are a higher ranking is a result of what?
---
Saw this last night on benediction. Sadly I couldn’t skin them.
---
Alternatively, you can also surrender before you log in or even before you install. Hope that helps.
---
Pvp isn't painful, it's joyous.
---
Hey I'm making a guest appearance lol.
---
Sorry about your group. I was actually in a different group here fishing for jed ID but didn't get so we disbanded.
---
Add me if you wanna run some dungeons sometime!
---
You can't just look at some mana efficiency values and take them as a fact, since it depends on your spell power.
---
Spell power scaling is as follows:
---
Base cast time of spell (3s for higher rank LBs) divided by 3,5, so in case of LB the coefficient is 3/3,5=0,857
---
That means the damage of your LB regardless of rank (disregard the very very low ranks) is increased by 85,7% of your spell power.
---
An extreme example would be having let's say 1000sp. Your r10 LB would hit for about 1500 and your r7 for maybe 1400. (Values not accurate, but just to make a point) 
---
Tldr: the more sp, the higher mana effieciency on lower ranks, since they get the same amount of extra damage/healing as a higher rank, while retaining the low mana cost.
---
Are you good at WoW? Most guilds are looking for good players rather than class stacking. If you are a skilled shadow priest, farm your pre raid BIS and come prepared to raids there is no reason you shouldn't be able to raid as shadow. Put in the work, enchant your gear and someone will pick you up.
---
1 agi = 1 ap. 29 agi = 1 crit.
---
I like redoubt for the visual for reck stacks tbh
---
You are my Queen
---
I will momentarily snap back to my character when jumping but have never had a LoS issue or the not recognized thing. Might be a ping problem idk
---
Took me a few there too. Kept having to run back and forth for mats, it was pretty annoying.
---
Buying on g2a or a physical game card and giving the code is the best option imo.
---
But 40vs 40 is painful because WOW is not really well designed for that.
---
Capping SH almost guarantees a 40vs40 grindfest in the bridge, which is not fun.
---
Defending in Galv and then pushing north to victory IS fun.
---
But I need rep for the free epics
---
after that I will never queue AV again
---
You. I like you. Marry Christmas
---
Wait til you discover you can macro it to a button
---
You're doing God's work. People see you as another afk but I see you removing afker's which will be replaced by potential active players.
---
Were you killed by a troll warrior by any chance?
---
That might be, I’m not sure. I’m just used to logging in after servers come back up to see if I gained a rank from the previous week. 
---
This has not happened this week.
---
it's common decency. plus we are well into the game that you would not be expecting that anymore
---
I'm in a mostly raiding/PvP guild on Grobbulus, but we ocassionally do RP events as well. This problem broke a secret santa event that ended up being fun anyways, but way more annoying to manage because of this. Support.
---
I think they sell gift cards so all he needs is a code for blizzard balance to add to his sub
---
Are you me? I had this exact situation last night. I wasn’t sure originally so I greeted but the devilsaur is better by a about 5 dps
---
Haha
---
Lol Idc about this nerd shit I was just being a dink
---
yeah go to herod
---
The best part is you guys wiped washed up and were willing to let garbage horde pugs of fucking rando guilds get Azuregos instead of Washed Up and these dipshits believe you sell bosses lmao.
---
I got an 50 euro gametime code on g2a. Can I redeem on my own account and gift sub to friends with it? Or gift part of the amount once redeemed?
---
sure. idc as you don't run w/ them. but if you did, just give them a heads up.
---
it was the mage named North
---
When would this have happened?
---
If you're only "almost friendly" you might have the epics by the time p3 hits.
---
Tanks don't care. They move on put 1 message in lfg and have 10 people instantly /w them.
---
During the harpy farm
---
1) To buy tier 1, so you don’t burn dkp/epgp/etc.
---
2) consumables
---
3) a second epic mount. I know my Tauren is going to look awesome on an epic org wolf.
---
4) BiS BoEs. Edgemasters, wardens staff, sash of mercy, etc don’t buy themselves.
---
I could go on.
---
Of all the things you could be doing, you choose to copy-pastebold-texted insults about a spec you don't like in a 15 year old video game?  Fuckin' sad, dude.
---
The terrain gives Alliance an advantage in this race, they will always win the race unless they fuck up.
---
not if we add a surrender function so matches last max 10 min instead of 1 hour.
---
that way we still get some rep from surrendering, might even be able to kill Galv in a few matches.
---
I was in a different group no hate pls :( just happened to be in screenshot
---
Because the cheapest epic mount requires AV rep.
---
Thats not how probability works. The chance of getting it to drop depends on the chance the right boss spawns
---
I actually think the dwarf lore and stuff like that is pretty alright. But the quests and bosses and general mobs are pretty meh. I think the final boss is interesting because it's not necessarily COMPLETELY braindead. Most of my friends hate the dungeon though.
---
No, like time date? Because I did get yeeted by one during lunch break yesterday.
---
Actually shaman are one of the only classes which really can do top-tier dps or healing, many paths indeed.
---
The nicest thing with the 21/30 is the lack of respec needed ever. U heal very well in 5 mans and raids, you can aoe grind/ farm really well dm/e lashers and tank all 5 man content well. As well as being the best spec for pvp healing in my opinion. I use this because I heal in raid and pvp as that's my fav thing to do but I use the prot parts to make me money with 1st orb live res runs and the dm/e farm
---

I've been running it for a minute, haven't even seen gorrosh yet.

Eh, Horde is even a long game + win or quick game loss, with loss giving ~168 reputation. That is with a 15 min queue.

I think you got to up your game and quit QQ.

No. Level a warlock.

Don't get all passive aggressive about other people's drama and no one will bother you.
---
If there was a better way to organize, communicate, etc, i.e. making a premade... then a big pvp fest works well, and even in a "turtle" it wouldnt last long bc you can call targets and work together. But herding 40 cats, as they say, is difficult and that's where it can get frustrating.
---
Yesterday. Somewhere, must have been evening for me. Amsterdam time.
---
1: Agreed.
---
2: Never underestimate the power of a 150-200 horde zerg against a weakened ~60 man raid.   
---
Azu is particularly rough since Org is so close there's just a constant stream of players piling up.
---
You bastard, lol
---
Right - it's all percentage based, but R5 is not that high. A casual should be able to gain at least some progress in the R5 range. High or low pop server doesn't matter. It's where your honor compares, percentage-wise, to others on your server. My server is so competitive that 200k is basically nothing and almost no rank points are gained.
---
There are plenty of servers, both high and low pop, where 200k would get you half a rank at R5.
---
It may refer to the actual sewer entrance in UC
---
Consumables. Once we get more and harder raids we'll be burning way more money on them.
---
Based on the number of people who thought this was funny you’re on the right track.

I’m a very fun guy

&gt;That is pvp as it should be.
---
Don't claim how pvp should be. You want to sit there with your thumb up your ass for 4 hours, go ahead. I rather get my wins out of the way.
---
Warrior Charge. Warrior smash. Enemy dead. Warrior good in pvp but need Lot of FAPing or heal. Get nice and sexy priest then u good. Orc Masterrace though.
---
I did that.. then got ganked in burning steppes ;(
---
**AV** 
---
- Marshalls and warmasters removed. 
---
- Graveyards and towers/bunkers now take 30 minutes to cap.
---
- Bonus honor for killing Lts increased by 200%.
---
- A wall has been added down the middle of the map to better keep PvP from happening.
---
- Fish are now 50% more likely to be caught when fishing naked
---
- Snowballs have been removed from current and future versions as this adversely diminished the ability to AFK to rank 14.
---
- Alliance now have the option to queue as a 40 man raid. 
---
- Queue functionality has changed such that Horde players are now guaranteed to not be entered into the same instance as anyone in their group or raid.
---
- Range of horde archers has been reduced by 50% as it was found that they would sometimes hit alliance players which was not intended.
---
- Terrain has been adjust to make exploiting "back door" paths easier.
---
- The iceblood chokepoint now dismounts all Alliance when they enter the region.
---
- Restrictions have been added to Horde to ensure that no more than 10 players are ever in the northern half of the map at any one time.
---
- All alliance base turn-in NPCs have been moved to be directly on top of the Aid Station flag
---
- An additional alliance lvl 61 elite Commander has been added and is stationed directly in the middle of the bridge.

Do you use heroic strike « abuse » that caps your hit for Hogg hand too?
---
I find that, as a warrior, the best way to farm gold is to level a mage alt. It doesn't take long to get to 42 by aoe farming, then you can start farming ZF GY for very steady cash flow.
---
If you don't have time to level another character, I have had some minor success farming SM. It's decent gold and you will occasionally get whispers from low level players asking to pay for runs through the dungeon.
---
I thought this was more commonly known, but I have seen so many people ignore this it's dumb:
---
As a warlock, your felhunter has a dispel. It can dispel positive effects from enemies, OR negative effects from allies and you. Basically you can use this to dispel a polymorph from yourself, or your healer. You can remove dots. You can remove absorbs from enemies. Any magical effect can be removed, even when you're in CC yourself. 
---
Just take it off autocast, keybind it, and use it wisely!
---
Too laggy and uncontrollable to do PvP. So it's better to farm stuff and earn some money or whatever while you wait for the BG to end
---
What a 5head.
---
Nope.
---
In the same boat as you.
---
We do SK and wish list bidding. I had to blow my top bidding place on the leather fire resis shoulders from domo despite the fact that absolutely no one needed it. Was kind of bummed when T2 Warrior Legs dropped and lost my bid. Then a few runs later to see things no one needed (vendor strike) get open rolled. Still paying for that bid as I have lost. T2 Legs, T1 Legs, T1 Boots (twice) and now T1 Chest and shoulders twice too. It's been brutal.
---
With proper healing Addons they will be similar in difficulty, which is not particularly difficult either way.
---
Priests have AoE healing for the raid while pallies will be spamming flash of light over and over.
---
The more difficult parts of healing are predicting when damage is taken, canceling so you don't get sniped, and mana management. 
---
I wouldn't worry too much about tank vs raid healing, you may be assigned to either with both classes depending on raid composition. Choose whichever class you think will be more fun as a healer.
---
I've healed as priest in vanilla and really enjoyed it, they are amazing healers with great utility. Pallies are the most mana efficient and have amazing buffs. Right now I'm playing druid and they are the "worst" of the 3 healers ally side but I'm still having a great time, mostly raid healing. Hope some of that helps.
---
lol I bought the game last night after a kief bowl. Couldn't figure out how to switch to classic, cancelled the subscription bought it again on the alternate account then I figured it out lol.
---
I only played this game until lvl 25, never had the means in hs to play a subscription game. I loaded it up and seeing the old login brought back nostalgia I didn't know I had. I'm currently playing with a friend that's played a ton of WoW before and it's a blast lol.
---
They specifically tell you not to stream video because the bandwidth is too small.
---
See for the utility ones I just prefer to show all my hot bars, scale them down, and individually bind the button but same same I guess
---
I’ve had some glorious ones usually around 30 minutes. Sadly the longest was no more than 45.
---
Shit. This game loves you too.
---
I’m a mage. Need someone to make water then repeatedly press frostbolt and occasionally decurse? I got you.
---
Yeah, im not really sure any class besides hunter can solo DM:T by themselves. The whole thing relies on the ability to completely reset aggro every 30 seconds in the time it takes the bosses to run back and forth between you and your pet, so that you and your pet never get hit. Also not sure how any class could even get to the final boss without feign death and pet sacrificing. Could be wrong though, people come up with new stuff all the time.
---
Spriest makes more sense than having someone do holyweave spec, which isn't great for anything but MC right now.  You don't need to respec.   If you have a priest just raid logging anyway they can holyweave, or if they're hardcore enough respec, or rotate duty but that's a pain in the ass vs just taking a spriest.  
---
Spriest is still on dispel duty for some fights, and needs consumables for mag and rag most likely.  A couple  mana pots and one or two runes isn't much to ask, though.
---
Good fucking riddance. Goodbye to those colluding fuckers. 
---
Also, the server isn't dead.....the alliance on the population is dead.
---
/afk
---
Is it 1am?
---
It was in terms of good will for the server.  We decided to do it for tips and the second set of plans were sold to the horde, as they hadn’t gotten a single set of plans to drop yet. Got a lot of hate alliance side for that one. You’re right though, Pagle wins overall.
---
It's cool man, that problem got worked out. Horde gets paid to kill the NPC on a schedule now so guilds can turn in head at an appropriate time, lol.
---
People are expecting it now more than ever actually, because the tank spots are even scarcer than before when raids were working on their core raid inviting warriors allotting them raid spots based on attendance. A warrior online 24/7 in the beginning had good chances to become 2nd or 3 tank.
---
A warrior running random pugs to gear himself aspiring to become raid tank is chasing a dream. It's not gonna happen in the vast majority of cases. MT is the most fiercely defended raid spot in any guild.
---
10 gold( dats a lot i think
---
Prayer of healing is Niche as fuck but I do like to pop inner focus and get that big dick party heal off.
---
Always wanted to do elemental raiding. But also caved to resto so I had a raiding slot.
---
The color text of the emote is very unclear, and if there is all kind of stuff going on it is inaudible. White text is way more visible. 
---
But if a tank doesn’t wait it is his repair bill anyway, so if it keeps reoccurring he keeps dying a lot.
---
I'm not saying that it's completely ridiculous more so it is objectively worse design than some of the other choices.
---
I think devilsaur are better DPS wise, but depends on your other gear and if you need the equip bonuses from blade masters.
---
It all depends on the bracket size and how much honor people are making on their server
---
PVP = Gnome, and it's not even close.
---
How many people need to click and how quickly does it happen? 
---
Also, who needs to be alive to do it?
---
Had a group that had like 20 people channeling with just the main Druid alive and no summon happened.
---
I'm sure it will be for a day or two. You can't honestly think they are xfering now for bwl coming out, and then later the AQ event. Probably jumping the gun on that.
---
Glad someone else mentioned it.
---
And then had to flex a second time on reddit? I think I'd group with the other guy.
---
I am, so the question stands
---
plane attendants are basically the cops of the sky and I don't listen to cops
---
But much much easier than the burning blade insignia. At least the crocs don’t chain cast shadow bolt and have annoying void walker pets.
---
I disagree about brez, the whole point of that spell is to bring someone back with the ability to instantly rejoin a fight. But even then the seeds are fairly cheep, it's less than a gold for a stack of ten I believe. But encouraging people to gimp on spelled can significantly slow down dungeoning.
---
It's percentage based, so green will have like a 17% chance of skilling up compared to a 34% chance for yellow and so on.
---
Sash of mercy replaced by corehound belt soon :o
---
MID OR FEED
---
Gainastyle knows what's up! Merry christmas!
---
It's not better honor
---
Where is the naked, level 1 alt made exclusively for bank space running to TB?
---
Love the style of this piece, good job m8.
---
LOL
---
I'd just run end game dungeons you need pre BiS gear from. Just announce in LFG or to the leader you are 58/59 so they don't decide to take someone else later when they find out and decide they only want 60s. Shouldn't happen too much though.
---
All classes can be fun, you just need to focus on end game and forget about everything else. Soul shard farm is the least of your worries.
---
True. But if you want top parses now those BiS items will need to be part of your toolkit.
---
No one stops your from /afk-ing.
---
I doubt they are going to transfer to a low pop pve realm.
---
  A few moments later...
---
At 4 am server time. Every time. I'll never get a chance to take one down lol
---
lmao I just noticed that
---
It’s better honor than losing 30 AV pugs, and way more fun than AV premades.
---
Your comment honestly got me. 
---
Maybe we’ve just had such totally different experiences raiding that have lead us to different conclusions. My guild has 2 raid teams, one of them lead by the 2 MTs, one of them lead by a dps and co-lead by an OT. The one lead by the tanks does better for a few reasons, but my gut tells me the biggest one is that it helps tremendously when your tanks are expected to be proactive about making decisions and have the authority to tell everyone in the raid to do what they say.
---
I’m not saying different organizational styles can work; there’s a lot you can do with 40 men. However, I think that the personality/skill that qualifies a person to be a leader also makes them a good tank, and good tanks are vital.
---
You’re an idiot.  Get fucked.
---
oh god, windowed without fullscreen
---
When I was gearing I actually ran quite a lot with warriors, especially in UBRS as a fresh 60 arms warrior did really good DPS with shaman support. 
---
And personally I asked them if they can pass on items such as the Chromatic Carapace and Legplates of Valor. And if they did, they could come along absolutely. I enabled ML before killing the boss, assigned myself the PvP items I needed and rolled off the loot that a rogue would've contested. That way it didnt matter if a warrior or a rogue was in my group as both would've rolled on the raid DPS items anyways. Only the tank gear, plate, mail and PvP items were not up for rolls for the warrior who wanted to attend.
---
Time's out. Let's do it.
---
Counterpoint: I like seeing giant lore/setting pieces off in the distance.  It builds a satisfying mystery for when you're strong enough to finally go there and learn just what it was.
---
That's just classic drop rate at its finest
---
I think a high pop PvE realm would be the easiest to rank on. Although some of their members would probably complain.
---
I was never a big vent fan, I preferred teamspeak.
---
Or was it the other way around? It's been 13 years..
---
If a fight is going so wrong in a five man that you need them to come back at full health so you don't wipe, your probably still gonna wipe. 
---
In a raid it's probably best for the big boy acrorns. But that's a different story.
---
Tanking is always calculated at 8am pst on weekly reset, at same time as raid lockouts.  Sorry you don’t understand.
---
It works on ony too!
---
I’d go furor first and have a cancel + shift macro.
---
Also help to have a weak aura or some kind of similar overlay that will show you your mana, while in bear. So you can see if it’s safe to shift quickly for free rage.
---
Definitely not too late. People are always leveling up alts and will continue to run this phase of end game content for gear, mats, and other stuff. 
---
Just make sure you pick a good high pop server so you have people to do elite quests and lower level dungeons with while leveling.
---
My favorite gank is pallies. Viper sting to OOM and watch em flounder while I run circles :^)
---
I played from around 10am to 12pm sunday and got about 110k. You can definetly push harder but 170k seems very hard especially with 15m queues.
---
Tbh mate I just say fuck everyone else and level how you want. In sure you'll still find a spot in dungeons and raids. I've just rerolled to paladin and going straight up ret.
---
Did you read OP? Dwarf vs human, he didn’t mention gnomes
---
You got to control the game for 4 weeks, now you're stuck in queue, and the alliance who got stomped get an advantage of premades being possible because of instant queues that you created yourself. Roll alliance then, even the population, don't come crying now after you had your fun. No one helped the Alliance players getting farmed by the zug zugs.
---
Also troll resto shammy that is stoned 100% of the time I'm playing, also agree.
---
Pretty sure flurry procs proc a main hand attack, no?
---
You could have sold the bags.
---
I have.  These are literal dogshit excuses.
---
it's simply amazing.
---
during P2 the alliance got farmed all over the place.
---
during P3 the hardcore players are trying ( successfully) to exclude casual PvP'er from their AV matches... and WSG is filled with horde premade.
---
On top of that, with the longer queues , horde has begun roaming in the open world again... meaning casual-ish alliance jus get owned 24/7 wherever they go.
---
You seem to get "full" xp as long as no other players are nearby. I needed the quest reward wand on my 51 priest and was getting about 300 xp per kill, plus rested bonus.
---
So your argument is that someone who uses optimized macros, keybinds and UI layout is the person who is bad at the game?
---
Ma dude, I saw the skinning animation on your toon as you dismounted. Also you never helped me kill it.
---
Then why remove your post?
---
I am all for the fishing naked buff
---
The harpies drop coin. There's a quest in the cave as well.
---
I have it macro'd as a warrior just to be a little shit.
---
It’s like a limerick or something xD
---
&gt;...to level a mage alt
---
xD
---
While you may technically have a point, all those examples are plain stupid and make you sound like you play a Rogue (flash powder, lol!). 
---
/Healer
---
lol you deleted your original post because you didn't know they actually explained everything :P
---
Haha yeah dont pick druid, we can do everyrhing😃 ppl will tell you that its not optimal, but who cares  when you can do it all😃 play what you like the fantasy of, enjoy the game! Who cares its not 0.1% optimal😃
---
4 alliance slots, I have no idea how many the horde have, but I'd guess at least double.
---
Feels wonderful to be on the opposite faction to you and your lot tbh :)
---
What?
---
Server name?!
---
No I didn’t..
---
So does it just fail sometimes? Because I’ve definitely tried it before and it didn’t work, and no I was not in an instance
---
WSG
---
cross-realm was bad enough
---
RFD - you can kill the last two bosses solo and can make about 30g/hr
---
He's not entirely wrong, when you're well buffed and potted you shouldn't have an issue maintain HS while weaving in BTs.
---
You are pathetic
---
Doesn't really seem like Grizzly's style, but it's not my guild, just commenting on my train of thought.
---
Man last time I healed while stoned I kept forgetting what I was even doing half the time. Luckily healing was mad easy around that time. I think it was wotlk maybe mop. It’s been a while luckily illinois legalizes next month so I can do it all over again.
---
This♡
---
Good God the Lotus situation is gonna escalate, it's 60-80g NOW when nobody NEEDS it.
---
I look forward to seeing more of your work. :3
---
Yes you did, your original post crying about Blizzard has been deleted.
---
It's fun to not be a 1-button rotation presser, and i've always liked a challenge. I'm currently in a guild with 5 warlocks on the main roster which makes my spot secured for future content :) PvP is my main focus at the moment which fits perfectly.
---
Quality mark outs, don’t wanna get your account hacked
---
Make a GM ticket and appeal it. If you didn’t break ToS it will be lifted.
---
Quit while you're ahead! You should try out drug dealing.
---
Mods must still be asleep lol
---
Behind weekends used to be a thing where they'd give extra honor and rep during certain times,  but I haven't heard definitively if they're coming back for classic
---
People say you shouldnt do to poor performance, but Im willing to bet most guilds except for the most min/max sort will have a ret pal or two or ele/enh shaman. They are inferior specs, but at the moment, you dont need min/max. So to say you cant get in due to DPS is wrong. However, despite this, you may not be able to raid as spriest. 
---
The reason you may not be able to play spriest is due to debuff limit. Simply put, there are far too few debuff slots to let anyone go ahead and chuck out whatever they want. Now, if you roll a spriest in your raid, yea, youre going to have to allocate some debuff slots to him so he can function. However, there isnt any raid benefit to giving more debuff spots to a second, third, etc. spriest. To the contrary, its a detriment since those slots can be used for more important things (lock %dam curses, sunders, FF, etc.). What all this mean is that a raid is likely to have just one spriest. Now, if you find a guild lacking one and they are willing to give you that spot, great...but be ready to get some rejections just to the mechanics of the game preventing more than one spriest.
---
Also, as others have pointed out, classic isnt a game where you can close your eyes and pretend like you dont have certain skills. If your class can heal/dispell/whatever, you should expect to do so. (This one is a peeve of mine) Hybrids as standalone DPS are not awesome in classic, however, versatility makes them desirable. If a fight has tons of AoE damage and extra heals are needed, or tons of magic debuffs being applied and dispellers are needed, well, your personal DPS, regardless of how high (and it wont be high anyway) is minor compared to saving multiple people from mechanics. So, if you absolutely dont want to heal/dispel, then dont play a class capable of such, since its very likely youll be asked to do so.
---
You will see more of this around max level. Just be careful around those druids, some people don't even announce that they will roll ok healer loot. Really sucks if you do a dungeon for the 10+th time with just one healing piece you need, and the first time it drops some douche bag grabs it out of nowhere.
---
If you knew from the start you could just look for a different group.
---
And yes, tanks do pay a lot more in repairs. Healer here, if it was not clear.
---
dwarf &gt; gnome by far
---
Since Blizz never seems to do anything about PvP until it starts affecting PvE ... maybe the long queue times forcing horde to go back to camping flight paths will get them to do something about AV.
---
Meditation / Imp Healing / Shadow Weaving?
---
I'm close to that and it feels gimpy. Granted my gear is shit, and I used to be a heavy raider in vanilla, so perhaps my comparison point is skewed, but I do not feel like I am contributing at all with stacking shadow weaving and then occasionally healing / dispeling.
---
Found it, the macro also had /startattack on de 2nd line. I moved that down
---
    /equipslot...
---
    /cast Charge or switch stance
---
I feel like a stylistic choice is a bad reason to spend even MORE time ranking to 14. I often wonder how people can rank to 14 while managing their real life. Then I realized. They just don't.
---
It's not great for pvp.
---
Yea dude lets tank in berserker stance. Why do people who are fucking clueless about things comment?
---
Don't afk AV farm.  If you want to play the game,  actually play the game.  If you don't,  then don't. 
---
Asking if you should play the game while planning to actively not play is a confusing approach.
---
They make a profit by having mage friends (or alt accounts) and restricting the service to capitol cities. Custom summons are a larger fee.
---
They likely sell conjured noms on the mages and use the income to flip low quality items on the ah or pump out profession items.. in turn making them much more for little work.
---
At least that's how we used to do it on Nost. Partially rooted in assumptions.
---
Dem cheekz
---
I am so happy that I’m exalted and never have to step foot in AV again.
---
Has anyone ever actually made a decent reshade profile? With a calibrated monitor every one I've ever tried the highlights and the dark areas are crushed to hell and back. Massive bloom. Terrible color grading. If you are going to do reshade please calibrate your monitor first. If anyone can recommend a good profile i'd love to check it out.
---
Even if you had only 6% hit wouldn't deathbringer still be better than say mirahs or stormbringer? I was lucky enough to get deathbringer but getting vis or brutality blade has been impossible for me.
---
This guy's art is incredible. The detail is insane. You can look in any corner and find a story.
---
They ignored everything during the FP camp time so i assume it's gonna be the same this time.
---
There is an AV discord. I need more informations asap! I'm Pala, so I'm useful! :D
---
You would need to get to 9% hit or edgemasters handguard to sue deathbringer at 100% capability.
---
Or he has a life and his own way to enjoy way this wonderful game
---
They also forget about raid buffs. Life tapping when you have over 5k hp aint no thang.
---
I like to win.
---
8am has already passed, though.  Ranks still haven't changed.
---
Was wondering the same, as it seems we never get it right after the weekly reset.
---
What consumes will become available in P4?
---
The bots in Winterspring snatching up this and the Runecloth Bag recipe is depressing.
---
So what?
---
Put that shield on for a 5 man if needed.
---
Requires enchanting right? Small radiant shard runs?
---
4,5 minutes into the debuff: "Shit his green. *BAM! Dispell* /s got your back brotha"
---
Because the fucked it up again.
---
Hmm, not that I have noticed. I’ll try to pay some more attention to it and let you know if I notice something.
---
Exactly. Some people say it's a noob thing to backpedal but i use it for kiting warriors too. It's so satisfying to face them and watch them to bleed while they can't do nothing.
---
Not really, just use the backdoor
---
And you can easily get that. By transfering to multiple different high pop PvE realms. Then using the cross realm system to premade anyway. You can eat up all the rank 14 slots with your whole team, and have a way easier time doing it.
---
And there are people in here trying to gaslight us and tell us it’s never updated this way. 
---
No. The last few weeks have had the new rank immediately available after server restarts. This week is busted.
---
It sucks when you cast that 3 sec healing touch on your stoned ass self tho and then the tank dies a horrible death.
---
Yeah, but he didn't black out his vanish button. His account is mine now.
---
Stfu lmao.  Go play a game you like, or do content you like.
---
And then drop the other profession when you need to level Tailoring again in phase 4? That it's needed again later is why I decided not to drop Tailoring, but to drop my Enchanting for Engineering.
---
If you think they actually sold a world boss kill you are an idiot.
---
First, fuck GRIZZLY, however they are super dedicated to getting every world boss kill they can. FAR more dedicated to it than any other guild on the server except Fusion. I'm pretty sure those two guilds are working together to try and get bosses but on this shitty server where 200 horde randos show up to every Azuregos spawn that's a daunting task.
---
It means you have to engage in boxing matches with friends, sometimes to the death
---
sober wow is like.... sober fishing... which is as bad as fishing in game sober.
---
Rank 1 Flame Shock is also nice on stealth classes
---
I ranked up 7 to 8 and everything seems fine in my game.
---
Thanks in advance for not coming
---
how i like my honor, 10 at a time
---
Nah keep tailoring for bloodvine set drop whatever else you have
---
that just blizzard in general for past several years
---
dat just be da juju mon, i got mah medicinal juju card no judge.
---
Maybe y’all just picked bad servers
---
Then make your own group.
---
I plan to. Work still hasn’t said anything about it so I’m not sure how they plan to handle it, and I’m not really down with risking the job if it comes to it.
---
Why is this Grizzly guild such a big thing? Are they world first or something?
---
To be honest if your group is entirely decked in purple you will run the dungeon so fast its impossible to not make money.
---
Good luck finding a strat live group where the first orb doesn't go to the tank.
---
First, GRIZZLY is one of the most toxic groups I've ever seen on a server, ever. However, they are super dedicated to getting every world boss kill they can. FAR more dedicated to it than any other guild on the server, except for Fusion most likely. I'm pretty sure those two guilds are working together to try and get bosses but on this shitty server where 200 horde randos show up to every Azuregos spawn that's a daunting task.
---
Anyone know the quickest one for horde? I'm always flying to moonglade from org or to feralas from TB.
---
That warrior’s hoping for his Onslaught Girdle for Christmas.
---
It could be worse. I could be trash at the game, getting carried in every pvp battle then try to talk shit on reddit LUL
---
When dumb dps die a priest can Rez them more than once.
---
You gotta go up top
---
Why? Just common decency, something wich is not that important for a certain type of people.
---
amplifying it because the team is already 1 person less effective, and while he is snowballing they are 2 people less effective - i used amplifying because he has increased the unhelpfulness/afkness
---
Druids are so fun to play. I love playing one, and I love being grouped with one.
---
One of the most fun parts of being a Druid is adapting to the circumstances around you. In one questing party you might be best as a healer because there's some warriors and shamans smashing everything. In another group you might be good tank because you have DPS or heals with you. 
---
You have buffs to give. You have some CC. You have stealth. You have fast run speed as cat. You can heal. You can tank. You can mediocre DPS. You can switch between those roles (obviously not end-game content) with a simple gear change. Life is good.
---
According to [gamepedia](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Profession#Increasing_professional_skill_level) the formula is
---
&gt;chance = (greySkill - yourSkill) / (greySkill - yellowSkill)
---
So say for example you have a recipe that turns yellow at 150 and grey at 200
---
At a skill of 150 it would be 50/50=1, or a 100% chance to skill up
---
At a skill of 160 it would be 40/50=0.8 or an 80% chance to skill up
---
At a skill of 170 it would be 30/50=0.6 or a 60% chance to skill up
---
At a skill of 180 it would be a 20/50=0.4 or a 40% chance to skill up
---
At a skill of 190 it would be a 10/50=0.2 or a 20% chance to skill up
---
At a skill of 195 it would be 5/50=0.1 or a 10% chance to level up
---
At a skill of 199 it would be 1/50=0.02 or a 2% chance to level up.
---
Which conforms to my (and /u/keyserv's) experiences leveling up recipes.
---
My warrior actually leveled first aid to 299 with heavy mageweave bandages and no runecloth anything. Going from 240 to 290 was probably 10% of my total mageweave used, while going from 290 to 299 was easily 500 mageweave ---And I easily used twice that much *at* 299 given that I was 45 when I hit 299 and 56 when I finally ran out of mageweave and headed down to arathi from EPL to go learn heavy runecloth
---
Also, /u/Dankest_Pepe commented that it seems like green/yellow below 100 are more likely to grant a skill up, but this formula doesn't support that.
---
Personally I think it's probably more that there's an over-abundance of recipes at low levels and a drought at high levels, so you're not likely to craft them for as long as you do at higher levels.
---
Another possible explanation is that at high level crafting, materials are so much more expensive and craft times  are so much longer that you're more likely to notice bad luck.
---
When it starts taking 5~10g in mats and a 30 craft time to make a single glove, you're gonna feel periods of bad luck much harder than you will when you're pumping out 20 pants a minute for a total of 2 silver each.
---
I understand and you obviously haven't been reading. I understand how alliance are exploiting the system and I think they should implement 5 man queues to encourage friends from the same server to be able to at together and 5 man queues will not hurt the overall flow of anything
---
That's fair and I understand the issue hopefully they will follow the laws of your land and allow it! I am sending you massive amounts of good luck rn irl via telepathy so don't even worry about it probably.
---
Sup Boolean
---
If there is no one close they give full xp
---
Fusion isn't going anywhere right now. I don't know where you guys get your info from but the GM, Cstrike, has made it pretty clear they are hanging on for now.
---
By collapsing the blizzard raid frames and downloading Grid2.
---
I like meme specs as much as the next person and our raid actually has 2 Ret Paladins currently but man, you are really trying your hardest to convince people they don't suck when all the evidence, math, logs, stats, whatever all say the same thing:  They will never be as good as the other 5 main DPS classes.  If you had a similarly skilled(can press 1-3 buttons), similarly geared person on Warrior, Rogue, Hunter, Mage, Warlock instead of a Ret Paladin, they will be doing 2-3 times the damage, especially by the time Naxxramas comes out.  If you don't want to have all your hard work thrown away later on when Ret Paladins will be getting benched, and you actually want to start helping your guild, please level another class and put in even half as much work as it sounds like you're putting into your Paladin and everyone you know will appreciate it much more.
---
1. If every DPS in the raid was doing the same DPS as a Ret Paladin, you wouldn't be killing Ragnaros in 1 phase.  That means it's not enough DPS, you're being carried by people nice enough to do so.  There are even more DPS checks that result in instant wipes instead of just extra phases in the rest of the content that you say you don't hinder anyone in.  First example is Vael, if everyone had Ret Paladin DPS on Vael, you won't ever kill him.
---
2. All classes are expensive if they are actually using all of the consumables they can.  Rogues as an example - Mongoose, Juju Power, Juju Might, Squid, Thistle Tea, Ground Scorpok Assay are the normal ones but if you want to go really hard and squeeze out every bit of DPS, add Shadow Oil, Spell Power Flask, Greater Arcane Elixir, Elixir of Shadow Power.
---
3. Every class has utility, Ret Paladins aren't the special ones who have it all.  Warriors have battle shout, Rogues are required in BWL, Hunters have Trueshot Aura and Tranq Shot, Warlocks have Curses, Mages have decurses and AOE, Priests are Heals and Cleanses and a Shadow Priest buffs the Warlocks, Druids and heals and decurses and if they meme spec they give crit to melee or casters depending on which meme spec they go.  The only utility Ret Paladins have over a Holy Paladin is meleeing the boss to keep debuffs on that there aren't room for.  There aren't open debuff slots for Wiz and Light if you have an actually balanced raid.  And if your guild is actually using Nightfall, you give it to a few people, usually the Off Tanks and a Hunter or 2, because they both bring much more utility, Offtank switching to a shield when they have to tank/Hunters bring Trueshot Aura for melee groups and Tranq Shot on the bosses that you absolutely need it on.  Most guilds have 4-6 Holy Paladins and that's usually more than enough for cleanses and for keeping auras on groups that need auras depending on the fight.
---
4. Yes there are good and bad people playing all classes.  We have a Ret Paladin who regularly parses 95+ on bosses.  He does maybe 10% more damage than our tanks and is usually around the 15-20th DPS in our raid, while we have a few other classes parsing down in the 40s that are still doing more than a third more DPS than he does.  Ret Paladins in general are bad at DPS.  It's just a fact of the numbers.
---
5. You are comparing absolute best case scenarios to absolute worst case scenarios.  I could do the same to argue that a Rogue or Fury Warrior should get a Thunderfury over a tank because the tank is terrible or already has QS or only raid logs.  I'd still be wrong, just like you are.
---
6. This will actually start happening in BWL.  MC is a total faceroll while BWL will have some hard encounters and the first people getting benched will be Ret Paladins unless there are just horrible people in the raid who don't know how to do their 1-3 button "rotations". None of them are currently hard. Some can do much better with lining up cooldowns and such but doing the bare minimum basics on each class will out-DPS a Ret Paladin - Rogues press Backstab/keep up SnD, Warriors use WW and BT on cd/HS to dump rage/Execute under 30, Hunters use Multishot/line up Aimed Shot with autoshot, Mages press Frostbolt, Warlocks keep up your curse/press Shadowbolt, Ret Paladin Seal of Command/Judgement of Command/Consecration
---
7. Yes, it's possible to do all content with a Ret Paladin.  It's also possible to do all content with 35 people.  What most people are talking about is making the content easier instead of intentionally gimping the raid and making a lot of progression bosses have extra wipes which will make some guilds fall apart before they're able to finally get the kill.
---
Why would PvE be easier to rank on? Meta at the moment is to spam AV constantly for honour and they're all cross realm with PvP servers anyway. Whether you're standing in your capital to queue for AV on a PvP or PvE server makes no difference.
---
Macros, check xaryu on twitter

Thank you man, i put a lot of effort in telling stories inside the illustration :D
---
Is it possible to export your controller layout for others to use?
---
&gt;You play with what you can get AS THE SPEC YOU WANT TO PLAY... AT ALL TIMES.
---
What happens when everyone exclusively plays as the spec they want to play as at all times? You get 3+ hour clears. You're wrong too, most people don't want to spend hours in MC clearing trash and killing bosses that just stand there.
---
Your LFG being green makes me feel dirty.

Is there any future use for talioring after making robe of void for walocks? Currently have enchanting and talioring but looking to potentially ditch talioring for mining to make additional cash
---
:D
---
Why would anyone want this horde OR  ally?
---
Yes, when it’s no longer terrible
---
I'd buy this version of "Live, Love, Laugh" for sure.
---
Luna Unit Frames FTW
---
I usually pull both outside and run them to balinda. I can tank them for like 20 sec without heals, so I usually die.
---
I would imagine there are a lot more casual pvpers on a PvE realm.

---
is swimming! :P
---
Because we need to save our mana for when the tank is taking heavy hits or we have a bad pull. If we run OOM from a constantly lifetapping Warlock and can't do our job of saving the group, then we're going to get shit on. If the Lock dies because he lifetapped himself to death, that's at least only on him.
---
hence the reason for this post. sorry you didn't understand
---
not yet, definitely on the list!
---
I remember how fun Ele was. Lots of utility buttons with damage sources being simple and clean. No bullshit like having to keep flametongue up and fishing for Lava Surge procs or turreting weak filler spell to build up enough maelstorm to cast Earth Shock.
---
Yes. That is why spell penn was the shit in tbc i think. 
---
Where the gear actually had it. 
---
Same as weapon skill and glancing blows
---
Warriors don’t need anything from strat live really. Tanks are there for the orb only usually
---
Myzrael is great, but very lopsided alliance according to the census websites
---
&gt; First of all, if you are replying to my whole comment then you don’t need to quote me.
---
&gt; Wow again.. and whats the point? Do locks allow dps to damage without worrying about threat?
---
yes, warlocks do enough threat to allow dps to go crazy.
---
This made me smile! Thank you!
---
The queues should reset at party leader change
---
May I suggest going to r/WoW if you despise this game so much?
---
Don't come back we dont need more AFKing in BGs.
---
So the problem with your strategy is that it will be extremely difficult to find groups for Arena/Anger where you won't have competition while leveling. Definitely do some BRD runs to get Magni's Will, Deathdealer Breastplate and maybe the necklace from Emperor, but it's far better to push 60 as soon as possible and then you have the luxury of building groups designed to get the SGC. 
---
HoJ is not as difficult because it is a low drop rate on a mob that's always there. The SGC is the one that could take 300-400 runs. At 60 you can pickup a healer and duo it or a healer and a Mage for easy trios.
---
there’s always mooncloth cd’s but those are few and far between. honestly i think unless you get some rare recipe like Bottomless Bag you’re probably better off switching. Gathering professions will inherently generate more money than conversion professions, provided you can farm
---
For sure. I just think the dungeon has some merit but it's definitely up there for hated dungeons. Mostly I think the most awkward part of it is just how many relevant quests are actually technically outside of the dungeon. Feels kind of weird.
---
You got 110k in 2 hours?
---
The 9% cap is a total from all sources. Depending on your racial or other adjustments, ones hit needed to reach the cap may lower, because you have passive hit already in play.  Like the shaman talent nature’s guidance, hypothetically instead of needing an additional 9% hit from gear, you only need 6% (because you have the 3% attributed already). 
---
These gloves work as you are saying; the +7 weapons kill translates to 2~3 hit. you would still need another 6-7 hit % from gear in order to reach 9%.
---
Druid. Free gear, as guilds usually only have 1-2. You also are a badass flag carrier in pvp, and can either be a tank or a healer. There is always a demand for druids since they’re one of the most underplayed class, and have an extremely high skill cap. Plus, who doesn’t like  being a big ass bear- and then turning into a fast cheetah the very next second. Shits so fun.
---
Crit cap is not something that you will ever care about. It only affects white dmg and u will only crit cap with world buffs. With world buffs u have so much rage u hstrike on almost every auto which means all hits are treated as special attacks and as such are not subject to the crit cap
---
It was a sad day.
---
i remember reading somewhere that they weren’t gonna do them until p4/5 but i don’t have a source on that so don’t quote me
---
On fights with little damage, Locks are one of the few things keeping me engaged. Thankfully most fights I actually have something to do.
---
Feral can be “pretty good” but not as good as other classes . A Druid is definitely mans efficient.... but they are not as good healers as a priest or shaman. Druid can do it all yes.... but they suck at it.
---
My brother was in one that lasted 1h 27m, it was a good time.
---
&gt;your legit brain dead 
---
🤔
---
NUH UH, YOU DIDNT WIN!
---
RIP.  At least you have the tools to try again!
---
Haha there's some real ones every once in a while. I've stayed friends with one since vanilla. I have her on social media even, she's real lol.
---
So you’re saying you want to change the game because horde have overpopulated themselves.  
---
No.  This is a coward created problem.  You get wotf and more.  We get instant ques.
---
I personally don’t like alliance premades either.  I don’t use them and end up in groups that get hit with que dodge. That’s an automatic loss for us.  We start the match with 10 or so players. 
---
I hope horde come over soon and learn to pvp without the handicap.
---
I dunno, assuming 125 wins is from 3 flag caps - if you get 2 flag caps every loss, maybe 190? Up to potentially infinite. I think there is win bonuses though. So probably more
---
I can kill Gordok consistently in about 12-16 mins without pushing too hard, variance is mostly from buggy ass pet pulls (sending my pet in and mobs attacking me for no reason, mobs attacking my pet super early, getting dazed, etc.) and which chorush spawns.
---
You CAN quick reset by inviting someone else, logging and resetting at Gordok, but this means your inventory is going to pile up real fast and you also lose out on a few book and chests that might have spawned.
---
That being said i dont usually quick reset and just run through to check the chest and book spawns, so its usually about 16-20 mins per run.
---
Getting people mad at you is just being an asshole. Trolling is getting people to be mad at *each other*
---
Unironically. It is the best water available from vendors (not sure if there is AV water that is cheaper/usable outside of AV), and who do you think gets the shit if I don't happen to have magewater after joining a dungeon first thing I do when logging in? Believe it or not, but there is not always a mage in the group you join. 
---
And it is a metric fuckton better than glory few. Try filling 5+k Mana pools with that crap, if you are OOM you will drink 1.5 x morning Glory to get full Mana again. Why the fuck would anyone use anything but the most potent water?
---
If you think this is a 'me' problem you are either playing DPS or have not healed a dungeon with anything but a guild group for way too long. 
---
Morning Glory dew, lol..
---
Oh theres real girls for sure. I’m just saying you def don’t wanna meet them lol. 9/10 they’re dogs.
---
i may not be much to look at, but i have a way with words.
---
definitely noticed this
---
Classic is great but it's not for everyone. Retail is great but not for everyone. I'm just glad the game made it long enough to be able to offer an experience for multiple groups of people to enjoy.
---
lmaoooo
---
Anyone can use bloodvine, but the set bonus requires tailoring, correct? It's 2% crit so probably worth it, but I think you can equip the pieces without tailoring to at least get the hit? Honestly asking here
---
I love healing in classic. It's so chill. Especially smaller group content. You are responsible for your group, you are not expected to do any damage you can just chill and heal. In also wasted most of the time. Healing is my jam
---
Wtf?  A clicker calling people bad?  This is why you need those horde pvp facials.  You get shit on without them
---
No one needs anything from strat live anymore lmao
---
The biggest difference is that on PvE servers, there’s literally no way to gain honor outside of BGs now. On PvP servers, hardcore Horde rankers all need to try to get open world kills in between games. Alliance and PvE Horde just have to do more AV games than their competition and maximize their honor in each AV.
---
I'm learning to PvP lol. I successfully defended myself against a rogue for the first time. Maybe he wasn't that good. But free action potion into fear then dots and running around with the odd mind blast and smite. A few times he died to my SWP after he killed me but I count that as a victory. We 1v1 for about a half hour untill he gave up and left me to farm my water like I wanted lol
---
Haha for sure.
---
&gt; and wonder why your guild is disliked.
---
Where did I ever wonder that? I admitted the guild is disliked. I gave reasons for the guild to be disliked.
---
Priests unite!!
---
Druid or rogue for my next class?
---
I've got:
---
Main mage: does mage things and is the best class in the game bar non. Used to power level. I've got pretty much everything I want. 
---
Shaman: incredibly fun healer buy doesn't seem like it'll be funner than mage for PvP. I don't really want to do subpar DPS with enhance or play another caster with ele. 
---
19 hunter twink that does the twink things. Not really using him since no one has twinks yet. 
---
30 warrior that's a side project that's not really that fun to play. Haven't logged on in a few months. 
---
Druid seems easier to gear and flexible play patterns seem fun. Playing a PvP healer that doesn't get bent over the barrel and can be a stealthy boi seems really fun. Also trolling my guild with boomkin is really, really high up on my to do list. 
---
Rogue doing broken shit seems like it would be as fun as the broken shit I do with my mage... But gearing will probably such. I'm thinking of going mace PvP since some of the BOEs are pretty cheap for how good they are and going 2/2 devilsaur and 6/8 T0 for set procs seems like it would be pretty fun.
---
Lol dude just respec
---
Haha you can. It actually happened to me twice in a row the other day. Luckily the explosion doesn't cause durability when you die.
---
Nah. Just your mediocre players with more than the average free time.
---
&gt;as someone who understands how engineering and development work
---
Send Blizzard a resume and show them how it's done!
---
Yes you need 300 tailoring for the set bonus not the hit
---
You can do a Rank 1 Mindflay and instantly cancel it to apply Shadow Weaving.
---
&gt; Generally people who rolled on a PvE server are not going to be as serious about farming insane amounts of honor, and it's easier to place in the top brackets
---
There aren't really many 'casual' PvP players on PvE servers. It's either hardcore or nothing. The brackets are also smaller so if anything it's actually harder to rank.
---
Yup. I get that some people dont like the idea of res runs and I get that tanks could and maybe sometimes should help guildies and friends to do runs.
---
But asking total strangers to come spend 1 hour for literally 0 drops? I mean whats the point? If theres literally nothing in it for me, Im not gonna spend my limited playtime doing something that has 0 benefit. And this is not a min maxing mentality, its just a simple reality.
---
And Im not even a tank myself but I think reserving orbs in strat live for tanks is more than reasonable.
---
Medallion has a low drop rate my freind.
---
Just wait til you discover raid warnings.
---
I was planning to vote at all. Now I'm upvoting in spite of you.
---
You will want to craft the bloodvine set once ZG is released as it is the best way for warlocks to get +hit gear and will result in a significant boost in PvE dps. I wouldn't drop tailoring.
---
If you're an undead, you can actually macro food and water after cannibalize, and as long as you're out of combat, you can cannibalize, eat and drink at the same time!
---
I just need exalted, then I will never queue AV again
---
I get what you're saying but this is how you enable greedy behaviour by tanks, and if one can get away with this, others will follow.
---
Had a 58 tank asks the group wether he could have all the greens in LBRS today, we said no and we continued the group with him. It works.
---
Agree. Double ele with double disc is realy strong.  But I would replace a hunter or a lock for a 2nd mage. The reason is that a lot of allis play with 2-3 warris and mages can peel rly good for them. 2nd reason is because of the wl dot that increases cast time that the mage can dispell.  We are currently 35-0 with that lineup, going full tryhard. Its rly sad that there arent as many alli premades which makes the game rly borring. Most of us arent interesred in honor but in good fights vs rly good premades (like apes)
---
How much hit Does a Human combat sword rouge need from gear?
---
why are they talked about so much then?
---
Fucking doesn't make you smarter, dude. If anything it makes you dumber
---
I especially love that some things are just out of your reach? Is the honor system good? Well you could argue it's not. But the thing that there are things that I can't obtain just doesn't for me. What's an item worth if everybody has it? Classic is the best game ever made , god i would kill for classic +
---
Cheers brother! I’ll take a shot tonight while playing in your honor!
---
Ya that execute switch to the 2 hander made me cri a lil bit lmao
---
ZF GY? The place with sand graves? It drops grays or what?
---
G quit and find another guild my man!
---
That moment when during a dungeon the tank is low on health (because you follow the 5 sec rule like the Gospel) and you cast that beautiful Greater Heal on yourself, already full on health. Panic. Cast Power World: Shield on the tank because you do not want the tank to die - you really do not want that. Good job, now the DPS has all the aggro. Keep the DPS alive while the tank regains the aggro. Eventually all goes fine. I love/hate when this happens.
---
I opted for a Weak Aura's to track it. A bit buggy because it doesn't drop stacks on death. But overall, it's a nice addition.
---
join the ranks of underpaid blizzard employees that no longer have bonus structures.
---
:okretard:
---
I agree with you here. I'm still a bit slower than you but I can clear it in 17 mins consistently. That's still about 2-3 run per hour.

Very informational video about how honor, brackets, standings and all that jazz works.  
---
I lost 1000 RP (ranking points) this week, and since it's christmas (most of EU celebrates on the eve of the 24th, unlike other parts of the world where its on the morning of the 25th) the people in the 2nd bracket now has a very large chunk of honor to catch up to without the time to do so, meaning instead of the clean full RP they could have gotten, that 1 person just made all of bracket 2 get hundreds of RP less each. His gain was 1000 RP, but the total he fucked people over numbers maybe 5.000-10.000, of which my loss was the biggest.
---
Do you call him Mageblade now?
---
nice comment deletes
---
Keep thinking your good because you kill E-monsters with no mechanics quickly HAHA. We know who the real casual is, the one who can’t even win a duel. Shitter
---
It just cost me an extra week of playing 16-18 hours a day to reach my goal, that's as serious as it is just for myself :p
---
1%
---
Yup
---
It's fascinating in how many different ways classic is showing the degeneration of the so-called "community" - it seems that on average it's not significantly better than the private servers some of us were so desperate to escape.
---
Lol you wish
---
ret pally is a cheese class and the players who play this class would actually believe that paladins in Classic would be as strong as they were on private servers. lmao
---
Are you... trying to tell me what *I* said?
---
Lmao.
---
4 Guilds already left, and us, ToW and Fusion are also leaving. Server's dead, bud. Free xfers killed it awhile back
---
There are lots of people grinding rep and honour in the BGs at the minute.
---
And this is what lfg was like in classic. Painfully long and sometimes fruitless. Also levelling guilds tend to not want to pug instances and would rather wait.
---
Just keep adding nice people you meet to your friends list and keep in contact with them. Building a network of people with the same playstyle is super important in classic 😁
---
Don't bring a horse to an elemental fight.
---
No because using their mana or blind isnt cost anything but my raid tank gear cost a lot even if I dont die and just the mobs hit it. If you dont like it then find an other tank and thats it I dont care I will invite the next healer/dps.
---
I love burning hours on end on BRD, LBRS, UBRS, and Scholomance with people who never got to feel the pain of challenging pulls and nasty corpse runs.
---
Moonguard Goldshire that is
---
Hes not out of line to ask, but out of line to leave. But he likely got into other group instantly and didn't effect him at all.
---
If grizzly joins your server, you’ll have a lot less fun as alliance. They’re just not nice people to play with.
---
I found out that you can report the player for being inactive or something like that, after short time they will be removed because they didnt respond to the message or so that appears on their screen. This was in retail tho, but still a good function.
---
I'm just a retail lurker here but its nut how hard that dude is trying to attack you lmao some of your guildies must have corpse camped him for a while because his hate boner is strong for you
---
Do not read post, make idiotic reply.
---
You managed to check both boxes.
---
Right that is the point, at 60 druid repair bills even druid tanking repair bills, am druid tank, are never big.  Only once have I run a dungeon that didn't pay for itself just in cash and random gear drops.  I am just raging against the mindset that it is normal to not be able to cast the top level of spells cause someone was to cheap to train the spell or to cheap to by the reagent. We had a shadow priest in our guild who I only had trained his rank one res spell. He was sixty.  He got a skullflame shield drop and I told him I better not ever get rezzed by your weak heal again. Go train your abilities.  This stuff is not expensive seeds and roots and whatever don't cost that much and are negligible to gold income.  I am so thankful though that I can tank without wearing mail or plate.  I know I have it good with my repair bills.
---
Didn't blank out your HP, say goodbye to your account *idiot*.
---
AV queue times will keep growing, and it’ll be better eventually to do WSG and AB (when it releases) premades.
---
I don't mind winning 90% of my games as horde. 
---
But I'd really like to take a 2-5 man party in AV. Allow parties to queue, prevent raids from doing so if you want. Playing with purely pugs is annoying when I want to play with friends, but feel forced to Q AV instead.
---
It just feels meaningless. 
---
Ps. I could care less about any petty alliance sore losers trying to convince me or themselves of how they "rolled the right faction". So don't even try to pull any "you deserve this for playing the other faction" bullshit. Yes I deserve longer queues for playing the more popular faction. The game doesn't deserve forced soloqueue. Let parties queue on both sides.
---
can you explain this part?
---
/equipslot [nomod:ctrl,equipped:shield] 17 {offhand}
---
Now, you have moved the goal post.
---
This seems a bit unbalanced to one faction in particular... I mean how can you reasonably expect alliance players to find the correct NPC if they're all stacked up?!
---
He's an asshole but now your down another possible tank to pug with. Imo give the tank what he wants if it's a small request like this who cares if he wants the 3-6 gold or w.e it is.
---
Yeah I throw them in for safety. Just test test test homie
---
No screenshots, but my latest went something like this... 
---
Lost in a place where the wind howls and wails, (deadwind pass)
---
This place will be my eternal jail, (He's dead)
---
Where I lie you'll hear not a sound,
---
For I rest among the drowned.
---
The answer is karazhan crypts, and the person who solved the riddle won joonho's mercy.
---
Another one went something like this...
---
Gray hair and a wrinkled face,
---
I watched my boy fall from grace
---
I don't remember the rest of it, but the answer was terenas menethil
---
Harpy grinding
---
The only change that matters is to let my Druid dual-wield claws, damnit!
---
I grouped with a killer shadow priest last night. He made the mage and I look average in comparison
---
Noice
---
As a horde with AV queue time maybe. But remember: you need 10 SKILLED players and a good setup (not just some random classes) with good gear, good communications and consumables. They also need to be online for a long time if you want to farm honor. (You need to stomp every game 8minutes) it’s easier to just Afk in av for 24hour with teamviewer accshare
---
I had the same thing happen when I rerolled alliance on a PVE server. I was killing the candle weasels and I got 2 bags by level 4.
---
Yeah, all that gets thrown out the window with a Turtle.
---
Unless you have to use a flight path to get to their desired area.
---
Prattle on foot soldier. 
---
You act like there aren't people who enjoy playing roles typically sought after.
---
News flash: There are people who enjoy those roles.
---
Start your own group or don't be a dps warrior and start tanking
---
well I explained at the very top that I don't like to show my UI so where I do have buttons, I want to get the most out of that particular button
---
Yeah, you'd have to be really desperate to willingly work for blizzard.
---
When I can't find my last member I have tried something along the lines of "Totally awesome and radical group seeks a healer for groovy times and gnarly adventures with friends and good times, please whisper."
---
Not only has it worked three out of three times, two of those times I got whispers from others saying "if I wasn't in a grp right now I'd join you for sure."
---
Maybe not roll the popular kid race.
---
I don't know but our main PvP guy gets 400k honor a day from AV premades. Don't know what that quantifies add since I don't have the time to PvP.
---
Odd, my experience was more arcane crystals.
---
Yep
---
Gnomes are the entire reason I can never play alliance.
---
Eh, not on Stalagg but Grizzly's escapades are well known from the private server scene. They are disliked by quite a few people, not just me, and for decent reason. But you're right, I'll leave it here.
---
My main ranked up.  My alt is still stuck in last weeks ranking lol
---
Well, UC is a circle, you can theoretically get to anywhere in the other ring by taking a left.
---
Thanks, I hate this new meta!
---
you should do wow classic rp bro, because thats exactly what we do.
---
Titans are only 30g what magic realm are you on?
---
First time? Welcome to the addiction of expansions past.
---
Ah, ok. I can see a PI / weave build being all around utility.
---
The plague has reached Kalimdor and now they're going to return undead crocs!
---
Annoying people gravitate towards classes/specs that make up for their shitty personalities. Everyone knows that Fury is basically top damage after MC, so every jackass who was playing a hunter or PVE rogue or suicide shaman in 2004 is now a DPS warrior.
---
Like you I ended up going back to a warrior for Classic and it really has been a night and day difference. I got immensely tired of a seeing a group LFGing for a tank , I join it, and there are two other warriors in clown costume leather who will not fucking shut up about BIS-this and BIS-that, pay no attention to anything but their damage meter, and instantly get pissy if you give them any sort of suggestions or instructions.
---
DPS warriors are fine. A significant block of the people choosing to play them are horrible.
---
Mine hasn't either, it seems that some people have had their honor updated and some have not. Not really sure why that is lol.
---
Definitely not drunk. Drunk people don't use punctuation or any thing like that while typing. Have you ever read a drunk text that made sense? No.
---
That's kind of annoying but I do appreciate the role playing elements of classic. Hopefully I'll be able to get that helmet.

I’m glad I can tell my grandchildren I was there lurking in lfg chat when I saw this joke and saw someone recommended they put it on reddit. Now it’s here and I can die happy. It’s all come full circle
---
Tuneing was really weird in pservers. Some of the things scaled better since the mobs you were facing we way over tuned. Until its released we don't know what it'll be like for sp coefficients and such. Chances are all classes will be lower than in private servers but content will be much lower too. Time will tell what the difference is.
---
I don't think you know what "galvanizing" means

LFM UBRS Everything reserved - 10g buy-in to join group. Need key. Exp not reserved.

It's typically x10 the pot. Some people x10 the bet as well. Either work, the pots the proper way though.
---
Night elf ofcourse. Frontflip + improved stealth which equals to one less point in master of deception if you like to run it. I like to have equal of 3 points when i need to, so i have macro for nightscape boots and catseye goggles + 1 point in MoD. So when facing another rogue i get the sap first most of the time. There is very little wiggle room in talents when playing with daggers and cb+prep atleast. But for real, play horde and choose orc.
---
I think this is accurate to a degree but should be taken lightly. Min/maxing you may push 4-5 an hour but realistically doing a solo tribute run without high risk pulls you will only do 3. 
---
Also I do not know how you're getting 30g a run consistently, it's super RNG and you'll  need green weapons and blue weapons from the tribute chest. 
---
I think 20ish G is the average.
---
Hope they take washed up with them, they're all terrible mechanically anyway
---
I think ally go straight to galv whereas horde pull all lt/com and kill them first.
---
So tired of rank 2 ret pally telling me tactics for the BG.. please dude, just lay low, you’re absolutely useless.

Edge masters (7 skill) brings it down to 5% I believe.  https://bookdown.org/marrowwar/marrow_compendium/mechanics.html
---
Why did the priest start drinking? Why didn't the warrior bandage him? So many questions, this video gives me anxiety.
---
Let me tell you, feels extremely abnormal. As if you're playing half a class. 
---
I'd hate to imagine what rogues are like I guess, it must surely suck playing such a cd based class?
---
What idiot locks do you fight.  Coil, fear, then you have all the time in the world to dot. Hell I even grab a shard most times.
---
With all the gear available in mc elemental shaman are absolutely viable......that being said it's due to the short fights. I have raided in mc as elemental due to an overstock of healers just to help out. I haven't taken any big ticket items like toep but even with full consumes I am able to compete only on 2 min or less fights. I do very well and use FULL consumes ie dark runes, major Mana pots, elixirs, and a flask when I'm feeling frisky.
---
I don't think your math is correct based on my personal experience and I do believe elem.can be viable in most fights in bwl as half.of them aren't very drawn out. However fights like nef, chrom, and even razorgore that have longer combat time their dps.will greatly suffer.
---
I really am not biased and will be going back to healing in bwl as some healers have rl stuff coming up next year. I do believe elem can do well in mc and even bwl for the most part but beyond that they will do much less damage on larger hp boss fights
---
I started classic the being of Nov so I'm behind by a bit but I dont care. I find theres no rush for anything just enjoying my Warlock and cant eqir to start running dungeons for pre-raid gear
---
... why would they 'tweak the formula' ?
---
just pulling scenarios out of your ass?
---
Yeah just cuz I'm saying most of the times you do not need big boy resses, doesn't mean situationally you don't need em.
---
And the peeps here saying warrior repair costs aren't that much must not have even played one. I'm going through the long dungeon grinding for pre raid bis and quests I need. And within the first week I have probably spent 25+g on repairs. 
---
A warriors worst nightmare is having to spirit Rez with both your tanking set and dps set on you. GG cashstack.
---
So I tried that method and it still hasn't updated for me. Maybe they're updating everyone's randomly over a period of time, that sounds like something Blizzard would do lol.
---
I believe its nova into iceblock into just kiting with CoC. Look at youtube 
---

I'm a lock. I'm also stoned. I probably lifetap at full mana just in case ur bored.

I put together a guild event for my guild &lt;Hazard&gt; called “Hazzy Christmas” and I was in the process of gift wrapping 150 items. Ranging from actual wrappable items to plain letters as “tickets” I was 90 presents deep that morning when the hotfix came. I had written the last 60 notes and sent them all to be wrapped. When I opened them all I saw they were soul bound and started panicking trying to figure out a solution to this problem. I had 1.5 hours to figure out a way to get the tickets out there without them being plain letters.
---
We decided to use crafted white gear made by a specific person in place of the tickets so they were tagged and not dupable. 
---
Hazzy Christmas was a success even though Blizzard tried to stop it.

This is the best answer :-D

Should add the stupid amount of salty griefers that alt+f4 when the think they're gonna lose a fight. Happened 3 times to me in wpvp same day. Mage sees free kill, mage tries to poly, I FAP and interrupt, they alt+f4. Freaking stupid.
---
I'll take it just for collection reasons. IIRC, to upgrade it to tier 0.5, you need to have all the pieces on hand to progress through the quests.
---
Mage.

Has the best farming by a decent option when you learn to do the farms. They have the most options and It's the best class atm (pretty much unarguably) since selling runs for pretty much every instance under BRD is boonkers money. I can pretty easily sell Cath/ZF runs for 2/3g per run while also making pretty good money from loot vending. Most people will also pay 2 to 5 gold per run for twin runs or other leveling dungeons they have quests for but generally doing this for one or two people isn't really worth it. 
---
Runner up is rogue which has a comparable farm/hr (often better if you look at coffer vs just ZF/dm without running people) and take a lot less attention/skill. The trade-off is a lack of boosting and only one reasonable farm. 
---
Hunter is reasonable with DMN but isn't quite as quick and requires reasonable practice but is good money.
---
I've also seen hunters/rogues/mages/Shaman/locks/druids sell HOJ for a ton but I'm not sure how much that actually works out too. Most classes can find SOMETHING around 35-55g per hour.
---
Someone reported it as incorrectly flaired. I don't know who.
---
**STEP FORWARD, YE WHO HAS AWFUL JUDGEMENT!**
---
This did not work for me. Good luck everyone else! Seems pretty random.
---
The amount of worldchat memes that people are spreading here is hilarious
---
Thx for info
---
You were an asshole.  You just wasted 3 other people's time.  Especially that blue guy that said "sure".
---
You didn't ask for their decision, and 99% of the time, the group will allow the tank to  have that one green item.
---
But you acted like China, and decided on their behalf.
---
The tank wasn't greedy at all, he passed on the roll before leaving instead of waiting for the roll and leaving.
---
So what happened to the group?  Disbanded? 
---
I bet the other 3 people were mad at you for screwing up big time.
---
Was that why you created this topic because you didn't understand why these people were mad at you and not at the tank?
---
What server are you on?
---
"summoning them is a waste of time"
---
*read as*
---
"You don't play how I play so you're playing WRONG 😭😭😭"
---
what is the macro? The /startattack /stopattack  ???  Or is it something else
---
In real life you'd have a point. There are many situations where you need to set your issues aside for the greater good of yourself, your family, or friends. But this is a game and I quite literally don't need to play it or even need you in my life. I just don't think social leverage is nearly as effective or important in a video game.
---
Yeah that’s another perk they have. Insta group.
---
Can I get groups without tanks reserving boe? Yes. So why settle with a greedy bastard?
---
This greed I only encounter on Reddit. Never even seen a tank suggest anything like this in game.
---
Are there any macros that can make turning in items for Rep in AV faster?
---
Average player trying to "push" can get 50k - 75k in an 8 hour day. If your guy is getting 400k a day he's probably playing 18 hours a day.
---
That's why you have tailoring and engineering, buddy
---
Going great I’m having a blast
---
For some reason I have seen that spirit rezzing is much more common place in classic then it was in vanilla and I am always like why that is so expensive. Warriors have huge repair costs for sure. I think it's one of the reasons that so fee warriors want to tank, cause they don't want to get hit with that bill.
---
&gt;  fine-tuned my hatred for leeway
---
Haha nice
---
If this happens it means 40-60 minute Q time are ahead for the Horde.  I remember 40m AV Q times on alliance back in the day.
---
If I had money I'd invest in Reddit to develop a Platinum reward just so I could then spend MORE money to buy it and give it to OP for this masterpiece.
---
Merry Christmas, OP, and everyone.

You can actually get Shadow Weaving and Infusion (according to our spriests) so you can buff a few people a little bit and one person a a lotta bit.
---
Honestly not much now. We’re at the content lull where people have ony and mc on lockdown and are mostly raid logging unless they pvp.
---
It also translates it to the other player's given language when you play on a server with multiple languages being spoken. (Because it's based on your client)
---
It actually blew the minds of some of the Portuguese speaking players I was playing with because they didn't even know the emote existed, and (at least for them) it showed the emote both in English AND Portuguese.
---
WOW your life must be very sad bro
---
Ty I’ll google that
---
Not much, I personally quit.
---
Turns out it was the same game, but the people and nostalgia I was yearning for more then the reality.

Aha so it's true that mods can't see who reports things

It wasn't me I swear

Save yourself editing pictures if you’re actually that self conscience or worried about people knowing your name. But: 
---
/script CharacterFrame:Hide();
---
For your target: 
---
/script TargetFrameHide();
---
And turn off friendly nameplates. 
---
And no edits required!
---
Nah that's just when it gets fun, and it's an excuse to do celebratory shots when you don't wipe.
---
Counterpoint: mage is a garbage class for garbage people
---
No. T1 and T2 are better. The gouge bonus set is terrible also.
---
Yes, but only if you hs queue, if you don't you'll still want to gear hit, if you aren't hs queuing I really suggest you learn to. You still want edgemaster's regardless as they will be your best gloves, probably forever
---
Priests do not have aoe healing for the raid, nova and prayer of healing both only effect party members.
---
Yeah that was my thought. Then they will think they are crazy. Then it will happen again.
---
Jokes on you, my mage is already undead
---
I think most don't want to tank because they are either new to wow and don't know the dungeon. Don't want the responsibility, or just want to push 1 button while dpsing. 
---
I chose to respec to a tank/dps build so I can farm my pre raid bis fast. Idk why more people don't do that
---
I’ve smiled so much reading this and I only ever played wow for maybe 2 hours.
---
Are you sure you don't mean coating the alliance players in a protective layer of zinc?
---
A hunter rolling on HoJ?  Please god don’t roll on HoJ if you’re a hunter and reading this.
---
The DM trinket, blackhands breadth, and Rune of the Guard Captain (horde) are all better and infinitely easier to get.
---
How do you not have better bag patterns at Tailoring 299? lol
---
If life tapping is that big of a deal then why do most locks insist on wearing +shadow gear instead of gear with stats? Seems like you're already going to be losing on a massive amount of int, which entirely goes against what you all are saying.
---
"Puking: debuff that reduces Mana regen by 5%."
---
Hard mode!
---
I've been seeing this too! I saw that exact same area covered in croc corpses. In Silverpine I saw like 20 wolf corpses side by side, pretty much just like this. I dunno what's going on but I think for some reason corpses are spawning. Like, I don't think someone is killing all these at once and there's way too many bodies there. There's not that many crocs in that area and they wouldn't spawn fast enough to pile up the corpses like this. Corpses despawn fairly quickly in Classic. It would be impossible to get a pile like this without some sort of bug.
---
15 years of good times
---
What's a mage friend?
---
Just rankers trolling people. It took me 2 days to enter DM back to back to turn in 2 librams about a week or so before bgs. They had the whole route camped.
---
Oh it's possible.
---
&gt; Most Warlocks don't need more than 900 healing every 15 seconds unless they're taking damage or using Hellfire.
---
Oh I completely agree, but why not just throw them a Heal for that?
---
He's since quit, because last reset someone did AV for 72 hours straight then was off for 4 hours and was on hour 18 he said. Thinks he's Botting lmao. This was last Thursday I think?
---
If they just want to push one button they can join me druid tanking it's pretty much one button lol
---
Liked infantry war, wants good writing, good luck. J
---
if you're canceling heals because someone else landed before you and this happens constantly doesn't that mean you have too many healers in the raid
---
Warlock is objectively the funnest class in the game.
---
Lol, that's an accomplishment on Stalagg. Small violin for Horde players here.
---
This is even worse than people taking cell phone pictures when they ding 60.
---
just reached lvl 60 a few days ago and i need about 200g to buy the epic mount (pala). I have 300 herb but i never farmed seriously in my life... so any tips of what plants to farm and where?
---
I’m grinding for the weapons and rank 13 gear for bwl progression. HWL dags are good till CThun which is probably a year away
---
Just another mage that realized OP wasted 3 other people time.
---
Just read OP's post and screenshot.  Blue said sure.
---
And then OP panicked and tried to bribe the tank back with 5G because everyone in the party was probably mad at OP for ruining the LBRS run for them.
---
Ouch
---
I’m just happy we even have Classic and enjoy it for what it is
---
I think this was "fixed" in regards to paladins using it with Reckoning.
---
" Reckoning stacks are lost when you initiate an auto-attack against a target and cancel it before it goes off. " -- this was in the "reckoning fix" update notes
---
Because with my gear Renew is more mana efficient and doesn't meaningfully affect 5sr if I use it at the end of a tank heal.
---
You made me look it up, you’re a literal blue parser 😂
---
I highly doubt it, but I ain't gonna be the one to test it!
---
"The good PVPers left so rushing Drek doesn't work" 
---
Rushing Drek doesn't work because the Horde have decided they're tired of waiting a long time to lose.
---
I also came here to tell you that you're using "galvanizing" wrong.  It is good to try out new words, but be open to correction.
---
#showtooltip Heroicstrike
---
/startattack
---
/cast Heroicstrike
---
/stopcasting
---
The first press will start your auto attack and queue HS.  Press it again before your MH hits if you want to cancel HS.  A swing timer is very useful in this scenario.
---
Could you PM me them as well please bud? Would really appreciate it!
---
Fire mage to me was some of the most fun I've ever had raiding. While you're still for the most part only pressing 2 buttons, every fight becomes a race to get that first crit so you get the ignite, this leads to a fun dynamic with your other mages and people trying to cheese it ie timing a pyroblast to hit as soon as 5 scorches are up because (I could be incorrect as this is how it was on pservs) the first crit sets the ignite, so the higher the crit the better each ignite tick. This also makes threat become a very real issue as its not a question of if you pull aggro, but when. On farm content this can lead to you purposefully rolling the ignite when another mage has it so they get killed by the boss.
---
Full Tier 1 is BiS due to 8pc bonus, even in BWL and afterwards.
---
1,55g per stack of arrows*
---
Only if you waste 3 points into Imp. Renew is it going to be more efficient, but there are a lot of better places for those 3 points than in a talent that doesn't scale.
---
Stalagg players are such toxic trash. Never fail to give us Heartseeker players shit in AV. Sorry not sorry I don't want to play on your garbage server and you certainly aren't making a good case for it.
---
For me that's HoJ. Seen it once from 53 to 59. Lost the roll to a resto druid.
---
It’s named after the color of the ribbon, which is visible in the icon...
---
if the game is so easy lets see your orange raid parses.
---
&gt; HWL dags are 
---
... not likely to be yours.
---
I’d like to make the point that hamstring kiting is much less viable in Classic than it was in pserver
---
Was that a haiku?? 😂
---
People do productive things between queues now like farm gold or gank people for additional honor.
---
Me a tank was looking for a healer for BRD, at the same time another group whispered me just looking for a tank. I replied asking for the name of their healer in jest. The guy gave me his name so I whispered him and stole their healer for our group.
---
Rogue BRD farm is nowhere near DMT or even Warlock in mara let alone a Warlock in DME.
---
There's a few pieces that are fine for pve. The t1 pants are better than pre-raid options and are just straight up good. The gloves aren't bad, and are like the second best option, it's just it's easy to get felcloth gloves.
---
Yeah. So I use black stone and another ring. I keep elven Incase I want to swap out the other ring for more hit.
---
Mine has never updated on time once since the honor system launched. Sometimes it takes 2 full extra days. At this point I'm assuming that they're just never going to fix it. No amount of logging to alts or logging in and out corrects it for me.
---
It’s apparently some sort of server issue that is affecting the borders between zones.
---
Kush you got a spreadsheet going? They are available on the classic warrior discord I’m sure, they show you the exact value of every possible upgrade
---
Oh man I made so much money on these things. Was selling em for like 400% profit and it was beautiful.
---
no, the amount of people who have 60 mounts and horde mid interceptors is why.
---
if the entire raid is mostly 100 mounters, then rushes can work.
---
No I don't I'll def check that out
---
I kinda want/need more space for my spells etc. Is it not possible to use spells without putting them in action bars?
---
Yep, OP’s OCD is broken.
---
That screenshot was in a game against us afaik, and it was a relatively fast  game too. We do IB camp if horde does a 20 man galv defense, because it's kinda necessary at this point or you'll never push south.
---
What’s your raid frames addon?
---
Its not the color, but theyre not in a line.
---
Merry fuckin Christmas
---
It has nothing to do with riding fast ponies.
---
How is hunter twinkling has at 29? I have mine at 19 for now but will probably take it up to 29 once AB drops
---
lmao that's the weakest excuse.  I don't play a caster so it's a non issue but I can't run 10 ft in any direction in Orgrimmar without seeing a mage yelling about selling food and water for tips.  This dude is just lazy and stubborn.
---
You’re a mean one....
---
Solid editing. End could've used music. gj.
---
Do you get locked to MC if you start a fresh instance and clear a bunch of trash and kill no bosses?
---
"you ran out of range" works like a charm as well
---
Ive been lookin for this ty dude
---
Sulfuras
---
Rogue BRD is definitely better than DMT. My friend makes 60g/hr doing it very consistently.
---
I'll play for you! what's your username and password? what dungeons you need run?
---
/s
---
But how could you take a picture of your screen then? Do you have a second phone?
---
Type /raidinfo in game to see what instances you're locked to
---
This wont go unnoticed, scum.
---
I love the classic wow, and i wouldnt mind the 0,5 tier to be release already, and playing with the BC talent tree. BC talent tree was release in vanila 2 month before BC arrival. (And paly could be actual tank)
---
I'll counter what everyone else said.  Go paladin if you want to play group content and heal, or play hunter if you just want to play solo.
---
If you have distance you should almost never coil first global. It's a waste of the heal it gives if you are at full health, and there is just no reason to coil unless you need the peel. 
---
The first sign of a shit lock is when they run in and coil instantly for no reason.
---
Just sounds like error due to sample size
---
I had a game where we simultaneously summoned ivus while the horde did lokholar. Thought it's going to be an elic battle of the giants, with us ants helping them, but the horde simply pulled the tree away and we did the same with the icelord, both was dead in minutes. Rather anticlimatic :(
---
Can't wait to see the ego-stroking competition between them in yang gang, followed by literally no one else on the server giving a damn
---
this is an advanced shitpost
---
:D kind and inventive! Need mace from BRD seven dwarves, cheers!

Gullible2019 // BadsantaMerryXmas

Finishing quests for gold plus storyline, helping guildies farm gear or legendary mats, farming gold to buy those damn librams, trying to solo tribute, chat with people around the world, recruit new folks for the guild, level an alt to try a different role, pvp for fun (not afk).
---
I did something similar while leveling initially and it was really nice having a spell interrupt in the early levels. Plus a lot of blue 1handers are bargain bin prices while leveling so you can have competitive DPS pre-30 via 1 handers. 
---
I would switch to cookie cutter Arms though once you get whirlwind axe. Sweeping Strikes WW/Cleave is a fat damage boost with a big axe.
---
The showtooltip line does the exact same as just finding the icon manually in the icons "folder"..
---
Thanks for the tip :)
---
I did what I had too. I wanted peace, but he wanted war.
---
Yes it is. I was sharing a stat weight system that has been used before and some rogues continue to use in Classic. It better answered OP's question of comparing the value of AP to agility. Stat weights attempt to assign how much of X stat is worth replacing 1 of another stat. It isn't a perfect system, but then there are no perfect systems.
---
AQ and silitus is a thing. And it will be way worse than those 2 chill weeks.
---
War is coming, child.
---
Fuck off this is funny. If the sub were inundated with posts like this we'd have a problem but this is fine.
---
LockyHuntyMage. Its new.
---
I have a drink + meld macro and I just hit rejuv manually.
---
I read this a few years back while on a military deployment and unable to play. It's a great series.
---
Its a rare camped recipe, shouldnt be worth 2-3g lolol
---
RIP any chance of washed up ever getting another world boss
---
Lol was gonna say "when you make your 5th pair hoping for the point"
---
Seeing as how be marked each item with the color in the text, I think he is referring to the color of the wrapping paper.
---
You sound like you spent most of your school years with your head down a fucking toilet.
---
Yes, the 2-set is great and worth running even if you have every piece of raid gear before AQ.
---
A very large bandit of unemployed neckbeards, good luck if you encounter this wild creatures
---
What about drunk tanking?
---
Why the fuck did you make our the names of crocs?
---
Heal thy self before you heal others
---
Is this a lot? It only recently dropped to under 100g after bgs came out on Herod.
---
A gentleman and a scholar.
---
&gt; But by showing how quickly the practical advantage disappears, it logically follows that player two only has an advantage because of the first roll.
---
No, it doesn't. You're looking at a graph that only shows data to a maximum roll of 30. Making assumptions beyond that is foolhardy without further context. For all you know, you could be looking at a transformation of a tangent function. That's something "someone who knows how to read graphs" should know.
---
As a mage my macro says "I'm a thirsty how." Then drinks free water...
---
Saw this near Ironforge too, almost 30 Frostmane troll bodies.
---
I care, but not about anything in this post.
---
Please tell me what pieces are better than green shoulder/cloak/bracers if you know so much about lock itemization. Outside of the rank 10 shoulders, the wsg exalted bracers, the bracers from insindeous (which are basically just greens with bonus fr), and the archivist cloak of shadow wrath (also basically a green with just a little bonus mp5). Those 4 items are all actually better than greens but are extremely difficult to obtain.
---
You know people PvP on PvE servers right?
---
I promise you I was the one shoving heads into toilets
---
Nothing in that video contradicts values in the stat weight system I shared. Yes 1 agility = 1 AP in game. But in a stat weight system agility and AP don't have the same relationship. As agility also impacts crit and dodge. While AP does not. The system attempts to balance that with basic valuations for other stats as compared to agility. This particular system also value defense stats, under the theory that a dead rogue produces 0 DPS.  
---
There are several stat weight systems people have made during vanilla and classic. No one has been proven superior. So go with whichever one you prefer.
---
Bind to mousewheel up and down and you can do way more than 50
---
I mean you paid money to kill him I’d say you lost lol
---
Does the arcane elixir spell damage apply to healing as well? I know the +30 spell damage weapon enchant actually applies to both.
---
If you are going to run dungeons till 60 then lvl 51 is when you can make the switch. One of the big reasons so that you can still get enough points into Arms to get Anger Management
---
Not quite - Your autoattacks, which make up a big portion of your damage as rogue thanks to slice n dice - can still miss with 1% from gear.
---
More hit will help.
---
Got me freaked out few times :-D
---
so i could have more honor and a lower rank then someone on a lower population server that isn’t “tryhard” right?
---
T1 pants are actually better than every option with the exception of t2 pants. So that's something at least
---
Your sentence is not complete and I have no idea what you are trying to say, sorry.
---
Oh i mean bags for 2-3 gold. And recipes yeah 10-15 gold
---
I haven't done cleared a bunch of trash, I want to know if it's worth making a group to farm the boe wrists/belts
---
Mmm salt LOL
---
The Drek rush strat was never about PvP - the game would end with literally no kills on either side.
---
To say that it no longer works because "good PvPers left" is really dumb.
---
I like dwarves more than humans too, but unfortunately the racials don't make it worth it. Stoneform's use as a cleanse isn't needed (since paladins can do that anyways, excepting Bleed). The armor is neat, but the issue of paladin tanking is often threat, not mitigation, meaning the weapon skill humans get is probably better. And the spirit and rep boosts are nothing the skoff at. Stoneform might have some good PvP utility.
---
Ultimately play who you want to. Fun is more important than the racial perks. And it may not even really matter- if you're just planning on pve healing, the only benefit humans would have is the spirit boost, which isn't that much of a deal.
---
Dwarves can also ride mechanostriders, so in that sense they're better than humans.
---

---
Regrowth spec. Once you get into a raid with good healers getting off a healing touch is impossible. Regrowth spamming is also lots of fun and it's great being top of the healing meters next to priests and shamans.
---
16 to 18 hours a day... that is just sad.
---
Night elf.
---
It should be, and hopefully something changes to make it viable other than during WSG weekends when that comes out months from now. But sadly right now it’s not. If horde had instant WSG queues it might be, but since they’re roughly the same length as AV queues, AV wins.
---
You are the asshole. Tanks can need what they want
---
If you think life tapping is a bad spell, youre a bad lock
---
If your healer thinks life tapping is a  dick move hes a shit healer
---
Life tap is a warlocks bread and butter. Without it they would just be an inferior mage with fear
---
Kinda true, mostly care about games being done as fast as possible with the most honour.
---
Shh don't tell them that Slam is actually good!  
---
(Timed correctly with the macro you can abuse this behavior heavily with a single point into Improved Slam + HoJ/Sword Specialization/Windfury Totem)
---
I’m a warlock. You want me to fear mobs into other mobs? I got you bro.
---
Henry, are you ok?
---
I'm more concerned why you feed your kids junk?
---
But Corruption is increased by Imp Shadow Bolt.  And if the average crit chance of the locks in the group are 40%-50% (and you’re not drowning in spriests), then Imp Shadow Bolt will have pretty close to a continuous up time anyways.  At some point you are wasting Imp Shadow Bolt damage if you refresh it before the stacks are used and not applying DoTs.
---
The AV discords, at least a majority of them aren’t private. The only requirements I know are : Have an epic mount, have more than full greens, follow directions.
---
The issue is that about 6 Alliance guilds have left since paid transfer opened, Alliance is all but dead at this point. People will quit, it will continue to get more difficult to full raids with quality players, etc. It's inevitable at this point
---
Id like to speak for those of us exalted on day 2..  
---
NO!.
---
How crazy! I saw the same exact thing outside of Thunder Bluff with those mountain lions. It’s global warming!
---
You really are a heel  
---
You're as cuddly as a cactus, you're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch

You're a bad banana with a greasy black peel!

(Sorry I had to, otherwise it'd get stuck in my head all day)
---
Buy booze from the barkeep, Pluggersomething or whatever, and give it to the dwarf, forget his name, sitting in the corner. It's a repeatable "quest" and after you give him 6 beers, he starts a scripted event where he goes off searching for more, and in the process smashes open the door out and triggers Phalanx going hostile. Make sure to stay in the corner where Phalanx usually stands to avoid pulling the rest of the room when fighting him.
---
I played in a few AV's where it was played as intended. I mean kill all captains/commanders/LT's etc do turn ins and win. I think I got something like 1100 rep in a 35 minute game. It was hilarious seeing the chat of alliance players keep saying "Why are we getting so much rep?" I think the first couple days meta and the streamer effect caused a lot of alliance players to think there was only 1 way to win.
---
LOL the amount of people spouting fallacies on this sub-reddit is astounding. Where is your data? There are players even making posts  here that they just started the game bc they finally got a pc for holidays or are finally having the time to play for the 1st time ever. Yet every other post/comment is about how the game is dying. It's purely speculative and perspective based. Its dying in some of your eyes but there are THOUSANDS of people still playing and probably HUNDREDS if not more starting the game fresh or even re-rolling on new servers/starting alts. People just need drama and something to complain about to make themselves seem more interesting when in fact you're a cancer to the community. Likely players who were never gonna stick it out in the long run in the first place. Meanwhile the rest of us are out here having a good time big chillin.
---
Looks much better now in the feed - [https://imgur.com/2r4CL0s](https://imgur.com/2r4CL0s)
---
Thank you for you help!
---
It's possible, but there's no way to guarantee you end up in the same AV other than you both queueing for a specific one, which can result in really long queue times.
---
For Alliance, queues are short enough that they can just requeue multiple times until you get into the same AV. But for Horde, if you don't get it the first time, you're kind of out of luck unless you wanna wait another 15-20 minutes.
---
I normally end up next to 1-2 other healers when I heal in BG.  It's almost counter productive.  You keep someone alive in a 2v2 or 3v3 and they suddenly think they are unkillable and charge into a horde of... horde.
---
Out of range, break LoS, ignore rogues on their lease on life.
---
Why I die?
---
I’m a hunter that’s been gold farming. I have no end goal in mind, just doing it because it’s fun. Now that I have my epic mount what do people spend their gold on? Is there anything in the upcoming phases that is worth saving for?
---
What airline has this good of WiFi? I need to switch immediately.

But you can keep honoring farming in the current week and not lose anything?

Gf account noob you forgot to mark out sinister strike. This account is mine now

---
You can always farm for ironfoe
---
You might be able to find a place in PUG raids if they're not too picky (and if they've been looking for people for a while, they won't be picky)
---
Could run 9 man premades also or have 2 people alternate out.
---
Dunno if it's the quickest but I go to Felwood, just south of the FP there is a Moonwell in the little Jaedenar camp.
---
did my best converting it to a reddit table (don't want to post a link to our guild google sheet, sorry) here
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/eew9e1/cepgp_addon_question_about_gp_values/fbyfers/
---
I'm pretty confused by where your non-arms talents are. Did you get Last Stand? Max out Defiance? Do you have the 5%crit in Fury?
---
Might get 1 before being slaughtered, but you probably won't.
---
Shaman because there seems to be a shortage of sham healers.
---
Man Idk why you are entertaining this retard. Hardcore guilds are always going to be hated. As for toxicity that guy really needs a backbone as does most of the current up and coming generation of pc retards.
---
Yes, communicate to each other which AV you got prior to entering the BG. If it's the same, accept. If it's different, leave the queue and try again.
---
Same. I’m full BiS. Don’t even need anything from MC. I just join groups because it’s fun to run a dungeon here and there.
---
But now you moved the goal post even further. The tank in this scenario was running the dungeon in hopes for needed loot. Not just to come along and tank to be nice.
---
thanks
---
good alliance players for av = people in epic gear from raids so yeah pvers,
---
Thorium are 1,55g on my server. And about 10s cheaper if you buy the mats separately and make it yourself.
---
thanks will try there because there are so many ppl in plaguelands
---
For classic I decided to roll a warrior. This has been my first time tanking ever and it has been very interesting, fun and stressful at the same time. Knowing that everyone is relying on you for good pulls and threat management, expecting you to lead them through the entire instance is actually kinda stressful. 
---
I'm so used to just being DPS, being all laid-back following the tank and not having to need that much knowledge or attention for a dungeon. Now I will look up a dungeon, looking what it has to offer and what I should watch out for. It is fun when you can get it down and know exactly what to do, but each dungeon has been a different challenge than what I've been used to with playing WoW.
---
is it easy to do it?
---
I'm not a professional statistician, but I believe the margin of error at 1,000 hits is only like .35%, while the difference between the two Shiver Blade tests was 1.5%. Right?
---
We have a spriest in our guild named joopiter who is always close to the top of the meters, check him out on warcraftlogs
---
I mean if have a warrior in my group that’s refusing to tank, and I Have a tank hit me up after 45 minutes saying he will tank if the other warrior leaves, you best believe his ass is getting kicked. All that would be avoidable if he just tanked the shit himself
---
I'd like classic +. Treat it like an alternate time line that can never interact with the original time line.
---
Allow blizzard to improve the game with lessons already learned.
---
BRE slam just got a whole lot slammier.
---
You don't* need tailoring to wear it. But you need 300 tailoring to get the 2% crit set bonus. 
---
As a lock, I'm wearing bloodvine for the hit, and going to take the L on 2% crit since I've already got 300/300 alchemy and engineering
---
Lol. Like we didnt gave them Azuregos last week. Merry Xmas bros :P
---
I’m onyour guys server and can attest that he pulls great numbers, but that’s also due a lot to the speed of the kills. The longer the fight the worse it gets obviously.
---
What's there not to get?
---
She answered the question but I thought she just was shutting me down by saying "I like older men" so I said "I'm older than I look"
---
Lead by example they say
---
When  you have the choice between agi and an equally worth amount of ap you almost always choose ap. Agi is "expensive", as it also gives dodge, armor (both useless) and crit (not a very good stat). Raw ap gear is usually great.
---
There’s no abuse. Apparently this was possible in vanilla wow. So no punishment should be handed out, but I do think they’ll patch it
---
perfect class for you then
---
This thread in a nutshell: https://imgflip.com/i/3keadh
---
Nah
---
Could find a guild doing gdkp runs.
---
I dont think it was a typo.
---
People are rolling tanks for the sole reason of making unreal amounts of money.
---
Everybody is blind to it because "tanks are in high demand and they can't make money" but some players I've seen offering themselves to groups have insanse conditions.
---
Saw a warrior reserve all righteous orbs, all unneeded BOEs and boss loot. Depending on luck that can be a 100-150g run.
---
My server has loads of tanks doing "tanking service" right now and few are actualy geared. Most have barely hit 60 and are running dungeons in greens.
---
im really not
---
Okay. So you don’t want an answer. Got it. Dick.
---
Yeah well that's long gone.
---
No, it's from Game of Thrones.
---
you a dick bro. he is a tank, they do whatever they want, now you have to find another. way to ruin everyone fun.
---
hmmp!
---
Press 1 if you're sober.
---
Yep I believe the math as long as it is an accurate formula. My comment was strictly anecdotal.
---
Oh good it's not just me
---
Just still alchemy on a level 35 alt if you want it that badly.
---
# LONG LIVE STALAGG AND THE FEW WHO REMAIN
---
How did you manage to take a photo as bad as this is amazing.
---
The amount of times I've taunted a mob in BG's when playing a warrior only for all the healer's to stand around and not heal me is too damn high. If up to that point I've been getting heals however, I will gladly tank even though I'm arms specced and not best equipped to tank. If it seems like I won't get heals though then fuck that shit, it all depends on how things have gone up to that point for me anyway.
---
You can get into melee range?
---
This is why I just love it. You can be the unsung hero or the very cause of a wipe. If everything works fine, you just did what was expected. 
---
I am still levelling, so will look forward to ignore the 5sr at 60. But more than once it caused my pals to sweat a bit - even funnier when you have them on Skype and can feel that they would call for a heal but do not want to be rude... :P
---
Lol knew this would happen before reading the comments!
---
no
---
Grenades are more powerful than they were in vanilla  because a lot of cc now shares crowd control unlike they did in the past.
---
Is there an addon to have Ability tooltips show the correct damage / healing?
---
I constantly get asked, you're not going to roll on dps gear, right?
---
you are a hunter stop crying
---
I will downvote only because you asked so nicely
---
No this is patrick
---
I was under the impression that iron will was basically worthless.
---
Make a /say macro that you're tanking now and require healing. People don't pay attention but maybe they see this.
---
"Don't be mad cause you can't keep up." Yes, it is quite hard to keep up with people who account share. I'm not mad as I'm not delusional enough to think I play enough to reach rank 14, but it's quite obvious that choice Grizzly accounts are on for well over 20 hours a day multiple days in a row. It's the only way you can achieve 1.6million honor by Friday night, given current AV win times and honor yields.
---
In my guild the ranking would be something like: priest &gt; druid &gt; everything else.
---
Why would I wanna roll a race that appeals to 9year olds. Lmao
---
Thanks for weighing in! I always wondered how that was calculated, but Google just gives me survey calculators when try to find more info.
---
I’d put stop attack at the top of your macro for good measure.
---
fire is like aq40 Stuff, you need alot of crit and yeah it sucks that only the first mage to crit turns up on damagemeters,if you care and it depends on you and your guild if you have to specc fire
---
What happened to best friend Bulltrue? I need to know!
---
NTA: Thrash tank.
---
Or spending the holidays in a 80 degree house because the oldest family member is freezing if it’s not scorching hot inside.
---
Duel comps should restrict it to class specific consumables only. Otherwise it’s just a gold spending competition imo. 
---
Don’t worry, you’re a warlock, you should win anyways.
---
People pay you 25g plus greed items to tank for them? Christ.
---
DIn my guild we were DEing druid loot like after like a couple of weeks. Resto stuff that is. Followed by Resto shamans and priests probably.
---
Gear a twink. 49 bracket is fun
---
Just because i have a lot of mats which are used to make well selling pots so i might have to level an alt for the recipes in that case.
---
Awesome thank you
---
Yeah that's exactly what I want to figure out. This would make future gear choices much easier.
---
Wow that's really expensive! You're definitely wasting money bringing them to dungeons at that price. Ice-threaded arrows from the AV vendor are under 50s and only 1 DPS less than Thorium
---
Quirky Spellsteal :)
---
I dont think ive ever seen 20+ grizzly ever so I wouldnt know if they can organize 40 of them to do something. Im sure they clear mc but mc is a joke.  
---
Im just speaking from a skill perspective that matters, how good they play, and I can say that they arent good. Myself and my friend have managed to wipe their AV premades for example and the only time they managed to hold brd entrance would be against lowbies trying to do it while leveling and it would be 20+ of them all 60s.
---
I have alchemy and tailoring on my mage and been meaning to drop one or the other. Can't decide if I want drop tailoring and level it again p4. Don't have too many Alchemy recipes though, and can always just get guildies to make potions for me I guess. I really need to stop puttin that off lmao
---
Who are you hiding from?
---
I want to emphasize this. I run tribs alot... Like alot. 5 successful runs per hour just doesn't happen. 3 per hour is my target. Four is possible, but creates risks that will result in wipes. The videos showing even 15min portal to portal clears take risks and have the RNG mob placement to enable that impressive video. 100gph is possible with 3 clears per hour... but honestly this requires averaging the longer term selling of trib chest gear, forors, pots and buffs.
---
(Skill/patience dependant) Tank. Run dungeons, vendor blues you win via greens.
---
(Gear dependent) Diremaul east jump runs - YouTube guides.
---
(Time dependant) herbalism, run around the world hunting for high level herbs and use the auction house.
---
Please jump off a bridge while you’re at it?
---
Nah I just charge 25g and then greed roll everything else.
---
doesnt matter. you can still gain threat on multiple mobs in battle stance (ts/demo) or on a single one (hs, etc) before switching to def.
---
It gets better
---
I mean you don't have to believe me, you can literally add us to friends list and see when we play. We usually sleep 5am-noon or so.
---
Cool dude, drinking - wicked! You are cool!
---
Its a known bug that came with BGs. It only occurs with mobs that die around areas where the chat region changes. You can also see it happening near the western lift for Thunder Bluff. If you kill one of the mobs in these areas, and attempt to loot it at the same time your connection is changing from one chat region to another, there would be a chance you would get stuck in a sort of soft disconnection which essentially forces you to close the game. After you log back in, you will have the looted item in your inventory but the corpse will remain, appearing unlooted. You won't be able to open it, and it won't despawn.
---
Just move on. U seems to be regretting. If so give tank some green next time. and move on.
---
It’s still really good.
---
If you tip them it should be fine.
---
I think he wanted a question answering not your alt profession plans for the next few months 😂
---
Well it's more of a combination of that and the fact that all of your claims are justified using more claims. You don't actually explain anything in any sort of way that helps people understand your thought process.  Then when people call you out on it (not just me) you still don't explain. That leads me to believe your defensiveness is based on you lacking confidence in your claim or you really didn't think it through before posting and now you feel exposed. Sorry just calling it how I see it.  No worries though as we all have a right to our opinion.  Ours just differ is all and that's more than okay. More than happy to have a logical discussion about it.
---
Can you explain in more detail? How does the stop auto attack make you attack that instance?
---
Hackers DDos

Nah no way, every monitor is different, for example this sharpening setting looks like crap at 1080p but great at the 4k I'm running it at, also monitors have different color ranges, most support 16.7 million while mine supports a billion, also stuff like contrast ratio, this screenshot looks way different on my mates monitor no matter how much he tweaks with his monitor calibration settings.
---
for healers in demand it would probably be:
---
druid &gt; shaman &gt; paladin &gt; priest
---
Druids are definitely the easiest to gear up raid wise.
---
Got kicked off my server Skeram. Checked Pagle and it's also down.
---
Same with Farilina
---
Mankirk crashed just now. Pray for us...
---
No joke. All these people defending it appalls me. I play a tank, a fully raid geared one, and every dungeon can costs me around 4g in repairs even when it's smooth. I ALWAYS come out in the positives. Dungeons drop so much shit it's unreal. People who complain about repair costs either aren't looting or are shitty tanks - period. Asking for reserved items imo is greedy as hell. Particularly as the tank. I think anyone asking for extra items for gold is 100% a dick. Everyone has costs and interests. Taking advantage of the fact that you're high in demand is double dipping into the benefit. You already get to run more dungeons, so you get more loot. Now you want to request greens too? Greedy.
---
I don't think it's just you. Same for me
---
Accurate. They ban for advertising gambling, NOT gambling.
---
In AV atm... same... just ghosts in there... a whole raid.
---
All your characters have been stolen and all progress reset
---
Same with Netherwind
---
Benediction checking in- we are down too.
---
If you do it correctly it doesn't reset your autoswing.  That's the slamspam secret.
---
I remember on private servers the "GRIZZLY DID IT" meme and the fact that it translated over to classic is hilarious
---
We should raid MC like this
---
Hang on, I thought doubling something was increasing by 100% and doubling was +200%, so cutting something in half would be -100% right? Or does it depend on context?
---
Windseeker and several others are down.

Just had the same thing happen to me. Not sure, seemed fine moments before. I've rebooted, still getting no characters in the login screen.
---
Earthfury is down too
---
Are you horde? That might explain why you're having a hard time. The advice I provided assumed ally, sorry.
---
Was just stuck in wsg
---
Yeah same for pagle
---
Paladin or Warrior. Paladins are high demand, are best single target healers, have the best buffs and are ok tanks.  Warriors are best dps and best tanks. But very grindy and farm intense.
---
Or if you're Horde go Shaman or Warrior. Shamans are the best group healers and do decent burst damage as elemental for pvp.
---
Paladins and Shamans are 90% of the time healers in dungeons and raids.
---
You can take that time and level up an alliance char while you're queued up
---
Yup. No life loser hackers with nothing better to do on Xmas eve
---
Servers just crashed
---
Incendius is also down. All the servers are shitting.
---
servers are down
---
All the servers are crashing. Someone said it may be DDOS
---
What’s the over-under on it being another DDOS? The script kiddies seem to like Christmas, for that.
---
I just started playing for the very first time 30 minutes ago. Got a shaman to lvl 4 and then this LOL.
---
You're actually a brain dead idiot. No guild in the history of vanilla wow would ever sell wboss loot at any point in time. Especially not grizzly. Why in the fuck would we sell loot for a currency most of us already have enough off to fund anything until wotlk? Much rather have the loot. Too bad everytime we show up to a world boss there are 400+ mudhutters zerging around. Takes exceptional effort to secure a world boss from the horde on this server, but keep crying that we sell wbosses.
---
Pretty sure there is a DDOS happening
---
Do you have any sources on this or is it just speculation?
---
KEK....
---
I was right in middle of killing in STV and tried to loot a mob and nothing happened. 
---
Surrounded by hostiles. I expect to log back in at a graveyard.
---
The longer you watch the worse it gets. Hopefully your guild isn't that negative with debriefing all the time.
---
Is this confirmed or just a good guess?
---
Well you can most of the time, assuming the group can wait some sec for you to generate threat. You have no chance however if aoe dmg is already done while youre charging, which is almost every dungeon i tank. But hey, most of the time its not a problem, most trashpacks are easy, even if the dps warrior/rogue pull aggro on the mob they are fighting. I can still hold aggro against the mobs that deal most dmg.
---
Yea, I finally got t1 legs and malistar's defender shield on my paladin Sunday. I have 8.5k armor with devo aura up. I was running to strath UD and after opening the gate, I got attacked by a spriest and warrior. Just spammed dispel and walked into instance. 50% hp and never had to bubble or heal.
---
Same here, was 2-0 in wsg. Suddenly we couldn't rez at the gy after death. We tried to quickly relog to save the game and I've yet to be able to log back in. Feelsbadman
---
I didnt know typing in chat was a spell
---
I Just did this yesterday as shadow priest, everything was working fine. Will try again tonight.  Only problem I have is the Imp pack by hydrospawn, have been aggro randomly for me sense last tuesday.
---
Dude, no one cares.
---
My buddy constantly PIs me instead of himself.  I'm a warrior.  It's hilarious.
---
I faced Bobkawow, Toezx, Athlete, Shapex, etc’s premade yesterday back-to-back on about a 30sec queue. 
---
No clue how — if queue times were just that low for Horde at the time, or they were using this method, or w/e.
---
But, they are easily the best premade I’ve faced in the battlegroup, and they are *always* on (it seems).
---
So, anyway, yea, that sucked.
---
Awww, the horde can kill flight masters and gank people, but the alliance can't make pre-mades. You poor dear.
---
Good day, can I ask how you set up the wasd and the 1-8? I can't seem to do this. I am able to see wow and all that jazz but can't figure steams app out to make it work right.
---
A big hunch as it’s happened before
---
Curious as well.
---
You know what the number one thing I remember hearing from people leaving Stalagg, all the way back to the first set of free transfers to Heartseeker?
---
"Horde's bad enough, but what chance do we have when the top guild on Alliance is working with them?"
---
Players that left complained as much if not more about GRIZZLY as they did Horde, because it was frustrating enough going into a world packed with Horde, only to run into the big Alliance guild that never goes offline and have them call Hordies over to camp you.
---
I honestly think if GRIZZLY tried to be a leader instead of a pest, Stalagg would be in a good position right now. I can't even comprehend what makes these players do and support this kind of behaviour- but everyone blames your horrible guild for the downfall of this server, and if you think you can escape your reputation by fleeing the damage you called you're wrong.
---
Welcome to Classic! :) Hope you have fun. I just started playing Warcraft (Retail) like 3 months ago, and Classic shortly thereafter.
---
It's a lot of fun - and there's a really cool sense of community (most of the time :D) that I never found in retail.
---
If you need any help, this subreddit and the Classic WowHead website saved me more times than I can count lol.
---
As per tradition every year, steam, sony, blizzard etc etc. Move along folks, it'll be over in a couple days
---
The reward for ganking in brm is you prevent other people from getting to do bwl.
---
TF2 proved that to be the case
---
All servers are down. It’s Christmas. Makes sense.
---
&gt;It's like an open secret on our server that their GM, North, account shares.
---
This is a TOP TIER shitpost
---
Thank you for this.  Glad my rogue is 300 herb.
---
DDOS
---
Same. Killed and then couldn't loot. Walked around and tried a few things and nothing happened.
---
Made a warlock alt who is currently level 32 with alchemy/herbalism. I love the pots and all, but am I gimping myself in the long run by not having tailoring? I hear lots about robe of the void and the upcoming bloodvine set. My warlock is primarily for gold farming but im sure ill partake in both pvp and pve when I can.
---
Despite playing Horde, I would say Westfall is one of my favorite zones in the early morning, probably because nostalgia.  Now that I think about it I haven't been there in probably 10 years at that time of day.
---
This is the world telling me i should go to the airport i think.
---
That can happen if you juggle him too quickly right at the farthest point, which a lot of people do to avoid ennervate.
---
So are your posts. And yet you're still here
---
I mean no one in the guild honor traded during P2, people on other servers got banned for it - no one in our Guild did. Believe what you want, but we just play more than everyone else/more efficiently.
---
Idk where it came from but it's taking off.
---
So here are the basics:
---
Lets say you gamble 100g. You roll for 10x that amount. So player 1 does a /roll 1000. Lets say they roll a 700. Player 2 then does a /roll 700. And so on and so forth until someone rolls a 1. That player loses and must pony up.
---
Glad the server issues weren't just for me
---
Sounds like you don't have enough brothers and sisters to rank when you sleep.
---
Disconnected from East Coast servers, but I can connect onto the West Coast ones.
---
This is because I chose WoW over going to christmas mass with my family
---
I upvoted all your follow up questions because you legit wanted to learn
---
Too bad tanks don't give a fuck lol. Classic warriors gotta keep smashing till the healer is oom and we wipe.
---
Pretty sure procs can happen off of anything that's registered as a hit. For instance, spamming Sunder Armor as a warrior. Your autos can proc an on hit weapon effect, as can every hit of sunder armor (if it connects). That is because its an ability that "hits", even if it doesn't directly deal damage. Should work with any melee ability that can be missed/dodged/parried, as far as I know. If you're talking about something completely different, then don't mind me :D
---
*Doesn't get the skill up*
---
blaming blizz for this shit is exactly what DDossers want but go off I guess
---
seems like it's happened on basically every server, which makes me think it may not be a DDOS (which usually targets one or two servers at a time and rotates).
---
Not blizzards fault, I'm 99% certain this is a DDOS
---
That sets the bar way too low. Like if you can find 40 people to all play on 2 days out of the week this counts as beibg good at the game? I dont think so.
---
thought i was the only one lol
---
Same.
---
this has happened twice, maybe three times since classic wow came out. usually during the weekend or holidays when some script kiddies get bored lol
---
Any class played by a good player is better than a mediocre one lol. If u picked a proper guild trash tier isn’t around.In the end they hurt the raid by taking stuff away from PROPER MDPS. S spriests buff locks. Locks and boom kin buff all dps. just heal and put up shadow weaving for us. The art of shadow has a master already XDXD st st st step back
---
Lvl an alt to 35 then he can be your alchimiste.
---
There is no reason tu be lvl 60 unless you get the flask patterns
---
I don't think it needs punishment. It's only affecting the other super low percent of players that are trying for rank 14. At least this is making those guys do something extra besides just play an insane amount of hours, they now need to socialize and use the community to work with them.
---
It was an inside job. Typical American way :p
---
pve yes, in pvp, particularly as orc, its hilarious. Can be a nice pickup if you're going with a arms/some prot spec for pvp and off tanking without respecing.
---
it is also immensely helpful for some pve encounters like Visc in AQ 40 with sapper charges
---
Does this function similar to the buy menu in CS:GO where it selects based on the position of the cursor relative to where it was when you pushed the hotkey, or is it based on where the cursor is on the screen as a whole? 
---
It sounds like this is one of the features I’ve been wondering about.
---
Joining the alt's party puts you into the queue with them?
---
They forgot how they did it 15 years ago.  Took them 4 months to figure out how keyrings were done, should only take the one guy working on battlenet another year or so to get honor to calculate for everyone.
---
Wait... North is the GM?
---
He spawned after 46 hours for me.
---
Big brain moves
---
how does 30 minutes on alchemy net hundreds of gold?
---
Thought it was just our sulfuras here but it’s others. Doesn’t feel like a DDoS though. Why would we be affected by already being logged in?
---
How do you get to 3%? 0.55(55% of rogue damage comes from autos roughly) \* 0.4(40% chance to glance) \* 0.1(10% difference in glancing reduction) = 0.022 = 2.2% and thats without accounting for glancing blows being unable to crit which means the original 55% damage should actually be lower.
---
Whats the point? The last time it happened the guy was arrested after 2 days and sentenced to 2 yrs in federal prison..
---
Ask them if diamond is the hardest metal next
---
I have a feeling it's a DDOS and not anything Blizzard broke.  People like to DDOS big games around the hollidays for some reason.  I feel bad for the staff that has to leave their family today to go try to fix this mess
---
I... What?
---
Happening on Mankirk too...
---
Get them into WoW and you got yourself a raid team right there
---
Hello darkness, my old friend
---
I've come to talk with you again
---
Same thing happening over here on Mankrik.
---
Doesn't have to be more complicated than this. Play the game the way you enjoy it and be kind to people. Stop worrying about all the intrigues, stress and drama. Happy holidays!
---
I have the same profs as you but didn’t want to take tailoring because I didn’t want to invest into that shit for just for the robes then dropping it for something else. Robes of winter night Vs robes of void is just a 1% dps loss. If you want the robe of void go for it but in the long run it doesn’t really matter.
---
Isn't it ppm?
---
It's not an exploit. People are putting in extra time collecting buffs and getting rewarded for it. Just like using consumables. My paladin gains 18% spell crit from DM:T, Songflower, and Onyxia buffs. That is HUGE for my mana regen and healing output. Other things to consider is Sunder on bosses. If the main tank is the only one doing sunders, it's going to take awhile to get 5 stacks. Where as in my guild, ALL warriors are supposed to sunder for their first ability so that 5 stacks is up asap.
---
I had just won the roll for Corpsemaker but it wasn't put into my inventory. :(
---
Hoping a ticket will help me.
---
This is actually the opening of an ARG for Shadowlands, where all Classic characters are sucked into utter darkness and can only be rescued once enough people have cleared the final Shadowlands raid at launch.
---
Why do you say that? Ancients are needed when people spend too much effort on defense and the game bogs down. If objectives aren't being defended and are being capped, ancients are not summoned.
---
We have police officers, therefore there is no crime.
---
Actually, yes.
---
You greatly overestimate my macro-writing abilities. :)
---
Will keep this bookmarked for sure though!
---
"If I lose my mage water i just bought Im gonna lose it"
---
lmao too real
---
Repent, filth!
---
Can we get a redo of this meme but have the text be "Stalagg is dead" instead?
---
Option for either.
---
I'm wondering if this is a NA specific issue - I've heard people are logging into other regions with no issue
---
As horde, no.
---
I /afk 'd got and got deserter buff, someone took my spot but I couldn't leave. Was running around as a ghost until the end of the game and couldnt leave after. Had to alt f4 out and am looking at a black char select screen atm.
---
I hope they keep getting sentenced to prison. Their goal is to ruin joy for people because they think it is funny. These losers need to be punished.
---
Doubling is indeed an increase of 100% (or multiplying by 200%).
---
Halving works differently -- it's a reduction of 50% (or multiplying by 50%).
---
In this situation, we're talking about a reduction of ~67% (which means multiplying by 33%).
---
It might help more to talk about it in terms of fractions. In order to double a value, you multiply by 2/1 (aka 200%). And in order to do the opposite of that, you multiply by the *inverse* of that number, 1/2 (aka 50%).
---
I'm not a good math teacher but maybe that helps clarify some.
---
Sounds good on paper. But not worth spending dkp on when I'm saving up for a weapon I think haha
---
CUTS DEEP BRO
---
Nobody cares
---
There was no weird flex q in vanilla from what I remember. You had to re q everyone if someone new joined the group
---
Rank 14 isn't something you can casually grind out. Almost every r14 I knew had multiple people playing their accounts from r13 - r14.
---
So unless you're planning on playing 13+ hours a day while sharing your account you won't be getting HWL or GM.
---
Yeah I can't log into any servers right now, just a black screen. In in SoCal/Los Angeles area.
---
I use it on my mage. Great in pvp, useful in longer fights like rag where blow through my mana gems as fast as possible.
---
Sure i have ONE, but how can I click my spells when I'm turning with the mouse?
---
Man I was gonna comment that. You snooze you lose I guess.
---
It frequently happens on christmas eve / day.
---
Yeah same here on EarthFury. Lagged out and can't get back on. Might have been a bug introduced by the server maintenance this morning.
---
lmao
---
Battle chicken in PvP...? Lol
---
Negative
---
Seems like every server is having problems finding healers
---
Consumables for raids. Enchants for gear (you're a hunter so look into the price of a 3% hit scope). Lately I've been buying dungeon boosts for quickly leveling up an alt.
---
I think I'll have to disagree. The felstriker will out perform core hound tooth in raw damage because of the proc. Its just that good.
---
Now what do we do... bathe?
---
I have a level 35 and 45ish on Stalagg. Do you know how long it takes to find an SM, Ulda or ZF run?
---
SM- maybe 3-4 hours unless I can pay a mage to run me through, but some days it's impossible to find a full party for the most popularly run low level dungeon.
---
Ulda- impossible, literal week of looking from midday to late evening. ZF- impossible unless it's a mage doing it for boosts.
---
Gnomer took almost a week and a half.
---
I played Vanilla, and I started an entire year after launch- on a server 1/5th the size. I remember thinking it was awful taking 1-2 hours to find a full party back then.
---
This is nigh unplayable, and it isn't much better at max level.
---
I have never played on a server this horrible before. I'm tempted to transfer not because of Horde or even the awful economy- but because I don't want to play an mmo solo outside of raid day.
---
Need your controller layout.
---
Good holy paladins are hard to come by. We've had no problem finding druids, every druid and their mom is a resto.
---
It was an off-night, this wasn't the norm!
---
The most optimal way they could skip these ques, would be to have all 10 players in the premade with an alt. They que up with one other so at any time they have 5 WSG ques going. Skip the ones that pop to early, and funnel everyone into the shortest que. I could easily see people dedicated enough getting stupid fast ques.
---
Other commenters have said it, but most in demand and easier to gear are essentially opposites in Classic. Fury Warriors seem to be most in demand but are one of the hardest to gear due to high competition. Druids tend to be the least in demand but the easiest to gear because there is so little competition.   
---
Warlocks seem to be a good mix. Some level of demand for them, and relatively easy to gear because they aren't widely played. Although your mileage may vary for this.
---
Scryer has been bugged recently, and supposedly it was fixed today.  We killed Scryer, then no one got credit, then the lag started.... then darkness.
---
So......sorry everyone?
---
Yeah? Don't even understand why you're confused here lol.
---
Herod also down
---
Priest.
---
You pretty much got the jist of it. Itll give you the edge in certain situations but is it necessary? Nope. The issue is im not sure dropping eng to pick up alch is worth it. Like if you have an alt thats at least 35, have them pick up alch. The reason is that most pots are sold for what their mats cost on the ah, i think the exception is goblin rocket fuel and a few others, but you might as well sell the mats is my point.
---
Perfect! This will replace itemrack buttons since they can't change weapons in combat like I need it to.
---
*wut*
---
You need 2 alts to que as a group. If the group goes over 10 players, then the que resets.
---
For alliance at least, 1 point in to imp slam doesn’t seem to matter- I believe that may be for the Windfury effect to work?
---
It's a fact ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Default is on the screen as a whole, but there is an option to centre the rings at your cursor.
---
If you macro a ring binding to 'B', then when you hold B it will bring up the radial menu in the centre of your screen, then based on where your cursor is on your screen, letting go of B will select the option (cursor in the centre cancels/selects nothing).
---
Spells, items and even custom macros are able to be added as slices to rings, so it's very versatile.
---
The courts actually are cracking down on them big time, which makes it baffling as to why anyone would keep doing it since the reward is 0 and you are almost guaranteed to go to prison and have your life ruined
---
Source?
---
Do you mean 4 bars towards exalted? Because 4 bars into exalted is like 200 rep.
---
lol, viper costs more than cleanse and don’t feed me this “I fake r1” as a reply either. Priests and mages, ok I’m with you. Not pallies
---
Lmao thank you for this, this is the perfect analogy
---
That is so far from true.... lol. But ok!
---
It's 1/3 of AV premade honor sadly
---
Network Security and mitigating DDoS are two completely different things.
---
You heal me, I heal you.
---
Last time, it affected every server on Classic and Retail.
---
Goblin sapper charge and goblin rocket helmet the main things.
---
no, cutting it in half would be -50%
---
5 min CD, 1 hour CD
---
Lets first clear rag in one phase XD
---
It’s okay you guys don’t have to validate yourselves every chance you get.
---
If my other trinkets are on cooldown yea, been using it in AV a lot.
---
did you bother reading the left of your character select screen?
---
I think this is maintenance not ddos. It's Tuesday after all. I think someone said their normal maintenance fucked something up so they had to do another maintenance patch
---
Nah, check the status page, everything is fine.  
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/status/classic-us
---
(end sarcasm)
---
nope just you mate
---
Yes, having the same issue now. Just saw a message when I reloaded the game saying Blizzard is aware and looking for a solution.
---
I wonder if any members of Lizard Squad know the world would have been better off if their mothers swallowed.
---
On Earthfury and Faerlina screen was black with notification about authentification issues that Blizz is aware of.
---
Lol i'm from EU but ok bud.
---
I heard blizz's normal Tuesday maintenance fucked something up and they had to do another maintenance patch. No idea really tho
---
Omg, no one pitches in for all the arrows I use every dungeon.
---
yeah servers seem to be down at the moment, crashed on me when i was in ZF i was running back and forth through the instance portal lol
---
Possibly for alliance, but for horde, no. The reason is youre going to run into an alli premade 9/10 times and the queue times (last i checked) were on par with av or slightly below it.  
---
Anyway soon as you run into a turtle, youre fucked and thats the problem.
---
You must be fun at parties
---
Ah gotcha, thanks for the heads-up. OP corrected
---
Titans made the climate changes!
---
Because leveling engineering twice isn't worth it.
---
Hell if he just spent two seconds looking at the dozens of new posts on the subject...
---
Yes! Black screen, no character select. I'll try rebooting, but I'm trying to log in to Stalagg. When I mouse over Enter World, I get a text box that says "This world is scheduled to be available soon."
---
Oh is it still down? I didn’t even think about it being Tuesday and was like man I should play today but was doing shit for Christmas. 
---
Guess I didn’t miss anything lol
---
No problemas on the EU servers, schweeet
---
It hit me while we were easily winning in AV /sigh
---
So what you are saying is, you can't farm as much honor as us, and unable to put in the same hours, so therefore we are cheating.
---
If you think it's this simple, than you have no idea how anything in IT works.
---
RotV is strong but there's a lot of good option. Felcloth Robe has almost the same stats and is cheap. Robe of Winter's Night is even closer to RotV but a bit more expensive. MC has Robe of Volatile power, you lose some spell damage but 2% crit is quite nice. Felheart robe may lack damage, but it has the all important +1% hit and some insane stats which lets you feel okay dropping stats in other places to pick up more damage. Where RotV really shines is if you want to play as soul link, particularly in pvp. That heal cool down is clutch for SL spec. And then eventually along comes Nemesis Robe which pretty much straight overpowers RotV. So in short RotVs dominance is minimal and short lived. It's a very nice bonus for tailors, but I no longer feel the necessity to spec tailoring on my locks solely for that robe. 
---
As for bloodvine, the set is purely for raiding due to its massive +hit. You will still wear it even without the 2% crit from the tailoring bonus. So again, the crit is a nice perk, but bloodvine is still good, and again like RotV eventually it will be replaced. Ultimately I think that both RotV and Bloodvine are in a good place: they are a meaningful bonus granted to tailors, however the bonus is not so great that you absolutely must spec tailoring at the expensive of gimping yourself.
---
It's unlikely to be a ddos
---
why would you afk at the entrance when there are much better hiding spots
---
I was fighting Mr.Smite in DeadMines when I got stuck casting the same spell, and couldn’t leave the game so I Alt+f4 and haven’t been able to get back in. Black screen at character select. I’m glad to see others are having similar problems, meaning it’s on blizzards end.
---
Be honest, you have no clue how network security works, do you?
---
PUT YOUR FAITH IN THE LIGHT
---
No amount of "Network Security" personnel can prevent a random DDoS from a botnet from at least temporarily disrupting services. 
---
If you think that the solution to this problem is a magic box that blizzard isn't paying for, or a smart person that they don't employ, you have no idea what the hell you're talking about.
---
Well, off the top of my head:
---
Total rep required: 42,000
---
 - 1 Mark per loss
---
- 3 Marks for turn-in quest.
---
- Quest grants: 250 rep (idk if it's changed for classic/i have wrong data)
---
- Total # of Turnins:
---
4 for 1,000 rep
---
40 for 10,000 rep
---
160 for 40,000 rep
---
168 turnins. 
---
Obviously, if the rep is only 50: 840 turnins (Max possible if you never cap a flag and never win)
---
so i should drop my war and roll hunter?
---
Where are you from so I can explain how the sheeple from your country are stupid too?
---
This is not my experience.
---
So what happens if you don't censor 50% of your UI in Runescape ?
---
It's almost phase 3 98%+ of leveling warriors/ freshish 60 warriors are literally only tanking to get DPS gear for raids. If people think they are only there for prot gear, then they are delusional. All MT roles were filled like a week in on release.
---
Sulfuras is realm you’re looking for
---
Dude same
---
Yep, the realm I'm on, Mankrik, is also down for the count.
---
Flamelash Horde: 27min Q; 4min AV time against premade rush
---
Got kicked to selection screen exiting ZF on westfall I'm guessing it just another pre christmas DDOS attack or some other stupidity
---
1. Network issues.
---
2. Addon.
---
Why don’t horse rush and win. Alliance farming are getting more out of the loss and they don’t care. They farm Galv, LTs, you guys go straight to the aid station. Gg
---
Imagine thinking about Americans 24/7
---
Sir, you seem to be Mad Online. Maybe consider not getting so riled up about video game network security.
---
Memes and people like you are what's wrong with this sub.
---
I see no reason to elaborate.
---
The two trials performed here need replication before we can really claim statistical significance. Until then the results OP is presenting are still plausibly explained by variance, you admit it's "unlikely" that the results OP is sharing are explained by variance, but it is possible. 
---
If it were me, I'd start by replicating the experiments twice more, each (that'd be another 2000 swings in total), and then I'd use a student's t-test to compare the two groups of data.
---
If the AV honor meta stays the same then I would say its not needed. For open world and WSG its needed
---
all i cared about was that the group knew beforehand. how you do it is of no concern to me.
---
Honestly i dont know
---
I sure do
---
Am hunter. Raided 13 weeks now. 6/8 set and seen leaf drop once (not for me)
---
Nothing lol it’s just a joke. People say stuff like “oh didn’t block out your health thanks for the account idiot”
---
I feel like I always have a better trinket I can rotate than a chance of 5% speed proc from a chicken that can get 1-shotted. That’s all.
---
Jesus dude lmao
---
Just tried to log in on Heartseeker to the same thing. Is this across all servers?
---
just your average clan of unemployed apes
---
100% this. Druid and it’s not even close
---
New message indicates Bliz support is aware of issues with their login server.  Would have been nice to know before I removed everything out of my addons folder and updated my video drivers.

Making potions from rare materials, having a client list that sends you materials, etc.  Alchemy is one of the few professions that can make huge quantities of goods that are in need of constantly being replenished.  Imagine being the guy that has all the flask patterns.  A good group can clear to the lab in scholo in 15 minutes after zoning.  Then after that, if your bags are stocked with flask materials, you are making a lot of money from a single run.
---
Outside of transmutes, alchemy is dependent on materials, not time.  If you have the stockpile or cheap orders from alts of in demand materials, you can easily make a huge profit in a minimal amount of time.  The other professions make non consumable goods that sell once.  Sure you can make Lionheart Helms.  Once every warrior on the server has one, you will make 0g going forward.
---
I'm not Horde.  The Horde were getting huge honor numbers on losses the first week because they'd kill the LTs.  Now it has sort of swapped.  They end up winning more because the Alliance puss out and spam "let them win" in chat.
---
Get out
---
When I leveled my tank I used to try to find ZF groups without the mallet bc that bosses drops were shit and it just made the run longer lol if nobody has the quest for him I don’t see the point of clearing him
---
Maybe it's because I'm a hunter but I dont get it?  Dont get me wrong post not wrong that's all hunter gear....but hunter already has gear?  What's the point of the post?

Merry Christmas :)
---
...really? Good to know - thanks :)
---
Our OT stopped logging in and I became OT due to having mentioned that I'd also like to get tank gear (they were discussing a list of wars). 
---
I'm levelling a few alts so it's nice to keep that in mind
---
15g every hour from GFPPs.
---
Do you really benefit from the proc for it to be worth it? I mean, with pvp trinket and the 3 reflectors, net, etc - I don’t think it’s worth putting in a PvP rotation but perhaps that’s just me. 
---
If I saw an enemy using it, I would 1-shot their chicken.
---
Or you could have just read the left of your screen when logging in..
---
Fix the classes like retri, moonkin, pala tank etc etc to make them all viable end game that is all.
---
I think it’s just US East that’s down
---
Glad you're thinking about us!
---
Yeah I thought they looked lackluster when I first learned of them but when a warlock in my guild explained how important hit is it makes sense. He also said you have to keep tailoring to get the set bonus. You can wear the robes if you drop tailoring but you lose the set bonus
---
Servers are down. Likely a DDOS. Basically you picked the worst day to resub lol.
---
I was making BANK from alch, not sure what you mean, albeit every server is different.
---
It really is fun. I’m having a blast. This classic experience is the reason WoW became THE MMO the world knows.
---
Meh, the druid one from yesterday was better.
---
ahh the "I was only pretending to be retarded" card.
---
Take a step back and go and enjoy christmas with your family bud, I'm sure there's other things for you to be doing than posting dumb comments online
---
Well as wow classic players are better than retail players it should be pretty easy
---
Having same issue with Herod. Prob server down since my buddies have it too
---
Message on the left of my screen was not there 30min ago when I started having problems.
---
pvp rank still hasnt updated.  What gives.
---
Bloodsail is down.
---
I did this too
---
I’ve seen Mr Robot S1 like three times bro. I’m what you call an “expert”. Please take a seat.
---
Damn guys we got trolled hard. Time to play something else or grab something to eat and play in an hour
---
Your comment is worse, he/she got lots of likes and comments which shows you are wrong.
---
I forgot to mention I’m on EU
---
Only horde can lose with Icelord.
---
Small. Indie. Company.
---
Its also pushback against casters
---
This reminds me of a few days ago when i dropped a portal outside the ony cave after we finished summoning someone and they clicked it and had to be summoned again. Lesson learned!
---
The thing about ddosing is, they can easily take 0 skill with programs nowadays hence the term script kiddies and not only that you can just buy a bot network for extremely cheap to achieve this from a third party.
---
Ex biker in my guild claims he hit r14 twice, and a lot of meth was involved...  If that means anything to anyone.
---
I've been ganked a few dozen times just in the past few days- and that's on lev 35 and 45 by skulls that don't even get honour.
---
Yeah, Horde on this server will literally chase you halfway across a zone to kill you even if you're zero honour to them.
---
The reason there's some Horde starting to avoid ganking you is because some have clued in to how screwed the server is becoming and how bad that means. I imagine at least some of them wanted to join a pvp server in order to have pvp- and there's a very real possibility that this is Flamelash 2.0. Every time a group of Alliance quit it becomes that much harder to do anything in the game.
---
The horde should leave 1 squad behind dedicated to this so they dont get honor by the time we down balinda - fuck the AFKers riding our success, we need to make sure they get nothing with the 20 minutes queues.
---
Us sinners are truly being punished.
---
Not really.  Classic was DDOSed like the second week it was out.  DDOS attacks are always large-scale these days by virtue of using malware to enlist tons of computers that aren't your own.
---
Oh boy if you think all it gives is the speed proc ... it's op against casters for the pushback due to the chickens high attack speed. And many casters, for exemple a warlock, probably won't be able to instantly one shit the chicken.
---
Click create character then hit back and enter world. Worked for me.
---
It's Christmas time.
---
Just admit that you are in the wrong here, there is no shame in it. The other guy isn't riled up or anything.
---
Druid is by far the easiest to get gear for since not many people play it as it's on the weaker side. Warlock also tends to be be lacking in a lot of guilds - they aren't the easiest to gear necessarily since a lot of their tier slots are weak and they are competing for a lot of generic caster gear, but they're definitely in demand. 
---
Hunters are also very easy to gear because you just want full tier (and the leaf for your bow!) so you aren't really competing with anybody else except for Onyxia head (neck) and rings. However, also keep in mind hunters will start falling off pretty hard in AQ, but it shouldn't really matter unless your guild is super tryhard (since they'll probably want to go down to fewer hunters).
---
Retail quests are braindead easy and the rewards you get dont matter because your class is overpowered and designed to blow through leveling as fast as possible. It has shades of Diablo combat, where you jump in and murder everything in your path. Whereas in classic, before killing half the mobs in westfall with a shit-tier weapon, you died 4 times from pulling too many gnolls and murlocs and had to endure shit-tier drop rates. But when you finally get that green mace quest reward you become that much more powerful and your damage output is noticeable because you just suffered through an hour of hell.
---
Correct
---
Mine too lol commenting Incase someone answers ..
---
#Nochanges
---
The game launched with major changes lmao
---
At this time of year it's quite the contrary
---
Shit you mean 1g per water?
---
Their parents tell them the same thing.
---
Tell the waitress you love her
---
Can you please post or link a video explaining this? I’m so confused and I’m very interested in topping DPS vs. my guildies. I’m a warrior and I guess I would do it with hamstring? Someone else said slam would work? I’m so confused haha
---
Take this L
---
This was released in 2007....
---
It’s because lots of hunter gear drops. So much so that a hunter that is already geared out is still getting even more gear that will only be disenchanted or sold.
---
Hello Darkness, my old friend.
---
I have this same problem maybe every 4 of 5 times I log out or exit. No idea why either.
---
Some script kiddies DDOSSing because they have no one that loves them this Christmas season.
---
A good pun.
---
&gt;It is and will stay an absolute MUST in pvp no doubt.
---
Only if you're trash and need to make up for your lack of skills.  Otherwise, you won't notice a difference.
---
....
---
idk, i don't think it's unreasonable to inform the group that you are rolling on dps gear. Especially because not everyone goes on forums and the like
---
There are also new players to classic. 
---
It's just a matter of being considerate. Is that so hard?
---
Whitemain
---
yikes...
---
Yes, it does. Do YOU have a roster of 40 people you know of, all organized and prepared for raids? Or did SOMEONE ELSE do that for you in your guild?
---
Derpppp
---
Listen, I'm not a dang psych teacher, we're not here to solve for The Evil Within 1 and 2 with the DLC. But uh, people with rich and fulfilling lives usually don't need to assure people on a nostalgia-riddled subreddit that they have a job and a life. Just say you're not good at remembering to use CoT on healers. It's fine.
---
My african american brother. 
---
Its not my fault pressing Flash of Light is boring sober.
---
No, it was up and running fine for hours.  It's not maintenance.  It's script kiddies.
---
“Apart” means the opposite of “a part”
---
thank you, i was looking for a site like this but some of them had some questionable looking data
---
Delete your alliance filth and play on the real side.
---
Yes you obviously need the gold as a hunter..........................
---
You literally have the best and easiest gold farm in the game. If you play 2 hours a day and you're just a little bit lucky you can easily get 2x epic mounts a week while watching Netflix.
---
I just assigned keybinds to the standard WASD and Mouse template
---
Ok nerd
---
It's just a matter of being logical. Tanks also need threat peices, which some are in fact dps peices.
---
Hahaha merry Xmas from a warrior!
---
Fusion is not leaving as of right now. 
---
Obviously is a situation that needs monitoring, but don’t expect to see any Fusion transfers happen anytime soon.
---
Muggers belt is from DM north
---
Always played horde, but when you have accuria and onslaught it is hard to let it go lolol
---
I might check it out thanks.
---
 Nah.
---
Prob DDoS
---
Okay.  Done.
---
He can easily grab the DM bow, so that's not really a thing.
---
More posts like this, please.
---
Don't have to like it.  Never been an issue for me.
---
Nah, building archmage robes and then UNLEARNING tailoring is where the better feeling is.
---
Flash of Light. Flash of Light. Flash of Light. Flash of Light. EZ.
---
Paladin is the ultimate stoner class in Classic. You auto attack and press Flash of Light.
---
Yeah especially if there's already a stipulation to the party. Solo healing, 4-manning, doing huge pulls.
---
In these cases we need to drink more, not less.
---
Tbh after I got my Carrot on a Stick I preferred groups that didn’t have the mallet. I don’t really love ZF and less time spent in it is better in my book.
---
Wars don’t need accura :p come at me when you have a BRE
---
It takes like no time at all to re-level tailoring if you're a mage.
---
Hmm that was kinda the idea I was coming up with. But since crit scales it's a bit difficult to figure out lol.
---
34 runs it took me to get those stupid bracers.
---
Grizzly didn’t crash the economy with collusion. 
---
We lost a majority of the Alliance when Stalagg got Heartseekered by Blizzard. 
---
Grizzly did a lot of scummy things, no doubt, but they aren’t the reason the server is dying
---
I prefer the old delete their hearthstone and walk them to the opposing faction’s city center prank.
---
I play classic exclusively and i gotta say that's a hot take if I've ever seen it.
---
Thanks man 😄
---
...and yeah, I’m fixing the combat text for the next video. 🤝
---
95% of my games are over 20 minutes
---
&gt;For maximizing damage in a PvE situation pushing the crit cap is valuable. 1% hit &gt; .52% crit in raid situations.
---
Again.  You're not going to push Crit cap.  It's literally impossible.  The extra hit for white damage is a DPS loss over other stats.  Stop talking out of your ass.
---
Will this be all evening/Night?
---
Haha this is true, looking at fury wars with BRE on horde... parses are INSANE
---
hello, could any holy paladins share a screenshot of their ui including keybinds if possible? would be great to get some ideas how to use them better than i do
---
Eleven. Dollars.
---
alligator invasion event, look it up.

(I'm kidding)

Just downloaded and checked it out, this is exactly the feature set I was looking for- thanks for the suggestion!
---
Knew it.
---
That actually was the problem! Haha I feel kinda dumb now but thanks for the tip :) happy holidays
---
I turn the music off, but I need me some sound effects so I can fish and watch TV.
---
I like my t1 mage helm more lol
---
Premade queues are fast, no more than 15 mins usually. I spent all day ranking so I could make sure I hit my bracket since I'm no longer ranking after Reset. I got what I needed.
---
Nah you keep it chump
---
I want to have what you're having. Make it  a double. Peace brother.
---
And their bats.
---
happy holidays and enjoy your queues brother
---
Trying to log in with this bug caused a weird issue with my second display.
---
It went blank and then it got stuck in power save mode as soon i got to the character select screen. I had to drop the res to 1080 to get it to to display a picture. After that i reverted it to 1440 and it was fine.  Strange.
---
Ah cool! Thanks for the info!
---
I pretty much just use that macro in combat yeah
---
Legit.
---
Interesting... so if you’re not a ret then by your own classification you’re a gigantic moron
---
I fought a premade last night.   I opened one mage with cheap shot.  He blinked. Popped fap.  I blinded he ice blocked and grenade me.   Then the druid with him coming for flat grenades me again.  And also has a Fap up.    I was worthless defending alone.

I’m guessing that’s fat fingers or autocorrect, as I ended up with “how” twice while trying to correct you. In case it isn’t, hoe.

Does not end as well
---
This had mortor on 90% of My wpvp ranking so powerfull. Really good dmg and aoe stun :D
---
...they're not? But I saw the BG-specific NPCs standing around in major cities. I thought those were indication of what BG weekend it is.
---
Kirtonos?
---
Bwl comes before ZG
---
Oh boy
---
Especially frustrating as pally with a handful of 5 minute buffs to properly apply
---
If you dont care about faction imbalance, as a Horde just roll anywhere.
---
~60g and an hourish, just did this yesterday for the chest and already have herbalism back up to 200.
---
I don’t mind dropping another 60g in 9 months
---
As a healer with Mallet, I would have gone with the other guy, you have the mallet already, they don't. They need my services more!
---
Is ele okay for leveling? The little bit of reading that I’ve done has shown most people level enhance? I don’t remember what i did back in the day. I was a pretty big dummy until I started raiding Kara and people could point out my many flaws lol.
---
Good choice
---
God same. So annoying
---
1 day of herbalism = 300 tailoring
---
Since it’s the holidays we did mc with 30 only 5 being healers. We brought anyone who wanted to go. This fresh 60 hunter comes. Our only other hunter doesn’t need anything. This kid gets like 3 pieces of t1 and the leaf on his first mc ever. He didn’t play vanilla either.
---
it's only good for humans because it's higher dmg than blue servers. worse than viskag and worse than blue axes for horde
---
Ok so devil’s advocate, what if I cared about imbalance? What would you recommend?
---
This is happening on Faerlina. Bobka, Toez, Yoni, Zetox, and the rest of their premade have been abusing it since Friday. Our team held 3 bracket 1 spots on friday and were going to have it on tuesday, until their entire premade started abusing this 24 hours a day from friday until reset, allowing them to zerg ahead.
---
We didn't abuse this bug because it's in the ToS that its bannable. Bobka deleted his vod yesterday and they will never stream them doing it. They didn't stream for the 3 days they were abusing it. They only started doing it when Oneshotted from &lt;GG&gt; was going to definitely take br1 spot (he was going to be over 100k ahead of zetox for the 5th week in a row).  
---
If this isn't fixed then all 10 of their charracters will hold br1 spots because of the exploit while the rest of us have to sit in 25 minute AV queues and 25 minute WSG queues.   
---
Please fix this Blizzard and issue disciplinary action, its completely ruining the ranking system for br1 players and allowing others to get world firsts by cheating.
---
Dont you put that evil on me Ricky Bonby.
---
I see no more red books have they nurfed the spawn rate on them in east, the two around the lashers. Anyone know? I haven't seen any since av patch.
---
as a rogue i wait for druid to start healing before i blind tho
---
Hence the two raids part. BWL will be here before he hits 60.
---
I don't think it can click for you. However, type /fb for options. There are sound enhancement (it will do the splash sound even when alt-tabbed out) and with autoloot on you can pretty much use the mouse only.
---
Hehe nice, also too bad about the leaf,ä. Our guild is the opposite and have only seen 1 eye and rest of leaf we’ve given out to all our hunters and have a few weeks ago let rando/alt hunters join to take the leaf. :p
---
Prime representative of this sub right here.  That's why I don't visit much.  Maybe if you read what I typed you'll find the answer, but  I have a feeling that's not what you're here for.
---
Witness protection
---
I’m talking about just the contribution from Spell Damage.  Things like Shadow Weaving, Curse of Shadows, ISB debuff, etc can about double that damage.  But they increase Shadow Bolt and Shadowburn by the same amount, so they aren’t relevant when comparing the two
---
I'm still putting together the video for this topic but I thought getting this info out sooner would be beneficial, unfortunately nobody else has been talking about this outside of the Discords so far. This method is probably only useful for "priority debuff weapon procs" like Nightfall-wielders.
---
I'm too low level on my Warr to test the Slam thing but I've seen video of timing Slam to end the cast at the same time as the next auto would land, leading to a Slam that doesn't technically interrupt your next auto unlike normal. As before, nobody has made a video about it on YouTube yet, so I don't know how much widespread usefulness there is with it.
---
I didn’t realize that, that’s neat
---
WhAt’s wrong with playing on faerlina i want a really populated realm that feels alive
---
Depends on your play style, in my case the one class in vanilla I never did get to sixty was a mage. I loved the warlock and the hunter as they can be great classes to solo quest but a warrior or rogue can feel very rewarding if a little fragile in larger groups of mobs.
---
If you did care about imbalance, I believe Heartseeker might be alliance dominated, but this is like 1 every like 15 servers.
---
It’s also a really common meme in HS.
---
Do you want to engage opponents and npcs only at your leisure, and only when convenient for you? Rogue.
---
Do you enjoy solo killing most anyone you want with enough practice? Rogue. 
---
Do you like forgetting you have a key ring because you never need it, and it doesn’t hold your Ony neck anyways? Rogue.
---
Are you a fan of casual theft? Rogue. 
---
Are you not so secretly a bit edgy? Rogue.
---
Join us in the shadows, there’s anywhere between one and millions of us, depending on how well you look.
---
On the link I posted, make sure you're downloading the WoW Classic  version in the bottom right. You might have accidentally tried using the retail one.
---
What for? Bloodvine is BoE
---
Yea.....no.
---
Lock hunter mage are prob the easiest. You barely use any of the hunter kit in efficient leveling tbh. It’s mostly auto shoot and learning to kite. Locks are a little more complicated but once you understand them it is very easy leveling. I’d say mage is the easiest and simplest for leveling.
---
I'm wondering why you think the backdoor matters at all.  A single person standing right there at the top can stop the whole thing.
---
Did you really pick up Tailoring just to make the chest and then plan on dropping? I've been thinking of doing that - any estimate for the entire costs, everything included?
---
so what i was saying is true in some cases?
---
lol thanks man
---
Nothing inherently wrong. But obviously it will have the most stress on the server relatively speaking, so you will experience different gameplay. 
---
Do whatever you enjoy! I personally avoid those servers because every single spot in the world is saturated. I play on a medium pvp server and it still feels very much alive :)
---
You are 100% correct sir. And that is exactly how I arrived at these numbers! Rank 3, despite being below level 20, is the most mana-efficient rank at my pre-bis spellpower level. Still, even with 200-300 spell power, rank 10 is significantly more DPS than rank 7. In other words, downranking saves mana but costs DPS.
---
So I had an issue that kind of sounds similar. 
---
When I would double mouse click to run this would make me do like a 720 and go all crazy. I honestly don’t remember what the setting/program I disabled but it was caused by a razor program.
---
If you have a razor mouse I would do a quick google search specific to the mouse. Sorry I do have better info. 
---
Good luck
---
As a council member of our guild now that we have established a system- I agree. But sometimes you happen upon hardcore players and they get upset about the “optimization of guild gear” and “how much of an upgrade...etc”. Keeping a ton of 20-40 year olds is harder than the game was as a kid...
---
Mage: literal easy mode my 5 year old daughter could play this class and get to 60
---
Paladin: not too many buttons to push
---
Rogue: combos take 20 levels to get down but it’s easy sailing
---
Hunter: learn how to time your shots and pretty easy
---
Warrior: tanking is of course harder, but dps isn’t too hard
---
Warlock: not super hard more like medium level to learn how to spell tap efficiently
---
Shaman: the totem set up is a bitch but still fun
---
Priest: only hard because you don’t have much room for error 
---
Druid: just kinda sucks in classic in every aspect
---
Ret paladins were doing this with HoJ to get an extra attack in, and we did it with reckoning as well. It got patched, so I would expect this to get patched too.
---
Flamelash
---
Commanders and leaders are still expected to be accomplished warriors(other than fucking 2nd lieutenants), but he's not the first one in, he's not the one doing the big deeps, he's three steps behind you to still have oversight. You want your commander to be near the fighting, but still far enough away to still have oversight. If there's one class where tunnel vision is prevelant i PvP, it's fucking warriors. 
---
For 5v5 arenas in TBC the entire S1-S3 meta was built around catching overextended warriors.
---
For other reference: See any other esport, the ingame leader is usually some sort of support, not the entry fragger.
---
So saying that warriors are built for leadership just has no historical or practical ground, you're a dog on a leash waiting to be let free.
---
 in PvP I'd say a hunter or any healer would be a better shot caller, but that's min/maxing to a needless degree.
---
Enhance is a lot easier and fun imo to level. gear is easier and generally better up to 40 for enhance. Once you get to 40 it's up to you. I stayed enhance until level 52 then went full ele and never looked back.
---
Your raid leader should have assigned you a role.  Our raid has assigned tank healers and those not assigned to that spot heal as needed.  I think it could be a little more efficient by assigning groups so that there's less heal sniping, but just ask your class leader/lead healer.
---
the [party leader] said no, and 1 dude said yes. been a while since i checked but i'm almost sure 1 does not equal 4
---
Not really sure what you're on about, tbh. But, Merry Christmas.
---
Well I stand corrected. Thanks for the info guys. Good to know it does still work. Handy trick
---
I don't think you understand the gear of a paladin, but as you are obviously a horde priest, that does not come as a surprise
---
Careful with the druid though.  They're only in demand because there are very few.  You want more shamans for example in your raid, because of totems being party and not raid wide.  So in a large part, druid is easy to gear because there are very few of them.  But once a raid gets 2, 3, maybe 4, they're probably not going to want anymore.  I think we typically have 1 bear and 2 resto for example, and don't need more.  We currently have 4 active resto shamans, and are still looking for more.
---
Priest isn't so straight forward either.  Disc from my understanding will continue to get stronger as the tiers go on.  Right now we have a balance of disc/holy, and that's good.  It means we can have more priests.  More than druids even.  In the future though they will probably start shifting to disc, and then we'll potentially want fewer.
---
So this is a long way of saying, I think the most in demand on horde side at least will always be Shaman.  I can't speak for alliance.  And from my understanding, shaman has the added advantage of being the highest throughput healer in the later tiers.  Plus, they have a very viable hybrid pve/pvp spec going ele/resto.  Maybe I'm just biased though being a resto shaman main.
---
Yeah I mis worded it, it was toward exalted, ty homie
---
I find myself to be pretty fit; I tried one of those group TRX group sessions with my girlfriend and I was pretty much dead during the warm-up.
---
So, keep doing it.
---
Lol really? Okay bye then I guess 
---
Stalagg is still thriving and still has plenty of people in LFG chat and in all the major cities. I love the server to be honest. There are some assholes like grizzley but most people are awesome. And the alliance alall seem very organized as well. Though I do see less of them nowadays.
---
Though that's probably also due to them sitting in BGs
---
I don't have the game yet, I'm just wondering what kind of time investment is expected in this game? I want to play an online game but don't have the time to keep up in competitive "eSport" type games, so I'm trying to find something where I could get away with just a 2-3 hrs a week?
---
yes.
---
just hope you can kill galv before they get balinda and people turn in rep items.
---
It's your game, do it your way. His way may be the optimal cost way, but everyone doesn't need to play the same. You do you, friend.
---
The most DPM efficient rank is always rank 3 or rank 4, which does very low DPS. Spamming that will keep your mana high but your DPS low. The true answer is a balance between DPM and DPS.
---
I love that last part! Amazing sales pitch for the rogue, man. 
---
I've always loved the thought of the rogue - I swear though, I have a rogue curse. I've played maybe 10 or so different rogues in my wow career, and something always distracts me away so they die in alt-hood.
---
Maybe now is the time ;)
---
Yeah he is just one dude
---
[Stalaag alliance when they heard cheating Grizzly is leaving ](https://youtu.be/YhkNLHictW8)
---
I know there are a lot of variables that can be involved here (maybe it's because I have better gear, maybe the other healers are bad etc).  But as a resto druid I put up above average healing numbers and this is considering I need to give up my innervate to a priest.  I kept hearing they are the worst raid healers by far, but I am definitely consistently beating people.
---
And if one of the reasons is my gear is a little better since they are less druids, that's still a valid reason to bring druids.  Eventually if you can bring another druid to get geared faster to pump out more heals, why not take 1.
---
Set bonus requires tailoring I think.
---
Fuuuuuck
---
That surely won’t be patched out, they don’t won’t even give a shit about NoChanges considerations.
---
That's not a great way to look at it though.  I'll speak to shaman first.  Their tier gear is all or nothing if you go resto.  You want a couple shamans to have full tier set, and you want a couple to go full l +heal gear.  So after the 2nd or 3rd complete their set, it's very hard to convince them to take gear that will essentially just set in their bank forever.  There's still a lot of stuff they need from MC.  Just not necessarily the tier set.  I'm not quite as familiar with druid, but I think it's somewhat similar.  Except, they don't have a crazy good 8 piece bonus for healing.  Our bear tank for example has full tier, not because he's using it, but because an obscene amount has dropped, and we don't have many druids.  I'd be surprised if you're DE'ing any of the non-tier shared healer gear.  I know we're not.  We've been in MC for about 3 months now, and haven't seen anywhere near enough.
---
Raiding essentials for rogues; help me out here.  I'm a fresh 60, a few pre-bis, nothing special.  Combat swords.  
---
I'm thinking stacks of Mongoose, healing pot's, bandages, free action pot's, fire resist pot's, Elixir of Giants, and Winterfall Firewater.  Instant poison of course, and elemental sharpening stones for the fights where mobs are immune to poison.  
---
What am I missing?
---
*Ricky Bobby
---
Thanks a bunch
---
If you don't like classic then stop playing. Jesus fucking Christ you people
---
Yeah feral does fall down a little but using pummelers and powershifting will let you pull respectable DPS while bringing a druids utility to the raid.
---
It’s unfortunate but in vanilla druids were never designed to compete with pure DPS classes and as someone with a 60 Druid and a 60 rogue, they shouldn’t. Rogues do lots of damage with low utility, druids do middle of the road DPS with a lot of utility while being able to be excellent healers, great off tanks, and even serviceable main tanks. It’s a fair compromise IMO.
---
&gt;Typically macros are used to have multiple different spells on a single button. 
---
This is not true at all. Most macros are just to deploy functionalities like target and other modifiers, stopcast, unmount, startattack. Not spells per se, though they are also used for that, just proportionately a lot less.
---
If you just meant actions in general then sure.
---
Do people even use that jump?  I just go through the front gate.  FYI:  You can cap all of the Alliance bunkers without getting shot by arrows.
---
CIS?
---
Yea I’ve finally started to come around to this obvious fact, I’m jusst one DPS of many and easily replaceable.
---
10g/day and you'll have your epic mount in 90 days. 10g is like 15 Mountain Silversage on my server. You can get an epic mount in a few weeks just herbing.
---
This.
---
Why do hunters fall off in AQ? I keep reading this but haven’t found a straight answer other than they just don’t scale as well.
---
Cancelled my subscription this morning. If I did one more AV or Molten Core my head would explode from boredom.
---
Also side note, what a joke classic maintenance is done 8 hours after BFA is ready each week. What could possibly warrant a subscription for classic wow in 2019-20? They do nothing for a game already released years ago. BYE BYE BLIZZARD
---
&gt;Lvl 60 Druid hotw ns spec
---
Maraudon solo would be great for you. Relatively easy and a good GPH rate.
---
DM:E jump runs require a bit more training, but they're more GPH.
---
They're the best thing about AV, I honestly wish they were permanent!
---
The mentality is if you can't provide anything for the team you are dead weight just wasting a slot that could go to a 60. It does feel fucked up, and I wish 60 had its own bracket.
---
Bro it was a geeen item, 4g, how poor are people that they care about such irrelevant sum of ingame currency..
---
I have no experience in sexual encounters with feces so I'll let OP be the judge of that.
---
Is there something like the comm rose from games like battlefield 3?
---
Good for you not rolling alliance.
---
Tell us how you really feel.
---
i use it for school and music production but if u have any actual tips that can help lmk tyty
---
Wait, everyone knew alliance would have insta queues
---
Seriously, people are whining over a few gold instead of the efficiency or completion of a run.
---
You're assuming a lot about the tank. My read of it is that he took social cues from the group that they weren't going to get along, and dropped so that it ended any further drama.
---
I have no idea what you're talking about with the "greater good" line. Care to rephrase?
---
Don't let the door hit you on the way out
---
So I really like the class shaman but I don’t really like the horde and I think there is a class in a later expansion so you can play it on alliance and I was wondering if there is an expansion set for classic for shaman to come to alliance and when that is set for thanks.
---
Dapper charges for aoe fights and dragon breath chili is good too along with gordok green grog for stamina. I try and run dm north to get the buffs as they help tremendously too and if you can time your servers onyxia buff you’ll be a god
---
Feral is so hard! I thought it was gonna be easy
---
It isn't leveling engineering twice; leveling up to the point where you swap is fairly cheap because the cost of leveling engineering completely is extremely backloaded into the final 70 points or so.
---
I did this and I think it only added maybe 40g to the total cost which is nothing compared to the overall price of finishing engineering and making all the cool toys.
---
He was rude as all fuck. "k tank without me" and drops group. What a shit attitude.
---
That guy clearly went over the line and was a flagrant asshole.  Most are not and are reasonable.
---
Farming herbs is a big part. The key for me has been to try for less farmed zones on off hours. Make sure you have a gathering addon to show where the nodes are, especially for black lotus. 
---
Arcanite bar xmutes can be a slow but steady stream of income. For pots it helps to know the market. Selling mana pots on raid nights. Goblin rocket fuel is good, especially now that pvp is getting real. 
---
I also know a lot of people who got one lucky drop that funded most of their mount. Sometimes it’s just luck.
---
nah, there is only so many times you can hear the same tracks and sound effects without going crazy. Most people I know who play wow just have a tv show in the background or another monitor
---
Props to him.
---
Yeah my comment was more for any dos, not just this bug. Mousewheel scrolling on your main ability drastically reduces input delay
---
I am also on vacation and my ping on whitemane 300 and i still play it :-) the only difference is that I’m not drunk,  I’m just high!
---
I wish
---
2x Dawn's Edge are much better than 2x Bone Slicing Hatchet.
---
So two people could have messed up? Wow I thought it couldn’t be only one way or the other!!
---
Nah I think most people would do the same. Totally reasonable too.
---
Druid.
---
I can tank. I can heal. I can dps. I have travel form. I have aquatic form for water quests a d ease if travel for pvp realms (stay in the water when travelling in STV. Never die.) As an example.
---
Warriors love you since you dont competewith gear. You are very easy to gear in raids. The best flag carrier in WSG and everybody is always laughing when they see a boomkin.
---
Also if you ever get the itch to try say a caster or a melee dps or a tank or a healer you can. No need to reroll.
---
there was an issue recently with wow using intergrated gpu instead of dedicated gpu, not sure if that applies to osx though.
---
the reason I play rogue isn't because Im aggressive its so I can go AFK and watch videos while tabbed out of the game
---
I get hit by that when mining in EPL lots. Then you get ganked
---
You have some very one-sided ideas about "common decency".
---
20-100g range is flagrant, a few gold is too minuscule to care about.
---
That and non-farmable mats (threads, leathers, etc)
---
You already pay for shadowlands with your classic subscription, the monthly subscription for a wow account is one in the same for retail and classic
---
Its a dpi issue. I had it too. If these dont work try turning the dpi down on your mouse.
---
Where do you even find these non super exclusive premades?
---
It wasn’t the first, there were many others a month into the launch.
---
I think they mean buying the actual expansion.
---
I think that's exactly it, that we don't scale well. Our pet doesn't do anymore damage then it does now and the amount of AGI to crit is so much higher than rogues or warriors so that DPS doesnt scale the same.
---
Does not mean that you bought the new expansion though. Game time and new expansions are different
---
I switched to elemental at 40 and never looked back. So much fun. Stack int and sp.
---
Tailoring is dirt cheap to level. On most servers cloth is hovering just above vendor value with the occasional stack below and is easy for mages to farm. Your other major expense leveling tailoring is the occasional bits of leather, which is also really cheap on most servers.
---
I just hit 60 today on my hunter. What would you recommend farming for my epic mount?
---
How do you not get it? 48% chance to miss is not good my dude.
---
How do you even find non r14 super elitist ones?
---
That's exactly what he did.
---
"Can I take that?"
---
"No"
---
"Ok bye"
---
If nothing had dropped, he might have tanked "for free".
---
It will take a lot of runs to get a specific item. So why spend time with people you don't get along with during that?
---
You’ve already taken it
---
Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; change graphics card from default to whatever graphics card you actually use.
---
If the game crashes when making the change, try disabling everything DVR from Windows (some weird game stuff that is completely unnecessary)
---
The thing with all those suggestions and ideas is that they're pointless because they're not gonna happen. People these days feel very entitled to suggesting changes to a game and seeing them actually happen. This game is already mapped out and none of those things are gonna happen. This isn't even about some 'spirit of classic' bullshit, it's just not gonna because blizzard aren't going to be touching this with a ten foot pole. We will all just have to accept that things are how they are. Bug fixes and such aside.
---
The irony is palpable. "it doesn't matter, so I take it."
---
I’m using GatherMate 2, and it’s invaluable. Makes herb gathering much more focused. Also, black lotus go for 15-20g on my server so it’s no joke. 
---
Also don’t forget, like most things in this game it’s a grind. If you put in enough time you’ll get there.
---
Only one spot open for you in a raid, just going to be very competitive.
---
As much as I love my priest I’m just a low tier warlock in almost every way.
---
I have a pretty fucked up story involving pvp ranking "mafia" on my realm back in vanilla. I was in highschool at the time with no job, school was out for summer and I was extremely depressed and literally never left my house, I was playing for 18 hours a day, nothing but BGs. 
---
After a couple weeks of that I got contacted by a guild on the server known for hardcore pvp. Apparently I was getting so much honor per week they were getting nervous that it would mess up who they were planning to get higher ranks that month. 
---
So they told me stop playing so much or else. When I tried to argue back to them they started threatening me, saying they had "expert hackers" in their guild and they could hack my account in seconds and delete all my characters. Then they said they would also find where I lived. Basically threatening to show up at my door unless I stopped playing so much so their buddies could get higher ranks. 
---
I was a young teenager at the time and didn't know how to handle it so I stopped. But it just goes to show you how psychotic these players are about ranks, a bunch of 30 year old losers threatening a 15 year old for playing a video game.
---
Yeah I like my spec a lot because I’m not useless solo in the world and I can heal well in dungeons all I need to do is have gear.. I lack bear gear though lol. I don’t mind helping guildies by tanking lower lvl dungeons I just feel so bad wasting people’s time ya know . Anyways it’s probably worth it to try I’ll see if anyone in guild would be willing to help with my tanking issues .
---
No I pushed through a dungeon or two that went bad.
---
You can just click the name in the chatbox, its actually easier than typing it out. For tells it makes no difference.
---
I don’t want to play with alliance together. That’s why I rolled horde. It’s an mmo not a “I queue and have some fun idc about astethica game”
---
maybe youre the exact same rank you were last week
---
Check world, trade, or lfg chat during high times, when on alliance at least. Or Reddit dm me and I can give a link
---
Kids crying you say?
---
You still have numbers above the letters though right? under the F keys
---
Allowing a silly thread once in awhile risks the post ending up as a citation for inconsistent moderation later on. You've jumped ahead a bit.
---
They go for like 50 on mine .. 
---
I am going to get that addon immediately lol
---
Wait for the first waves to reach r14 it’s getting easier
---
Thank you

Hello everyone, 
---
I was playing classic at release, but had to stop because of some major changes in my job. Now I wanna start again with a fresh character but I'm afraid of being alone while leveling since the game is out for a while now. I dont wanna have a bad experience when facing some hard quests when Not a Single leveling player is around to join. Finding groups for the early instances seems like pain when there are mostly level 60 players playing on the Server. 
---
I know having fun should be the Main goal, but whenever I read about leveling on PVP servers nowadays im getting headaches. And Leveling on PVE servers all by my own seems like a solid way to waste my lifetime. 
---
I'm not sure if it is worth starting again now.
---
Thanks in advance
---
Lol, that’s the point you are talking about 99% parses, to prove that muggers belt is shit. But you have these parses with aclg. So your argument is total BS.

The strategy is to pet tank one, fear one, tank 1 each and dot everything and then wand to death while 4 dots kill everything over the next 15 seconds. Since you only spent mana at the start, you should in theory keep going forever.
---
Worst case you life tap, priest heals and drinks whil you start the next pull
---
Flair checks out.

*through laughs* “DUDE WHERE WERE THE HEALS??!”

“Wtf dude take the rez”

“Sorry dude I was making another drink”

“Get mana so we can keep pulling”

The actual ensuing conversation after the survivors cleared the whelps.
---
Can a 60 hunter decently geared (5 BiS items) solo farm warpwood belt?
---
&gt; Druids have a lot of tools, and a resto druid is not merely a stationary turret healer.
---
I love this line. I'm a tank and my friend is a reato druid and often when i lose aggro he just stands there and dies while trying to heal himself. Our running joke is that he "got stuck in pylon form."
---
Can't druids decurse?
---
🦀 jmods wont reply to this thread 🦀
---
Fuckin gold
---
Google gathermate 2 import or something along those lines and you'll find a user made database of nodes that actually works
---
Ask the guys ranking on your realm. Check your realm discord. Etc
---
Think they'll release TBC?  I really hope they do, but don't want to get my expectations too high
---
Too real for my guild. We're thinking about selling hunter spots, but every hunter is running around in full t1 anyway.
---
What server?
---
I could have an explanation. I had this exact quest when I was lvl 8. My GM mate called me to org where I proceeded to get WCB and dragonslayer buff. I then went on to, quite literally, slaughter all the basilisks. When i returned later all I saw where corpses. They didn’t disappear for some reason. This was on Firemaw EU. Could explain this?
---
There are actually some items that you can sell nicely during leveling up. Especially the black mageweave boots that you need for the engineering boots. You can usually sell them for around 3G and they cost maybe 1/6th of it to craft. Just have to be careful and only put a few of them in the AH. Also runecloth bags can be sold for a profit.
---
Server?
---
I dont think this is a tip, this is how you're supposed to play.
---
Your second recommendation worked for me a while back. I had this exact issue that OP describes:
---
&gt; I’ve also had the issue of having my cursor suddenly appear in the middle of the screen after clicking elsewhere.
---
Ran the macro and it was gone.
---
Actually it’s the opposite. It just allows you to bind stuff that normally you’d have to click. The menu pops up right under your mouse in a radial pattern, then you mouse over the selection and release the key.
---
That makes more sense. So do you recommend full affliction and which pet?
---
What am i missing here?
---
They’ve added a lot of stuff to classic that was not in vanilla. I wouldn’t put it past them if they start losing subscribers.
---
That's shit-tastically awful.  Brings out the worst in people
---
3 months of MC and barely got our first Hunter legs today off Rag.  Feelsbad
---
Awesome thank you so much
---
is this the one you can upgrade?
---
As a prot warrior I farm weeping cave in WPL. Rich thorium, gnpp, disgusting oozling. Can be tedious, but due to how tedious the cave is, most others stay away (asides from stealths and aoe grinders) Note equipping as much "thorns" gear as possible is advised here because it helps with the slimes that split into multiple mobs. I probably wouldn't attempt this grind if I wasn't prot and opt for tyrs hand as a solo grind in fury spec. SM grind is fine if you have a second account parked outside of the instance to trade with otherwise your bags fill fast and you find yourself doing a lot of running. That being said I did farm my epic Mount in cathedral, sometimes you can find peeps willing to pay 2-3g per run for xp which is a nice bonus. If you are feeling passive then fishing is always a great money maker and as a prot warrior the gank risk from rogues isn't such an issue! Happy grinding! :)
---
How does the prospector pull work?
---
Do all the lvl 60 and dungeon quests.  The reward gold and other loot will really start to add up.
---
i would pay 11 dollars for that
---
Until t3 it’s probably elemental shaman. With t3 it’s probably like a destro lock or warrior.
---
Think of it as a currency you use for obtaining loot. Basically you acquire dkp for killing bosses and some guilds give dkp for other things like healing out members and showing up on time to raid etc. You use the dkp you’ve gained to bid on loot you want. Think of it like an auction.
---
Yeah warrior looks fun for burst but is to dependant on reck and procs, im looking for something i can basically roll up on someone with and with a single global utterly destroy their day haha
---
It doesn't update for everyone at the same time, even everyone on the same server. Give it a few more hours. I've heard of it taking as long as 12 hours after maintenance.
---
Old school Runescape meme
---
Dragon killing points.
---
An attendance-based system where you earn points for attending a raid and killing bosses, typically you may get some bonus for showing up on time, perhaps some bonus for clearing/staying to the end of the raid time. Your DKP can be used to bid on items you want, usually items have a minimum you start from, say a tier 1 helm is 50 DKP minimum. Someone may start at 50, someone else bids 55 and you keep bidding until all except one fold - if his final bid was 100, he gets the helm and 100 DKPs are removed from his total DKP.
---
Are we talking about leveling? Raids, dungeons? Pvp? There quite a pretty hard difference in all those activities.
---
But for leveling the order is imho: Hunter, Warlock, Druid, Mage, Priest, Shaman/Pala, Rogue, Warrior. Leveling is rather dull though. The difference is what the classes can pull off in order to level faster. And Warrior sucks and that field. Hunter and Druids have basically zero downtime. Warlock and Priests are killing machines that cannot die.

Come to Fairbanks!
---
Honestly, one of the biggest strengths of rogue is that the same itemization is good for pve and pvp. At most you might trade rings, etc out that give hit for things that have higher stamina or crit.
---
Ty man
---
Greedy person defending other greedy people, what a shocker.
---
Yeah that’s how I made all the gold I’ve made since I hit 60 actually ! My log is completely full of dungeon quests .. I’ve been chipping away at them. I really like quests so I am for sure doing this :) plus all the drops for vendor etc have netted me a fair amount too. I just don’t love living in instances and I have a fairly unique playing situation that makes it a little hard to be in them too often now lol
---
Anybody who played PVP in vanilla and did some ranking knew that you would need 1+mil honor per week to rank up in the first weeks of BG, be it AV farm or WSG premades.
---
If they didn't add the 1.12 AV ppl would be doing WSG 14-18 hours per day, sharing accounts and ganking in WPL/EPL while in the queue.
---
If you pop reck probably quite easily but i dont want to rely on a proc or large cooldown. Consistent high immidiate burst is what im after
---
That's a lot of projection right there.
---
Maybe DDOS attacks which are also currently downing servers?  For me it typically happens at ~1pm sever time.
---
Just find em 4Head
---
Duuuuude ditto
---
Possibly with that HoJ proc you can.
---
The addon Select's purpose is to replicate the pop-up menu that Mages have for ports and hunters have for pets on retail. It's very useful for occasional casts like ports and pet stuff, not so useful for combat.
---
"Character with that name already exists..." Awesome. Over an hour and cannot log in...
---
100 is more realistic.
---
Maybe you ain’t, but I’m generally sick of these kids thinking they will ezpz get r14 and then whine about people farming more honor then them.
---
English is such a beautiful language.
---
Welcome to hardcore clearing a 15yr old game lmfao. All this pressure to be ultra cutting edge is such a joke.
---
AWS is Amazon Web Services. A cloud services for easier scalability and reliability. 
---
Content Delivery Network i have no idea.
---
ya i'll DM it to u
---
No, you're correct. People who think mages are 1 button dont pvp.
---
There’s like 5 of varying requirements
---
I felt for the tank....until u tried to give him money.
---
Well you have to move some fights and can't cast
---
I know I personally wont be able to grind to get r14 but when i cant get a chance to do literally anything in the game besides farm av it gets pretty tiresome. Btw this is on a low pop server that has never had a queue time mind you. I can only imagine how people on faerlina are feeling
---
Go for elemental shaman then. Nothing beats that imo https://youtu.be/WQiBexvbLeY
---
What rank are you going for? If you want 10+ you will need to invest a lot of time and this has nothing to do with the AV honor farming. This is how vanilla honor was done. Anything below 10 and I’d be curious as to why you’d be concerned about ranking at all.
---
On top of that the server populations now are far larger than they were in vanilla, so you have many more people to compete with each week.
---
Full rage deathwish impale execute is 5000+ depending on armor.  Enrage even more but hard to pull off.
---
Ally complaining about the literal single advantage horde has in AV, while also being lucky enough to wait &gt;4 min queues vs 20 whole minutes.
---
It was in the game, it legit dosent matter AT ALL. This isnt some ranked system with money or elo on the line, it dosent even actually have an effect on you if you are ranking.
---
It's not even an issue for the tank to need on a righteous orb in my experience  and you're being passive aggressive about a vendor weapon.
---
Finding a tank to help you farm lbrs is amazing and you didn't appreciate that. Tank hearthing and killing your run is realpolitik
---
Well yes but getting hit 10 times will be a lot more profitable compared to getting hit 100 times for the same loot. And the advantage you have as a warrior is that you don't have to wait 30min for a group so you have 30m saved. You also can reserve gear just how you like it and no one complains. So while you may have some struggles there are a lot of advantages as well. If a caster could tank you better be sure I'd be doing that.
---
&gt; CDNs
---
CDNS are content delivery networks, you stand/distribute your "content" through that rather than straight up from your servers. So some websites have their content cached in a CDN for high availability.
---
Consistent high immediate burst is definitely ele shaman.
---
Horde can't rush and win.  The map is more beneficial to the alliance rush (and appears more beneficial to a horde methodical approach.)
---
Alliance get to pull drak without killing all the other shit in his room.
---
Okay, the argument I'm seeing in this thread is "but the tank NEEDS gold because repair costs!"
---
...you get enough gold from grey items and other vendor trash to cover repair costs. I mained a warrior tank from MC -&gt; Naxx on a recent pserver and never, ever felt the need to reserve a single trash item for myself.
---
I wanna know what he said :(
---
:DDD This is golden, thank you for posting this. I love wow too, and you too.
---
&gt;Would Dog Whistle help with that fight? Extra targets to explode might reduce the likelihood of a player getting blown up... right?
---
You know, that was actually a meme among my guild members back in classic. Someone used a dog whistle during rag and the dog almost instantly died. Someone suggested over teamspeak that it died of heat exhaustion and the whole raid lost their shit laughing.

---
The great thing about WoW Classic is it moves as fast as you want it to. There's no daily quests or intentional pressures that make you feel like you're falling behind if you don't log in every day.
---
The world is big and beautiful, and levelling through it for the first time is actually really fun. An experienced player following a guide could do 1-60 in about 120 hours. For a new player it would be a lot longer, if you're the type to take your time and explore all the side paths. You don't have to be max level before the game is fun (though experienced players may argue that point due to having levelled up to max already). 
---
There's no pressure here to do anything or be someone you're not. That's the best part. Something for everyone.
---
Differs greatly, could be 100 games too
---
IIRC they are boe but you need a certain level (probably 300) in tailoring to wear them
---
This bug has existed since actual vanilla and still exists in retail today afaik. There are a dozen different "fixes" but none work for everyone.
---
You can downvote me all you want but I had pre raid bis lists, theorycrafted specs per phase, set up guild relations, constantly looked at classic wow sub reddit, watched all the beta hype, reserved chars ahead of time. You. You are exactly who I’m describing. Your refusing the truth and are telling me it’s my fault. Lmao. I fucking didn’t know you asshat, my post literally says I would’ve gone ally had I known. You’re the scum of the community.
---
That's not an analogy.
---

---
ye 100 ap on crusader proc will definitely help yar dps, but to boast for it take you to #1 just cust u AR + SS spam with BF with extra 100 ap is a bit light headed
---
You admitted to botting in whispers btw I wouldn't be so high and mighty lol.
---
oh my gooooood this sounds amazing i can’t wait to try this
---
It's good, much quieter since bg's actually able to farm and level mostly unimpeded besides the occasional pvp vs your own level in contested spots
---
What gear set addon is this ?
---
Can agree for all of them but warriors. Majority of warrior players would prefer to eat their dinner off a shield than tank with it.

---
&gt;  But uh, people with rich and fulfilling lives usually don't need to assure people on a nostalgia-riddled subreddit that they have a job and a life. Just say you're not good at remembering to use CoT on healers. It's fine.
---
There's a difference between "I have a job" and "I have a rich and fulfilling life doing the thing i enjoy for money." It could be a situation of 'i work this shit job, but it's the best I can get in my area/education without going completely broke, and im fine with spending 180USD a year extra on my normal expenses to sub to wow"

The Maggot Slime disease is an annoying debuff for melee classes that lasts 30 minutes. OP went somewhere else to kill mobs as they'd rather not deal with it... only to go fight mobs with an equally annoying debuff for melee.
---
It'll probably go up a bit when BWL comes out because restorative potions are nice to have for Chromaggus, and spike big when Ahn'Qiraj opens because everyone's gonna need lots of greater nature protection potions.
---
What server are you guys playing on that has this? I play on Benediction and I have yet to see anyone say anything about this type of min/maxing.
---
Yeah alliance pushing 400k per day with their 2 minute queues.
---
No one can answer that question except you.
---
We don't know your server or faction and we don't know the level of demand or supply that exists (and will exist) for elemental earth.
---
Your best bet is to decide for yourself.
---
Fire Nova Totem + Elemental Mastery + spell dmg trinket or Natural Alignment Crystal from BWL, cast CL and spam Earth Shock.  
---
Fire Nova going off at the same time you finish the CL cast, spamming ES to batch it with CL making it benefit from Elemental Mastery for the double crit is pretty insane.  
---
Can maybe fit a grenade in there after you cast fire nova totem and time it perfectly. Should be enough to global most people, pretty nuts.
---
BIS wand for warlocks drops off a boss in Strat live. That’s not for my alt, that’s my main.
---
Yeah it procs. And for on-next-swing abilities like Maul, as far as I know it actually copies the ability rather than give you a white swing, making it pretty monstrous for threat.
---
It's frustrating to see them use "no changes" as a lazy excuse to not address obvious game breaking exploits, especially considering they've already addressed issues in the past (such as changing how the guards spawn and behave).
---
it's just a matter of realising that what you think/believe/know may not be common knowledge so letting others know when your actions will affect them is just common courtesy.
---
And for the chance that it doesn’t rank you up this is why I only use orange skills to rank up.
---
Shamans are great. Don't worry. Do your best and gear yourself properly, and you'll do great.
---
My guild has a few shaman healers, as a tank I don't notice anything lacking about them. I'd honestly rather have a shaman than a druid, if only for the resses.
---
BIS wand for warlocks and shadow priests drops off a boss in Strat live.
---
Reduces your chance to be crit by melee attacks and ups your dodge chance and parry if your class is able to parry, which priests arent.
---
&gt;You've clearly never tried to install anything other than AAA games. I'll let you continue to think you know what you're talking about though, buddy.
---
I absolutely love that instead of trying to disprove my claims, you just decided to attack me personally instead.
---
As for your assumptions, you couldn't be more wrong.
---
If it makes you feel better, I use OSX for work (software engineering).
---
you only get staggered when attacked in the back. If you constantly jump and turn around midair until you touch the ground again you greatly reduce the time monsters can attack you in the back. And AFAIK defense reduces stagger chance. so try stacking defense in your "riding gear".
---
Sounds about right :p
---
Ah okay ty!
---
&lt;Cry baby sub these days holy shit. People have been afk’ing in AV since the day it came out. Yes it sucks and it ruins it for others but it’s nothing new. Take a look at yourself and ask if you’re still enjoying this game. If you aren’t, maybe it’s time to let it go. If you are, then stop with the negative Nancy karma grabbing whine fest posts!&gt;
---
That’s a direct quote you posted like 2 weeks ago to someone and now you’ve made 2 cry baby posts in the span of like 3 hours.
---
A new Goblin NPC found at Shimmering Flats.
---
I love shamans. It’s my dream healer for dungeons. They give so much support with totems (especially as a tank for wf etc) and can kick casters/purge etc. if I have the chance i would do every dungeon with a shaman healer. Also: they are in good demand on my realm for raidspots
---
Warlock is quite a lot to manage and also has so many options and counters. It’s easy to say that it’s simple to set your pet on them and start popping dots to shadow bolt, but I think the complexity in warlock lies with knowing out to counter each class, type of mob, etc.   
---
In my and my friends’ experience, this is tricky from the start and becomes much more natural, as is to be expected.  
---
I’ll agree that mage is pretty complex in hardcore pvp and dueling environments, but pve is half the game and it’s hands down the easiest pve spec so I can’t say that overall mage is one of the more complex classes.  
---
My choices would be warrior and rogue. The two hardest classes to level on, the only two classes that have to take sustained damage of all types, and two classes that have quite a high ceiling and low floor when it comes to pve and pvp.
---
the decision remains... Do you sell the 1, or buy 3 more
---
That too. Like the stat templates for pvp in Legion. Basically killed pvp entirely. That was a suggestion that came from the WoW forums, so I guess that's where they look.
---
I just got it to finally drop today after a 100 runs. Can confirm it does proc in bear form.
---
What gear would you use in its place? Compare the total stats of both
---
+3 is barely anything so will hardly matter, the good stats and +15 resistances I'd value more with some +dmg
---
That cbow is better than Core Hound Rifle?
---
&gt;Druid, more about mana management and trying to not really engage your targets so much, again not having a ton of hotkeys.
---
Not having a ton of hotkeys? U have never played druid effectively. Drujds have dozens of keybindings and need macros for different scenarios.
---
Ah yeah, my bad
---
Maraudon definitely came out before 2008.
---
idk, im sure blizz is aware of this and we'll see if it's allowed or not. if so, then it's legit. if not, then they're banned.
---
Not really.
---
... yep
---
There really is no Cone of cold build for dungeons. The combo of frost nova then cone of cold. its meant to be your pvp slapper because frozen targets have 50% extra chance to be critted. in a dungen this will only steal agro off the tank and the whole mob will focus you. great way to piss off the party.
---
Just makes it extra worth it :))
---
Shamans are arguably the best horde-side healers due to the party buffs they bring.

you realize horde have an easier pull on van than alliance on drek right?

Lmbo ret dps in raids yikes miss me with that boomer shit
---
If you’re only level 50 I’d wait until you get more +healing/ mana per 5 and see how you like it. Dungeons between 50-60 when you’re not 60 is a little awkward for every healer imo. I a little bit agree though, the dispel is why I landed on priest as my main and healer. You do have the essential tremor and grounding totems which if placed correctly can save the group just as much grief. Shamans are allstar healers in horde raids because the melee meta is so strong and they always clump up.
---
I have stoneskin but farming black baron for the hunters that /needed shrouded mists

This is the way.

You’re 100% correct, my B

Question: if you want to heal dungeons while leveling, I’m guessing it’s best spec Ele? Is that ok?

I’ve never played Shammy before, but would like to someday!

I haven't played wow for around 12 years (left on BC) is retail wow worth playing? How many expansions would I have to buy?
---
You posted this 5 days ago. https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ecmun3/going_from_hero_to_zero/
---
I like the idea of elemental shaman and am not much of a healer, I’ve tried warlock and mage and find them fun but I really like the shaman abilities
---
Yes. It is early to worry about AQ. That is a fact.
---
&gt;It's literally impossible.
---
If you get max buffs on an alliance BiS geared dagger rogue you'll literally be 4.5% above white crit cap, and that's with *11%* hit. You have no idea what you're talking about and seem to think crit cap is just a static number. This is easy to calculate. This is something top rogues agree on. You're wrong. Get over it.
---
Where should I be leveling at 45 horde warrior?
---
Ever ninja a chest from someone? 99.9% chance you get this same message
---
And lose all your patterns, nice
---
While on the whole I agree with you, there is something to be said for healers getting the raw end of the stick. When my guild does not splits, I don't use any DPS consumables because the fight isn't a DPS race and I'll be more likely to pull aggro but the healers eat 2 major mana pots and 2 runes every time.
---
So in some situations DPS not using consumes just means the fight takes longer so healers go oom and have to eat mana pots. Just shifting the cost from DPS to healers.
---
Can I join your guild on it?
---
he said classic players are better than retail players.
---
You can farm gold in so many other ways as a mage you don't need gathering, and getting all your lost patterns back is no bueno
---
What kind of turn ins? You must've had all wing commanders up cause i don't see someone getting 4k rep with scraps turn ins \^\^
---
Been to every MC on my rogue 4/8 t1 no mainhand drop (ended up buying my current mainhand since MH drops are so rare)
---
Two MC’s on my Druid alt. 6/8 t1 and lots of accessories. Feels pretty good I’ll say !
---
Don't even joke. Nothing is beyond the realm of possibility with Blizzard.
---
Necropile is a super good PvP set because of the raw stats/stamina it has, the defense is irrelevant.
---
So Hello ladies and gentlemen, im the streamer. Let me tell you some stuff about this. First off thank you for using me as an example. For all of you that was sitting on these forums X months ago with #nochanges this is no changes. This is how it was in vanilla and if blizz wants to do something about it, that's up to them. NOW let me tell you why this is good for the game.
---
The discrepency betwen horde and alliance that most people are complaining about on this sub is que times. In my opinion this is not the worst thing. The worst thing is GOOD ALLIANCE PLAYERS GET AN EDGE! If your alliance you are able to ''premade'' av. This mean's if your a good player (that ofc no lifes for 20/hr a day like me) You will be able to make more honor then the average andy afking on his moms laptop. For horde we dont get an edge no matter if we're the faker off Classic WoW or if we are a 10 year old playing the game for the first time. Sit 25 min AV que join, do whatever your doing, try to get some solo kills and move on to another que. With this in the game we can acually get an edge being an organized and well focused pvp premade. You think this is not fair? Tough shit, get good find some friends and do it aswell or keep complaining here until we change classic to retail to cater to the majority of the playerbase. I just wanted to vent a bit since there's so many people saying this is a bad thing while I honestly think it's acually good for the game.
---
Of course it depends on your gear in comparison to the rest of the raid but for me it's often enough to secure a top spot. Can only really say it's your best bet to maximize your own dps.
---
No its like saying dont be a ret paladin because no matter how hard you try, it wont matter because you are a ret paladin and your damage sucks.
---
You're incompetent at a lot of things in life, I see.
---
If you disenchant stuff, I think it can be more. Especially if you adjust certain parts. For example, Red Mageweave Gloves are 45 ilvl and disenchant into some pretty good stuff.
---
A lot of healers and caster DPS don't take advantage of drink walking, which is really frustrating as a tank. You're just wasting time when you don't have to... Waters are free from a mage
---
I've played druid, rogue and priest extensively in vanilla, pservers and classic. Druid by far has the highest skill cap out of the three and by far the most keybinds.
---
Everyone acts like Christmas is some sort of universal celebration... Fact is that only 2  out of 7 billion humans in the world do celebrate it, I am an atheist married with an atheist in a Christian country and couldn't give less shit about Xmas
---
So instead of key binding I would need to click on stuff. How is this an improvement?
---
A bunch of guilds rolled there on purpose to avoid competition. Pretty sad a bunch of dudes intentionally played on grobb because it's the only way they could come close to being "the best" and it kind of ruined the whole vibe of the rp.
---
Pretty sure that’s not pre raid but who cares if he was excited about it ! Gz to him
---
I see you're avoiding the topic and going for the classic ad hominem strategy.
---
Maybe you're just in denial about ret paladins being garbage in raid because your favorite streamer guy plays it?
---
I'm not entirely sure, but I think all past expansions are included in base, which everyone defaults to when the new ones come out, so you'd only need the most recent? Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
---
As for getting in now, I personally wasn't a fan of this xpac, but everyone has their own tastes. The game is still fun regardless, but be aware of the drastically different game from BC.
---
you have nine whole months to get them back.
---
Join the channel /LookingForGroup, it's disabled by default but it's what most people typically use for finding groups. Depending on your server using /World might work too.
---
Play a Tauren. They're chill bovine.
---
You do realize that actually reaching there is much easier for Alliance?
---
No counterargument I see. Yes really.
---
What do you have against pizza?
---
You sir are a true hero
---
7 Holy Bois, 1 fraud and 1 work experience kid.
---
\+healing and mana/5 are useless if we are talking about dungeons exclusively.  Far better to only stack int than either of those stats.
---
You have achieved ultimate wow status
---
Yeah man, how dare 2 consenting adults agree to play a game between each other that doesn't affect anyone else.
---
Looks like you did yer job.  Hemadtho
---
Maybe a n00b question. But why the skinning knife? Does it stay tradable with the enchant on it? Can I use this at level 1?
---
Thanks
---
I believe it's the loading screen for the Hall of Legends in Orgrimmar. Equivalent of the Officer Barracks in Stormwind.
---
It's useful there but in most cases I just lifetap when movement is required and HP isn't in danger
---
460 blaze it
---
I do believe it works this way. If you buy BFA you just get everything else that came before.
---
Yeah, BFA isn't for everyone, but a ton of people still play it. I have fun with it once and a while. I wasn't a huge fan of it, so I stopped pretty early after only getting one toon to 120, I just recently came back to maybe attempt to finish BFA flying, and get the other 11 characters to 120, for some weird reason. I am having fun with what I am doing, not really sure what the end game is looking like though.
---
This is a dangerous sub to express even mildly pro-retail thoughts, thanks for being level headed about it!
---
Honestly all this talk makes me really happy I have a great dps and tank set. Been tanking more lately because all the warriors who are good/dedicated have everything from every dungeon.
---
Not everyone wants to manipulate every extra second out of the game...
---
I won my first tier piece last week, it was the giantstalker chest that got raid rolled since noone wanted it.. I'm a warrior.
---
We're obviously talking about alliance guilds here man.
---
Then I have no idea what your point even is.
---
You literally said that throwing a ball isn't as readily available as playing a video game.  I'm not sure what planet you're from where that would be true.
---
There's farm more obstacles to playing a video game then playing a lot of traditional sports (certainly not all).  And people sit on their couch and watch those sports instead of playing them.  That's the point others were making.  Not sure what your point is.
---
It's good for war tanks. Not sure about druids but I don't see how it's bad
---
As a holy pally I like ret pallies that keep blessings up on the group without reminders, throw a heal/cleanse when necessary, and adjust their aura to benefit the group not sanctuary which only benefits them.
---
I don't...I don't like most ret pallies.
---
Yeah man that totally has everything to do with RMTing and gambling laws.
---
Awesome, thanks for the tip. May make a shammy later this week!
---
Yup this is just a video of some asshole fishing in AV
---
0/10 OP
---
Doesn't mean a guild is going to want to run a shadowpriest though.
---
Yeah, really, assuming this about people tanking lowbies is more suggestive of some psychological pathology than anything
---
You're so wrong.
---
this is the ghost of Christmas future
---
You're the problem. People with your mindset are the problem. The "sweaty neckbeards" that are actually good plays the game completely independently from other more casual players and have little to no impact on them, yet some "woke" people like you seem to think they know that we either look down on you or are trying to tell you that you're playing the game wrong, which simply isn't the case. Most people that do that does it outside of the game and most likely just have big mouths. Why in your mind do you feel the need to talk down on people who like to min-max, when the people who are actually min-maxing pretty much never talk down on any other type of player in WoW? Just mind your own business and let us play however we want, we are not trying to disturb anyone, we're literally just playing the game the way WE enjoy it.
---
guild has yet to see a binding or an eye
---
Only Totems you should drop are WF and Strenght. Aim for 100% uptime. Use max rank Lesser Healing Wave when your group is taking big damage. Bind rank 1 Earth Shock, and interrupt when needed. Use Mana Tide Totem on CD to reduce downtime. Drink asap when you leave combat.
---
As a Tauren player in Undead zones - eg, Hillsbrad - the Undead are completely transparent about their goals to develop new biological plague weapons capable of killing nearly all living things.  There are several entire quest chains entirely built around it.     
---
There’s absolutely no way the Tauren would have anything to do with them.  Blizzard writing is patchwork and sloppy.
---
I don't understand anything about this post. What is deathroll?
---
What's your ingame name? I think I played with you in that BG, what a great AV win that was.

Kurinnaxx is slightly favored for Horde but otherwise a good server.
