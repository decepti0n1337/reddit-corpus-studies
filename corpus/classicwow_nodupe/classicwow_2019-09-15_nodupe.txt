If they sell for 20k gold then I'll be annoying the people willing to pay 20k gold for it
---
---
---
Yeh except your epic mount stays static.
---
Actually, you Revenge him right before you Conc Blow, so you could've used the rage to Hamstring -&gt; Conc blow. Why wouldn't you expect him to get out of combat after 5 seconds of him not attacking you and you not attacking him?
---

---
And yeah, you did kill him after you dedicated 80% of the fight to trying to run away -- trying to run away while you're snared and he's not.
---
Sorry unrelated, but what's the add on that changes your party healthbars to that?
---
I read your name wrong as StrikeyWifey at first
---
I give bitches 10 if you want more then pay me
---
I see no reason it would, its apply a filter on top of your game through nVidia. Its like changing your monitor settings as far as i can tell.
---
Team player. I like it
---
I'm super buzzed on promethazine and oxy (post-op), and so I'm having a hard time processing all of that, BUT
---
I disagree with most. Costly flying, eh, worth it. Better than it is now. Dailies were great for farming. The finder tool is great, and I would like it in Classic IF it was a locked playerbase from THAT server. Free loot bosses were somewhat silly, but I know it got several good friends of mine into the game very quickly, and they still play today.
---
We raided a lot, so obvs agreed on that part. Aesthetics, no contest from BC to WOTLK. I mean it's laughable.
---
Layers aren't going away, a lot of servers have 60k+ pop.
---
Literally wanted to upvote this twice.
---
Can I change which primary I want to do whenever I want? Or once I start is it locked in

About that other video....

Yea. I actually got the ivory back in vanilla and exchanged it for one of the others because armor is cool! Still sad about that
---
Hahahahaga love the comment
---
Its a great choice.
---
IMO the population curve went south because WOTLK was the third act of WoW, it was the summit of all that had been happening. Everything since then has been BS.
---
I'll cosign
---
OK, so it sounds like faction isn't an issue. What about class? Are there class storylines? Like the most fun I'vehad in WoW is the class order halls. Anything like that? I'd love to learn more about mages, for example. But if there's nothing really class specific then I'd probably just roll priest.
---
ah.. you mean cheating.  Nice one...
---
He just wants a big tiddy self gf.
---
I don't think it's that long away. They have stated that they want layering removed before phase 2 is released and Ion Hazzikostas  has stated that they want phase 2 out within a couple of months to get world bosses, Dire Maul, and the PvP system out.
---
LFD has its ups and downs. And yeah different games for sure, agreed.

You can drop any profession at anytime and pick up a new one, but you will lose all progress you've made if you ever decide to pick it up again.
---
For example, you can have Mining up to 75 and drop it for Enchanting. You will start Enchanting at 0 skill. If you then drop Enchanting and pick up Mining again, you will start back at 0 skill.
---
gtfo youre actually trash
---
Exactly!  I think in vanilla I got my mount around 42. But I enjoyed my time questing and seeing different areas. To me grinding would be too boring and I’d end up being burned out with the game by then. Plus quest rewards get better and trash loot from mobs get bet in higher zones.
---
What was that addon called to see an items item lvl and does it still work for classic?
---
people normally don''t have any idea about what they're talking about and just repeat what they read on the internet. 
---
as you said, dps scaling is a thing in raid, since we're talking about consistent DPS. Burst DPS for hunters still high even in late game. Anyway, PVP is not about DPS. Warriors are one of the best DPS in the game and still, they suck in WPvP. SP have mediocre DPS compared to warriors and mage and still are top tier in WPvP. PvP is about CCing and not going into OOM.
---
You too, go join him
---
You should have given you the INT buff first.
---
They quit because the story ended, for all intents and purposes, with the death of Arthas. All content since has been lame.
---
Yeah, I take offense to seeing blood elf and weeb in the same sentence. Nothing weeby about them, just some pretty boys with green eyes. :)
---
It’s sooo good!
---
Retail has a lot of conveniences but those conveniences have cost us that sense of community.
---
Things like phasing help tell a more immersive story but it separates us l. The auto-group finder makes it so much easier to play with people even from other servers but we can’t form any real lasting connections when everything is so automated.
---
While there are some things that are great that they added, they may have added too much conveniences we have lost so much in the process. We lost the core feeling of being in an MMO.
---
While personally I'd sooner say I was from Norrath than any place on Azeroth, this post made me uncomfortably emotional - it never ceases to amaze me, how common our experiences can be despite how radically different the conditions of our lives are.   
---
I was born in Washington State, but I'm from Kelethin, or Teldrassil, or Coruscant. Take your pick, they've all been home.

Thx love u

Ya but you'd have to swim to BB or run through Vietnam.
---
You’re not going to get 5k. Maybe 1k in 6 months to a year or so. 
---
I was very into the AH back in the day. Even during TBC it was only fetching a few hundred gold. 
---
While being the only epic pet in the game and crazy rare, there are no pet battles or pet journal to keep them in, so it’s just cosmetic, and people will grind the pet out before laying out a guild bank of gold on it.
---
Do yourself a favor. Be the man! Use that booger and keep him out all the time!
---
Gondola operator?
---
LFD had its uses, and I prefer locked communities.
---
BRE is mainly a pvp weapon, arguably the best pvp weapon in the whole game for warriors(except for Might of Menethil)
---
Any BoE that's worth any amount of gold is always a NEED.  The other way this isn't a thing is when you are playing with a full group of friends.
---
How is it fair if a 100g boe drops that someone gets to need an equip it in a pug?  If he wins it he can equip it if not everyone contributed to the clear and has an equal right to get the item to use or sell.
---
idk about that but a skull undead mage only resisting what, 2 spells from a 20 dosent feel right
---
Im confused but dont you think its a bit early for a plants to cost over 100g? Im fairly sure its still a bit early for a flast to go for over 100g
---
Imbalance faction only really matters for world pvp, so it comes down to how much world pvp do u want to do? also affects farming area's for professions etc. as you get ganked and can be frustrating for vast majority of people
---
One thing to consider tho is alot of people rn are forming cleave groups to spam level in dungeons, so this negates the impact of world pvp as you're likely not going to see the opposing faction from anywhere between level 30-45 (or wherever cathedral stops becoming good for xp)
---
Maraudon is an instance in Desolace and princess is the highest boss. That means the lower area of that instance will be skipped.
---
LFD on a locked server would have been killer.
---
&lt;3
---
Not with a cam though, and coincidentally he uses a cam on his streams now...so who knows
---
Black lotus were worth very little for like half of vanilla because flasks didn't last through death. After they started lasting through death they were 20-40g on every server I ever played on.
---
Nope still a clown
---
The first part of Legion was super. The second part was shitty in the exact inverse proportion.
---
Dude he's 7 levels above me. As soon as he charged from his fucking mount my mind was 100% run away. I knew I could do that in the water. My focus was that water. 
---
And the drop combat timer is &gt; than 5 seconds. That was the only thing unexpected.

You’re assuming way too much. Sure, Iran is very backwards, aggressive, and a radical state. However America did prop up a dictator there which fueled this fire. And yes, the current administration has been a lot more harsh with passing sanctions on Iran so they were literally pushed by the United States like I said. Stop assuming shit.

Shoutout to Bowsandhoes and Scratchnsnif for rescuing our party of under-levelled allies in stranglethorn vale. Defended us the entire journey.
---
Based off the 20 memes daily that say the same thing, yes.
---
Warrior prot isn't really meant for grinding 3+ mobs out in the world, but you can do that in any spec as long as you have a friend. Its main concentration is making regular dungeon runs and many pvp situations a lot easier. 
---
For focusing on counter-ganking, I always pick up:
---
-Improved Revenge (basically a 3 second stun on demand against melee)
---
-Improved Shield Bash (can catch most mid-tier mages completely off guard, and great against spriest)
---
For Shield Slam, I typically respec at 40 to grab it. It can deal really good burst, and can even dispel vital buffs (ice armor!!! ice barrier!!!)
---
Storyline contributed a lot to the decline, as that's essentially the end of the story. I'd be fine with non-cross-realm LFD.
---
They don't even have heterochromia!
---
[this is unironically my inventory](https://prnt.sc/p681ij) as a lvl 43 war going through STVietnam for the 2nd time, i literally gargle so much drugs i turn into a witcher like geralt.
---
I out range the boulder, and when the boulder does hit me, I cancel cheetah before the dmg hits me to avoid the daze.
---
What we used to do in vanilla is irrelevant.
---
Doesn't change the fact that someone could have easily hit need instead.
---
I'll agree with you brochacho
---
New to this game. Picked a human rogue. Can somebody link me a guide to leveling, gear, questing, etc..? 
---
I feel like I'm drowning. Theres so much shit to do and I don't know what is neccesary and what is a complete waste of time. Please help
---
Same parroting on that matter
---
Wow have not seen this in a long time.
---
The first half was so good. The second half was excrement.
---
We don’t 
---
Without layering it becomes multiple times slower than it was in vanilla
---
Nah. TBC was ugly, tedious, and boring.
---
This wasn't well known enough for them to have actively fixed it.  I'm betting they accidentally fixed it with how the imported the old data in the modern engine.
---
Still, it's a real shame.  Makes broken tooth the only viable pvp pet in phase 1 now.
---
On the real!
---
Lol you guys are so dumb. Stay mad noobs.
---
Just take your time and know what you're doing. Sounds silly like there isn't, Just breathe when someone opens on you, check CD's, Decide on next step. 
---
It'll get easier and you'll get better and better, especially with prediction too. So again, Practice.
---
Underappreciated zone, one of my favorites. Nice screencap.
---
I used to make millions of gold just playing the ah in retail years ago, but that isn't really doable until you have some money already and the ah is also very volatile right now. So while you're leveling it's more about slowly and steadily building bank without splashing it on all kinds of non-essential things. 
---
I just hit 31 and have about 40g by selling literally everything (have herbalism and skinning). I have a bank character placed in a big city so I just mail everything that isn't junk to the bank and sell it at the ah. 
---
You say you vendor green and white items, stop doing that. Never vendor green items, and only vendor white items if their ah value -cut is less than vendor value, which it rarely is. Green items will always be worth something due to the DE value, even if the stats are awful, and items with decent stats are worth way more than their vendor value. 
---
Most money (unless you get lucky with BoEs) comes from white items which are mats for all sorts of things, and therefore you should never sell anything without finding out what it's worth. You can't rely on getting BoE items that you can sell for 100+ goal because that's unlikely to happen, you just have to get the most return on the items you do get and for that, vendor is not the best option (my only non-green BoE so far was a cloak worth half a gold, and my highest selling auction so far was 95s). 
---
Generally post items at short duration and then repost 2 hours later is far more effective (and cheaper) than posting them 8 or 24 hours, but ofc you also have to repost them more as you're not going to find a seller for every item in 2 hours. 
---
You can probably take advantage of the fact you have leatherworking, but as I'm not too experienced in that department I'll refrain from giving you advise that might be wrong.
---
Interesting. Can you screen shot the ui with it?
---
Would you able to share the steam link controller setup? I think those are exportable, this setup fixes all the problems I encountered trying this the last time a thread like this showed up
---
I’ve soulstoned so many random people instead of myself over the last two weeks.
---
Hahahahahahahaahaha what a loser.
---
Yeah it feels like theres a way bigger imbalance on that server
---
I'm not saying I want it that way. I'm saying it is that way. The fact that theres a definition from dictionary.com or it has greek roots doesnt fcking change that. In English it means the mental illness, nothing else. I literally said in my posts that theres no other correct usages, yet you act like my argument is about what I want. Lol
---
They patched it right? I thought you could only layer every 3 hours or something. Did you do this before then?
---
I'm rational, you're being a child.
---
When you say game design, you must mean LFD.
---
I only like the concept of LFD in a locked community. 
---
Premise, lore, aesthetic, raidng, etc WOTLK beats the stew out of BC.
---
What's sleep?
---
I feel yoyr pain
---
No, it turns out that Sunken Temple quests aren't in phase 1, but they will be in phase 2. So you'll probably see questie saying that quest is available but it's not yet. The same with "An Imp's request".
---
I for one appreciate that I don't have to `/cancelaura [form:2] Bear Form, [form:3] Cat Form`... For every single macro and can use `/cancelform`. Otherwise, I agree that we shouldn't be limited in the way you're describing.
---
Now i'm curious as well

New patch?

Level BS or QQ.

Felcloth is an upgraded version of shadoweave about 12 levels later
---
all spells deal a certain type of damage.  spell damage affects all types while shadow damage only affects spells that specify they deal shadow damage.
---
Haha yes! Luckily we were 5 man premade - So the item will be sold and shared amongst all 5 players
---
Those shoulders look reallllyyyy good, damn.
---
Should always need on rare BoE drops, especially while leveling, stupid to even wear it anyways. Half the time the person who actually "needs" it won't equip and just put on AH.
---
[removed]
---
what are his unit frames?
---
100%
---
I bet you the people yelling to need on boes are the same ones who give hybrids shit for needing on their gear.
---
Any source on this? I'd straight up bet my life there's no chance retail still has nearly 2 million active subs.
---
Exactly!
---
What do you mean by banned? You can kill all the npc's you want, you can't get banned for it. Go for it, it's part of what wow has to offer. And classic/vanilla was all about world pvp.
---
There seems to be some uninformed responses here, or at least ones lacking depth. It is 100% true that UD have better racials - cannibalize, wotf (which is massive in spriests few hard matchups of other priests + warlocks) and even shadow resist is relevant, whereas troll Regen is a joke, and berserking is extremely niche at best - but not negligible in the form of group PvP throwing out fast heals (when you are low and safe, don't heal yourself - pop zerk and cast on other players).
---
However... Priest racial spells - Troll is extremely, extremely powerful, arguably one of the best damaging spells in the game even. Shadowguard is a 1:1 ratio of spell power, no cooldown, and procs when damaged by ANY ability, not just melee. Every single proc has a chance to stun due to blackout. Absolutely insane.
---
And their other racial? A ranged mortal strike effect. One of the only classes able to apply healing debuffs in the game. 
---
For group PvP, trolls are undoubtedly stronger, and in 1v1, trolls are still stronger in all matchups EXCEPT vs other priests and warlocks - which, granted, are the hardest matchups for shadow priests.
---
I leave it down to aesthetics because of how close they are in power.
---
As long as you hit honored with your own races reputation for the discounts its fine.
---
Though the problem with grinding only is that sometimes it can be hard to get back into leveling, since there's a fair few follow up quests and stuff for some zones, so if you didn't do the previous ones you will miss out on a quest or 2 which hurts the efficiency.
---
People have been saying this ever since WoW Classic was announced.
---
If it actually did kill retail, and Blizz had to shutter retail to focus on Classic, they’d rub it in the face of anyone who enjoyed retail the slightest amount for years.
---
Even if classic peters out, but retail lives on, they’ll go “well boys, we give’em a run for their money, didn’t we?” for years. (Or will brag about how they forced Blizz to bring about any sort of change for the betterment or retail, no matter how small or indirectly influenced by Classic.

He wasn't level 20? He was level 49 after he dinged.

Can't you talk to someone to see it before the mana bomb?
---
Oaky but this doesn't tell me what to do. It tells me where to go after level X, but how the hell do I get to lvl x in the first place? Is there monsters I should kill for level 1-10 for example? Like where is a guide for that.
---
You guys should have rolled all rolled need, he did nothing wrong, yall probably flamed the shit out of him and he prob taunted you cause you're dumb not to all be rolling need on a BoE purple while leveling.

Nah man game is ruined because people know how to efficiently level now /s

&gt; Both names are reportable under the Blizzard Rp server naming convention rules.

This is amazing, was looking for a dedicated sub for Mograine, but this is all I need!

Is the azure silk set worth the loss of other stats?

Lmfao how incredibly stupid to call me absolutely disturbed based off that last post. That is the real ignorance. That was literally a small amount of anger and you think you know my mental state based off 1 reddit post where I'm dealing with overwhelming stupidity? That says next to nothing about who I am as a person or my mental state. How offensive, rude, shortsighted, and straight up dumb and wrong. It was also 4 am when I typed that. I shouldn't need to give you reasons for empathy for you to not make those asinine judgements.
---
There definitely are not other uses for the term schizophrenia in the English language. Saying a group of informed individuals will laugh at me is such a weasel statement. Lmfao. That doesnt support your argument at all. I can say the same thing to you. 
---
Greek roots are the ROOT of a word. Talking about its background. It doesnt decide the English meaning. It relates yes. But it's not uncommon for it to be different in certain ways too. You literally didnt even address ANY of my points. You went on to reply with an Ad Hominem argument. Lmao. You're wrong. Bye.
---
On my lock on Northdale, I once casted 12 Curses of Agony at level 42 on a ?? Skull level Rogue in a row (counted, I stopped because I was OOM) in a group fight, and all of them were resisted. And that was while I had the affliction tree talent to reduce chances of targets resisting my spells by 10%. 
---
Maybe it was a tad broken on PServs, but on the other hand I remember watching an old retail Vanilla PvP video a couple months ago in which a mage had so many of his spells resisted that it genuinely motivated my choice to play a physical damage class on Classic. So I too agree with the OP that this clip is bizzare.
---
I have yet to find a single green item in a chest.  Has anyone?  Usually just trash or pots, sometimes some herbs.

How many of them were Alliance NPCs?
---
Should have linked eu also to show another 2 mil at least.  Us alone isn't poaching them all.  Not to mention other regions.  Curious if those numbers are all correct because they blew most of the estimates out of the water.
---
Well, if you’re playing classic you’re also subbing to retail right?
---
Hahaha I remember doing that super often both by accident and on purpose  
---
NPC lives matter!
---
With the help from /u/Senaeva, this is the one I think, not only does the tooltip and cooldown display properly, it also takes you back to Battle Stance and Charges from Berserker Stance, so it goes both ways:
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
`#showtooltip [nocombat]Charge;Intercept`
---
`/cast [nocombat]Battle Stance`
---
`/cast Charge;`
---
`/cast [combat]Berserker Stance`
---
`/cast Intercept`
---
Half truths. Druid single target TPS is higher than warrior, but their aoe DPS is lower. In raids, druid tanks are bad main tanks. For the reasons I already said, but since you don't seem convinced:
---
-druids don't have a reliable way to remove fears in 30 second intervals, and when you consider that only the alliance have access to fear wards, this is a huge problem
---
-druids don't benefit from weapon skills, or weapon procs, including windfury totem = less TPS
---
- shifting out of bear form during raids usually = death. So their toolkit is small
---
-druids can't block or parry. This means they take way more damage, since this is a huge part of damage reduction during end game content. This means they take die faster than warrior tanks, which means more heal, which means more mana for heals. I don't think you understand how significant this is. Not to mention you can't use pots in bear form.
---
If you're raiding in a semi serious guild, can you tank as a druid? Yes maybe, but you're not going to be the main tank unless they have zero warrior tanks, and even then, they'd most likely want to wait for them. 
---
If you're I'm a hardcore guild there is zero chance they'll have a main tank druid, or even a 2nd or 3rd tank. Maybe an off tank.
---
If you're dungeoning, and enjoy druid, you can definitely be a tank for medium difficulty bosses.
---
If it's like vanilla. They will not be. 
---
I'd prefer it this way to preserve the Classic feel.
---
Unpopular opinion, but I think it should remain fixed.   Roll on a PVP server if you want to grief other players - roll into a town and kill all the NPCs and lowbies you want.  
---
There should be some areas where it is safe to go afk and not have to worry about some asshole getting your player killed.  In vanilla this was used to grief your own faction more than the enemy faction, so I don't really think it is that big of a deal.
---
I reported as a bug when I first noticed it a few days ago.
---
If it's the one I'm thinking of, the southern camp, it's 50-51. But there are a LOT of caster that spawn. Tried making it work myself without any luck.
---
I'm right behind you man!
---
I have a hard time believing they invited learned your stats somehow and kicked you for not "tanking".  I imagine there was some shit that went down where people died and it probably happened because you're a dookie tank tbh
---
Bring a Hpal healer with Salvation it helps a lot with mages
---
You literally cannot get more fair than rolling for an item. Everyone has the same chances, the winner gets the item, the end. It’s the most fair and fullproof system you can implement.
---
Why should anyone get "Ravager" automatically? It's a nice 1,5g vendor price and nobody worked more than the other to get the drop. How exactly does this change from 1-10g items and suddenly 100g items? By the time you finally got a 100g item, you would've made that through countless of BoPs.
---
People competed for mobs in vanilla, it's not a new thing
---
Is there an addon everyone uses to find this out?

Don't worry, you won't be taking my raid spot.

It's not going to take a year to get to phase 3.

World pvp is fun.
---
This is the way it was in vanilla.
---
The itemization for pvp rewards was designed for specific timing along with other pve content. And the itemization in classic is based on 1.12 for pvp rewards so really you DON'T want people to get those rewards any faster that they already will. If you are a raider it would be like wearing mc gear vs someone in naxx gear. I think that using the 1.12 itemization was a mistake but that's what they chose so...
---
I'm baffled with the amount of people in this post that thinks this is ok...
---
yeah but you gotta outrage everyone on reddit.  grrr I have my pitchfork!  face my fury blizzlord!

It's cross realm

hard to convey the joy I had playing today in writing.. I know that from now on I won't be logging in for that level up, that gear upgrade, that mount, but for the fun of it..

That's a nice looking cast bar, what addon is it?
---
You don't get to pick and choose what you like and don't to be removed. The Devs said they wanted to recreate the classic experience and this was a part of it. There are no safe areas, it is a dangerous world. That's why you play a MMORPG.
---
Fuck people trying to actually use low level epics, like seriously? That's for twinks and people willing to pay a premium. I'm definitely not going to not need roll on a BoE epic.

Revered to exalted is 21000 reputation. One turn-in is 50 reputation and costs 20 cloth --&gt; 8400 cloth for revered to exalted.

How does transfer work?
---
It's honestly not that hard to get it by 40 tho.  I just hit 40 last night and bought my mount with 9g left over. Don't buy the useless skills from trainer pay attention to the different ways you can make gold while leveling.
---
To be fair, don’t play on a PvP server if you don’t want to get pvp’d. You signed up for the chance of something like that happened as soon as you pick that server type. Mistakes made weeks ago potentially.
---
Why not BGs without honor gear? How is that so massively different from, as you accurately mentioned, 1.12 itemization and specs?
---
There's a pretty good out-of-the-box frost mage WeakAuras available I would recommend. Haven't found any cast bar replacements yet though.
---
Even with layer abuse you only farm ~8 runecloth stacks per hour. 500 stacks would therefore take 62.5 hours of playtime.

8 friends and I transferred to earthfury and I love not sitting in a 2-6k queue when I get home, and find groups just as easily. You just have to actually find the group instead of scrolling thru world chat
---
Same for some engi stuff, I always roll need on my engi gems. People always respond with “why need”, well I quite literally need it for my prof. Lol
---
&gt;Any BoP that's worth any amount of gold is always a NEED. The other way this isn't a thing is when you are playing with a full group of friends.
---
&gt;How is it fair if a 1g bop drops that someone gets to need and equip it in a pug? If he wins it he can equip it if not everyone contributed to the clear and has an equal right to get the item to use or sell.
---
that logic is flawed
---
No, the sub growth was stagnated from the start of Wrath.
---
It said its in wpl for alliance in the quest.  Is that the location for horde?
---
This is awesome thanks a lot for your help!
---
Expansions for retail are a completely separate matter so yes, all you need is a subscription to play Classic.
---
he berated us, laughed and taunted us all day, why support negative behavior? Also, yes, it is ninja loot, see that need button? He doesn't need it. he cant equip it. You must have ninja'd in vanilla or do now.
---
not saying hes lvl20, im sayin he casted like 20 spells
---
I did aswell this comment made me realize it was plz don't hex me.
---
your healers will love that
---
People are saying Orc/Troll or doesn’t matter but I much prefer Tauren. It’s a little longer walk to set up but if you’re going to lvl to 5 anyways that doesn’t matter. 
---
  
---
The benefit is once you’re there and set up Thunder Bluffs is the best city for the alt. Bank/Mailbox/Auction house is the closest to each other, the city population is lower so it’s not super crowded, and I feel like it’s most out of the way that if you need something from there you just switch to the alt and buy it (profession stuff, Fishing/cooking recipes). Save your main time and money going there.
---
No

Hello from Canada. Lots of Iranians, and Persians here (some people who are from Iran call them selves Persian). There is a life outside of Iran if you can make it! White, brown, black, asian, it really does not matter here. No sanctions.

#NOCHANGES
---
What's the difference between this one and the one that drops in dead mines?
---
Thanks for taking the idiot approach and not being able to see the difference between a 1.5g gain vs a 80g gain. I'll let you figure out the rest.
---
Careful, It's redditors that actually think you even need a 1H/Shield while tanking SM
---
Shocked everyone agreed to greed
---
Purely for pve yes. In PvP though you need your actual class advantages.
---
Question for anyone that might potentially know: in WPL there's the 'hidden' quests at the Dalson farm, where you read the diary, open the outhouse, then the cabinet in the house. I remember doing this chain loads and have looked at a video of someone doing it to make sure i wasn't mis-remembering, but seem to have a problem. 
---
I've read the diary in the barn, then killed the skeleton outside and got the Outhouse Key, but the outhouse just isn't clickable for me to open it.  I'm lvl54 and the quest req. is 52 so it's not like it's not available to me, and the skeleton only drops the key if you've read the diary so i know i didn't miss something. Any ideas what's causing it, or just bugged?
---
Nice!
---
yes i can, you see i did?
---
you are all just greedy bastards, just because the value of an item is a lot more than another item it is somehow different?
---
imagen every item is BoE, would you roll need on everything just because you could sell it?
---
hypocrite
---
Currently in between jobs.
---
They actually said they would get rid of them asap when the launch rush was over, phase 2 is just the deadline to **absolutely** remove it immediately. It's in recognizition of the fact that even primo phase 2 is really, really late to get rid of it but of course they wanted to have some leeway in case they misjudged the population or the rate at which it declined, which is strongly looks like they did.
---
boe epic or blue = need
---
If you want to play for the lore, classic has a much more cohesive story.
---
Wouldnt matter. Tank lost all aggro and healer is still abput to die.
---
beh güd
---
Good boy Ben
---
U can move them by default
---
Lol I didn't even notice that. It was surprisingly easy though so that makes sense now.
---
wires
---
People aren't shelling out big money for twinks yet, most players still trying to get to 60 and if a boe purple helps them do that, then hell yeah they should use it.
---
This 100%. Way too real. Enter the grind to escape the grind.
---
/r/mallninjashit
---
Right click your nameplate
---
Download the Questie addon. That will show you where all the quests relevant to your level are.
---
so you want to play horde but youre not playing horde.
---
On launch of bgs' they were not. It changed before the end of vanilla and likely will be inclassic
---
The point is, that 15 gold could potentially buy you as much now as whatever you could sell it for in two or three months.
---
yea but slows are easily reapplied and not as bad as losing complete control for a few seconds
---
As a person on an RP server, they are NOT the place to go to looking for a mature world chat.
---
Sure if you outgear the lock you have a chance
---
From my understanding your party members just need to be within the vicinity like 10 yards or so. Someone correct me if I’m wrong.
---
Worse: with the buffs they no longer need you.
---
Whatever you are trying to tell me..  
---
..i even stated "So, if you don't have a problem healing up the druid" and u are replying with "druids can't block or parry. This means they take way more damage, since this is a huge part of damage reduction during end game content."  
---
Are u kidding me? What have i seen on the various different private servers the last few years?  
---
And if you wanna talk about the difficulty of endgame content.. sure go ahead. Seems to be very hard if i see people clearing Molten Core already when back in the days people took weeks of resets to get gear to kill him.
---
No.... read what I said that I thought op meant changed... not banned.  Right now mc is changed.
---
Huawei mate se
---
Very nice! Made me think of a post I saw talking about a possible feature for Classic+ that would like, scale levels to be the same during PvP or something stupid like that. Would completely take away moments like this. If they want that, they should go back to retail lol
---
Use soulstone to dump aggro.
---
It's like feign death, but way more convincing.
---
It's oddly fun to adventure as a warrior, as much as it appears to suck. There's something rewarding about stocking up on supplies before you head out and stretching them as far as you can. A lot of the early levels have you drifting about, using most of the consumables you find to sustain yourself. Just something gritty about it that I find appealing now that I've done it several times.
---
The world PvP has felt very balanced as well. I’m so happy, it’s the chilliest most casual server I’ve seen. We barely have enough 60s on to our raids together. 
---
For you casual dadlifers out there, if you’re looking for a move this server couldn’t be a better fit. So happy I left Whitemane.
---
Play both
---
Could get this back with server crunch and situational layering
---
Only get layered as a last resort for stability, only play with your server unless invited to another
---
Keep the benefits of sharding/layering while eliminating detrimental stuff
---
**World** of Warcraft &gt; **Interdimensional Strangers** of Azeroth
---
Nice one, hope you reported him too because that's very against the rules
---
By the time you've gotten the 80g item, you could've had more than that in 1,5g items.
---
I'd say the idiot approach is understanding Ravager is a nice item. But not understanding a BiS item for Warriors, which is going to last most warriors probably half a year isn't 'good' enough for them to get it, if they actually need it. But the 150g is.
---
MadSeasonShow.
---
Nope, The Novels Dawn of Aspects and War Crimes both confirm Chromie to be a Female.
---
Also, Not likely possible, since Like elementals, Dragons represent Primordial Truth of Nature and the Cosmos, meaning it wouldnt really be possible for them to suffer from body dysmorphia given that they're literally made of Primordial truth. Something would have to actually drive them crazy, like the case with the Emerald Nightmare.
---
I was calling a 2:1 horde to ally ratio in General Chat STV while leveling ally Skeram, I kept hearing people say "Naw man, it's like 55:45 or 60:40 at worst!"
---
65:35. Big oof. I had to just skip Badlands because the horde ratio there was more like 6:1 and I would be killed for my quest mob tags all the time
---
or you know the person is actually going to use it.
---
for BOE epics sure roll need but for the blues I would just do it the normal way.
---
No, you're just looking at too small a picture. Yes no one has gold now, but layer hopping has allowed them to collect months worth of materials already, the intention was never to sell them immediately. The discrepancy between these players and non-abusers is only going to keep growing because they've got this massive reserve of resources to use for the next long, long time for flasks and whatever craftables you can think of that requires Arcane Crystals.
---
Also op put it an edit I see how to confirm he meant changed.  He said banned as in a mechanic that is no longer in the game that used to be.
---
It's also the kind of thing that we were all on the receiving end of at some point back in the day and laugh about.
---

If the server is full, find the nearest opp faction Inn that is pvp enabled.  Get your corpse as close to the inn as possible.  Res in the inn and spam aoes.  I cannot imagine the salt from people who are trying to avoid afk from jumping or keyboard pushes being logged out and into a queue because they can't jump when dead....
---
Some hordie is gonna go to gank em and are gonna be in for a rude awakening

I regret following my guild and transferring from Faerlina to Heartseeker. Playing on Heartseeker feels like a singleplayer game. I'd rather have the queues.
---
&gt;Disclaimer: I have not yet seen endgame. No spoilers.
---
This doesn't work on reddit, lol. You've practically seen Endgame already through all the scenes used for memes.
---
Dodges come before blocks on the hit table. Even with 100% block chance you will still dodge before you block.
---
I was weak. She seduced me.
---
Its just so much more socially orientated than every other mmorpg today. I love it its such a great experience to be able to play this game!
---
Ye everyone should role need on boe epics as far as i know
---
I’m not sure but I do believe there is an internal roll for tie break, just not disclosed.
---
Damn they were dumb af
---
I have no idea when it was, but I do vividly remember a whole bunch of folks that regularly hung out at the entrance to WSG turning in marks to level from 30 to 31 because they'd changed the brackets and we weren't the top dogs any more.
---
"I'll help you, but complain about it the entire time."
---
Come to Earthfury. We have a more balanced pop and chill people.
---
Druid twinks were always bear form flag carriers.
---
I mean I agree classic feels like a much better social experience than retail, but cities are just as filled up in retail if not more. In fact this looks like a quiet day compared to the server I play on retail. And before people put it down to cross-realm sharding, it's not. I just play on a high-pop realm.
---
Heartseeker is WoW: Singleplayer. Transferring was a mistake.
---
Your video looks so awesome I’m going to have to look into how you did that later. Thanks for posting this! So it’s alt+f3 in game with NVIDIA. Fantastic! Thanks again!
---
I mean I am aware that most people aren't close to 60 yet. 
---
However the real question is - who will be playing the game in 6 months time. Probably the majority of those cashed up players who are abusing layering right now.
---
and my nickname is highschool
---
No it isn't lmfao. That is so wrong.  Go to "QuoteInvestigator.com/2015/11/15/legs/" and behold how wrong you are. You can find actual discussions about this aside from that quote investigator too. You cant call something by something else and act like it is actually that thing. That happened with the definition of literal being used as metaphorical. There are very specific certain things that change the actual meaning of a word. You cant use words however you want ?? 
---
And your example is different than this specific case. 30 people upvoting on Reddit isn't equivalent to such large scale common uses. People upvoted that because they realized he meant crazy. Schizophrenia is associated with a very subjective and meaningless , ambiguous word, of "crazy." That's why people understood his meaning. Understanding what people mean as opposed to the literal word usage is a very good skill to have. That doesn't mean the words are correct. People upvoted cause they thought of "feeling crazy". I doubt any of them was like, "Ah, I understand that alternate usage of schizophrenia that doesnt imply the mental illness".  And if they did think that, then they're wrong. 
---
If tons of people call a dog a tree, it definitely does not make a dog a tree. Theres many words that commonly misused and we arent changing the definitions of the word to attend to peoples misusage.
---
I mean it’s your opinion who the best content creators are so this is a pretty dumb question
---
Bleau- Alliance
---
I feel salty towards the ones abusing layering. We should've never had this system and we got it even though it's shit and now they're making it even worse by abusing the super obvious problems that were pointed out on here but drowned by the "It'll be gone by phase 2 it won't even be a problem" idiots. Leveling is a bit more meh.
---
Anachronos would Like to have a word with you over where you got the whole "U" endings mean male. Because that's just made up, man.
---
just play whatever you feel like is best in the moment
---
It really doesn't seem accurate. Why does Faerlina have a 3.5 hour queue right now when Sulfuras has a higher population but no queue?
---
Rising above at 47
---
Look at the realm list around 8-9PM, pick one that's high but not full and you'll have more than plenty people to play with!

Still more dps than using a shield.
---
Ffxiv is a bad example. That's a japanese game, their default is cutesy or edgelord anime god.
---
If it has a pre req quest, make sure every else has turned theirs in before starting.  If it's a pick up and go, wait until everyone is in close proximity and it gives them a pop up to start it as well.

Every alt is really just a feeder for warrior mains

Yea, they're probably just new, so dont take it personal.

They think you have to use a shield for tanking, for some reason

The healers are just playing whack-a-mole with their raid frames anyway, and never heal pets.
---
I am on Kromcrush. I came from Herod.
---
Herod had horrible queue times during peak hours and seems to have a bad balance with many more Horde.
---
Kromcrush can get a queue but it is no where close to the Herod queue times. There we days I couldn't play at all on Herod. The faction balance on Kromcrush is very good going by a lot of the resources for server population. Almost a 50/50 split.
---
I have only been on Kromcrush a short time, 14 orc warrior, bit it seems like a great server to be on.
---
I would say each class has their own niche, but shamans have huge burst damage. If you like burst damage and killing others in just a few seconds (provided you get lucky with crits of course) you may like rogues and mages. If you are into world pvp i strongly reccomend rogue! Stealth lets you avoid fights and get the jump on others, as well as letting you sneak into enemy major cities to gank!
---
they are not bad at all anymore on mograine
---
NO MORE CODDLING US BLIZZARD, WERE NOT ALL PVE SNOWFLAKES.
---
Yeah have fun getting let into dungeons and raids to get geared for PvP
---
wait what, how much did all that runecloth cost you?
---
Arms is the PvP spec. Fury is the PvE spec. 
---
Reason: 
---
Fury generates better rage dual wielding and does not require a lot of debuffs for good damage output (note debuff limit and arms at 3 debuffs; deep wounds, rend, mortal strike)
---
Arms is good at killing leather wearers and preventing healing, hence PvP viable build.
---
I hope you added those players in that group to your friends list because that's something you want to do to increase your odds of having a truly memorable experience here, one of the things that others who experienced something similar back in the day never forgot.
---
My original squad in Vanilla was myself a Forsaken Prot Warrior, Frost Mage, Resto Shaman, Shadow Priest and Survival Hunter and we did everything that this game had on offer even though we weren't optimal choices for any of those roles (except the Mage) by today's standard I mean who would want a tank that wasn't a Tauren right?  And why was the Shammy healing when we had a Priest?   But we made memories and pulled off every single thing this game could throw at us and it was a joy.
---
I was a pretty hardcore vanilla player and greatly enjoyed the game until wrath. After that I fell off more and more until finally quitting. When classic was announced my thoughts were that I was 100% going to play it but figured the nostalgia would get me a few hours before I moved on.
---
Nope! Turns out I was right... the game changed, not me. I’ve been absolutely loving classic as much as I did 15 years ago.
---
As a fellow prot warrior, this makes my heart happy.
---
Kromcrush is super chill, no streamers or try hard and we need a bit more alliance. It’s about 50/50
---
That would be a better solution. Or at least using the gear that bgs actually launched with.
---

Gauarentee I have better control of my emotions than you, and higher emotional intelligence. Gaurantee I am more of a stable person than you. I dont see a therapist.

Screech is nice, if you prefer you can get a Carrion Bird instead, they can also use Screech.

Was questing with a rogue as a priest and he had an agility scroll that he put on me by accident. I blessed him with one of my intellect scrolls as a show of gratitude.

This game offers an experience that other games don't. I am ecxcited to see so many prople who jave never played wow before coming to try this. I can't experience this game for the first time bit finding that you of playing it for the first time is still there.
---
So did I😂
---
That user name. Lol. Super cringe
---
Agreed, this is amazing!
---
I’d love to see N expanded into subcategories for those who had no reaction (ignorance), vs. those that paused momentarily in confusion, etc. (indifference). It doesn’t *exactly* fit with the experiment’s goals, but sometimes the dumbfounded looks you get from opposing factions during small-scale “infiltrations” are the best part.
---
No, what's stupid is rolling greed and trusting others not to be greedy.
---
Still hurts less that innervating a tank in a heated dungeon moment.
---
It is alright for solo leveling but cats are better end game.
---
“Thing I feel like mocking” or “thing I don’t like” seems to default to “weeb” anymore. The word has lost all meaning at this point, like Mary Sue.
---
This is exactly what the other guy said. The world isn't black and white, yet you manage to come up with a stupid black and white scenario.
---
If all drops were BOE the need rule wouldn't be a thing. 
---
Why even argue. It's just the logic thing to do. 100-150g to equip a low lvl epic? Not worth it for 98% of the players. Only the 2% richest or whatever actually buys and uses that stuff for their twinks. It's not for people aiming to ding 60.
---
Its not an addon, he is displaying his party frames as raid frames.  You can do this in the games interface options.
---
Looks like grid2 to me but nowadays there's probably more similar looking addons so not 100% sure.
---
You're honestly idiots if you greed Epic/blue BoEs.
---
Unless you're playing with a complete premade, you're just looking for ninjas if you don't all need.

Youll start to make more from quest rewards and vendoring greys, dont worry too much

This data isn't accurate. Stalagg has a huge Alliance pop and I can see that by how fucking activate your /world chat is at 5 am last night, vs. other Alliance "dominated" servers where their global chat channels are dead empty.
---
Ur doing it wrong then, ur suppoed to split up everyone goes into own dungeon see if hes up and whoever finds him invites the rest
---
There is a headgear u can get for druids that gives you either rage or energy and I think it’s 40 energy. Power shifting seems like it would be good if you have the mana for it.  I’m pretty new to classic so I dont know how end game looks for pretty much all the classic but I’m assuming a lot of people have tried it in private servers tho, that’s how we know bear tank is viable as well.
---
To all the people in Hillsbrad this morning...
---
I totally wanted to do it.  I did dun it.  I'm dang happy about it too.

That's the point.

I don't see the correlation, there is no V or C in the word deadmines. So why not call it DM?

Dire Maul isn't even out, so not like people can confuse the two.

You pick up the first quest, turn it in. Then wait. Once everyone has turned in the first quest and still can see the exclamation point visible above the questgiver's head, someone can start it. It will give everyone eligible (so everyone who accepted and turned in the first quest) the opportunity to pick up the escort quest. And make sure you have room in your quest log before that happens!
---
I don't know why blizzard decided that was the best way to do that little quest, but it's rare to have a run that someone doesn't accidentally start the quest before everyone is eligible.

Wednesday nights my wife is taking classes to get her MBA, so I'm home alone.  Last Weds, I drank 7 beers and mindlessly killed yetis in Feralas for like 4 hours while listening to music and youtube stuff.  I got a bunch of XP, a ton of Thick/Rugged leather, and I loved every second of it.  It was zen and relaxing and exactly how I wanted to spend my night, and it will always be there for me to do.
---
What did I change specifically?
---
&gt;Stop being all doom and gloom. It’s not anywhere near as big a problem as you think it is with the many thousands of people playing.
---
Stop being all the world is made of jellybeans and rainbows. A tiny minority with an absolutely massive excess of wealth can have huge ramfications for a market, the fact they are few in number doesn't change the scope of their influence one bit. The faster the abuse stops, the better, so you're actively making the problem worse by still not acknowledging it's actually an issue.
---
I'm not entirely sure, but I think something between 600-800g
---
Saving this!
---
Alliance do the same garbage. Wont attack anyone 1v1. QQ more
---
?
---
Stop getting hung up on the definition of the word. Everyone rolling need ensures nobody can ninja it. Hopefully you learned your lesson. Keep being stubborn and you'll probably lose the next one too and come here and cry
---
Some kind of RNG, exactly like the roll yes. Otherwise no one would get it. Or everyone with the same roll....
---
When you put it like that it doesn't sound *too* unreasonable.
---
Awesome post, you got them good!
---
Oh well that's a classic, didn't notice it listed.
---
Like the alliance is any better?
---
I did quest a little in eg Felwood or Winterspring. You can calculate how much cloth it takes easily: 20 cloth is 50 rep. Revered to exalted = 21k rep = 420 stacks runecloth (8400 cloth). Do the same for your missing rep from honored to revered and you have it!
---
No lifer lol
---
The tunnel is filled with level 50ish hostile mobs until you have done a couple quests in southern felwood. There is a flight path but it only connects to nearby high level areas.
---
But there are two flightmasters in town that will take you to your druid's respective racial capital for free!

Blademasters are more or less based on the samurai. A samurai had a large arsenal of weapons, their main weapon being the *bow*, but also well known to carry katana. But they also get training in many different variety of weapons, that being spears, clubs, and throwing stars. Ninjas being the ones throwing shuriken is a romanticised myth. Blademasters do appear in World of Warcraft, and they are based on samurai. It did not stop in Warcraft, it continued in World of Warcraft. The whole Burning Blade Clan is known for their Blademasters. Saying that future Blademasters suddenly stops being samurai because they use another weapon makes no sense, since samurai used many, *many* different weapons.
---
And no, honour before anything else is not only applied to the Japanese, but it is certainly one of the main codes for the samurai in their bushido code, and is still a large part of their society today, even during normal work conditions.
---
I did not state that Orcs are only based on the Japanese and the Japanese culture, past or present. But orcs have *way more* Japanese influence into their culture than blood elves ever have had.
---
This post and all the comments have me dying rn. Thanks for making my night.
---
Ironic. You get so upset about "misappropriating" a term for mental illness then claim I have Down Syndrome as an insult. Have fun, my man.
---
Barrens improved, you kidding right? :D
---
Yea it had more stuff, but visually? Nooo..
---
Yes they are, it's totally not you, the person lashing out on Reddit. Such a winner you are. Truly I am shamed and beaten. I shall cut off my penis, as you have caused it to shrivel and die.
---
First off screw you and your snowflake mentality. If you dont want to die to an infernal, dont play the game. Its people like you that watered the game down to where it is in retail. Give them an inch.
---
Shadowweave is good into the upper 50s. Definitely not replaced in a couple of levels.
---
Dancing around with hamstring. Im not very good at it so it doesnt change much for me. Level 57, pulling 1 by 1 i can probably kill 1-3 before having to eat though
---
The data for Lakeshire is wrong, no idea where they got it.

---
This is greatest lol he's ready...
---
I will always upvote a clip of these Vurtne wannabes dying horribly.
---
i KOS every ally on Thalnos =)
---
&gt; Lol, why you're trying to make it about me not understanding english?
---
Because clearly you don't understand English if you're coming at me with that. Pretty much everything doesn't mean EVERYTHING it means what it implies. And it's true. You can do pretty much everything on your own in retail.
---
&gt;Because if you're telling the obvious that WQs are soloable, then its true that you can do everything pretty much on vanilla by yourself too.
---
Not really.
---
There are dozens of quests you need a group for in Vanilla. Without one you will have a very very difficult time or be unable to do it unless you out-level it completely. The elite quests in Redridge come to mind instantly and the ones in Wetlands. But there are many.
---
On Retail I practically never need to group when leveling. And that is a problem.
---
Blaumeux is what I roll. I'm east coast also and get a nice 60ms aswell
---
Probably just a wonky spawnrate on private servers that was way off. Can't imagine anyone had reliable data on how often he was meant to be up.
---
Hard to argue with someone whose username is such an accurate description of their personhood.
---
What level are you and what exactly are you killing?
---
You might reconsider on your leveling zones towards places with more skinnable mobs.  e.g. I've been hanging out at the Shimmering Flats, which has gotten me tons of heavy leather, putting my LW skills a few levels ahead of my character level (205LW at 32).
---
and 10 lvls lower
---
It wasn't. Just pull up any vanilla video and look at the plates.
---
It's even lower than 20y now, since I can fireblast something before the nameplate comes up.
---
Blizz just does whatever it wants.
---
hello friend, dm me if you want to chat feral talents :)
---
My first guess would be the data is misleading. Maybe that is showing all players that were in the party and their location upon killing hogger? How does it track the kill location?
---
Yeah but there are some things that will stay the same, like the price for an epic mount.
---
Whoa i literally took the exactly same screenshot about 45 minutes ago. Were you on the same boat as me?? :)

My Paladin has gotten so many axe drops that would be upgrades, but I only use hammers.
---
I can’t for the life of me figure out how to take a SS if the nVidia overlay so, sorry about the phone photo! haha. but [heres what i use](https://i.imgur.com/62TrUNG.jpg)
---
Don't pay, the SM axe isn't that hard to get, just takes one slightly grindy quest in Desolace.
---
If you can find someone to help you grind the elementals than by all means though, you'll be able to get WW weapon earlier than Boneviter usually and then that opens you up to the awesome 1H sword that quest can also reward.
---
Don't be paying anything more than a few handfuls of silver for a weapon while you're levelling in general, despite how important your weapon is to a warrior
---
Yeah the game isn't as hard as what people have given credit for. Ragnoras dying to a group below its limit with all members not even having full dungeon gear or even being level 60.
---
I'm glad min maxing isn't a thing and I hope it remains that way, I feel like any class can be any spec and the raid will still function.
---
Oh who am I kidding. Protection paladins still need a god damn taunt. That aside the game is genuinely fun and will remain so until an item level add-on is introduced...
---
Yes it is somehow different. Stop being a retard about it. A 200g epic vs 2g green is very different.
---
Could try to get a bat from shadowfang keep, they can learn screech and are going to be at your level
---
Whitemane's hat + robe of power + shoulders from Fairbanks (zombie inquisitor in SM Cath) look much better.
---
OK.
---
this site says otherwise http://classicrealminfo.com/Chart/Stalagg identical method of collecting data
---
What's your tanking ability rotation?
---
Key word is *yet*. As soon as the launch period settles down and people start preparing their twinks for WSG launch, that price is going to skyrocket. It's worth like 10g right now but it's easily worth 50g on an established server. That's WELL worth holding on to to sell later.
---
Depending on what class you are you almost definitely don't need to learn all your skills.
---
I've seen a few 99's get beaten by 100 and even had the pleasure of doing that myself
---
this happens to me so often
---
Shut it weeb.
---
[Cleave]
---
Blizzard adressed this claim of there being people with inventories full of rare mats walking around due to layering and plainly stated that to be untrue.
---
It's only 500 runecloth for full rep? Is this the same for all groups? Because I have easily had that much cloth from all the UBRS runs I have done and want to get a raptor as an undead lmao.
---
Holy mad.
---
I know it's PvP but this is kinda shitty
---
It could be automated, but eventually if they spam it theyll start to get reported. Send out 100 messages to different tanks may get them on the shit list. Remembering a name isnt always a good thing haha.
---
Not ironic at all. How can you have such a lack of thinking inwardly. I was purposely insulting you. Throwing your insult back at you. I really dont care if people want to use schizophrenia as an insult, or any other terms. I wasnt getting mad at purely missing the term. I was getting upset with the incredibly stupid arguments being put forth. The first comment I made was criticizing the justification of the dictionary.com definition for using the word. That's dumb. I even said things like it "may be" coming off as stigmatizing. That was a small extra point. Everything else I said was different points than getting upset over "misappropriating". Its the justifications put forth as to why it wasnt used incorrectly. It was the greek roots thing. Again I really dont care if you use it as an insult. But when you say it's ok for such stupid logic, that's what I was debating.
---
Nice reading comprehension, but at this point I'm not expecting anything intelligent to come from you. Peace out man
---
You’re probably seeing the Scarlet Monastery mail gear. It’s a wonderful set.
---
Carrion Birds just have higher armour, which combos nicely with Screech reducing enemy AP, allowing them to be tankier than expected. Other than that Owls deal more damage.
---
So you're saying a 150g item is not worth its value, even though it'll probably be used by a fury Warrior for 6 months?
---
This is the problem with alot of the retail crowd. They see a strategy on a stream/YouTube, don't understand it, implement it poorly and then blame it on the outsider.
---
is grinding mobs to lvl faster in a group or roughly the same?
---
Scarlet Monestary. Herods shoulders. I forget the name of the helm.
---
This could cause different issues though. Such as  someone new wants to play with his friends and can’t because of that restriction.
---
You are probably talking about the Raging Berserker's Helm and Herod's Shoulder, both of which drop off of Herod in Scarlet Monastery: Armory.
---
Blizzard intentionally changed it to prevent same-faction griefing.
---
There's nothing fun or interesting about Warlocks being able to grief their own faction with no way of stopping them.
---
ET phone gnome
---
Yeah but 2v1 totally flips the tables. Wasn't that a shaman? All he has to do is spam purge and grounding and heal. Priest has no burst strong enough to win that
---
Warthog? They're generally awful in bgs, dungeons and raids. They had to remove Strand of the Ancients, and Isle of Conquest/Wintergrasp  are pretty universally hated.
---
I pay $15 a month I should care. I'm trying to change it before I simply unsub
---
The helmet and shoulders from Herod in the SM Armory are probably what you are seeing.
---
With over 100+ on rank 3 blizzard i see an increase of maybe 2-3 damage per tic
---
Same, wanted Herod but went down the list to the first server without a queue. Kromcrush is a very balanced server with minimal queus at peak play times.
---
What happened mate? It might be fixable....
---
I am pretty good with computers im happy to help
---
Some spells scale with spell damage more than others. Usually aoe spells dont scale well so you need a lot of + spell damage to see a noticeable difference. You can look up a full list of spell scale ratios online.
---
I am a Fury Warrior and since I end up usually having to tank dungeons, I use every single spell/ability that I have gotten.
---
Yeah, one person "having fun" is more important than the hundreds of people who just want to use the mailbox without dying.
---
Obviously.
---
SM if you can get there is the best place to farm
---
Rattlegore has been decent, sometimes we hit queue but at its worst it has only been a few minutes.
---
So confusing. Wtf God. Why you play these games with me.
---
Yeah, well I've seen your character and you look stupid as fuck.  What were you thinking?
---
Same happening for retail it seems :(
---
That eould mean the mobs goes back on you when the bubble ends. This is not what happens.
---
you sound like an entitled tank.
---
Never had the luck to find a 'squad' like that, only small magical moments with pugs scattered throughout my game history, which reminds me.. we were zoning back into Blood Furnace after a wipe. I had Aspect of the Pack on to speed things up, while the 2nd hunter was regenerating his mana with Aspect of the Viper. Once he was full he switched to pack so I could regen instead. No words spoken. Isn't it great when you have that symbiosis with other players of your class?, esp. when you just met them.
---
Unfortunately our schedules never align though, so no lasting 'friendships' ever emerged from these encounters, but they will always be remembered!
---
Bro you can’t talk about end game raids and then bring up deadmines and stockades as comparisons.  Just admit you are new and don’t know what you’re saying and try and learn.
---
Not a bug.   You cant skin birds in classic anyways.   Sometimes mobs dont drop anything.
---
They are safe in barrens why scare ?
---
Only starts in phase 2 or 3.
---
Hordies will downvote this because it's true. I've actually never seen Horde start shit unless they have an unfair advantage. Whereas me and my alliance bros regularly fight off multiple hordies at a time, often taking down more than our number before falling.
---
Shit today I saw the horde need 10 level 40-50s just to be able to kill level 20s in duskwood
---
Will hunters roll on this gear?
---
Man I feel so owned
---
No, 500 turn-ins, which means 10000 cloth. (You turn in 20 cloth for 50 rep). If your starting rep is higher you need less, if its lower you need more.
---
There are a bunch of really good mail pieces from Scarlet Monastery: Armory and Cathedral. They’re basically the best you can get for like 10 levels (or more), so you get a lot of warriors farming for those like crazy in their late 30s
---
Omg his pet is a prarie chicken
---
there is a lot of gear in there that i want lol. not a bad idea while hunting some gear.
---
Bind your VW taunt to a key and use it manually everytime your vw loses agrro. Leaving it on auto is just not worth it.
---
That sounds horrible. Good to know... I got that dagger and orb from sm and just got acid walkers from gnomer was super excited to put all of it use and was like why isn’t my dmg better.
---
I did learn, but no need to be a dick about it.
---
What are you using the key ind for? My visibility is pretty important
---
I believe you're not alone in that, because lots of ppl say "pst me" which only makes a little sense your way.
---
But yeah, please sent tell.
---
There are more overall alliance players in the game than horde, the statistics were just released.
---
So, this is awkward.
---
Thanks. That’s what I feared
---
WoW is the quintessential snowflake mmo. Sorry it’s just really hard to hear wow players call other WoW players snowflakes after cutting my mmo teeth on perma-death muds and eve Online.
---
The racials lend themselves to that. WoTF and Orc stun resist are insane PVP racials.
---
Check out his other videos on wow classic too. They are really awesome.
---
Met a good friend who I kinda fell out of touch with trough the general Westfall chat last year in a private server. I still have him in Discord but the fact that we stopped playing there, the jobs and the different timezones made us lose our touch. However I'm sure he's playing classic now like I am and I might get in touch again.
---
My skills went from costing a couple of silver to one whole gold. Like charge generated 9 points of rage and for one whole gold itll now generate 3 more points of rage...bah
---
But how is that relevant to World of Warcraft?
---
TB is my fav honestly just for the compactness in general.
---
This is on Deviate Delight. My realm. What a disgrace.
---
Dammit you made me spit out my drink.
---
You’re not wrong. It’s just the population imbalance means alliance is much more likely to be on the receiving end of it.
---
Oof with yeh
---
I tried explaining this last week and got down voted to hell. Evidently everyone needing on boes was not popular last week on reddit but this week it's agreeable.
---
And until you prove it’s your firewall just disable it. If you prove it’s the FW then open what ever port you need to. I haven’t run a firewall (it got turned via a new install to ssd) for 20years and have had no Secruity issues
---
These questions are starting to wear on people.
---
Yes, play a lock if you want to. They do a lot of damage and are very good in pvp.
---
It's an exciting goal to grind for, even if stopping to grind it may not be as efficient technically speaking.
---
Lmao love the dude with the shades
---
I was spamming my /say macro when I was taking the screenshot lol.
---
Less dps than using a 2Her.
---
Troll is baller af.  Best animations too!  And not left handed.
---
Any class is worth running as an alt if you feel like playing it.  
---
I like that you described your mage as a wand / pyro mage tho.
---
Hopefully none
---
Are there any Central time servers?
---
I've used innervate on the tank as a druid healer...
---
I soul stoned an enemy....then we wiped....
---
You play a Gnome, don't you..
---
Cries in repair bills.
---
Hunters roll on all gear.
---
I’m not ashamed to admit I laughed hard when he sent this
---
as an alliance player trying to level, good luck. im the fuck off this server. cant get a single quest done within an hour because the horde are fucking everywhere. switching to a pve server because i will never play horde and i cant stand not being able to do anything.
---
What addin
---
I’ve invested most of my time into running my character around wand damage and pyroblast, also focusing my rotation around them.
---
Wow guess cause it only happens to you it has to be true. I literally quested in stv and every alliance walked right past me unless there was a group. It’s everybody not just the horde lmao
---
Yep, it did. Didn't realize how much damage dungeon finder (among other things) has created until Classic: elitism, entitlement, impatience, detachment.
---
Shadowed Unit Frames
---
Is there any easy way to look at the data of 30+?  It shows everything for 5+ which is pretty worthless imo.
---
Big yep. Idk how to turn sticky targeting off, definitely dumped a few heals and buffs into npcs instead of myself causing a few deaths lol
---
Actually now that I think about it, the surviving Humans betrayed King Terenas when they turned on the undead. The forsaken are pretty much just humans from Lorderon right?
---
Dude wtf.  Why isnt this real?
---
That's the default.
---
But God dam what a waste of some very accessible binds.
---
You only have to kill one mob in there and chances are he's right by the front door.
---
wololoooooo
---
No such thing
---
All greed, if no one needs, roll and highest win.  
---
All greed except 1, he gets.  
---
All greed except 2, they roll and highest win.  
---
Simple as that.
---
And ofc on Group Loot Mode
---
It's the people controlling the USA that cause it. USA isn't calling the shots.
---
I don't believe they are but I'm not sure what phase that will be.
---
I feel like some of the Warlock interactions are a bit wonky in general.  Like I don't recall Eye of Kilrogg carrying aggro to the caster if it pulls aggro and gets killed, yet in Classic that's exactly what it does to where you can't really scout ahead with it.  If your demon is set to defensive it will also go and avenge the Eye.
---

Fucking hate layering. Stupid mechanic. Nicely played...but i wish that mechanic was gone...
---
Thanks. Pulled up the wrong website. D'oh.
---
Haha, I love this. I just got cleaned out from lvl 16 training
---
i can safely say that i came to this post waiting for this reply.
---
WoD had like 5,5 mil subs mid-expansion when they stopped reporting. Sure, the subs went a bit further down after that 6 mil but there’s no way in hell that BfA has less subs than WoD lmao.
---
I’d say they once in a blue moon kin be posted, otherwise they’re just spam.
---
Thanks a lot to everyone answering :) Guess im going to run SM when i reach \~lvl 40 :)
---
Sitting in stealth waving, the single target life is pretty sad while mages can aoe everything. Rogues have no aoe really :(.
---
I'm a level 35 warlock. Where is a good location to mindlessly grind dudes that drops some decent vendor trash  (don't have any gathering). I've lately been finding myself running around too much for quests and just want to zone out for a bit and kill green or yellow dudes that are easy for my class to slaughter. I just need to detress from a long day. Thanks!
---
i really dont understand how people are supporting this change. like okay you died once go res and run the fuck away lol its not like theres a bunch of shit you can be doing besides sitting in the middle of xroads...

Wait how did you get to 44 if you have never played before?
---
Confirmed purchased account.
---
Oh man wow you must be the best video gameser of all time
---
If you hold something to sell in 2 months when it's 3x as expensive, but everything else is 3x as expensive, you've made no actual money.
---
I see tanks doing it all the time mostly with SM for like a gold a run
---
Lies
---
I'd have killed you. How DARE you come to "pay respects" to my king after turning your backs on his people. After all Lordaeron has done for Stormwind. But when it's your turn to help us you kill our ambassadors. No. Stay away from Lordaeron, coward. Stormwind will pay with blood.
---
Is their a better rage potion than Great rage potion in classic?
---
I am not proud. I did the same.
---
Upvoted for visibility...great discovery.  This one definitely needs to be reverted.  Thanks !
---
Putting a bug ticket up now.  This mechanic was honestly the eye opening moment in my early life in WoW that made me realize how much of a “world” it really was.  Heartbreaking to hear that they changed it for some reason.
---
Something something don't cross streams...
---
My dog was basically as big as a lion so I see no issue with this
---
Just brush it off, it’s just a game and some people forget that. As long as you are having fun and being nice it should not matter.
---
No, definitely not.
---
I remember the first time I rolled up into Ironforge in 2006 and it stuttered so bad I couldn't play. Bought some more RAM and was able to at least play but it wasn't great.
---
Now I play at 1440p/144fps.
---
i would wait a bit tbh. 225 skinning will be enough to skin mobs around lvl 40.
---
Kudos to their social media guy for not only responding in good fun, but also knowing enough about the game to respond properly to the reference about Judgement.
---
Oh no, its almost like people have different deffinitions of fun. 
---
The risk of it happening to me IS fun. Thats why i play a pvp server. If you dont like it, pve servers have an opt in for pvp. Get off pvp servers if you dont want pvp. Those of us who want the immersion of danger everywhere can play our pvp servers. :)
---
But this only happens on certain mobs, and the loot panel shows up but then the option to loot the mob goes away after this panel closes. and it locks other people from your party out from getting loot, AFTER you do this. So people can loot a mob, but once you touch the mob and bug it out, everyone else gets bugged out. it's obviously a bug
---
In pve things fight back as well.
---
Also, armor doesn't do shit against a caster
---
You share our tenacity. If you play horde let me know and we can do our spitting together
---
Polearm is absurdly fast. You want slow weapons for higher ability damage.
---
I’m on bigglesworth alliance ratio seems slightly horde favoured but lots of good people. AH economy just took a dive by being flooded with under cutters though. Q times around prime time are between 10-30 minutes lately but they were worse
---
party leader can set looting system
---
by right clicking their portrait. It is set to group loot by default, and uncommon, meaning everything that is green or above will be rolled on
---
Thank you for this friend!
---
‘Wait, what is this!’ DOMESHOT
---
Mmm
---
It can be annoying short term, but the idiots/guilds making false accusations quickly create a much bigger reputation of being morons compared with anyone falsely accused.
---
Mostly because **we**'ve improved since, but that's a good thing! More diversity/variety, more fun!
---
Think I'm gonna roll a tankadin just to prove a point :P
---
Ey'there
---
Damage is normalized to 3.8 in 1.12
---
Racist
---
Extra really really. I learned this the hard way. Tool tip is just flat out misleading and wrong. I sold my like 35dps fire wand for a 10dps shadow wand. I was like fuck yeah!!!! And then my shadow wand did 10dps despite nearly +80 shadow dmg from gear. . .
---
If you're alliance you should whisper this guy. I want to know if he broke his keyboard afterwards.
---
A quake reference and a pants pooping, this is good.
---
Dude doesn't even have mighty troll blood.
---
Barrens was fine today for me on Sulfuras. Yesterday was a nightmare though. Thank god I was too low and just passed through a few times.
---
ty
---
That’s what I’ve been doing. I use them immediately.
---
no reason to wait unless you won't have enough gold for your next skills.  gold ramps up and the only breakpoint is having 90g at 40. unless you're going to wait until after you buy your mount or you won't have enough gold for your next skils waiting is pointless
---
another trailer post from only a few years back. is blizz trying to hype us into retail or some shit? ARE YOU A BLIZZ EMPLOYEE SIR DONT LIE TO ME.
---
Yes and I played till 2am and it was still bright...
---
Lmao this is so true... corpsemaker, ravager, rockpounder, princess mace. Always the damn shaman
---
The aggro on you after while running away after getting aggro on your pet happened all the time in vanilla; this is not a bug.
---
The aggro on you randomly when chasing someone else is a bug.
---
I've had mobs aggro me that should be leashing which is also a bug.
---
at first i was like :\\ 
---
but then i was like xD
---
Being technically correct is the best kind
---
Those are the best
---
Imagine being a Clover subhuman degen. Get bent.
---
He's online as we speak but he's in ZF. Also it kinda feels like harassment. I'm a 58 human rogue. I might wave at you before I show you how a true hero of the alliance slays undead scum. ;)
---
Maybe that is the reason you are still level 10,hihi.
---
Well, I do personally. I'm mostly the group lead and I announce in the beginning that all BoE blues and epics will be rolled need on, because that's the fairest way and more importantly the way that nobody can ninja and kill a 2 1/2 hour Sunken Temple run 2 hours in.
---
With all my auto-atacks I dont need a gym to be fit!

**Rides away with ma free mount**
---
Questing is fun.
---
Yeah I'm a 42 shadow priest. I've got a ton of + shadow damage gear and it says my ranged damage has gone up... Interesting.
---
Wasn't sure about that, but I am certain the "+10% shadow damage" talent increases wand damage, extremely certain. Gear I will agree with though.
---
No.
---
Most your warrior abilities says: Deal Weapon Damage.
---
Weapon damage is the **102 - 154 Damage** on WW axe, vs the **88 - 133 Damage** on the Polearm.
---
Playing dps will always be more efficient.
---
Holy spec
---
You should strive to make stance swapping not feel like a hassle. It's a key component of the class and you're going to miss out on a lot of utilities by trying to sit in one stance all the time.
---
Women play too??
---
You can heal fine in dungeon content in a full DPS spec. It's advised by basically all guides to level in some form of damage spec (priests are suggested to go wand build, you'd have to google it cause I'm not sure on the specifics)
---
try rt click on volume mixer in the task bar -&gt; open sound settings -&gt; related settings (sound control panel) -&gt;  rt click on speakers -&gt; configure speakers
---
and that's where i get to pick stereo/quad/5.1/7.1
---
obviously
---
This has nothing to do with retail. Im just a dude who loves the game and think these videos are crazy good.
---
Some people are jags. That's about the extent of it. Most of us don't give a crap about ninja looting claims unless the're from reliable friends. People like the ones you just described you wouldn't want to group with them anyway, be happy they won't group with you.
---
We're all dying at different speeds. Time is the apex predator of anything and everything, you are merely a breeze in eternity until the heat death of the universe.
---
No I'm trash at pvp which really just illustrates the point. Me and another paladin today went 2v5 against horde and killed 3 of them before dying
---
Haven't bought anything and only trained select spells. Still sitting at 3g at lvl 30. I have tons of herbs and enchanting mats in my bank though.. when's a good time to sell those?
---
Yessir and make sure you dl the most recent driver
---
What is going on with your guild?
---
I dont believe you,if ur 44 with a mount,you must've been playing 10 hours a day atleast and for a new player whos not familiar with everything,its really hard to believe you got that far.
---
You couldn't be more wrong if you tried. If I had a weird talent, it would be camping people in video games. I used to do it in runescape for ridiculous amounts of time, like 18 hours. I've dueled someone for over 24 hours straight once, until he conceded that he couldn't outlast me.
---
It could easily be understood through context, or they know Paladin from D&amp;D or any other game too
---
You reminded me of my winterspring grind. I remember it took me a month and countless hours a day to get that beautiful mount. Cant wait to do it again.
---
Odd. I tried around 10ish, 2 and 4 and so damn laggy.
---
For any other profession I won’t probably say no, but skinning is something you’ll potentially be using all the time provided you’re killing the right type of mob.  Personally I would buy it, would suck to be capped and missing out on skillups.
---
Its stupid reddit based humor, the lowest common denominator where you just repeat the same tired phrases ad nauseam
---
U hav 2 slots left

Jumping out of water is not clipping any pixels. It's also working as intended. Jumping up a straight wooden pole to get on top of a very small section of area that guards are unable to interact with you is not as intended, and iirc, would warrant a GM's interaction. Back in the day, this was probably a gm showing up and talking to you. Now it's all automated, so maybe they don't have a policy for it.
---
I play on nethergate and it seems correct. Everywhere there are a lot of ally players...
---
I think you could use this [my] in your sentence friend. I was just going to vendor it so I’d be happy to give it to you. :)
---
This is with sharding, just wait till it gets turned off.
---
First, don’t quit the class before level 10. You get a pet and the entire gameplay experience gets so much different and more fun. 
---
Beast Mastery is great for leveling, and a big red kitty (your pet during Bestial Wrath) makes for a fun time. 
---
The Petopia website has a classic version that includes guides on how (and why) to tame and train certain pets, even including where to find ones that appeal to you visually. 
---
Lastly, have fun and meet people by doing dungeons and group quests. Dungeons start around lvl 18-20 (Deadmines for Alliance) or a little earlier on Horde side. Just, for the love of all that is holy, never forget to check and double check that your pets taunt (growl) is turned of as soon as you enter the instance.
---
&gt; now switching between stances for different moves is a hassle 
---
Should probably just reroll ret pally tbh.
---
So I did something similar. I was attacking a mob and about to die. I ran some distance and use a bandage on the mob thinking I was healing myself. I died. And proceeded to do this about 3 more time before I realized that I was healing the mob. Can you tell I never played classic lol
---
More specifically slow MH fast offhand is ideal.  Your abilities hit harder with slow MH and your poisons apply more often with a fast OH.
---
i have a character named "dogcrap"
---
I think you SHIFT click to compare. It’s built into the game.
---
Alliance has the exact same ganking habits
---
My friends and even my own wife are about that level up. Completely sucked the joy from playing.
---
This Set holds up until your mid 50s sooooo
---
On baseline stats 2x 1H weapons do more than 1x 2H weapon before the 50%. But 1H Specialization maxed (normally 10% bonus) when Dual Wielding would be 10% + 10%/2 for a 15% bonus. It makes sense to dual wield since you gain more out of it than losing all bonuses with a two-hander. The extra weapon is also great for generating rage more consistently, instead of in large chunks at once.
---
The miss chance makes things more like gambling, however. But so is Windfury...
---
This truthbomb, man. I can't handle it. My life is empty.
---
Thanks! Glad you like it. Yeah, you can get a lot of good shots while on flight
---
Imagine needing a raid group to kill one person lmao
---
Thanks for clarifying!
---
&gt;even during normal work conditions
---
Or even miserable conditions
---
WTf does political association have to do with this?
---
As a new player that's exactly how I felt too.
---
Then why not do the same with greens?
---
Probably the same. You get less xp in a group but have less deaths and less trouble with tough quests so less downtime. A duo is probably a sweet spot if you have somebody always there.
---
I got ganked today by a Paladin named Nickelback.  It hurt and humiliated on so many levels,
---
I'd rather fund my bis devilsaur than his bis weapon. Simple. I'm not here to give gold away. I have items I need to buy and I can't get them from rando world drops. I don't feel pity for him. I dont play this game to be a charity to the poor poor warrior or whoever. If he really wants it, he can buy it, just like me.
---
Lmao 😂🤣
---
To many griefers yes
---
even after phase 2 they give no honor or kill count so just a waste of time really
---
Everyone knows blood elves are just magic crackheads
---
Yeah he must be on a pve server. Always gotta have your guard up on Herod
---
Because the douche-tank doesn’t wait for anyone to eat/drink/loot corpses before he pulls the whole room
---
More confirmation bias.
---
This is quality memeing.
---
Are you an Enchanter?
---
12 is greater than 8.
---
Counterspell
---
Yeah, I remember getting ganked and running to my bf crying because it was so important to me now I’m like oh I have half an hour before bed after doing the dishes and clearing the table, will play a little but not too long because I have to get up and do stuff in the morning.
---
Where is this?
---
swamp jaguars are amazing
---
https://classicdb.ch/?npc=767
---
you can also farm whelps for a chance of a rare pet and flame sacs

Hi, /u/K_iIIuminati

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d4e8tw/whats_next_as_a_lvl_52_warrior/). 
---
Other classes can also sell the 1-10g BoE items which drop, but for some reason those can be given to people who needs, even though most of them won't last more than a few days. Meanwhile you got a 150g axe which lasts for probably 6 months for Warriors, which suddenly isn't worth it.
---
Someone tried to tell me about getting reported for camping/killing. Lul. Why the fuck y’all on pvp servers if you don’t understand what it means
---
There’s probably an add on for it, but if you check your spell window it will show you this window if you Hoover over the icons.
---
Half way between 39 and 40, need about 20 gold for my mount. Are there any good farming spots for my level for both xp and money? Am a druid with herbalism and skinning
---
I'm not arguing with you. This was a sudden fight, not a practiced Symphony Orchestra.
---
I needed rage for Shield Blocks #1, Stuns #2.
---
Oh hey, despite my week-late start, I'm close to the front of the pack.
---
Just wait until Zul'Gurub.
---
True pain awaits us.
---
More like unexpected mass respawns. Several times I’ve been fighting one thing and had 2-4 more appear out of nowhere.
---
&gt;It's just the logic thing to do
---
It's the "logic" (sic) thing to do from an extremely greedy perspective. To you it's 100-150g, to the guy who could have used it, it's an amazing upgrade that'll boost his DPS significantly for the foreseeable future, make his questing easier, and overall make him feel happy, as that's the whole concept of the gear progression system.
---
Contrary to popular belief it's not illegal to equip BoE epics if you aren't a twink, they're actually significantly better than dungeon weapons of the same level range and can last you 15-20 levels.
---
The fact that you view your greed as common sense is hugely telling.
---
Are you making sure to run auctionator checks so the prices are up to date?
---
There should be a disenchant ability somewhere in your spellbook.
---
Have you gone to a pet trainer? Also, you should have pet spells I  your spellbook no?
---
You're literally in a thread about a guy posting evidence that he was able to abuse layering to farm off the hook. Yes, the screenshot linked in that thread was appearently fake, good to know, but is OP also faking? The guys I see in my guild and in zone chats asking for layerhopping, are they also fake?
---
How are you not able to admit this is a problem and the CD solution is clearly insuffecient?
---
The zug zug went to his brain
---
You're just being pendantic dude, you're even contradicting yourself you NEED to group up but you can solo it, you just have a hard time or you have to out level it.
---
Many people never needed to group to level, just because you do it to make it faster doesnt mean you need it.
---
And if you're talking about the leveling experience it just show how you dont understand about the game. You dont play retail for leveling just as you dont play classic for challenging raids or having an engaging rotation, they are different games.
---
Dono why but this is cool. Thanks for sharing!
---
i’m horde....... but i’m also a rogue LOL, good one bro
---
Benediction bro!
---
So in the past I was always an enchanter and gathering profession. This time on my 35 warlock im doing tailoring for the first time ever. I finally got the pattern for this and though "WOW no one is selling these on AH!!!" I'm a genius and bought the pricey materials with most of my savings to date and made 7. Yea I'm broke again but at least I have a free mount!
---
It's somewhere south of Zul'Farrak. Was just kind of walking while whispering a guy and then I got dismounted and dazed. Just ran for my life. Don't really know what happened next. But I looked up to see this tower and it looked pretty scenic.
---
It was a shitty post, about a shitty user, with a shitty political jab. We are now making this a thing when it was nothing. Are we done now?
---
Im right with ya bro dont worry its just phase 1!
---
I was tailoring/enchanting in vanilla and while I did enjoy it I had a tough time with money. Skinning/Herbalism now.
---
QQ more? That's some boomer speak there
---
Intercept can’t be used on allies in classic.
---
2 words
---
FUCKING SAVAGE
---
Solo the trash in SM GY.
---
More like 4.4 million, but keep in mind these are just characters not player count.
---
the staff in library is alot better than corpsemaker
---
Are you saying that a party member can open the loot window, see items, close it without looting, then you go to loot and it shows nothing?
---
Or that there is nothing there on first loot? Because not everything is gonna have loot and I've come across several mobs that have a smaller loot table where I only get something every couple kills.
---
Also loot... since I didnt say it enough.
---
You’d be surprised what “normal people” don’t understand about our hobbies.
---
ive avoided them my entire life in preparation for classics eventual return.
---
General tab I spell book. It is the slingshot icon
---
Only 6% playing Holy? LUL
---
Ctrl+V by default.
---
Yeh don put ush in with shose bashtards hic.
---
On Kirtonos? Dude, it's literally unplayable. People are resorting to grinding SM for level 30-40 to avoid it because you will get no where.
---
I'm in the same boat.  About to start looking for some BRD runs.
---
Dungeons are a good bet. They're good xp and you'll be able to find groups quickly. As a healer you can do dungeons over your level. You can start dungeons 2 levels before a dps would start them usually.
---
Lol!
---
You used master loot and invited a ninja looter into your party.  Said ninja looter got pissed they couldn't ninja loot and lied that you ninja looted them.
---
You dodged a bullet imo.
---
Nah credit where credits due, rogues will engage in same level 1v1s without you being damaged. That is because they have such a strong burst kit and can often finish fights before they start, but still.
---
Bait
---
People are just way more meta slaves or "spike" type players these days. Spike as in [Spike Johnny Timmy](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Timmy%2C%20Johnny%2C%20Spike).
---
Paladin must've been one of the most popular classes on alliance way back, at least on my server, but now I see so few paladins compared to what I remember. 
---
Anyway I agree with you and I think it's a little unfortunate that players over the years have gotten way more narrow minded in how to play games. Everything's focused on raw competition. I think that's a bit of a shame. I think that's the only thing we won't ever experience again in most future games. We won't experience a period again where people just goof around as back in vanilla. People or gamers nowadays are way to aware of what's good and what's not, even more in Classic because it has been analyzed to death over the years. But even with new games the period where people just try things out to see what sticks are very short. Metas establish super quick and then everyone follows it religiously. Sure, despite this new metas will evolve in most games because some talented individuals will try different things out. but the general playerbase will just copy what others do most of the time.
---
consider them more like drive by quests that you finish in another 5-10 levels and hand them all in one go.
---
I didn’t equip it right away since i wanted to use my current spirit hat because i was struggling to keep up with mana. They then assumed i was a scammer/ninja because they were under the impression that i was going to sell it. Told me to either equip it right now, or /roll for it and trade it away.
---
You wrote like 5 comments in this thread you're so triggered lmao
---
Just need to press V to turn on enemy platenames.
---
Yep... seems about right for fairbanks. Maybe even a little more skewed than that
---
I'm confused now. He said Ravager which is the axe from SM Armory isn't it? Is that why he said 1.5 gold?
---
Khaz'modaaaaaaaaan!
---
(For the Horde!)
---
Well use your brain and decide for yourself if the time commitment to leveling and maintaining an alt is worth it to you. Reddit isn’t going to answer that question for you.
---
OOOKAY!!!
---
Grind to 53.
---
As a side note. Take a few days off, live your life, then return to some rested exp. gg
---
&gt; What did I change specifically?
---
First the fact the costs were so low meant you were right, then the costs didn't matter because people were hoarding them instead of selling them and so you're right? Make up your mind.
---
That aside.... what do you think would happen without layering? Those same people would have **all** the resources because they'd be camping them to oblivion. Have you ever played an MMO before? This exact shit happens every time in one way, shape or form. The people who rush to end game get a big advantage with ever bug/exploit and the abundance of resources available to them. It's always fine.
---
They likely don't have jobs or took multiple weeks leave from work
---
Go to Un’goro Crater. That place is Jurassic Park on steroids!
---
Several minor things from classic has been retconned and if you want the actual lore just play retail, or read chronicles.
---
Is shockadin not a thing in classic?
---
XD kek
---
Go 5/5 Wand Spec then 5/5 Spirit Tap
---
If you wanna go DPS, you respec to shadow at 40
---
That makes playing there a real treat. Nice choice, I know it's always a gamble but congrats on a superb choice. How is stv?
---
Yes but that’s not the argument.  Things like BoKings and any other stat increase buffs or talents DO increase your attack power because they increase your stats which therefore increases your attack power.
---
You seem to be missing the point - if you have 1 str on an item then it’s worth 2 attack power but is affected by kings etc so with kings gives 2.2 attack power.  It is therefore correct to say that when comparing items with attack power on them to the equivalent stat (eg, a 24 attack power item being the same as +12 str item), the stat item is better than the attack power item because it is affected by stat buffs.
---
Yeah... I hated it when they brought it in. *Instantly* the attitude changed. Everyone rolled need on everything and fuck you if you didn't like it, you'd never see them again.
---
Fucking phenomenal!
---
Well that explains why half the time levelling in higher level zones in Westfall gives you no people in /who while you see a bunch of dwarves and gnomes running around.
---
No I don't run auctionator checks, how do I do that? and I don't have disenchant as an ability. I'm guessing I probably have to learn that somewhere lol
---
Sigh... I dont care about the rename I care about the inconsistency between 2 support members
---
Ahhh yeah that would be rough. I don't foresee it any time soon
---
Nah, we watch and wait till you link three mobs and barely survive with no Mana and 200 hp.  Then the six of us kill you.  And when you grave Rez our buddies over there kill you again.
---
I think it’s called Titan panel or something
---
It's a glass top hes not on anythin bad
---
As a priest.. Any way to set auto retaliate as wand instead if melee?
---
I would say its nice to know that we superior horde can bring out such strong emotions in you, but I kill you and take off because I couldn't care less. You already have the shittiest questing experience, you're alliance.
---
It's like portal roulette but.
---
Shadow fang keep has some solid cloth gear if you can get a group for it
---
As someone trying to keep pace while analyzing playing times, levelling approach, etc I really enjoyed your write up! Congrats on 60 dude, thanks for sharing
---
I'm continually amused by your commitment to respond to every one of my retorts with small essays. I think you just don't want to admit you're wrong :)
---
I've never stuck around on any max level character in an mmo. Endgame is the most boring part of all mmos, and retail killed every part of the game except for it. So no, it is not where I'm going to spend the vast majority of my time.
---
This is what my mage is wearing!
---
TitanPanel is the best one i've found so far
---
Agreed, I'm playing rogue. 
---
Its like some sort of fight ritual... Wonder by eachother, target, if he/she is targeting you back you know there's a high chance of a fight. 
---
When one of you stealths oooh it's on! Then it's hide and seek for the opener haha.
---
Thank you! And just as you’d expect. Even redridge and Surprisingly Westfall are getting their fair share, makes for a good time!
---
Its not the name man,enjoy the game.....people in your server will definitely help you.

I'd even pay like $30 for a 1 time switch. Won't get my hopes up tho
---
Was warrior back in Vanilla.
---
Now that I work 12h shifts sometimes, instead of 0, I've rolled Hunter this time around to keep up pace.
---
Is the rockpounder (mace) or stone slayer (sword) better than the whirlwind axe if I'm an orc? my racial is +5 axe skill.
---
BlackFathom Deeps. You'll want to go to Darnassus first and get the quest for the wand out of BFD. This wand will carry you for 15 levels. I'm 37 and just got a 0.7 dps increase wand.
---
that's the rpg aspect of the game. enjoy :)
---
Someone kited this same dragon to eastvale logging camp on Ol Blanchey and he's sat in one spot there for like 4 hours. Kinda wish someone would kite him to SW tho.
---
Loved this! That’s what he gets!
---
Oof, get that man some [Deeprock Salt]
---
Imagine being on a PvP server and complaining about this shit.
---
I was surrounded in STV the other day by ally, and then inevitably got ganked by all of them at once. 
---
First thought was “oh, I probably would’ve done the same” 
---
And then went about my business. 
---
Weird.
---
Don't worry about it, the Horde are illiterate. Have you ever stumbled upon an orc dwelling with a bookcase?
---
Bro, you are the best warrior here. You are the one. You are the one that can pull 2-3 mobs of 1-2 higher level and survive. Nobody can. Only you. Others cant play warrior.

thats pretty good.

Strange, I just had ravager equipped and a ton of trollsweat in my bags when leveling

---
Are you generally coming into an area with a bunch of horde farming and deciding to start farming? Of course theyre going to kill you then...
---
Was that at Fozruk? Might have been me; for the Alliance!
---
Just wait until battleground release and the twink scene is born
---
Brd arena, lvl up in 2hours or less.
---
Thats a hunter item!
---
I upgraded to it from an Orc Crusher from Tharil’Zun at lvl 27. I didn’t notice a huge upgrade in DPS but the +9 spirit definitely helps with mana regen during fights
---
O you poor soul idk how you have been leveling.. you are going to want to watch a video on Hunter pets. There is quite a lot there, but go to your general tab in skills and click on beast training. Then learn those spells. For new ones you gotta capture other pets.
---
As Alliance on Stalag....that makes sense
---
if it did work change the last line to
---
/cast [nocombat, stance:2, stance:3] Battle Stance
---
so you can go into battlestance after combat
---
If you need the item so badly then you can buy it off the person that wins the roll.
---
This is intentional on Blizzard's part, it won't be fixed
---
It's okay he has to live as nickleback
---
My realm is exactly 50:50 Ally to Horde
---
You can not handle my strongest potions! You best go to a seller of weaker potions!
---
Find out for yourself and see.
---
You seem to be missing the point.
---
I'm not arguing that BoK doesn't give you more attack power. I never said that. What I said is that it doesn't increase the attack power ratio from strength. It's pretty plain and simple. I don't know how people are having such a hard time understanding this. 
---
10 strength = 20 AP.
---
11 Strength = 22 AP. 
---
It's literally that simple. 
---
You aren't changing the conversion rate of strength:AP by having blessing of kings, you just have more strength, and therefore, more attack power.
---
I never play pvp, you were just so whiny.
---
I was guessing rogue from the flair, my b lol
---
What’s that say about the people who spend “+100g” to buy it? With your logic they should never sell.
---
The game isn't hard but does force ppl to group up to tackle a fair bit compared to retail and most other modern MMO. Get used to asking for help in general chat...I used to be like you and frankly not sure I could ever go back.
---
Nice.
---
Level 60 *shrugs*
---
I scan the AH every few hours and anything that isn't at least 40 silver over vendor gets vendored. But there are lots of well itemized greens that will sell quickly for substantially more than AH prices.
---
Great, many horde players can also make the same claims. Both factions have pvpers of all honor, and only an idiot would think one faction unfairly ganks more than the other.
---
Give it a little bit and your kids will be asking to create their own characters lol. 
---
My 8 year old daughter kept begging and begging me to let her play classic. I finally relented and she started a troll hunter. Got to level 7 though and she gave it up as a bad job because the game play is too slow for her and she doesn't get to pvp yet. She's played Overwatch since she was five and she was disappointed that you can't headshot other people in WoW (she's a Widowmaker main in OW) and that "playing doesn't take much skill cause you don't even have to have a good aim" lol. Broke my heart just a little bit lol.
---
Excuse me sir, could you please elaborate further on your first point 'Waaaaa QQ'? Oh, nevermind - it's just a stupid thing to say.
---
I tend to agree, but am seeking a confirmation.
---
I’ll answer it for you.  Pick a class you enjoy to play but pick professions to support your main.  That way it’s not a total loss.  Some classes are better than others to farm.
---
Lol ya idk why wrote quests.
---
roll need next time.
---
There's a *increased wand damage/speed* talent somewhere in the talent trees which priests usually take as soon as possible. 
---
I don't know where it is by memory, but I am sure you could find it with a quick Google search.
---
Like it or not, it was part of classic and integral to the experiences of many,
---
Even from an RP perspective what you're saying makes no sense, he's just kneeling there, not even responding to your aggression, and there's Holy Priests in the ranks of the Horde lol.
---
People don't have this deep RP reasoning behind stuff, they just like murdering people cos "red is ded lol", aka malicious fun.
---
You are looking for "ClassicAuraDurations" in combination with OmniCC!
---
Preach it, brother. Victory for the Forsaken!
---
Not really relevant as this doesn't reflect the general server A:H ratio. Could very well be that OP is on a 80:20 server for Example, the global number doesn't really mean shit here.
---
Thanks! Either faction?
---
i was thinking more like 80 is greater than 12
---
Your dad's?
---
I play horde, city's are always populated
---
Why do u mean bro? Why asmon can keep the name and u cant? He's on a pvp server
---
You don't play this game for charity, yet if you play like most people, you're giving away more than 150g in pure 1-10g BoE blues, which won't be used by people for more than a few days max. Meanwhile you got 150g axe, which will last most Warriors probably 6 months.
---
You can just live in the scarlet monastery til you're  40+
---
We play World of Warcraft of course we ea t to be pedantic
---
Leatrix Maps better than Mapster by quite a long way.
---
EQ had zero chill
---
thanks a lot man! gonna give it a try now. does it have to be configued via omni CC?? thx again.
---
lmao
---
This may only be specific to the cats then, cause the mech chicken, and macaw definitely still show
---
Where did I complain? Just pointing out a fact
---
So what UI is that looks awesome
---
This was the same way in my groups on Stomrage in Vanilla though?
---
as a fellow warrior you defo do not need all those upgrades , fuck paying 1g for 10 more damage on thunder clap
---
Level as shadow. You can still heal dungeons.
---
In my experience the enchantrix is wwwaaayy off. If it was 4g for disenchanting then everyone would be buying the 20s greens off the AH just to disenchant them.
---
Ungoro is great place to quest/grind 52-54/55. Also Felwood.
---
Dont touch WPL / Winterspring until at least 56 as a warrior.
---
Doing Arena runs in BRD gives a good amount of exp, so use that to grind.
---
My warr tanked BRD (early bosses only) until ~55 or so, did a full run at 55 (had a 60 dps warrior tank Emperor though, when he enrages you CANT tank him as 55), and finished a full LBRS run at 56.
---
If it would be old days i know i would be lvl 60 by now. but now lvling from 35 to 36 took me multiple days with 9h played on that lvl ( i hate stv ). all i hope is that they dont put any updates on classic and it it stays like this. So us ppl who work and have familys and can play few h a day or even few h a week can also hit lvl 60 and enjoy endgame content. 
---
My friend who doesnt work dont have family and dont study hited 60 fast with mage, and where said that all ppl in his guild are so slow to lvl. like no way bro, not all can wake up grind all day go to sleep and repeat.
---
Don't ever fight mobs above your lvl as a warrior. It's a giant waste of time vs what you could be doing.
---
Chests are very random.. and the loot is randomized so it wouldn't even be the same item
---
So you played the game... 3 weeks ago? When they added layering for the first time?
---
Well played.
---
It looney toons
---
For some reason the underground assault in iron forge is not showing up for me and my friend. Does anyone know why this is happening?
---
It’s always nice to have an add on for the situation where you need to actually check and see if the BOE is actually worth anything. I needed on the scarlet boots a couple of weeks ago and one of the people in my group got a little salty about it. Come and check on the AH in my server and it’s not going for much more than the vendor price
---
The amount of all-nighters I pulled in order to play is stupid. Years later and I'm still trying to catch up on the sleep I lost. 
---
I joined the Navy directly after high school, so that put an end to my WoW days for a few years. Now I'm a Uni student, back to playing, but homework and assignments come first... :(
---
The answer to your question is not tied to what level you are. You want to sell those when the price is the highest.
---
Gotta love when you type roll for chest and there is one player that doesn't roll and opens it...not once, but twice
---
Git gud
---
Without a healer, you will not even scratch him.
---
Ye I've seen people say they used the all need ruleset in vanilla, so I'm always careful not to say all servers. 
---
I had 60s on 3 EU servers in vanilla and they all used the need if you need, greed otherwise ruleset. Wasn't till I started on pservers in like 2010 I first saw that every BoE is just seen as a gold drop, and that's how it was on ALL of the ones I played. 
---
A lot of veterans aren't going to have played pservers though and will still auto roll greed on them for awhile due to how popular the old ruleset was.
---
lol what
---
I'm level 43 and play 3-4 hours per day in the weekdays
---
I got the green wing macaw from Dead mines the other night.
---
&gt;  do dungeons the right way
---
The is no right or wrong way.
---
Don’t bother anymore. Let them try and justify it to themselves. You won’t get through to them.
---
Start trying to push em now. Use the addon Auctioneer to save time slinging stacks and price matching.
---
This is the best thing I’ve seen. Next level rogue shit!
---
Need if you need greed otherwise was normal for BoE greens/boss loot. It's only BoE purples worth 200+g where everyone needs.
---
I like everything so far, but the change for nameplates are the weirdest thing they've done so far.
---
Of all the differences they seem happy with, this is the one thing that they want to change? Just seems so incredibly inconsistent
---
You will see more people/compete for resources. Same amount of people will be on the server.
---
No you wont have longer queues, you'll just see more people in world
---
You felt the need to point out “raid groups” tanking.
---
Complaining.
---
Check out https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/
---
Lots of information to pull from.
---
3 wars with ravager and a shaman in cath is some disgusting fun.  Oh god I feel guilty everytime we pile into the room with fairbanks
---
https://youtu.be/ebfftvVL3rk
---
Troll is better by far. Devouring plague is only good 1v1 or in wpvp 1v1 which is basically what priests are good at anyways.
---
But shadowguard is good always for so many reasons. It procs blackout which by itself should be the reason to roll troll. When a rogue or warrior opens on you they can by met with a 3 second stun from a low cost no cd spell. 
---
Touch of weakness is a mini mortal strike for almost no cost and it's a curse so it isnt likely to be dispelled. It shouldnt be underestimated. 
---
If you want to run bgs or so organized pvp go troll. If you are just looking to win 1v1s and duels go undead
---
You and I play for different reasons. This won't effect me.
---
10/10
---
Older with families, but an "unlimited" amount of time to complete it instead of a few months before TBC release. It'll be well above 5% now that guilds actually have a reason to do it.
---
My first day I saved a guy running from a few wolves, he thanked me, I demanded payment, he gave me 5 silver. 5/5 would RP again.
---
An absurdly long time imo 8+ days
---
Lots of AFK time and sneaky non-XP generating exploration
---
I mean its planet fitness, the least type of gym you can go to
---
actually He heals for every person he kills just like kazzak lmao
---
1-4 are official guilds, then you have 5-12 that are unofficial but have a large amount of members. And a large amount of 13-×× that have few members.
---
I also was impressed at how quickly things can escalate in wPvP. A few guildies and I started messing with allies in Hillsbrad last night and within about 20-30 minutes it has morphed into a full 25v25 man brawl. An absolute blast
---
whats dark about sex?  you one of them religious nuts?
---
I mean I got absolutely rocked by a few alliance earlier in Stonetalon.
---
Thank you so much
---
They're associated with weebs because every anime fan rerolled blood elf in tbc. You couldn't spit without hitting a belf with some anime inspired cringey name.
---
"leave plz"
---
I'm making a joke? Did you seriously get triggered at that?
---
I mean you're the one here complaining that inter-faction banter shouldn't be allowed lol
---
Yeah like those stupid kids who get bullied because they don’t fight back.
---
It’s not a perfect parallel, but my point is you’re shaming the wrong people.
---
I guess gyms have snobs about the brand?  So what’s a good gym?
---
Can you truly, really not see why these two people are different?
---
The seller is a fresh leveler that has little gold and needs as much as they can for skills and mounts.
---
The buyer is a whale/established max level character that has bought most everything they need to buy on their main and has extra gold to throw around to pimp out their alt or twink.
---
Lol
---
You can give uncooked meat to your pet. Only thing I have noticed is that higher tier food makes your pet happier faster.
---
It's called molten core yo, ragnaros is THE lord of fire.
---
I'm not saying they should be the defacto winner, but waiting until 3 people have effectively removed themselves from the "small jackpot" is going to ruffle some feathers.
---
Tree line to the right looks kind of like a silhouette of Dalaran.
---
Can't moonwalk anymore. I'd say that's about the most important change. Sad.
---
I enjoy levelling. Levelling is the entire game in my eyes. Forcing yourself through levelling and then feeling like there's nothing interesting sounds like forcing yourself to climb a mountain, hating it the whole way, and then getting pissed at the top that there isn't a Starbucks. You find classic empty because you expect the game to start where it actually ends.
---
I downloaded gathermate2 it shows up as add on but my mini map doesnt show any nodes.. sorry i am new WOW player, can someone teach me on how to turn it on?
---
Those tanking benchmarks are good to know, thanks!
---
What spec were you for them?
---
I felt the same way. I play Druid and used my cat abilities for lvling, bear for tanking, and healing cause you always need a heal. Around 32-34 I severely cut back and by 36 I stopped buying new spells entirely. Honestly noticed no difference and wish I cut some out sooner. But 40, bought by mount around half way to 41 and at 42 I started buying “some” of the spells back. I would highly recommend to review what you actually need and if that little extra dmg is worth it now.
---
Absolutely not! This is their first time to play. Turning on Questie is literally robbing them of the only time they can actually play this game for the first time.
---
Ferals can DPS really well with the right gear. but the right gear is rank13/AQ/Naxx gear. So. Not for a while.
---
Leveling as a war is a nice challenge honestly. Sure i dont have a ton of sustain but i have to make some Big Brain moves to accomplish certain things and it makes me feel like a pro!
---
Questie shows you where to go
---
wowhead is a pretty good resource
---
Rogues seem to make gold pretty easy with pickpocket macro
---
I've only done each dungeon one time (except two runs of RFD + maybe 5 sneaky chest runs)
---
But it's fine to not believe me not trying to bamboozle ya
---
Mom mom somone is mean to me ! Waahhhhhhh waaahhhhh get over yourself
---
We have no idea what they plan on doing with the game that far out. I think you underestimate the time investment vanilla is...
---
yeah I mean to say first ever WoW character
---
I dug this back up so I can present to you
---
#Exhibit A:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d46cqv/mounted_highlevel_tried_to_gank_me_prot_vs_arms/
---
Honestly seeing this mentality here is pretty much souring me on the idea of puging any raids.
---
Another huge advantage people have now is the upgraded technology we're playing on.  Naxx used to be hard because 40 people on old computers and connections meant people would crash during several encounters.  Now everything goes much more smoothly.  Things like the safety dance and balancing polarity will be no problem.
---
I don't think people will have much issue with Naxx until the 4 Horsemen, Sapphiron, and Kel'Thuzad.
---
Nice, I did the same thing! I have my Block Control for the camera always center my cursor. https://imgur.com/a/WVfTD5O I also made a little fake crosshair where it's located (you could see it just to the left of my moocow in front of the tool tip), and it made interacting with things WAY easier. 
---
Also wanted to thank you. Me and my brother saw your other post and immediately jumped on it and have been fiddling with controls since hahaha. Great down time pick up.
---
If you are Horde, you can get Berserker's Axe.
---
Boe's are literally designed by blizzard to be sold.
---
Bops are meant to be used immediately
---
Also yes, as you have found out - there is a difference between 1g and 150.
---
On top of this, you can view the combat log to see exactly how much faster (if at all)
---
Yes. That's why it's not a very clear answer. There aren't areas that are "easily jumped to" though. They involve pretty far distances, multiple tries, or very specific angles and wall jumping - i.e., clipping pixels to ascend nearly vertically. It's also why this was never an instant perma ban, but did warrant GM interaction.
---
A player could discover these and then find out it's an exploit, be told not to do it, and move on. They could also get up there and not PvP, therefore not grief, and again, no issues.
---
It all comes down to *why* it's being done. If it's due to knowing it's a specific location that you can interact with other players and they can't interact with you - as well as guards not being able to - that's pretty warranted for intervention.
---
This is exactly why players were suspended for banishing summoned internals when they knew it was an exploit- their immolation aura *shouldn't* have damaged players when banished. If they were warned but kept griefing, that's a ban. 
---
You can always wave the "I'm just playing the game!" Flag, but the devs / community at Large aren't going to sympathize. It's why duplicate exploits were also bannable. It's clearly unintended.
---
I think that was actually him outranging the Polymorph cast.
---
Are you a new player though? I said 10 hours which is a bit much i agree but as a new player not knowing anything,no way he played like you and got to 44
---
Do you have any idea about vanilla pvp system? If not dont spread false info. You compete only with people of your server.
---
"blowing", this is exactly what they are there for
---
The Halo Warthog is what I was referencing :D
---
It's all part of the adventure!
---
I try to do little things like this around zeppelins and other public areas with a lot of traffic. Never get any engagement from other people though :/
---
Your LOL made me laugh more than his “not yet”
---
Not to mention Orc racial is for axe specialization
---
I saw org full all the time in retail, and I'd group with randos almost every day in retail. I am really enjoying classic, but I seriously feel like I played a different game than most of the folk in this subreddit during BFA and Legion
---
Number 5. That's the one that killed my brother.
---
I was on the hype train for a long time, I give it a 10/10, it is by far the best game I’ve ever played, and I played it in the long long ago. I just wanted to add my voice to this
---
Good one.
---
I might, but I usually just afk autorun most places anyway. So I will survive if I don't get my mount right at 40. Pretty sure I was 45+ before I got the mount in Vanilla
---
For some reason any addon i use shows 100/100 hp for any enemy, i tried to it change from the interface  no luck
---
Any time you have a weird issue like this, do a /reload
---
Bushido cringe
---
Interesting advertising tactic with the response. Too bad it’s directed towards WoW players
---
 &gt;I’m making a joke? 
---
Lol, you’re hilarious man! 
---
Again, nothing bothered me or “triggered me”. You keep reaching for that. 
---
Again; it’s just funny to see people *complain* about the shit they signed up for.
---
I’m on that server and ive heard of a few people just doing /who and ignoring everyone from that guild. Shit’s whack. Tbh id be paranoid about joining for fear of getting blacklisted.
---
&gt; why should i pass on an 1g vendor item just because you want to equip it?
---
Because you expect me to do the same when your gear drops.
---
Is it seriously more greedy to want everyone to have a shot at 150g than just saying fuck everyone else and equipping the boe gear that is worth a few percentage points more than a random early raid or dungeon drop?
---
Do you vendor all your skins?
---
Naxx will be cleared in the first week after its release. Guilds like APES will have their BiS farmed up, attunements done, and enough consumables to break the economy twice over by the time it hits, however long down the road.
---
That said, for the average raid group it'll probably be a little bit of a nut-check. Naxx is unironically a difficult raid, and unlike modern raiding you don't get to pick your difficulty setting.
---
But, as a lot of people have said, the game has kindof been solved. Fifteen years of theorycrafting and data cosolidation means we know exactly what to expect. Anyone interested in doing Naxx can start working on the attunement reqs right now, and be ready to go the second it drops. There are certain pieces of gear you can farm right now that will remain BiS, or are extremely useful for certain fights. And unlike back in the day there doesn't need to be a figuring out, experimenting phase. We know what the fights look like, we know the strats needed to beat them. All that is left to do is execute.
---
Yeah true, almost forgot about that one.
---
You're missing the entirety of my point but okay.
---
I dont disagree with you. Wow is easier than eve no doubt. But these stupid small changes, less skeletons, no infernal griefing, these are small steps towards retail and I dont like it.
---
What about [this post](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=294502/wow-classic-realm-update-august-16th-herod-and-shazzrah-massively-overpopulated) where they say "While we are able to fit several times more players on a single realm in 2019 than was the case in 2006, we are not going to raise that cap any further, even though we have the technical capacity to do so. Raising realm caps would simply forestall the problem, letting more players in at launch but creating an unsustainable situation down the line, with severe queues when we turn off layering permanently before Phase 2 of our content unlock plan." Am I misunderstanding this?
---
10% of the people playing RIGHT NOW? Probably less than that, even. 10% of the people who are still left playing Classic by the time Naxx rolls out? Probably quite a bit higher. If I had to guess, it might work itself out to 10% when the two groups are evened out.
---
It's not that Naxx is too hard. Time and boredom and other games will dilute the player pool dramatically, and the roster boss will catch quite a few guilds up in the process.
---
Dude like 80% of the playerbase isn’t even 50 yet. I think 10% of all players is a good estimate.
---
LokTar
---
Mind control. Priest spell that allows you to control another character.
---
It’s kinda the opposite for me, I’m lucky. I was working my ass off back then. I was a service plumber working 12 hour days, at least 6 days a week. Gamed late at night or on weekends. But now I’m retired and game whenever I want.
---
Did Samurai use Axes? Apparently they did, but it was extremely rare: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ono_(weapon)
---
Im horde and i kill on sight
---
Right back at you.
---
It's funny to see you complain about faction rivalry in wow
---
&gt;It all comes down to why it's being done.
---
oh so blizzard has to read minds to determine intent and thats how they enforce the rule? 
---
Theres tons of easy to get to places that evade guards.  I think you might be oblivious.
---
oh thanks! let me check them out, whats AIE stand for?
---
I plan to stop leveling the minute I hit AV on nearly every character, Classic AV was awesome and just too much fun to pass up.
---
Reminds me of Burning Man.
---
imagine having literally just 1 thing you have to do and failing.  it's nuts how braindead people are like holy fuck these people presumably have jobs and work... this is why my mcdonalds order is always fucked up
---
A.C.M.E
---
Okay Kargath settle down
---
Honestly I was testing things out haha you are correct though
---
Follow the guy he shouldn't have his 1hr cool downs you can camp him for a while
---
Well yeah because it makes you invuln...movement skills don't drop it just invulns/vanish etc.
---
How do you possibly have a net gain from blacksmithing?
---
Classic wow and retail wow are also different games...
---
Dungeon Finder is the worst thing that happened to wow, but I do see where they were coming from. I miss the summoning stones and the lfg tab where you could put yourself as "interested" in a dungeon without joining a group. It made going to dungeons easier and quicker, without destroying the realm community. From there the logical step was the dungeon finder, but they took it too far in terms of quick gameplay experiences at the cost of immersion and general good manners.
---
You have to understand like 90% of that is just for thr luls and nothing serious
---
Maybe not in capitals true,but anything outside of them is a depressive mess.
---
Yes. That axe is best for AoE. However it's still good for single target, if you haven't gotten weapons like the Whirlwind Axe.
---
If I paid you $20 to hurt somebody would you do it?
---
If not, what if I payed you $200 to do the same? 
---
I’m just curious where your ethics lie. My point is greed makes people do unethical things.
---
"anywhere unpathable blocks guards" aka "I don't know I'm just rambling" like.. my guy... I'm trying to back up my points and explain. You're not giving a single example.
---
They find out by talking. By investigating chat logs. Do you think detective read minds? Journalists? There's a lot you can find out by just poking around the facts.
---
I'm still waiting for the list of tons of places that evade guards. Won't hold my breath though, because I know of a couple, and there *really* aren't many.
---
People who say "u retard noob", kicks you then ignore you; why do they exist? At least own up what you said and give me the option to reply back.
---
You're 6 lvls away from Whirlwind, and then 4 from Mortal Strike. Take the warrior to 40 and see if you like it. They're insanely fun at 60 once you get a little gear.
---
Cheeky coont
---
Sad, normal people have to be together with sick and pretend that it's ok
---
well no. I'm responding to what you're saying, if you come off as entitled, i'll call you entitled. that's not an insult it's an observation.
---
Enjoy your down votes man. you clearly have your head so far up your rear you can only see your own opinion. THATS an insult :)
---
If you don’t have much time, dungeons are really hard. Full time to complete a dungeon can easily run to 1.5-2 hours including getting a group together. If you have a hard cap of an hour or so a night, it’s a challenge.
---
I keep hearing this. So is druid feral damage not based off weapon damage? It's just a straight number based off stats? And the 50 percent speed boost can be used in cat form?
---
Yep sanctions are  economic blockade and pretty much and act of war tbh
---
Everything that is white can be used for some profession. The "safe to vendor without thinking" junk is grey.
---
It is ElvUi, that's pretty much it. Offers a lot customization for my likes, give it a whirl.

Lmao no one cares.

You're supposed to Need on BoE's.

**Nothing** is more satisfying to me than Shield-Slamming away a priest's fresh, mana-expensive, shiny bubble.

I would also like to kill you
---
Metal
---
I wasn't aware the epic mount followed the economy by increasing it's price 3 fold.
---
Also more expensive.
---
I'm using Classic Quest Log addon, and for some reason the quests I'm tracking keep untracking constantly.
---
In my experience it works excellently in the low 30s, but I would imagine that it's not great at lower levels
---
Don't mean to ruin the fun, but this was from like a week ago. I have since then moved to the ~~dead~~ server of Heartseeker for IRL friends :)
---
Umm life tap doesnt generate agro?
---
boomkin is shit because druids in pvp want to be able to change forms. they don't just stay in one. it's usually best to open from stealth in cat form. then bear form is useful for bash and feral charge and tankiness. and no form for casting spells. the problem with moonkin in pvp is that it takes extra mana to switch into it whereas switching out of a form to cast takes no mana, and shapeshifting drains mana fast. also you can't cast heals in boomkin form. having either feral charge or natures swiftness is just better.
---
You cried that I made a little jab at hordies...

It’s at least a gym that’s cheap, and offers an outlet to those who otherwise probably wouldn’t exercise.

I still have a very basic PF membership purely because it’s a 1 minute WALK for me, so on days where I don’t feel like driving to lift cause of stress, bad day, etc. I can at least walk to PF and do some dumbbell exercises.

It’s not as bad as it’s made out to be. It surprisingly has a very nice cage for calisthenics.

Things change when you're with strangers and a 600g item drops. Like everyone is saying, everyone should roll need on these sort of drops to avoid what happened to op

As what class? I doubt anything beats dungeon grinding besides super efficient solo hunter or mage aoe grinding +  layer abuse.
---
(And when a proper dungeon grind meta forms, I dont think anything will beat it)
---
Use an auctioneer addon and it won't matter. Makes scooping up the lowest price of whatever you need easy regardless if it's one at a time or in stacks.

Cheap as shit and free pizza

I literally never said anything like that?
---
To be fair, this mage is pretty bad.
---
* Using mana shield against a non-phys damage class? Check.
---
* No counterspell? Check.
---
* Running around like a headless chicken during AP? Check.
---
* No bandage after SW:P drops off? Check.

You need an addon to estimate the actual value
---
Please post it
---
That’s been mine too, since vanilla.  It’s worked out well all these years.
---
i do.
---
The kind of people who stereotypically play WoW are actually Planet Fitness’ target demographic. They bill themselves as being open and accepting of everyone regardless of your body type or level of fitness (The Twitter post alludes to this) and sort of anti-meathead (hence the infamous lunk alarm). So I guess in that light it’s not all that surprising to me that they would respond like this.
---
That’s because nightblade isn’t worth much but flurry axe is. Don’t call people out on reddit if you don’t understand the basic concept of needing on expensive boes.
---
Rogues are best for getting out of turtle situations since sprint is not only twice as fast as travel form but can be used indoors but once you CDs are burned drop it for the druid to run and hold.

Not stronglifts REEEEEEE
---
Interest yah in ah pint???!!?
---
I hope so. I started in Cata but I leveled a pally as shockadin with the intent of getting Herald of the Titans on it. I got it easily, was amazing fun. I was so distraught when they nerfed it into obsoletion
---
Look at two identical (white) 1H weapons and look at a same level (white) 2H. This is the base ratios all blues/greens/purps are based off of. Two 1Hers have more combined DPS than a single 1H, but the actualy DPS is only 150% (which will be closer to the single 2H). 
---
But you must now add the 1H Weapon Specialization bonus twice (net +%10*1.5).
---
I grew up in Toowoomba. Glad to see someone else from there.

Thank god it looks so good

You're 6 lvls away from whirlwind. Not as strong as mortal strike, but mortal strike isn't super insane at rank one vs whirlwind.
---
Lol just accept your fate and move on. People who whine about a ninja item to this extent almost deserve being ninja’d. Its a good reality check that its just a game.
---
I got mine from farming beasts in the badlands and skinning all of them, was there from 37 - 40
---
I love this so, so very much.
---
What class are you?
---
*holds up sign*
---
Uh-oh
---
I miss my priest on retail. I owe her so many apologies
---
I liked playing blood elves for the TBC lore when I got into WoW. I loved the idea of a power hungry and calculated race, because of that they seemed like the scariest race in the Horde to me.
---
That must teach you and others not to have a close mind
---
go lift rocks in the woods it's free!
---
Not to mention it was a great source of rep.  Iirc that's how I got most of my Alliance/Horde reps to Exalted for both my Human 'lock in Vanilla and my BElfadin in BC.
---
But Brock has an Onyx
---
It hasn’t, my server incendious still has a queue at peak hours, the longest being 20 minutes so the hype is still real. I also just dinged  43, just got my mount which made me absurdly proud for a video game :). It’s taking a while but I wouldn’t have it any other way.
---
Just straight grinding? Or questing too?
---
If it wasn’t on purpose then they should add it to their bug list, but they haven’t.
---
Depends on what professions you enjoy the most or can get the most value from. Fury for leveling tho.
---
FIFTY DKP MINUS!
---
Ayy dood i was in the same boat weapon wise, fun fact that orb gives shadow damage spell power so its not really good for us mages
---
Thanks, will take a look at it!
---
I really like Engineering and Alchemy as my finals, with skinning/mining as I'm leveling up. The skinning supplements my gold and I can save the mining materials to level up my engineering at 60.
---
sometimes I feel like the biggest enemy of the horde is their elevators... 
---
your choice of music ([M.O.O.N. - Hydrogen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNE2oCZH_4k)) is fucking amazing, btw.

You didn’t explain how it works though

My laptop still lags when I walk past undercity guardians lol.
---
That’s some war campaign shenanigans right here. You could write a whole story around this.
---
I'm Horde there and I'm genuinely concerned that Asmongold is going to end up owning the server.  He's already had 2 streams now where he's taken 2-3 40 mans into a zone and dominated.
---
Everyone in the gym gets a buff from it though
---
what class are you?
---
I got to level 60 by doing key dungeons only once for quests, mainly questing, your statement of high level zones being barren wastelands is a flat out lie. I cannot tell you the amount of times I had to compete to tag named mobs. Or was forced to group up because of the sheer amount of people doing the same quests. 
---
Your statement about the market being a mess is also laughable, It's the first few weeks of the game launch, the market is screwed by default, the amount of BoE's is because the Rat pack of players, that include yourself, are all out doing that content, and there is a lot of drops happening, wait until people start hitting level 60, less people will be in that stage and less BoE's will be in those brackets. You are complaining to complain. 
---
Go do quests, you are letting this stupid low level early meta ruin you. You are sabotaging your own game play by feeling forced to participate.
---
you absolutely murdered him dude
---
If it sells, you get it back. If it doesn't sell you don't.

You're not getting 5k either lol.

Yeah you're pretty much just watching someone panic lol.

In Vanilla, summoned Warlock Infernals, when released from control, were aggressive to everyone, had an AOE immolation aura, and stood in the area they were summoned until killed. ****Now****, they are only aggressive to the summoning warlock, have no AOE ability, and despawn after a few seconds of no combat. Why is this? This is not a simple "bug fix", you changed a core mechanic of the infernal. Why does it despawn? Why is not not aggressive? Why does the aoe not hit everything? Instead it just attacks things that attack it. Please let me know how to fix my Infernal spell, as it is clearly bugged and does not work as it did in Vanilla."

Planet fitness has some pretty shitty gym culture. If they think you’re trying too hard (not even slamming weights), they’ll hit the lunk alarm. It’s also pretty fucked to offer pizza for free every week when you’re a gym aimed at people looking to drop weight generally. It’s hard to clean up your diet and really get on track and build good habits. They do nothing to help you there. Pick a gym that fucks off and leaves you alone unless you ask imo. And pick one that cares about safety.

This is all that needs to be said

Roll credits

I did my first deadmines run last night as well. 
---
Our priest released 3! times with active Soulstone. After the boss in the round room, we lost one member, which we replaced. We wiped again, this time the priest understood the concept of having a Soulstone. We wiped again twice at VanCleeve and had to run the second time.
---
We returned and due to all those wipes we had respawn.
---
We reset. Everyone was in. But after the round room we lost another member....which we replaced. We almost wiped again at VanCleeve but finally made it thank to a clutch priest play.
---
5h of deadmines...hell you'd think!
---
No! It was awesome. Everyone was nice, positive, understanding and patient. We had great fun.
---
/u/vredditshare
---
I dont use the addon
---
As far as the most recent update: I don't believe Infernals had Immolation Aura on their cast bar in vanilla, it was just a passive ability you couldn't turn off.  At least, I swear that when I dinged 50 and first summoned it, it had a completely blank cast bar back in the day.
---
Mana gem and health pot probably.
---
Christ.
---
Keep reaching, lol.

Blood elf= weeb?

F1 to pay respect

Hotel gyms
---
You will easily get 10k for it when the economy is higher.
---
Technically they were not in vanilla until mid 2006. A year and a half after the game was released.
---
That was likely part of it, end result is the same regardless though - Mage stupidly Blinked in and got wrecked.
---
what kind of idiot uses master loot in a 5 man?
---
can you go back to retail please
---
Lvling got harder for me in the mid 40's and beyond. You're still stuck with your shitty WW axe which has same dmg range as a lvl 41 green. Honestly 1-40 was the easiest part.

One minor PSA about Steam link that no one ever seems to acknowledge is that there's about .25 sec of delay time from the time an action executes on your computer, is sent to the tv, and gets back to the computer. 
---
It's a very minor delay but for playing games like Furi, Dark Souls, or most likely WoW pve/pvp...there is definitely a noticeable lag.
---
Like Feenix ED?
---
Walk with the Earth Mother
---
RFD now and then ZF at 42

Also run SM Cath a few times to get your neck and headpiece.

Tin foil hat time!
---
My theory is that blizzard implemented this "bug" so we don't have a huge amount of infernals in the first month, later this year (probaly phase 2) it will be stealth fixed in some patch
---
I live in New Zealand but play on EU servers. I never notice anything really, but i guess its not exactly optimal for PvP, unless you're wanting to go cutting edge I wouldn't worry!
---
I have the opposite problem. With most games I go all in at first. The moment I feel the slightest disinterest is my downfall. I'm usually on a different game within the week. And I'm talking going from fully committed with goals and aspirations to not even wanting to boot it up for a quick session. 
---
Doesn't matter if it's big online games like WoW, Destiny, Ark, or Overwatch. Or even single player games like Skyrim, Dark Souls, the Witcher, Breath of the Wild, Persona 5, etc. I love all of these games, and even go back to most of them with full devotion and passion but it's impossible to hold that interest for more than a month or two. 
---
It's not surprising that I can't maintain that feeling. But it's frustrating knowing that I will eventually go back to it, wishing that I could've just powered through, reached endgame, experienced all of the content, and gotten closer to really mastering the game. Instead I feel like I'm in a loop of playing the first 50% of my favorite games over and over.
---
And that's the end of my rant. I hope someone finds this post relatable or at least on topic.
---
Dude, Horde sucks.
---
Either reroll or just continue playing. Has it impacted your game in any way? Assuming you mean stalagg, the population is high enough to where it might not matter.
---
i mean, at 40 i can go shadow, or go disc and spell cleave groups.
---
Salam alaikum
---
Like my grandpappy used to say - Well, would you have a look at that?!
---
What a dumb comment. Does not justify rolling need because more expensive. Don’t call redditors out if you don’t understand the basic concept of not being a complete piece of shit.
---
BOE purples should be needed by the whole group. This is like so elementary for this game, and learned it 15 years ago.
---
It is not only those who you are at war, it will attack friendlies. So a human warlock can come to goldshire and summon an infernal that will kill every single alliance player trying to level in golshire.
---
Will of the Forsaken bro
---
I'm at level 47, I have +109 spell/shadow damage without having the zf staff.  Its pretty significant spell power even giving up stamina on pieces.
---
Did U add the explosion?
---
You sir... are a legend!
---
You don’t do the same for greens. Why do the rules change? Because greed makes people unethical. That’s understandable. 
---
I agree, everybody should be unethical to balance the playing field.  However I don’t agree in victim-shaming the ethical ones. “They had it coming” or “they got what they deserved”.  I roll need on every rare BOE but I’m not deluded enough to think what I’m doing is ideal for everybody.
---
I’m on both (horde and alliance character) and they’re both great. Just pick one and have fun. 
---
My main is on Kromcrush if it makes any difference. The alliance on Kromcrush are a LOT more ruthless in wpvp than on Benediction.
---
So where do you pick this up?  I haven't seen any quests for it.
---
Judgement is a ranged, offensive spell. 
---
Do i need to explain the whole thing to you or you think you can take it from here?
---
I dreamt about this when I was addicted to wow in the late bc early wotlk period
---
They just don't like how I can heal myself after dropping dumbbells on my head. I know. I am a dumb-bell.
---
Thick Leather is where I started selling in the AH on my server at least. Everything below that wasn't enough to justify a trip to the AH.
---
Go spirit tap and then the disc tree till 40. 
---
On your 2nd monitor watch some TV or something. Cause this shit is BOOORRRIIINNNG 
---
Then at 40 go shadow and replace holy fire with mind flay. 2nd monitor still tv. 
---
Then go into retail and apologize to your priest for ever disrespecting it
---
Friend and I made the run to Desolace earlier tonight. There were 3 or 4 Alliance we met on the way through Ashenvale. We saw at least 20 Horde, and even had to fight off a group of four and a few loners. It's definitely imbalanced to a point it's noticeable. But in general does not have an exceptionally negative imbalance on game play imo.
---
I do not use LFG since WotLK and i joined Raiding Guilds. The dungeons that are included there are so freaking easy to faceroll that there is no time to even be an elitist.   
---
I do not see the fault in LFG especially since WotLk WAS PEAK Subriber Numbers etc.
---
So was 1.12, the balance patch used as a standard"vanilla" feel for WoW Classic.
---
I didn't get mine until level 42. Just keep chipping away with questing and you'll get there.
---
You one of them anti-religious nuts?
---
there’s only 500 other threads like this. we get it, you were once close minded.
---
That's sweet where is that at?
---
Get carrot on a stick trinket to increase mounted speed if you don’t have it already.
---
Why be prot at all though? You can tank anything super well as 31/5/15, even progression main tank. I mean the stuns are cool, but you can’t solo.
---
Ashenvale is right next to the barrens so it makes sense that you’d see a lot of horde.
---
I played since vanilla, and off and on since. A couple weeks in and still loving the hell out of it.  I hope Classic lives forever in a perpetual pre-BC state so I can come back and enjoy it over and over.
---
Really? I doubt they kick you out for minding your own business
---
Not in WoW, but Ive had it happen in Ultima Online. About three years back I was on a private server and a guy came up and confronted me.. His name looked familiar.. And he asked if I was XXXXX from Pacific back in the day (98-00).. Sure enough, this was a guy I PKed with for awhile but then lost contact when I quit playing Pacific around 2000ish. Ive had a couple other similar instances, but most of those were only 5-10 year gaps
---
&gt;not having Alch as a Rogue
---
Classic Alliance move.
---
On heartseeker and love it!
---
Does priest training cost a lot? Every priest I've met is broke. One didn't get a mount till 51.
---
We will see how fast Naxx and AQ 40 falls.   
---
But yes 15 years of experience totally helps with that.
---
Oh no
---
If I remember right it's actually a WC2 Naga ship model.
---
"The right to choose" 
---
Holy fuck mister entitlement.
---
So much this. It feels rewarding to level again.
---
Are you so sure? One of the best things about warriors in vanilla is that a dip of 15 into prot is all you need to tank ANY content. So you can be arms and a raid main tank at the same time.
---
That is next to horde central, doesn't matter what server you will see more horde in that area.
---
just over 8 days, but take a day or so off for trying to avoid the queue lol
---
I'm not entirely sure but I'm pretty sure the pandas have been in warcrafts lore since around warcraft 2.
---
Ah, but with content being released in "phases" perhaps this is being considered as well?
---
Although, more importantly and probable, perhaps they're still tuning server populations with free realm transfers before opening up paid transfers.
---
God, I don't know how you don't cut yourself with your edginess. You're so fucking cool
---
There was a lot of debate, but last I remember, Blizzard's stance was that a multiboxer is actively sending commands to all his(her) characters with a button press, which is enough to rule it as not botting and okay for the TOA.
---
shouldn't of jumped lol
---
You are lucky if you only get ganked 10 times in a play session. Groups of horde on every quest site. I am lucky because I am a rogue. Others are severely being affected in terms of leveling time due to this. Rerolling is not an option as I am already deeply invested in my character. Wish you could see it yourself. It is hard to understand until you are here yourself. Just trying to spread the word.
---
It’s the same with gold though
---
That's what he meant. And he's just playing dumb.

For someone who hasn't played any retail...
---
I'm constantly hearing about all the extra mechanics in retail and how fights take more skill and so on. Then every time there's a group story, the mechanic is "pull everything" and apparently that was "the retail way". Where's the discrepancy here?
---
Welcome to vanilla wow where every class can’t do everything other classes can
---
For horde.  Alliance has to shuttle up to darkshire then back down for 17s
---
I play a troll! I just have berserker and regeneratin!
---
Yaaaaaa... I just did a ZF and two hunters BOTH had growl on their pet/multishot on pull/and didnt feign death on aggro.
---
"The playerbase is so much better now"
---
No. False. Wrong.
---
The player character toolkits in bfa are more geared to a user friendly experience so they can throw much more complicated mechanics at bad players. People are wiping on MC bosses on stream with 40 players lol. 
---
Dont get me wrong BFA OBVIOUSLY is harder than vanilla raids but the general playerbase from retail playing vanilla dont even do heroic raids.
---
100% this.  That way if only the guy actually using it needs.  I roll greed.  And if anyone else does need.  I make sure to roll need too.  I personally would give up that bind BoP 500gp AH dagger to give it to the rogue that actually needs it.
---
Hi guys,
---
I’m playing a Druid and currently level 23. I would like to tank some dungeons when leveling, but have never tanked before.
---
Is there like a tanking 101 guide or video? Or a few key things I need to know? The stuff I’ve found is all aimed at level 60 tanks. (I plan to respec to resto at 60)
---
Most people. Plenty of blues in 60 dungeons are being given away to whoever needs them, most of them are 10-20g blues.
---
You have a free transfer. Use it.
---
For pvp I like Demo/Destro. Going deep into destro gives you 2 instant burst damage spells, conflage and soulburn. Also some percent change to daze with your fire spells, for world pvp I usually use VW as being able to pop shield gives you some extra buffer against rogue that may gank you. 
---
Although if you know for sure you are going to be in pvp soon I use succi, as seduce is amazing. Rogue ganks you, seduce them, put instance between you, dot them up, fear them and then spin out the dps with either immolate conflagration or shadow bolt. 
---
Felhunter I usually find helpful against priest to tear down their bubble.
---
I'm with you. Cata deleted the old game, the charm, the... everything.

I use planet fitness. I've never seen the lunk alarm go off except when someone was trying to trigger it. I dont understand why hardcore lifters are so offended that EVERY gym doesnt cater to them. I go and do biking. Light lifting, go to work. If I wanted to stack muscle and get jacked I would go to a local power gym.
---
Honestly not that expensive, most of that food is free, health potions are much cheaper than mana potions, and bandages are usually free with your own mats.
---
If he had a bag of engineering supplies as well, that would easily be worth twice as much as what he’s showing.
---
That's not what I'm asking for here. That was stupid, and should've been changed. I'm just saying that it's both inconsistent - why is this changed, and not everything else that's UI-related that's different (Macros are not classic for one).
---
I think they should've done this change, because it does make it a lot more 'am I going to get ganked around this corner' - which is an important part of the game, but I think it should've been in conjugation with a change to how nameplates are shown. Specifically; You should not be able to see enemies you do not have LoS with *ever*. I do however think we should be able to see the nameplates of the enemies you're actively fighting against
---
Does improved demo shout increase the amount of threat it applies? I’ve seen people say that if you spam Demo shout in AoE scenarios not even a mage can pull off you.... this doesn’t seem to work for me
---
You're forgetting that you're whiffing on 1/4 of your swings, and most of your damage abilities are based off of weapon damage, not DPS (Overpower, Cleave, Whirlwind, Slam).

I've only bought a couple pieces off the AH so far because I haven't had a weapon upgrade since level 12 (I'm closing in on 38 now) and haven't had a single helmet drop...  
---
But I was up to 40gp last night and now I'm down to 12gp after buying cooking recipes and other profession leveling items.
---
i mean the guy said what the fuck are they doing on this server that there's only 200 60s
---
Let's not forget when Black Lotuses were BOP. lol
---
I’d argue, especially right now, a lot of people, while leveling, aren’t there for the drops. Unless you’re saying my meleecleave group need extra Ravagers.
---
That wasn't the comment with the snark, brainchild.
---
I use this macro:
---
`/script DeleteCursorItem();`
---
Click an item and press the macro to delete it with no prompt. Been using it for years. Works in classic too.
---
That’s a good response but they’re still a shitty gym
---
My guild thinks I'm married cus I bailed on a group with the same guy in it 3 times and he messaged me saying you do that alot huh and I was like dude I'm so sorry my wife is really fucking pissed at me for playing so much... then I logged out went to work and came home to my empty house
---
Well, I just was about to switch to the new PF being built in my city... Guess not.

---

---
Fairly certain SS is it, as with many things alliance has big disadvantage on this dungeon.
---
Personally, I wait to roll last after observing how others roll. If people are need rolling to sell, I roll need as well. If let's say boots of avoidance drop, and a plate tank in the group says hey, I need that, I'm going to equip it, then he gets the item. I don't care how you go about getting the item to him, but he gets it. Period. Whether everyone passes, and he hits need, or one or two people hit pass or greed, and his buddy also hits need to prevent a ninja, it doesn't matter. But he gets the item.
---
If that warrior says hey, I don't care that much about these boots I'd rather buy a mount, let's all roll, then of course you should hit need instead of greed.
---
Ok if you don't have kings a piece of gear with 20 AP will be exactly equal to a piece of gear with 10 str, when you get kings the piece of gear with 10 str is now 22 AP and the 20 AP piece is still 20AP. So when evaluating gear for raid as Alliance you measure str as 2.2AP.
---
You're lucky. Heavy leather fluctuates between 50c over vendor price and 1s over vendor price on my server.
---
55 thinking I was going slow. I was very wrong.
---
&gt;give puberting, inebriated or puberting inebriateds the freedom to think of a name themselves... lead to warlocks being exactly not allowed to do this
---
Or, you know, you're subjugating an already existing demon who was likely born/created a long time ago and was just in general going about their life before you decided to summon them and make them your property.
---
But sure, let's go with that.
---
this is probably one of the best rogue elevator/boat pranks so far haha
---
That’s pretty dumb. The deposit cost is obviously small, but the AH cut is significant especially on a 300g item. You’d be better off selling it for less in trade chat than taking an AH cut
---
if that was me I wouldn't even be mad
---
We fucking told you so.
---
Basically what they are saying is if the money is good enough.  They'll do anything.
---
I've done that so many damn times
---
King's Honour, friend :)
---
I love being a Rogue. I know everyone hates me for it, but the satisfaction of being a Rogue outweighs the hate.
---
How are you seeing his buffs?
---
I had to give up questing in Badlands because of this. It was almost as bad as the release starting zone.
---
Holy crap I didnt know that, I'll definitely check that out once Im on again, Thank you!
---
Shadowgems are worth at most 3 silver and sell to vendors for 2.5 silver. Not worth needing on at all.
---
You’re forgetting about troll/ivory raptor.
---
They sure love ganging up on us on Stalagg though. Had horde camping the zf doorway literally all day long today. Couldn't get in at all without dying at least once. They don't deserve fun pvp.
---
Not when everyone agrees to it. It's also been pretty standard for valuable boe items no one "needs" for many years.
---
You perfect son of a bitch!

the notion of a shield made of cloth stretched over a frame of twigs

When I was a kid I played runescape during 2002-2005 and then WoW after and my god I was addicted to both, exactly like Op explains. 
---
Now I’m 28, I’m married with kids and I absolutely love video games but I can’t seem to get feeling back.  It’s not that I want to be addicted in the same way as before but it wouldn’t be a bad thing to have a passion and mediate it (I balance excellently well and understand my duties as a parent and husband) it would be awesome in my spare time to have this passion.  But many times, as you mentioned, with any game at all I’ll pick it up with absolute passion to play, then loose interest after a while.  I’ve gone ahead and in the last 5 years resubbed to old school runescape about 5 occasions and after playing for a day not bothered to log back in.  Wow classic I am enjoying, but I play for about an hour a day then I’m off because I feel tired of playing, next day I do want to play but just for a bit.
---
Yeah I am.
---
Anyway, I don't really care that much. I just needed some catharsis (that I couldn't get because ignored) as I was actually having fun and thought I had a made a new friend.
---
You go get them champ!
---
I saw one listed on the Bloodsail Buccaneers Alliance side AH nearly a week ago. If I remember correctly, they had it listed for 1k gp? I was still in my late teens or early twenties at the time so my gp count was several zeros short of affording it. lol
---
Use your free transfer or stop complaining.
---
How have you got you're movement pad setup? I assume you've got  some overlapping configured?
---
When I tried I couldn't get movement anywhere near as usable as that.
---
no, rofl. any contested zone i see shitloads of grouped horde fuckin up anyone they find
---
Similar price on sulfuras.

As a level 47 warrior, I can't wait to try out Dustwallow!
---
Did he literally pick a lock, or did he choose to play warlock?
---
I don't believe that for a second. Every zone I have been in since duskwood has been a hordefest.
---
Its not standard though. If it was this argument wouldn't come up 10 times a day on here.
---
What are going to be the most beneficial professions for a warrior? In vanilla I was a miner and blacksmith.  I've heard engineering and alchemy is the best choice though. Thoughts?
---
Did you buy any?
---
The one thing that was really nice about leveling 50-60 as ele shaman was how good it was for duelling locks and priests
---
Have a job and school, I manage to get 5-7 hours on a week day and 16 hours on a weekend. Currently 57 with 6 days played. Definitely feeling the burnout coming.
---
Why are three people needing on a Shadowgem?  
---
Is everyone needing on literally everything now? Is that the direction this community is heading in?
---
There are over 12,000 characters over level 5 there. It’s not dead.

You could probably use arcane intellect yourself

TASTUU MY BRADE
---
A lot of people do farm indeed but you can make your mount money by being selective about the abilities you train (i'm 41 mage and haven't trained quite a few abilities) especially later on when start costing 1g+. Just train the ones you really need. 
---
You should vendor most things not put the on AH unless they have a huge value. Actually a lot of people farm for vendor trash not for AH stuff. Gray items often have a huge vendor sale value. Install an addon that tells you the price of items, like ehem, Vendor Price, or even Auctioneer. The later is great to (at least) see what price the item you just got sells for on AH. do a daily scan with it to keep an decently recent database. Seeing the vendor price of a gray item helps you decide which item to destroy if you're out in the field and have full bags. Oh - goes without mentioning that you should loot EVERYTHING
---
You should pretty much always choose the highest vendor value quest reward unless you badly need on of the rewards. Weapons have the highest vendor value and you can sell them to vendors for 1-2 gold at your level
---
Run dungeons frequently - you'll get a lot of vendor trash, vendor greens, the occasional blue BoE you can sell on AH and lots of cloth which will be in high demand for tailors to make bags nowadays or skill up
---
Speaking of cloth, learn first aid. from silk bandage onwards, silk included, creating the bandages makes them worth more at a vendor. A stack of silk cloth vendors for 30 silver. a stack of silk bandages sells for 40 and each bandage requires exactly 1 cloth. so you gain 10 silver for each stack of silk just by making bandages
---
Same goes for cooking. Most of the time (there are exceptions) cooking the food makes it worth almost twice at a vendor. Check a cooking guide on wowhead and see where to get the recipes and what ingredients you need. If you hover them wowhead will show the vendor price. You'll see this way how much profit you can make just by cooking the food. Search the AH for ingredients that would make you a profit by cooking them. Same for the cloth with first aid
---
All those things add up. There are quite a few more ways, including crafting professions, and everybody picks and choose what they like doing, what they're good at doing, what they can afford to do etc as some things can be boring as fuck to do or require too much initial capital
---
Hope this helps
---
I don't feel like my skills cost any more than my warr leveling buddy's. Sometimes his cost a lil more total, some times mine. I don't buy everything though. Still broke AF. I think part of my problem is enchanting - I dont sell any greens unless they're great (leather/mail stam+str or stam+agi etc that I know will sell in AH)
---
We're currently lvl 31. I have 6 gold, he has 9 gold.
---
I went to my PF for about a year, all times of day and night, and never saw that alarm go off. For me, it was a cheap $10/month place i could do cardio and shit with free weights.

Ya tough to understand a convo when he deletes all of his posts lol

Possibly at the WPL flight path.

No, I am horde.

A priest aggro'd from throwing a buff on me. Super weird.

Hey All!
---
So I started playing WoW back with burning crusade.  I recently went back to my parents house to clean out and I noticed the WoW poster I bought at goodwill a few years back.  
---
When I went in I did my usual sweep just to see if anything new or interesting came in.  Generally this included looking through all the electronics, books, and various nicnacs.  
---
I always ended with the paintings, “not that I had ever bought one before but just to see what was there”.  I was about to leave and I noticed a black frame sticking out of the corner behind all of the others, hidden pretty well.  I pushed all of the paintings forward and saw this beauty.  I knew immediately I needed to get it.  
---
Fast forward to today.  I just recently started playing classic with my coworkers and it still has the same feel as when I first started.
---
I wanted to see if anyone knew any information on the poster?  I had read a thread previously that said these came with the original collectors edition of the first vanilla release.
---
Posted this on /r/WoW but I thought it would make more sense to post here :)

You can buy it back from da vendor
---
It its called, "Sticky targeting". There is a little box on it that you check or un-check.
---
Fadeleaf is worthless fwiw.
---
I've tanked everything through RFD so far as Arms with a 2her. Why on earth would I go prot?
---
Holeeeeee shit
---
go back to retail
---
Thank you for such a coherent and helpful response!! I am selective with spells. I've left mind control, inner fire, hex of weakness (troll), and this level I did not train smite or holy fire or fade. I do have Vendor Price and Auctioneer :) I love them both. I only sell mats when I can make double vendor price, and they do sell.... It's just a drop in the bucket.
---
I didn't think of farming grays. I have cooking, fishing, tailoring, and enchanting. I did not pick up first aid because I'm a priest :) I see my issue here... I d/e my quest rewards hahahaha. I haven't spend anything to skill up, but I'm also not vendoring things. I did not realize how big of an impact that had.
---
That helped a ton. Thank you kindly :)

Santa's workshop in the off season
---
Everyone greeds. It’s like any green
---
CRINE
---
I chech this sub several times a day sorted by new and I see it at least twice a day.
---
It's not ok. But hey I have a simple solution to your problem! If everyone needs then you won't have any ninja problems. It's as simple as that. The reason, *the main reason*, that people say to need on expensive BoE's is purely ninja insurance.
---
I have been selective, but it's hard needing healing spells for dungeons and dps spells for questing. I do believe my main problem is tailor/ench. I keep my cloth and greens and gain no cashola.
---
&gt; If I wanted to stack muscle and get jacked
---
i don't understand why people think this is the objective of everyone who goes to a gym that isn't a planet fitness
---
I am aware, but even then the samurai influence is pretty low. The main similarity is their reliance on a 2H blade that’s katana shaped. 
---
But you said they had “a lot” of Japanese influence, which isn’t very accurate. Blademasters? Yes. But that’s about it
---
Uhh, I would maybe need some more variables like is the guy a bad person or why you would want him to be hurt and how much he would be hurt, but I'd probably do it for $20k assuming you have a good reason and the guy is a bad person.
---
(but really I wouldn't because I'm a huge pussy and hate confrontation)
---
But the idea is that yes, you should in theory be rolling need on boe greens too, because everyone can use the money to vendor or de or whatever. 
---
In reality, though, the amount of gold you get from greens don't matter nearly as much - to the point where its not a huge loss if someone ninjas them - you just put them on the "do not invite" list and go on with your life.
---
If someone ninjas a boe twink or epic item, OTOH, you have a huge loss of potential gold - which you can put value on in the form of time spent farming.
---
I get ganged up on by ally all the time when I'm out by myself.  It's just part of the game.  Stop being such a pussy about it.
---
Yeah been finding the horde on benediction are very docile, usually running in fear at the first sign of trouble. The alliance dish it out, and the horde usually just roll over :/
---
The mobs I tank tend to go back to me after bubble. Maybe the tanks just get out-aggroed during the downtime?
---
&gt;Is it always a bitch to lol a warrior.
---
Yes, it is. It's slightly easier if you're buying BoE greens/blues from a richer character, but not a ton.
---
Plus side, they're highly sought after in dungeons to tank, and endgame after a shitload of work they're the best DPS and the only popular tank class.
---
Big effort, big reward.
---
Hi, /u/3kool5you
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d4f9u0/nothing_better_than_being_1_kill_away_from/). 
---
Went in to Classic saying that if they made this change, I'd be done. I really, really hope they didn't do this intentionally, though it certainly looks like they did. I want to keep playing, but if this was intentional it's a huge red flag about the development team's philosophy going forward and all but confirmation they're going to ruin it, and sooner rather than later.
---
I also dont get how they think it only happens for them/thier faction. It's the same for both..
---
I have something that tells me an item's level. It's probably either Vendor Price or Auctioneer
---
He's probably raid spec, but yeah expect to see a lot more inexperienced players in Classic. Most people dont remember how to vanilla
---
You must be joking if you can say dungeon finder created any of that.
---
Recall the sneering at 'welfare epics' ? Or people resistant to the existence of the 0.5 sets?
---
Great community btw ))
---
Every PF I've been to have never hit the lunk alarm.
---
It's more that people keep using Trade as well because they know some people only look there :p But yeah, it's a vicious circle and there isn't really a solution.
---
At least they got it half right!
---
Reminds of something crazy:
---
I (warr tank) was doing SM Cath Spam with 3 mages and a pala heal, the heal went afk for a bit but I was close to dinging so after a few minutes I was like "screw it, we can atleast to that one elite there without a heal". It went smooth as butter.
---
So I pulled the next 2 mobs. Working like a charm, bandaged up, pulled the next...
---
... it goes on and on until I dinged inside the cathedral.
---
You don't need a heal if you're a tank with good gear and have great dps around you it seems ;P
---
Hypnotic Blade from arcanist doan in sm library is pretty good
---
Im not leaving
---
mad cuz bad
---
The post already claims these aren't accurate, and it doesn't feel even at all in-game. Every zone 35+ is filled with Horde. I'm in Gadgetzan right now and it's a sad state.
---
Omg yes this! It's like going in on a lotto ticket with a group and then winning. But the guy who ended up driving there to buy the ticket claimed that he deserves it most and keeps it for himself.
---
Firestones would be a lot neater if they could be traded for sure.
---
What stats are you looking for exactly? Spell damage gear is super rare while leveling (and not super impactful), so any weapon with int/stam or spirit would be fine no?
---
Yeah this brings back all the nostalgia
---
31+ points in arcane is a raid spec? I don't think so.
---
I don't want anything. Haven't claimed to want anything. 
---
I noted where classic started is not where vanilla started. Phases will be introducing some features and content out of order and the balance will not be the same for most of classic because of this. It's all out of order to an extent because it's not an identical recreation of the experience with all patches, hot fixes, and whatnot players at the time experienced during live service. It's supposed to be representative of a vanilla experience. So it's been established, by Blizzard, that it is possible to pick and choose and not need it all at once. 
---
I don't care when paid xfers come - I'm not xfering.
---
My friends never understood why I'd immediately bail when shit was going south in a fight. I grew out of it, but it took awhile.
---
cc lol, give it a few more levels every dungeon will be a complete zergfest and aoe.
---
You literally cannot beat the troll laugh, and riding a raptor.
---
Spy has been in retail wow for a while now. It's not going anywhere.
---
Under city will train swords. Go combat until you get adrenaline rush. Then start putting points into assassination. BE on the lookout for dungeon quests. There are many blue swords that are amazing for lvling all the way up
---
to 60.
---
Yeah but I don't want to tank. I just want smash shit with a big ass hammer.
---
The numbers from vanilla nax are pretty skewed due to the release of BC so soon after nax, most people just lost the will to raid when every piece of gear was going to be invalidated. 10% seems accurate ish, no way of really knowing, but there will be plenty of time to prepare and with not much content after nax its definitley going to be the final goal for many players
---
The same dragon is sitting in Stormwind Keep on US - Thunderfury right now, lol
---
Stranglethorn. Arathi/Hillsbrad.
---
I guess it's the image of other gyms that planet fitness wants its customers to have.
---
No overlaps. On one of the square “pad”  bindings I have set to “mouse” and then “on touch” I have bound to right mouse button. 
---
To be more consistent I also mapped the left “outer edge” joystick to move the cursor to the center and then make the edge radius the maximum so any movement triggers it. Also helps with looting because the mouse move pad acts as a right mouse click if I just press and release. 
---
And then that’s it really. Just play with the size of the square mouse pad.
---
Is there a better quality photo than this? Or even better, the actual tweet?
---
had*
---
Even if he does or doesn't, you definitely take a mental durability loss from that
---
Just look at it
---
YOU ARE GORGEOUS
---
Still the *best* dps in the game so smashing is an option. Do be prepared to be sad about maces/hammers though. They tend to be hilariously tiny for the most part.
---
Ok in that case you were clearly snarky first
---
I'm actually curious about this as well. I would assume, yes, that the majority of the Forsaken are just humans from Lordaeron. Dead humans, but still. However, in WC3 it's pretty clear that a LOT of the undead created by the Scourge are Elves from Silvermoon, and I've never really been able to figure it out: are some of the regular Forsaken Elven in origin? Or is it JUST Sylvanas and her Dark Rangers, along with a few other very key members of the Forsaken? Are the human and elven Forsaken essentially looked at/treated the same or are there cultural/class differences? I've wondered this for a long time, so if anyone could chip in it'd be great! Bonus points for a source!
---
Not while in the dungeon, of course.
---
Outside it, plenty.
---
*laughs in pve*
---
I can only wish
---
Even 2 handed?
---
I too prefer to come in the back entrance.
---
I think you meant to say best side
---
And here is another thing. This community has got to stop throwing the word ninja around when someone needs on a ten gold Boe item that you are going to out level in seven levels. Ninja used to be reserved for pug leaders master looting and dropping group after a multi hundred gold Boe dropped or if thunder fury bindings dropped and looting them to themselves. That's what a ninja is. Stop pretending that someone who needs on a level 32 Boe blue is a ninja.
---
Probably... Time to roll ret pally
---
Well they are the most popular race in Asia by a wide margin.
---
This was not in any way a ninja. That's the fault of all the people who rolled greed. It's a BoE epic. Everyone rolling need on that is standard procedure.
---
Thanks for sharing. I hope you can continue to play. We are all from Dun Morogh 😁
---
It was a ninja in this instances, BUT the way to prevent that from happening is all rolling need on boe epics.
---
If you want a long term investment strategy, there’s lot of level 19/29/39 blue BoEs going up on the AH right now for peanuts - 1-2g a piece. 
---
Once bgs come out and people want to gear their twinks, those blues will skyrocket in value.
---
That doesn’t help your immediate bankroll and it may mean going mountless for a little longer, but it’ll pay off in the long run. The only risk is how long it’ll take for phase 3 to hit.
---
If warrior is good at one thing it's absolutely fucking on priests when leveling. Can stick on em so easily with hamstring and zerker rage.
---
On Thursday night there was a 7k queue when I tried to log in at 6pm EST on Herod. The queue usually doesn't go away completely till around 1am.
---
Damn should of went westfall as alliance instead of mankirk. Idk if its layering or what bit alliance seems dead.
---
BC is the expansion of Vanilla.  Hardly the same as comparing two games built by different companies.
---
We aren't talking about BFA which is 10 degrees removed from Vanilla we were talking about BC.
---
oh that's just shitty. blizz is being a bitch about protecting towns.
---
I'd say orcs are more of Mongol/Viking blend.
---
I was under the impression Flametongue was always inferior.
---
Windfury &gt; Rockbiter &gt; Flametongue
---
Dreamweave vest is another crafted thing that is better than robes of power.
---
Like most mages ive seen they only fight melee when they can root em for 4 years. But the second you counterplay the root with FAP they're actual potatoes.
---
Yeah, under general skills there will be “shoot” with an icon for whatever wand you have attached. Drag the “shoot” icon to an open slot and keybind like just another spell (mines on f1).
---
you could enslave elites in TBC without any issue too.
---
bacisally, you need a huge chunk of agi to get one crit. having stuff like devisaur which gives you flatout ap + 1% crit is better for example
---
I'm not entirely sure if resistances play a role in, duh, resisting spells or just damage reduction, but the undead also had the advantage of having +10 shadow resistance from his racial passive. Makes this even a bigger fail on the mage's part!
---
Right now it's at Medium. Medium is the lowest *any* NA server is right now so it's probably Low at most times. But hey, it's not fucking Herod with hour queues, still. Can't play with friends due to their obstinance.
---
We need to start a WoW kill of the week. I definitely vote this one. Wicked kill broth
---
As a priest i love to mindcontrol people off the boat to stv kek
---
ah I skimmed over that detail! what a bummer
---
It won't get easier. Currently 46 warrior here.
---
This is why I kill every priest in the boat.
---
Hunter hat
---
Yeah almost every mage thats fought me doesn't even attempt to kill casters and when i FAP their roots they fucking blink double ice block so fast.
---
Would I reach 60 faster rerolling a priest or continuing with my level 32 warrior ?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOGCaOhCZvo&amp;t=1253s
---
Thats pretty good
---
In general, sure maybe
---
But... the "Warcraft" in the name of the Twitter account? The extremely obvious clue?
---
It doesn't matter what they know in this specific situation. They're running social media and know how to use google and context clues...
---
Yeah i was a bit worried since i was having a hard time finding groups as a dps at 60. 
---
But it seems that i just have to wait for more people to catch up
---
"Best" is relative here to you.
---
What will you be doing with your warrior?  Will you have an alt who can farm?  Will your warrior have income to buy your mats for your professions?
---
Will you be more endgame and benefit more from the Blacksmithing or do you see yourself more floating around enjoying everything?  Go Engineering in that case.
---
I would never roll Alch on my Warrior unless I knew it might be my only character and even in that case... eh.
---
I usually do everyone rolls. Yes someone has to unlock it, but it's still a party chest. If your party is feeling extra generous, the person who unlocks could get an extra roll or something.
---
What about the your WSQE control though?
---
I'm trying to work out what's going on there as that seems to be what your using to control movements?
---
Someone leveling their anchor toon wouldn't buy it, but they would for an alt/twink they're leveling after.
---
Well cause the tweet is specifically referring to the spell judgement, which is a ranged offensive spell.
---
Lighten up fun police
---
Looking for an add-on that makes the world map translucent/smaller, so it doesn’t take up the full screen, and I can still run (and see what I’m running towards) while I look at the map. 
---
Had something like this back in the day, but can’t remember the name or if it works for classic.
---
Being able to see them from far away at render distance was bad too.
---
&gt; Herod
---
That's interesting cause for me as an Alliance, Herod in STV had been nothing but at least 5+ horde in every popular spot in STV ever. I rarely ever see more than 2 alliance at all. Its only yesterday that I see some alliance parties doing stuff but even then Horde is never far away.
---
Lol. In the plus side, the only people that think this way are new/bad players who don’t understand how items/the economy works.
---
So I think I’ll live if i get blacklisted by them.
---
You are increasing you dps output by gaining mana, no? Otherwise why do it at all. 
---
Stop blaming the healers. As I said. You have one job.
---
Part of it is just that you notice enemy faction players more. Its natural to pay attention to whatever is threatening.
---
These stats feel accurate for OCE: PVP realms are Horde only, PVE realms are alliance only, not sure who they're going to be fighting on the PVP realms though.
---
I'd be SO mad.
---
The refuse of the refuse thinks it owns Lorderon. You aren't the victims of the fall of Lorderon, you monsters are the perpetrators. Twisted and curropted dregs of lost nobility, if left alone you'd destroy the world!
---
Won't get xp though. Battlegrounds didn't award xp in vanilla. I can't remember when they added it. Maybe Cata?
---
“God damn horde”
---
Just fucking play, or reroll. Jesus Christ man.
---
I dont do spellcleave groups because 90% of the time im playing with guildies or friends (who arent spellcleave classes) so i RARELY get mages in my group, as they are mostly all doing spellcleave. I get the occasional warlock though, and i can tell you if hes above my level its tough to keep aggro in an aoe pull thru that hellfire. Gotta use taunt and mocking blow generally.
---
Incendius horde actually has 2 up for 175g right now.
---
It was mostly this subreddit and the forums crying about it. 
---
Like people are already 60 and head to toe in epics and BiS.
---
It’s not a big problem, but it really only takes one piece of shit to start a shitstorm.  If you are worried, just record all your runs, keep your own evidence.
---
How dare you critique someone criticism, on an advice someone criticized?....
---
The issue you'd run into is not having a druid trainer at that starting location.
---
Reroll if you want to
---
Either you have some sort of severe autism, or you're a pathological liar. So I mean.
---
Damn pve servers with no queue time I'm really thinking it's time to reroll
---
Waaah other people want a different gym experience better use this as an opportunity to make myself feel superior.
---
Please stay out of planet fitnesses thanks.
---
Dont have anything to say there were just 68 comments have to do my part.
---
Don't you mean 'zug-zug'
---
Also played since 2006, that's not how it worked on my server.
---
Hah =D My friends were going to play on that realm but after the queue time fiasco we all decided Yojamba FOREVER!
---
I’m confused by this. They have lots of equipment.. how is it the least gym? Because there is no basketball court?
---
I ended up switching to Alliance on Anethron to play with my friend. Rolled a Ret Pally at the end of BC for WotLK. Leveled with my buddy who was also a Ret Pally. It was greasy. We fucked up everyone.
---
Horde on Stalagg here, I honestly don't even understand why people waste their time world pvping in this phase if they aren't 60 yet.  I love PvP, but banging a rando ally out in the wild even 1v1 is pointless and counterproductive to me leveling.  I already feel behind by my own standards (won't be 60 until tomorrow afternoon), so why waste time starting pointless fights?  If there were HK's to be earned, this would be a completely different story.
---
I just /wave and move on with my quest for now.
---
It's a reddit post, not a letter.
---
Your weapon really dictates how much damage you do as a melee class, whereas a caster does damage based on their intellect... which they can get on all pieces of gear. A warrior is “gear dependent” on their weapon.
---
You can check out weapon progression guides so you can be sure to hit quests or dungeons with huge upgrades for your weapon. For example the Whirlwind Axe is a huge power spike for warriors because it’s such a nice weapon.
---
Hope this is understandable I am in no way an expert
---
Nah.
---
lol this whole post got downvoted
---
Then everyone should roll need to ward off a potential ninja then whoever wins can give to the person that wants to equip it. Assuming the winner doesn't want to keep to sell, in this case, the ninja that yall didn't prevent.
---
The gunshot was priceless.
---
That was fucking epic
---
Holy shit, this is great! hahaha
---
today i finished a BRD run with a tank that was hammered. but he could still do his job  incredibly well. cleared BRD and had a great time reading his ramblings 10/10 would do again.
---
You have the shoot skill in general. Put it on the action bar for the key you want to press to shoot
---
Thank you too and you're welcome
---
Yeah, Enchanting is commonly done "wrong". It is an extremely high value profession at higher levels but early on is just a big money sink. or more like a missed opportunity. You should sell the greens to a vendor. Or make a rule about DE-ing greens - anything bellow X silver gets disenchanted, everything above X - vendor.
---
Speaking of which you can make quite a bit of money by making lesser and greater magic wands. Not to sell to people but to vendor. Off the top of my head Greater Magic wands sell to vendor for 15 silver. Check AH for magic essences and buy them if you can make a profit by vendoring magic wands made out of them. I suggest leaving leveling Enchanting for later on when you'll be more established
---
If you're really desperate for gold, there's a repeatable quest in Shadowpray village where for 5 shellfish you get 55 silver. You can make about 8 to 10/11 gold per hour just by opening shellfish traps. But it's boring. Also mobs are level 34-36. This is horde only though but if you're alliance you can still get the shellfish from the traps and sell it at the Neutral AH for less than 55 silver. Horde will definitely buy everything you have.
---
With this quest i made my initial gold to be able to level up my tailoring so that i'll be among the first on the server to craft magewave then runecloth bags and buy felcloth for mooncloth, even though i wasn't high level enough to grind those materials myself
---
Oh, lots of people, me included lol, know where to find particularly useful recipes, patterns, etc that may be inaccessible for some or don't know about it. You buy those from vendors and put them on AH at a premium. For example in shadowpray village a vendor sells the manual for expert cooking for 1gold. You can sell that on AH for more, saving people the trip to desolace or for people that have no idea they can buy it themselves.
---
I corpse jumped my way through felwood to winterspring at level 34 to buy the mooncloth pattern, runecloth bag pattern and another high level enchanting recipe both for me but also to sell at a premium on AH. I died 10-12 times but it was worth it - i made 12ish gold just by reselling something i bought for 3-4 gold or so
---
Perseverance my friend :D
---
The normal quests are, the class quests aren’t.
---
maybe that's why I get so many hunters when starting a group as a tank ^^
---
When boe items like this drops, it's like money dropping. Let's say 250g, a lot for a single item.
---
If a priest gets it, he sells it, makes 250g. If a warlock gets it, he sells it, makes 250g. If a warrior gets it and equips it, he gets 250g and instantly spends it by equipping the item (and removing it from the economy).
---
Why should the warrior get it above anyone else? It's just money. He can farm up 250g elsewhere and buy it like anyone else. He can do another group, win a staff of Jordan and sell that (not very likely, but in theory).
---
It is very literally just gold dropping, and saying need&gt;greed for these expensive, tradeable items a) makes no sense, you just give away gold randomly to someone, and b) makes it really easy to ninja shit (and no, their reputation will not be forever ruined because they ninja'd one thing).
---
Looks like I'm staying the fuck away from Thousand needles tonight.
---
My first sentence didn't really make sense after reading it again now. Basically what I am asking is this; Is the problem that you are able to spot the enemies(Be it through walls, or at long distances), or being able to see the nameplates of the enemies you are fighting? ["Because I assume I think the former..." - now continue with my last post]
---
On retail, but I once rolled for something and my opponent got a 1. I gave it to them.
---
It doesn't, don't know what this guy is about. Maybe he means farm SM for gold and buy the cloth
---
Im actually torn. I love my Warrior,but Undead priest is extremely appealing to me. I will be playing both classes. But I think priest is more in demand on my server there are so many warriors. I just want to know which I would hit 60 with first.
---
Some of them are still doable at least. SM runs are like 20 minutes.
---
Google Arcane Power Frost
---
Am a warrior I want both at max level or atleast have to have engineering
---
It's just a starter gym. Very basic gym rules for noobies. I ain't flamin
---
Do you need your mount right as you hit 40 tho? I feel like people worrying about mount ultimately ends slowing them down. Quests at 40-42 give good money in general.
---
Faerlina.tv was a nice touch
---
3s? That's two goes at ur mum and six at your gran. That's not chump change by any means.
---
Chill
---
Pretty much. Get what you can get in
---
And that right there is the secret to DPS tanking, and why you don't really *need* to invest in Prot until the late game!
---
I'm betting baby reports get him leashed before p3.
---
High quality post!
---
Huh?
---
Ralph pls go
---
This. You can run Hypnotic Blade + Orb of Dar'Orahil (from the quest) well into your 50s before you'll find something that's better
---
I never play warlock but I like these kind of mechanics, they are novel and add to class fantasy. Makes the world feel more alive imo.
---
There are 2.3 million classic players and about 23k level 60s.
---
It's not just pretty good, it's so good that it doesn't get replaced by BiS weapon for Warlocks at 60. Even then the replacement isn't that much better .. like 3sp and 3 int difference.
---
That people exaggerate the difficulty
---
Okay I’m new to WOW, didn’t get onboard when I was younger. Are you a rogue or a hunter? Did you stun/paralyze him? Was he not able to move until you damaged him? Why didn’t the elevator thing take him down frozen in place? Ugh I have a lot to learn, there’s a reason my friends told me this is the best game ever developed. It’s so in-depth!
---
No, that's from Classic. Whenever a player dies from fall damage they explode.
---
If you run Gnomeregan, you can get the Electrocutioner Leg 1h sword from Electrocutioner 6000. 
---
It's fast (1.70 speed) so it's good for tanking, 22.06 DPS with a chance on hit to blast the enemy target for 10-20 Nature Damage.
---
I totally agree.  
---
This has been my argument for a lot of games nowadays.  So many people on forums are so matter of fact about every detail of how exactly you should play everything.  In WoW of course that is talents.  
---
Someone asks “hey I want to do these talents because I think it will be fun, does anyone know if x and y work at the same time?”  and here comes the inevitable snarky response “well I suppose you COULD do that, but that isn’t optimal, no one will group with you, if you want to play that class your role is X so just deal with it.
---
Other games have the same problem.  In LoL, its “omg, trash got THAT as a starting item!??  Report and surrender guys.”
---
Gaming just wasn’t fun anymore because everyone was so intimately focused on “optimal.”  Its. A. GAME.  If you want to play min/max then fine, but don’t be a dick to other people who want to play a bit differently.  The object of the game is to have fun.  Don’t we have enough “optimization” in our work lives?
---
Oof so every time I’m finishing a mob I gotta hit that.. oof
---
You're in the right place but you sound a bit under leveled. You might benefit from visiting the starter zones for another race for a time. You can easily take the tram in SW to IF and do some dwarf/gnome quests closer to your level
---
&gt; Virus &lt;limewire's pet&gt;
---
I see someone is a man of culture
---
Yes, and so feral druid damage just scales worse and worse until classic itemization finally just adds massive amounts of raw attack damage in cat form.
---
Two weeks before Classic released, there were 60 friends and guildies coming back to raid with me. Less than 20 are still playing this weekend. None of us are level 60.
---
&gt; the game changed, not me.
---
Very well put. I've been burned out on WoW for a very, very long time. I kind of figured I just didn't have the patience for this kind of thing anymore. But nope, I have the patience if I'm actually enjoying it.
---
Punctuation is your friend.

I mean, you can respect everyone who goes to the gym and still understand that planet fitness is shit-tier. They aren’t mutually exclusive.
---
Id say str is by far king, but spirit is a close second because pallys can fanagle the spirit mechanic pretty well
---
Wow.   
---
Indeed there is :Facepalm:
---
Time is money, friend.
---
This was just posted yesterday.....
---
Hell no.  Keep that cartoon garbage in 2019 WoW and Overwatch where it belongs.
---
Somewhat true, but keeping your weapon up to date is what will make or break your leveling experience. 
---
A pretty easy rule to go by (for 2h) if your weapon is more than 5 dps lower than your level you should probably start trying to find a new one. This can be hard to do at the early levels but by the late teens treat it as gospel
---
Not for that specific sound.
---
This. Bags are in high demand.
---
A starter gym? This is a finisher gym!
---
I never use the elevators to get down from thunderbluff and now I'm definitely never going to.
---
Reading these comments on this post are awful. Damn
---
"Community btw"
---
I’m glad someone appreciates it
---
You would hit 60 with warrior first.
---
Curious what level you are?
---
I wanna know what job lets you take multiple weeks off
---
&gt;4 other DDs
---
that's DPS to you
---
If you are on a PvP server stamina becomes more valuable.
---
The only health that matters is the very last point. If you can continue cycling through mobs without drinking you are doing good.
---
Warlock in pvp arena had to go demonology,. It wasnt as viable as some might remember.  Couldnt raid demo tho.
---
I just turn my graphics to the lowest for the authentic classic experience.
---
How do you get it to work? I’ve downloaded it twice now but It just doesn’t do anything in classic.
---
Why do so many mages use mana shield vs casters? I see it a shocking amount.
---
Within 2 weeks.
---
This is the exact reason I caved and transferred off Whitemane.
---
Nice
---
I do this shit too. Except I buff and heal my totems instead of NPCs
---
I find the "go to retail" insult pretty funny. I mean it's not even an insult... do people get mad about it?
---
You don’t need to upgrade certain spells tho because some are just like 10-30 extra dmg for 1g
---
Apparently this guy was somewhere nearby when I killed the last raptor in the wetlands raptor quest chain?
---
take engineering and mining.  ore and bars will be selling for premium over the next few months.  forget about BS unless you plan to be an early raider and get some rare/epic plans.
---
Can you link it? If so I’ll delete this.

Go to Stonetalon at night. Its dark

He did everything in there and never checked inbetween. So no clue what actually worked.
---
Census is not really accurate. Need Blizzard to release the proper data.
---
PogChamp
---
What levels are you?
---
My brother did everything in there and didnt check after each thing. No idea what worked but he fixed his.
---
Blizzard hard at work trying to drag this under the rug.
---
Holy shit lol
---
Personally, I have anyone who can unlock it roll. If there's only one rogue/blacksmith in the party, they get full access.
---
But I may be in the minority here.
---
Anyone on Bigglesworth Horde should also beware of a rogue named Popcornsauce. He's been ninjaing shit from a lot of different groups.
---
Can you confirm you have seen him spawn? 50 more resets and nothing.
---

Arms
---
Skeram is more horde than alliance. I wanna say roughly 1:2 ratio?
---
Fuckem honestly. Get in que.
---
Yea same same Imo its the easiest to level with the 2h
---
Yes? You are saying you would pass a staff of Jordan to a mage or edgemaster handguards to a warrior?
---
It's a limited quantity item, so you have to wait for the vendor to restock the item. Someone just happened to buy it before you.
---
You take durability depending on the source of the damage that finishes you off.
---
Big iron gang rise up
---
Join the navy they said
---
Yeah I’m wrong I’m thinking silk. My fault. Silk cloth 20 stack of heavy silk bandies are 80s at the vendor so I do that.
---
I'd say ditch DE but it's probably too late. I took skin/herb and have vendor'd most of the leather(up until thick) and herbs getting me to about 50g at lvl35.
---
Pretty cool. Definitely has value to a collector.
---
Straight grinding
---
That depends, is it now 9:22 and the kids are asleep and you're in desolace grinding away, if so yes..yes i am.  Also you shouldn't have eaten the last oreos, the wife's gonna be pissed.
---
Reminds me of the great Wall of MoP, used to sit in stealth outside the Horde PVP vendors and use my knock back to knock em off the edge haha
---
if you unlearn a profession like alchemy, do you lose the recipes you learned if you later relearn the profession?
---
The virgin prot warrior, the chad arms tank.
---
Nah that was removed in 2.0, players always combust when they die to fall damage.
---
What is that action bar addon called
---
https://youtu.be/IbRXBu1PSPA
---
This helped a lot.
---
They're cheap and offer a great assortment of machines and weights for a beginner or casual. Just because they aren't a gym for super macho weightlifters that can lift 300 lbs and have been going to the gym 6 days a week for the past 10 years doesn't mean they aren't deserving of respect.
---
I love planet fitness. $10/m to keep in shape is pretty nice.
---
Desolace has good faction balance, but the path there (through Stonetalon Mountains) does not. Expect to run into lots of Horde groups in the Charred Vale.
---
Dude! That was intense
---
Yeah I was about to say.. this wouldn’t have happened if he hadn’t of jumped onto the platform
---
Mages with aoe farm and layer abuse, it's pretty doable tbh
---
You’re a bad man
---
Right. I wish i could post your comment over at /r/wickededge
---
On horde side is there a particular starting zone that is best for all races to go to when starting out?
---
Nope, chat works perfectly. Just right click on the tab of chat window and change font size
---
Horde can get a [+25 fishing rod.](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19022/nat-pagles-extreme-angler-fc-5000)
---
and there is also a [+35 fishing arcanite rod](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19970/arcanite-fishing-pole)
---
She's just happy to be here.
---
Is there a limit to this?
---
&gt;fuckin weeab
---
He would make trailers for specific private server patch drops I believe. I have seen his cinematics and they are so ridiculous. How is he able to do this, really though??
---
I mean Herod is in SM - there is no pvp there.
---
you want me to submit a bug report so that you can kill me in crossroads?
---
Upside down?
---
GG
---
Yes, I know. That's not what they said though. They said that each point of strength gives 2.2 AP, not that, each point of strength, when you have BoK, grants an equivalent of 2.2 ap. Semantic, but technically incorrect.
---
Have you actually witnessed the alarm go off? I've been to 3 different PFs over the years and have never seen it go off once, and there were definitely some try-hards in there.
---
This is how you find out that you’re objectively a bad person
---
Yes, run north from Hillsbrad which is a lvl 20-30 zone
---
I don’t think either faction has an advantage. It basically comes down to an individuals skill and available playtime. I’ve seen really skilled players take weeks to level up simply because of lack of game time though. Generally how well you plan ahead and how good you are at playing is the biggest factor I see. Look at the players/guilds who played on private servers for years. They are basically dominant in classic.
---
Let's see who posts this tomorrow....

You can shorten most of this, just fyi. No need for a separate line each time and nostance is an option.

Everyone saying that only a small percentage will clear naxx shouldve just logged into a pserver half a year after naxx release.
---
Done Wailing Caverns yet? Quite a few good upgrades in there for leather classes. Also a bunch of quests (6 total)
---
This brings back recent memories of trying to get too thousand needles. Was ganked about 6 times running though the Barrens. Goooooood times.
---
caps at 1.5 levels so rest assured, you aren't getting a good haul of rested beyond that on return
---
35-45 is where the big pack of players are right now it’s gonna be tough but just keep on pushing
---
&gt; bandages are usually free with your own mats.
---
If you're not leveling First Aid as you level on a warrior you've made a very poor decision.
---
I think I was lucky, because the tauren starting area at launch was super chill compared to orc/troll and UD.  This allowed me to get ahead of the pack pretty early as there was very little fighting for spawns (and I was able to win those fights due to moonfire).  Also I was able to log in immediately and didn't get DC'd, which certainly helped.
---
We're lucky to have anyone with our memey server name, to be honest. I've been loving it though since server launch. Has to have been one of the smoothest realms to play on while still being populated.
---
I don't think I have a high enough rank for him to get the joke.

That nerd got owned in the best way possible.

Oh would you just look at it?
---
I remember in ICC on my Spriest i was in a raid where Nibelung dropped, the first person rolled a 99.  Several other people roll, then I swoop in last with a 100
---
Oceanic server
---
Or it's the image that some other gyms bring upon themselves. I've gone to other gyms with friends. Not every gym is like this, but I have been to quite a few gyms where it's nothing but stacked dude-bro guys who are trying to outlift each other and talk about how jacked they are all day.
---
I mean, I'm glad that these people have a place to go where they're happy and are surrounded by peers who appreciate the same things, but to say that there are plenty of gyms out there that don't breed this culture is pretty naive.
---
That would be ideal, yes.
---
Go back to retail then.
---
I'm aware of this but the unique architecture style of the building atop the turtle reminded me a lot of images I'd seen of Mists of Pandaria's buildings. I thought it would have been pretty interesting if they already had plans for MoP all the way back in 0.0.1
---
Daniass
---
Danm dude, you killed him!
---
Herbs haven't been selling for much for me. Last few levels probably got a couple gold out of them. Which ones start selling for a lot? I think i just got to kingsblood level
---
Would the Orc have lived if he didn't jump?
---
good shit, also love your ui

As /u/Amarger86 mentioned it's on the South-West coast of Swamp of Sorrows near the small Orc camp.

---
After having watched Dragonball Z all day today I read this in Vegeta’s voice for some reason.
---
Damn I normally hate elvui setups but yours isnt so minimalist that its impossible to use like the default
---
I would say Horde has an advantage because of the barrens. It's a very effecient leveling zone where you can chain alot of quests together if you know what you are doing. Alliance is forced to travel around more 10-20.
---
You must be such a huge pussy if you think that was edgy man.
---
Nah, I sent to get milk.
---
Hotline Miami?
---
That's great.  I was worried that everyone who was feeling all happy about things and wanting to just play had already out leveled me -- especially because you have 100% described my polar opposite experience in attempting to run wailing caverns.
---
Maybe it'll be better next time.
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I think you're the one projecting.. they don't care if you breathe my man. That lunk alarm is just for show. I've never talked to anyone, online or offline, that has ever seen it go off. You're being rude and putting down others for their choice of gym because of the image they give off, yet you get offended or defensive when others have a certain image of you or your gym choice in their head.
---
Well at least it wasn't Bev.
---
Im not sure why its hard for you to understand. I just bought my mount after this post and in the last 4 hours i've made 35 gold just farming the pirates in tanaris and vendering their loot.
---
Does the identity/feelings of the podcaster matter if one extracts the idea to discuss? Like let's say Oprah says, "Sugar is making people fat." And then Putin puts out a, "Sugar is making people fat." declaration from the Kremlin- does discussing the idea carry on the message of inclusivity or exclusivity based on its origin?  
---
If the message can be extracted and discussed divorced from the identity of its origin, does the discussion, "evolutionary advantage of humor for males to attract females" still ring as a sexist topic on its own? If so, how- and what about it might be changed to discuss it in a way that doesn't have the same sexism undertones? Can it be discussed at all?
---
I'd subscribe to a channel that broke down PVP like this. I'm on a PVP server and plan on respeccing deep prot when its time to farm preraid BIS so I've been worried I'd just get my ass handed to me, especially as bad as I am at PVP. Seeing a good breakdown of what you might do with the prot kit is very helpful
---
What makes it shit-tier?
---
Thanks man. I’ll let my guild and neighbor guild know. This is what a community is.
---
I understand where ur coming from but from a dps standpoint having to switch manually is a dps loss
---
Feralas should naturally be Horde dominated. Its squished in a bunch of Horde zones.
---
The Hinterlands will likely give you a different picture.
---
lmfao
---
Now that’s just hilarious.  Well played, have an up vote you alliance bastard.
---
I hate Healbot, but I definitely can recommend Clique, although if you want mouseover target then self priority, you'll still need to use a macro in Clique.
---
Hahahahahahah. You dumb.
---
OP typed it once...
---
You questioned it because you are an idiot.
---
Rogue unlocks and takes the money, party roll on everything else. That’s the best compromise I’ve seen on this issue. 
---
If there are multiple rogues or bs that can open it (and the bs wants to use his keys), can roll among them to see who opens and gets the money. 
---
Rogue benefits with a possible skill-up and a few silver, rest of the party benefits from your class utility.
---
GORILLA GEAR!!!! (Strength and Int) It's amazing, it's cheap as heck because only Paladins would use it, so easy to get on the AH, tons of strength allows you to kick ass and tons of int allows you to keep going with a large mana pool and makes DPSing and healing dungeons ezpz!
---
Still if you cant find anyone to PvP in the world you cant fucking rank up. Lmao. Also they have to compete within their bracket with SO many more people. First R14 on stalagg will be alliance. Someone from grizzly probably.
---
Don't ask here, submit a ticket to blizzard.
---
I just want to put in my 2 cents that I have never met anyone, online or offline, who has ever seen that lunk alarm go off.
---
You are absolutely right though, they do have an "anti-meathead" aesthetic
---
Their earlier dungeons allow them to get ahead much easier. Dungeon quests from RFC gives them a nice starter weapon, then they have the ability to go to Wailing Caverns where plenty of blues/ high statted gear drops compared to deadmines, along with the fact that there is incentive of doing multiple WC runs (skinning mobs/gear recipes/bosses actually drop gear.)
---
The barrens is also crazy accessible. You don't run out of quests in the barrens. All horde races can get there with ease. 
---
Travel routes for the horde are much better. Orgrimmar is connected to Trisfal and strangle thorn  and the barrens is central to kalimdor whereas the two previous locations cover the north and south of eastern kingdoms.
---
Try to convince me horde have it harder :D
---
My friend was running to catch me going down this lift and was a half second late and I watched him slowly float past me to his death in game while I choked to death laughing in real life.
---
Cross realm battlegrounds are going to happen.
---
Winnie is a bear.
---
None really up until the high tiers. You're better off vendoring them all or selling them to guildies for vendor prices, they wont sell for much more than that on the AH. Swiftthistle is one of the few low tier herbs that actually will sell well though. 
---
Skinning is the real money maker I've found. Hides sell on the AH for a good price but everything up to Thick can be vendored.
---
What does it matter if you are offended or not? This isn't about hurt feelings. Racism is a huge problem. You go ahead and cosign it. For me that's a hard pass.
---
LOL
---
Lmao dude you either have never gone to PF or you've gone there just to be annoying and get kicked out on purpose to prove a point
---
Herbing and skinning. Haven't trained since 24. Sell everything, even if it only makes me a few extra copper. Now level 39 and with 89 gold. Barely going to make it, but it might be until I'm 50 to get caught up and have actual spending money again.
---
I don't know how I did it way back when.
---
You have 8 or 9 (I actually can't remember now) percent chance to miss bosses on each attack. That is a huge amount of dps loss. So yea until you get hit cap from other sources it's very valuable.
---
Because what's the point of big damage if you cant even hit the target?
---
And when you hit the target, critting reliably is super good.
---
For alliance, in Auberdine, there's a quest for +3 rod.
---
It's a rare sell, just keep checking for the +5 strong

I've been getting blind powder by the truckload out of junkboxes so I just vendor Fadeleaf. I'd be losing money from the posting fee at the AH so screw it.
---
The spot you start in is fine. However, if you want to get to exalted with another race faster you can get more reputation doing the quests at the respective level.
---
Herod is definitely not 1hr queues.  I sat in a 6hr Wednesday night

To all the people I've crit with Ravage from stealth.

I didn't know I could crit for your total health pool. It was funny, not gonna lie felt good too. Lemme try again.
---
Low hp, they're casters so they do basically no dmg to you if you have an interrupt, and they have a very small chance to drop a black whelpling pet
---
Not only the interactions, but you really feel like you came together and overcame an obstacle together.
---
It seems like they've made it impossible to do that now. Whenever I try to MC someone on the boat it tells me they can't be charmed.

Currently level 38
---
what do you expect from an asmongold fanboy that is completely ecstatic that he can be part of his favourite streamers guild, and maybe after gifting him 1k gold asmongold might say OP's name out loud ONCE so that he receives the fame he always wanted!
---
Wait please don't tell me you spent actual gold on the upgrades for overpower and cleave or that you actually bought slam.
---
Just don't plan to roll into an opposing faction town on a PvP server with an enslaved demon because it won't let you do that, either...
---
I was gettin camped in The Hinterlands earlier.  Then I ganked like a dozen or so ally in Tirisfal just now that were looking to run SM.
---
The cycle continues
---
Mages should be able to blink through some of them too.
---
you are a monster. I love it.
---
You can yes, I free transfered five characters.
---
There's just something about it.
---
IMO this is the best it’s gonna be for a little while (lots of revenge ganksquads as people get to 50-60 I imagine), when everyone is trying to just level and get their quests done so the wpvp actually has weight as you try and claim the spot for your faction. 
---
It’s predictably spicy in that you’re not gonna get away with shenanigans for long if you’re on a fairly balanced pop. server.

16. classic first released with 8.
---
Sick em with the pointy end
---
It feels bad to miss on a 5 point eviscerate
---
I wouldn't worry about which you could finish first. Put bluntly, you would knock out 28 levels way faster than 60 regardless of the class. Warrior can be a little slower, but if you enjoy it keep playing. But there isn't a rush, you could start leveling the priest and maybe decide after level 15 or 20. Try not to be objective, just have fun with it during phase 1, it'll be a LONG time before not being max level could affect your gameplay.
---
Have you ever shared in the glory of a Paladin?
---
Horde racials are nice. But when your raid gets wiped by tiny, unkillable exploding Gnomes you start to question the choices you made in life.
---
&gt; You absolutely need some moderation in most internet forums
---
Really? Im so fucking dissapointed, I hate playing the zerg faction.
---
A lot of people agree with you! First thing I did as when I got my Doomguard at 60 was go to Redridge and got some lowbies help me summon. I didn't know Infernals auto-aggrod or I'd have done that. The hordes of lowbies that showed up and tried to re-take their town had me crying with laughter. It's one of my fondest memories of this game. He was eventually taken out by a 60 who was in the World Defence channel but he spilled his share of blood.
---
I've already noticed on Mankrik these last few days things have got really crowded. Especially in the 45+ zones. Not sure if they lowered layering or what but it's been noticeable.
---
&gt; I disagree. It's a forum made to discuss, and it's been proven time and time again that some people will cross lines and be unreasonable themselves in said forum. A reasonable person passionate about "X" topic who likes to browse subreddits on "X" topic can decide to become a moderator to help the place he frequents.
---
That has nothing to do with my comment.
---
I'm so glad I'm not the only one lol
---
Scarlet Monestary
---
Yes. Im a tank, if a tank boe epic drops, I think everyone should roll.
---
Yes but there's also.... servers where alliance outnumber horde, is what I'm trying to say.
---
So...
---
Be engi and bs.
---
I agree with you.  This is just a tier below people who camp quest givers on PvE servers.  Your enjoyment of a game shouldn't depend on taking joy from other players.
---
I’ve seen lots of mages group together. If there’s enough mobs, you’re just killing them even faster.
---
Only thing I can think of is reload the UI with /reload ui
---
If that doesn’t work you’ll have to submit a ticket for a GM
---
I never gank. I'm worried it will put me on a lot of hit-lists and I'll never see the end of it.
---
Granted, I get ganked all the time anyway, but still. It just feels rude, you know?

Fuck you, you human skum

That means a lot my friend. We are ok for now :)

Thats pretty normal.

Between 40-44, I made like 60g.
---
Kurinaxx has been a joy so far as a 39 horde warrior. Seems like an extremely healthy population with the majority being fairly casual and upstanding players on both factions. 
---
Excited for when the honor system releases. I am tired of all the danged AoE spec mages though. Sometimes more knowledge of old content and an evolved meta are a lowkey drain on the overall experience.
---
But my group of friends and are still loving every moment.
---
Zero barbells which encourages people to do compound lifts on a smith machine, increasing risk of injury. Young and uneducated staff (I can only speak for the 6 or so PFs I’ve been to, but it has always been the same) presumably from low wages as a result of cheap membership. Blatant mockery of grunts that are actually extremely helpful during heavy lifts. Mockery of “lunks” carrying a water jug (how horrible!) plastered on the same wall that says JUDGEMENT FREE ZONE.
---
Just imagine how it will look once layering is gone!
---
both charge yearly 200 where I'm at plus 65 a month for basic . and 85 if you wanna use pool etc. like jeez
---
Honest to god this is how you make money before 40.  If you can SPAM Sm you can make a lot of money,  but if you’re more of a solo player go to duskwallow marsh and farm turtles north of theromore.  They have a REALLY good drop rate for trash item but a stack of some of those items are like 50s or so.  I farmed for an hour and got ~10g not including the green drops that are on the AH right now
---
My girlfriend has been doing this every night for like two weeks now haha
---
Every silver is precious
---
Yeah man and I lived to tell the tale lmao. I feel the same way about the post talking about people buying upgrades on the ah that they will just replace in a few levels anyway. I also bought all of the weapon skills too, even polearms lol. Not really concerned about it, just wanted to meantion that i don't buy upgrades on the ah and I am still broke. So the meme would still fit 😋
---
Engineering is definitely not gonna carry you through getting ganked. On the flip side, in Classic the weapons or gear you craft are usually on par with the raids in many cases. But that really depends. Consult a guide first before you dump BS, cause you never know, you might craft sulfaron.
---
Until you're hit capped, hit chance is the absolute best DPS increase over the long run. Just because Misses are unpredictable and almost no abilities have any built in protection against them. You could miss your 5 point Eviscerate, your Power of Mind Pyroblast, or only miss a few melee swings. It can screw you, or it can massively screw you, or not effect you too much for a single fight. It's all luck, but on average, it's still the best possible increase until cap.
---
looks like a horror movie still lol
---
My biggest concern is starting shit with one person always turns into 3 or more. I've had a few back and forth today that have been fun.

You don't even need fishing.

There is tons of great food and raw meat for 1 silver a piece on the AH.

People like you are what made the game terrible in the first place. If I got killed by a random Infernal in a place I don't expect, I'd laugh. The most fun I've ever had in WoW is the pre-wrath zombie apocalypse, but you whiners still complained about your precious normal activities.

Get off of classic.

This was a BoE.  They should have probably all rolled need on it.

Warlocks can make that in any place. How can anybody be against that?
---
Oh it definitely is for sure. Great for squeezing some time in to quest a little any time that I’d normally just be browsing FB/IG/Reddit. 
---
The best thing is that it feels like actually playing and not just entering inputs to perform actions if that makes sense. My movement and spells are basically the same but it’s harder to weave in healing and chatting with other people.

What makes Dwarf Rogue so strong is the free vanish against other rogues, warriors and hunters.

I got ganked by a ?? in Hillsbrad and paid it back five fold to the local lowbies, in convenience on my way to SM (I'm Alliance obv).

Exactly except they choose to grind SM day and night and burn themselves out.

So rekt.

"dark side of classic"? Mate this is just another day on Moonguard.

Nice Quixotic.

You took that out of context.. u one of these sad internet people looking for drama. Get a life dude

Dangit I'm like level 10, I'm not gonna be able to get that.

I just started the game a couple days ago.
---
1) fuck you alliance scum 2) hilarious you crazy diamond
---
You just need OmniCC installed for it to work
---
Shoot, you went hard on Friday.
---
Disarm and fear are very useful tools if you are not already using them. Also Berserker Rage is very useful to ignore/cancel priest/warlocks fears.
---
Another tip is to bleed rogues/druids so they can't stealth away. And always hamstring them and kite if able.
---
But I'm not that great at pvp either, those are just things I do when I PVP. Sometimes you are just screwed, like when getting kited by a frost mage or not getting though priest bubble so you are rage-starved.
---
I think this post is commenting on how the Mages are each only 1 dps apart counting down, basically a 3 way tie. Not that the warrior is doing poorly because of low dps.

If you have a an add on to help with pricing auctions, definitely auction all your leather. The 10-15 silver per stack extra you make adds up if you are selling a lot.

I hated this shit in Vanilla and I'm glad it's gone.

I ganked a mage farming in Arathi Highlands and he just stood there and took it so he could get back to blizzarding orcs or whatever
---
I’m certainly not offended and I’m not sure where you got that idea from. 
---
But yeah, you summed up another huge problem of mine: it’s a gym for beginners that doesn’t encourage good lifting technique or longevity. Smith machines may be safer for beginners, but the transition to barbells needs to be made. I won’t go into the nuances of what’s wrong with a smith machine, but it absolutely does not allow you to practice good form. 
---
If you’re comfortable at a gym that offers the absolute bare minimum for a bare minimum price, more power to you. But fitness is a journey to me, and anyone with a modicum of sense knows PF puts a hard cap on progression.  But why would they, right? That’s not their “target demographic.”
---
Ogres have layers.
---
i actually do more dps if im not oom?
---
Its just reddit dawg lol
---
I almost quit classic around level 8 as all the negatives hit me and I wasn’t sure if nostalgia was going to be enough to continue.  I debated returning to retail but I have developed a pretty strict grind routine to minimize gameplay there.   Once I realized that I was actively trying to play retail as little as possible all the negatives about classic started fading.  
---
Even if I am not as hardcore in classic as I was in vanilla I am enjoying it greatly.  All of the content I have done before a dozen times so there is zero pressure on me to rush.  I can pick if I want to work on a profession that will actually be useful.  I can decide if I want to try hard and maximize the xp grind, or just casually do what I want to do. 
---
My take on classic is that blizz can use this feedback to improve retail.   It’s a wonderful tool to be able to see where the game has gone and what needs to happen to bring some of what has been lost in wow over the years.  
---
While I agree flying killed the game, what’s done is done.  At this point blizzard can’t remove it imo and each expansion they have gotten into the habit of disabling it to force exploration.  Overall I would say that’s fine. 
---
QOL improvements have been ok as well for the most part.  It’s always going to be a challenge to find that perfect spot that’s keeps it challenging and rewarding for try hards while also making it accessible for casuals.  To this end I don’t see an easy solution for abolishing lfr or lfg.   
---
My biggest complaint is the flavor of the class.  Playing a shaman on retail is a hugely different experience than classic.  The totems give a utility to the class that can’t easily be replaced meaning that even if I’m getting out dps’d by the rogue it’s ok because some of his damage is coming from my WF totem.  My heals aren’t priestly but in a bad situation there’s nothing more rewarding than a chain heal that saves the group.  
---
And this is where retail has failed imo.  Ability pruning has gotten to the point where all classes basically feel the same.   Sure it makes it easier for blizzard to balance the game but it also means all my melee classes feel the exact same.  And casters feel the same.  And healers feel the same.  The game has devolved into what archetype you want to play, and I honestly don’t feel like there is any point in adding new classes until the issue gets addressed in some way.
---
Oh man i am a lvl 45 priest went to help some guildies in RFK decided to fly to 1k needles and walk. Got up the lift saw a gray lvl alliance so i got flash backs of being mind controlled to my death. So i MC this ally off the lift in excitement. HAHA HOW DOES IT FEEEEEEL.
---
10/10 WOULD CLASSIC AGAIN.
---
Heeey you play on stalagg
---
Idk why im dieing at this comment
---
RP isn't for everyone.
---
Oh man cooking is free as fuck. Just buy single recipes while fishing. I went from 5 to 150 fishing and cooking last night in like 3 hours all for free. Once i hit 35 I'm gonna max both and it'll be super cheap.
---
Congrats!
---
You could probably auction that off on reddit during this hype and get a decent amount
---
Master loot in a dungeon is pretty weird I would of likely asked you to change it when I realised and left the group if you refused, what I wouldn’t do however is flip out and throw a fit, because thankfully I’m not mentally ill.

&gt;disagree with same-faction griefing

But when you pvp you can ball out in t2. Looking cool is half the battle.
---
You really are missing the point mate. I get the little bit you are doing though. Very funny haha.
---
So...you're upset specifically because you can't use it to grief lowbies, particularly in your own faction? Do I understand that right?
---
No he did not. I remember this post clearly and he did indeed type it at least 3 to 4 times. Thus my comment.

Stop responding to me days later on a deleted thread where you assumed something and were wrong. I don't have the time or want to entertain this level of autism.

username checks out.

thanks for providing an example whats wrong in the world. capitalism. me me me money money money

You're proving my point regarding dps honestly not understanding their simplistic role.
---
Im almost revered with IF and Darnassus they're both within 500 rep. Ive been pretty good with it. Only gonna need like 450 turn ins.... As a warrior..... Well looks like im never getting it.
---
Alliance on rattlegore ganking in hillsbrad?
---
There is not one that I know if. And TBH, sounds very niche, so unless you had a dev buddy or you yourself whip one up. You might be out of luck.
---
Take my upvote
---
I play on a pvp server.
---
I tried to MC a horde 25 levels below me in ashenvale so I could buff him, and I got the "Target cannot be charmed" error.  Maybe it's just players a certain number of levels under you?
---
In vanilla, quests that are tracked get auto un-tracked if an item or something hasn’t dropped in a while. It’s possible the add on just uses the default.

Flametongue is better with a fast weapon, like a dagger.

Sick watch

And the thing is that guywill remember you and may see you again someday to get revenge!  On Bigglesworth... alliance warrior named Rend I will kill every time I see him.
---
Cat.
---
What addon is that for the interface/UI?
---
I loved the start of wrath and honestly, redoing Naxx was a good choice IMO.. almost nobody got to run it at 60 so it was cool to see such a well designed raid get more exposure.
---
But the way things started going with dailies and all that fun stuff... yeah it was where it all started to go wrong. I want them to re-release the expansions until Wrath and then move on to something new, forget cata and all that came after.
---
This is a cash grab from blizzard
---
Yeah STV Tigers are pretty decent money, and not hard to kill.
---
For the lore? This is definitely NOT a mistake; however Blizz doesn't smack you upside the face with lore in Classic the way it does in later expansions. Classic is a bit more subtle, and it assumes that you played the original RTS games. 
---
But.
---
Once you get high enough level that you don't have to worry about respawns and pats, then spend some time in the Scarlet Monestary Library. The amount of lore books in there is incredible. Read them. A lot of people (Chris Metzen) spent a lot of time writing that lore.
---
Personally, I can't recommend retail, but that's just me. If nothing else, just play the starter edition of retail. This only allows you to level up to 20, but if you have a couple gold, which is easy AsF in retail starter accounts, you can catch the boat to Borean Tundra or the Zeppelin to Howling Fjord, from which you can take the sky taxi to Dalaran and read all the books in the Dalaran library. 
---
 Do this. 
---
Is it gaming? Idk. It's reading. But there's a SHIT TON of lore in the game if you know where to look.
---
If you roll a human in Vanilla/Classic, Anduin Wrynn is the boy King. But how is this possible if his father Varian Wrynn is still the High King of the Alliance up to the beginning of Legion? Play through Classic and do The Missing Diplomat quest chain to find out! I didn't play through that chain until Wrath, and it just kind of dead-ended, because spoilers. But yeah. Play through that chain in Classic, and it actually leads you somewhere pretty epic. 
---
The game is definitely a bit hard if you try to do it solo, so DON'T TRY TO PLAY IT SOLO. It's an MMO, and it's meant to be played in groups. Group up. Make friends. 
---
And read all the books.
---
*i did not have sexual relations with that woman*
---
I'm loving the original graphics classic, running it since level 1, looks just like I remember.
---
Finding a good place to grind is probably even better than trying to do quests. Most quest mobs are so farmed out
---
It seems your Horde from your flair, but for any alliance checking in, there's a +20 fishing pole you can get in Deolace: https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6367/big-iron-fishing-pole. There'll be hordes there though.
---
Yes.
---
It has the same effect but only for shadow spells, it’s quite simple.
---
Would you roll need on a BoP blue? It's still worth money.
---
Your logic fails to check out.
---
I don't believe the +35 rod is in yet. No fishing extravaganza until a later phase.
---
People are asking a few questions and making interesting comments:
---
No, this is not a PvP server.
---
No, there were no other cloth users in the group.
---
No, he did not rank his life tap above 1.
---
Yes, he was this adorable the whole way through.
---
and why is it different on 100g+ items? i also want to equip them
---
&gt;  winner doesn't want to keep to sell, in this case, the ninja that yall didn't prevent.
---
Nah, ignore, kick, and blacklist these players.
---
It’s a ninja because he was the last to roll knowing everyone rolled greed. And they were stupid to roll greed knowing people are scumbags.
---
Two things can be true at once
---
if you want to do dungeons then tank for sure. You dont necessarily need to spec into prot until the high level dungeons, having a decent one hand + shield is more important.
---
Lol, appreciate.
---
Nah, that's legit the screenshot I had. didn't expand the chatbox.  
---
And the difference between saying "Comedy is for getting laid" and "humor is a male trait" is the crux of the issue. (as it relates to just gkicking someone) Never even heard about something like that.
---
They have a difference of 1 spell damage for a swap in balance of spirit vs Int.  Unless you’re wearing this as a Priest or a Resto Druid, I think Robes of Power is still a better choice.

this post is super yikes

High pop vs Low pop when picking a realm? Or more specifically, Heartseeker vs Pagel?

AoE mage grinding is the fastest levelling in the game if you can find empty grind spots.
---
I do though, remember plenty of big moments on rolls. I remember a lot though to be fair.
---
Unless you are a fan of being subpar at everything. Coming from a guy that mained Druid in vanilla, there are better classes to choose from
---
What a shitty attempt at trying to answer his question.

Are you a fucking retard?

They'll be cleared the night they come out. Pretty sure about that.

thank you for seeing the flaw and calling people out on it

Your kinda of post reinforces my impression that you are a salty tank. I posted the picture because I was shocked that the 3 mages were all 1 damage apart.
---
It's the only way
---
that's not even that great of an org shot, once layering is gone it will be much more crowded (and you can go look at some light's hope/warmane org shots that are way fuller) but it's still a lot better than retail

Of course kirtonos is massively horde populated. Feels that way too and the gap is only gonna get bigger unfortunately. Wonder if they got free server transfers.

Also I dont understand weapon skill, being a human level 36, currently my weapon skill for swords shows 185(+5)/185. Does it count as 190/185 which doesnt work, or is it basically a 195?.

Ty god im 60 and not in STV right now.

What is it with rogues and being annoying shits lol.

Don't be greedy fuck and reduce everything in the game into it's gold value.

 This late it’s more annoying to aoe then efficient. Spots are crowded and everyone is a mage.

That's nothing. Just wait until you're raiding stormwind and a pally buffs bolvar with kings!

My wife and I have tons that we level together.. She is a skinner, I have the loot option set to free for all, if I go and loot a beast that has zero loot and close the loot window, she is unable to skin said beast.
---
I've tried a number of things to fix this. The only way I have found to allow her to skin a beast with no loot, I open loot window with auto looting off, if there is no loot she has to come by and open the loot window on that mob while mine is still open, then she is able to skin.
---
Do u mean no
---
You're just bad. And by the way, most classes lose when someone gets the drop on you in classic. That's just how it is.

Also every quest that has a weapon do it. They vendor for like north of 50 silver.

That’s what I was wondering. It’s an hour
---
Highly recommend becoming a glorious chad arms tank.
---
Vanilla dungeon mobs don't hit that hard. A bit of stamina gear and keeping up to date on your armor will give you enough defensive staying power, especially while in defensive stance, to hold your ground.
---
Don't bother with sword/shield or DW while leveling, it's more trouble than it's worth. DW is rough due to miss chance when you don't have good to-hit boosting gear, and sword/shield makes you do too little damage while boosting survivability too little.
---
2H all the way, baby.
---
Go arms tree. Your key talents are gonna be improved rend, tactical mastery, improved overpower and sweeping strikes. They're the ones that bring home the bacon.
---
Start combat by applying rend, then either sunder armor it a few times or heroic strike if you've got the rage.
---
For tanking, rend and sunder will be how you make most of your aggro for a good while. Later you'll be sweeping strike cleave whirlwinding for glorious damage and aggro, but baby steps. Be in defensive stance to boost aggro generation, and only leave it to cleave or heroic strike. Tactical mastery is the key here, since it lets you hang on to 25 rage when stance dancing.
---
Use bloodrage on cooldown. Trust me. As you get higher level, the damage becomes negligable and the rage gen stays just great.
---
As for sword/mace/axe, it comes down a lot to race. Orcs are gonna love axes, humans do well with sword or mace. You'll probably end up using all three over the course of 60 levels, though.
---
Every mage who ice blocks against me just has me shrug and go back in to stealth.
---
The one you need is part of a chain, which van be completed at the Crossroads in Barrens. A tauren named Runetotem something gives you a quest to check the 3 oasis etc. Do those and you'll get a quest for WC that gives a nice blue sword!
---
Let's get an f in the chat bois. 
---
**First** - If I were to gank someone and they level up mid gank, I vanish + sprint out of there. there are forces we are not meant dealing with.
---
**second** - to all people complaining about ganking 10 levels below you, fighting mobs, low on mana...
---
That's pvp server. if you want to have it fair, invite them for a duel.
---
As a Rogue sometimes I stalk my prey for 10 minutes waiting on them to be low on resources, especially if they are high levels, but it's also nice 1hko the occasional lowbie.
---
But we apparently all need gold. The logical extension of the all need on boe epics is to actually all need on everything. As gold is apparently the most important thing.
---
Back in the old days not many people knew how OP mages were
---
It could be panic. Sometimes it happens that when you are panicking you use all your defensive abilities without even realizing they are useless. Like dwarves stoneforming vs casters etc.
---
It suddenly makes sense way my mage bro always had sweet gear.
---
Yeaaaaaah that was a joke..
---
Look at the bones!
---
sounds like a nightmare.. remake!
---
Is there some kind of addon that tells you how many of the specific mob you're target you need to kill to level up?
---
Ex targeting a mob that gives 50 exp and i need 500 to level up, therefore mobs remaining: 10

The idea of if you don’t fuck people over they will fuck you over is starting to set back in. Not sure where the notion that every player was this honorable person came from. Vanilla was some cutthroat shit atleast Korgath ally was.

This is everything
---
&gt; I just hit 44 on my mage last night and I have yet to do a spell cleave dungeon and I do not plan on it either
---
I recommend doing it at least a few times, ideally with a group that's not too high level. It is fun figuring it out. I also recommend doing a bit of AoE grinding. You will die a lot and learn a lot about playing mage.
---
They see gibberish compared to what you want to type, but because it's a fixed translation you can say a few things. People will spam it in macros so they can talk to the opposite side.
---
Azeroth is finite, its loots are finite, so I proposed a solution...
---
Then roll need on everything boe and bop alike. Why would you can that someone else would use that bop wand or staff, it's worth gold to you that you can put towards you devilsaur set.
---
&gt; since usage determines definition.
---
Not disagreeing with this being how it is now, but this is so ass-backwards to me. Morons who don't know the actual definitions of words shouldn't be the ones deciding what words mean just because they incorrectly use them a lot.

Ok thx , i also found a guide  that mostly take arms but take a couple things inside fury at the same time.I think i will play 2h while leveling and if i go dungeons since my role is not to do dps ill have a shield and 1h swap and then go back to 2h.

44 Pagle - Normal. Unfortunately I didn't choose a PvP server this time around. Just didn't wanna deal with the ganks early on.

Agi is 50ish per crit for hunters, so while getting that much agi on gear would be preffereable, its almost impossible to find perfect gear with the current stat allowances on gear without looking for %crit/hit and +ap

I'm a casual, I'll take about 4-6 months hitting 60. I'll get there and never enter an entire raid, I promise you. A lot of people are like me

Wand slot is seperate from your stave, so you should use both. Wanding things to death is more of a priest thing, but it's good for a last restort, or to finish something off without using any mana.
---
Dude I fucking remember this vividly. I remember being one of the lowbies terrorized by internals in towns. It was awesome and definitely added a sense of danger and wonder to my experience. I hope they fix this.

Thank you very much for this concise yet detailed warrior synopsis. Really helps!!

I just did this quest the other day and had a similar experience. My group died the first time trying on our own. When we got back, another group was just about to start. We coordinated so that they tagged one dragon while we tagged they other, then waited for the respawn and tagged the opposites. I have to say the impromptu group coordination felt pretty epic for us as well! but no cool selfie to commemorate the victory here :(

And notice how they don't have a comeback for this.

Deep inside I want that Blizz dev who said the infamous phrase, to come on stage on WoW panel in this year’s Blizzcon and just be honest to the whole world just for a minute.

I mean I don't have a problem with Asmongold personally, nor do I have a problem with his fans wanting a sense of community from a game. That being said, I'm still going to make fun of them and gank them whenever possible.

I just got off work and logged on to Whitemane...2k queue at 11pm PST. I understand why you did it.

That was my point :)
---
I think it was a late vanilla patch or tbc when you got exp for turning in victory tokens. I (think I) remember getting exp this way and I quit before wotlk.
---
The answer is level with either arms / fury. Don’t level with prot, you’ll want to do as much dps as possible while leveling even with a hunter with you.
---
Haha must be nice. I'm a priest, so it's all bubbling and single killing while drinking after each kill for me.
---
Well it started with me wondering why people try to run when they're snared and the enemy isn't snared. Then the guy tried to defend himself in a strange way.

Is it really "stacked against [him]" if he isn't fighting back for the majority of the video and then finally decides he wants to fight and wins?

Prot warriors tend to do PRETTY WELL against other warriors.
---
But I don't need to farm good if a BOE drops. He can go farm gold too and buy it from the AH.
---
Boots and chest. Your eternal soul was not worth the trade man.
---
Personally, I feel that needing on any trade goods is kind of a douche thing to do, even if you can use it, because you're (albeit indirectly) needing on it for the money.
---
Dont be a weirdo man. 
---
Or if you want to go complete idiot mode join a guild that caters to your special brand of weird.
---
You absolutely cannot take frostbite if you intend to do AoE pulls as it will randomly root foes whereas keeping the enemies bunched up is key for survival when doing AoE.
---
Drop that and take improved CoC instead. That’s useful for PvP and you can also use it when doing AoE - once you’ve already got them on low health from blizzards, use nova and CoC for huge burst to finish them off.
---
Wtfff hahaha
---
Oh that would definitely be the issue I think! I always feel compelled to use it since I feel like I’m not doing enough between auto shot and my pet attacking
---
I’m a warrior that makes my own gear. I also don’t roll on anything else. I’ll need on gems all day long.
---
This makes me sick
---
bEcuz iTz eAsIer oN My pHoNe!
---
Hahaha okay champ, you go right on believing that.  And definitely come complain about your experiences on Reddit when someone "ninjas" a BoE in one of your groups because you're the only one too stupid to need on it; I love reading these whiny salt posts.
---
Stick with Arms and if you wanna tank, spec into protection at around level 55 at the earliest or 58 if you'd like to wait.
---
A prot focused build is gonna look something like this:

---
And PvP is smooth for you?
---
It's an hour. I think it was all the way up until Cataclysm, when guild perks were introduced and it made it so guild members would all be able to send mail to each other instantly. They later changed it so all your characters could send mail to one another instantly as well.
---
I need on all rare/epic BOE’s “champ” but I’m not so deluded to think I didn’t ninja those who roll greed.
---
Amen brother.
---
Mechanic wise maybe, but I would take variety. TBC has a ton of unique raids. Wotlk just cannot compete.
---
In dungeons your pet and your auto shot will be doing most of your damage. Save your mana for healing your pet, needing to feign death, or for conc shot that running mob. If you use a dps meter take a look at what is doing most of your damage. Sure, arcane shot does damage, but a good hunter will be saving mana and using frost trap to CC. You should still be using arcane shot, just not as often. Hope this helps!
---
That’s not consistent with my experience. Alliance group-gank and corpse camp anything in sight making certain quests in high population areas impossible for horde to even complete.
---
I wouldn’t be upset over this. Everyone should roll need if they intend to AH. If you roll lower than someone who really needs and will equip on the spot, they should be given the item or sold to at vendor price.
---
nice boyish wrists, you a bottom?
---
As a warrior, I need all the scrolls I can get
---
What’s your favorite lubricant?

Fullproof. Lol.
---
Take a look at this rank 14
---
Can you take me higher, To a tank where blind men see.
---
Eww zygote item score
---
Eh no he wasnt. Trying to save terrible comments with "eh was joke!" just doesnt work.
---
I prefer meateater podcast or tinfoil hat
---
yes but Im confused by the + numbers which come from the talent, why are they on the right side? **1(+1)/1**. If **1** is my maximum skill, then it doesnt matter even if it says 1(+100)/1. Shouldnt be on the other side? Like 185/185(+5).
---
&gt; The racials lend themselves to that.
---
While true, I'd wager it's much more psychological than anything. Newer players and people who aren't interested in the bloodthirsty PvP aspect of the MMO and just want a nice friendly game are more likely to pick the more aesthetically pleasing and relatable Alliance side in my experience.
---
I listen to Startalk
---
you may want to calm down bud
---
Thank you for the explanation bro!
---
after 40 quests give so much more Gold
---
I solve this conundrum by not ganking and being a mage, so I still win when someone ganks me.
---
Ahh yes, you need to do a front flip to get out of that trap.
---
Laughs in European
---
I never thought I could see thunder bluff, undercity and so many camps in Barrens, hillsbrad, thousand needless etc..... So alive! Wow.
---
Detachment is probably the most accurate and biggest issue. In classic, sometimes it's an endeavour of your party just to get to the dungeon, so by the time you're there you are ready to melt stuff with your 4 new buddies
---
Thorns is a form of direct damage, stat buffs are damage increases through passive attribute increases, they aren’t the same thing. Blessing of Might does not show up as a tagged damage source on meters unlike thorns, ret aura, and imp fire shield.
---
WoW classic.

A spec for leveling: [https://www.bobo-talents.com/?c=warrior&amp;t=qfrqrryKyLqlryrzrArBqmqisYyMyNp-rIrJrKrLqjrDrZr0r1r2yOslsxsHySyTqCsyszsAsB](https://www.bobo-talents.com/?c=warrior&amp;t=qfrqrryKyLqlryrzrArBqmqisYyMyNp-rIrJrKrLqjrDrZr0r1r2yOslsxsHySyTqCsyszsAsB)
---
Drop blacksmithing for now and take skinning, learn it at 60 if you want. Get the level 40 mount.
---
Warriors will switch weapons while leveling depending on what drops, then use the WW quest axe (or the SM quest axe for alliance) somewhere around level 30-37 depending on if they can get help with it, then switch again if they get a better drop. You can use axe spec in arms while leveling right about when you get WW axe.

---
Throw on a shield in instances, use prot stance, and sunder for threat.
---
Don’t bother trying to AoE grind. You’re not ahead of the level curve so everywhere will be full even at odd times of day.
---
I would recommend just questing and saving you AoE talents for when the opportunity presents. I find that if I can pull at least 4 mobs at once, it’s faster to AoE them than frostbolt shatter them so it still does come in handy from time to time.
---
Besides that, I use AoE for spellcleaving dungeons. ZF is very good for that. A tank can mount, pull tonnes of mobs then los them round a corner for mages to chain novas and blizzards for crazy exp.
---
Where is my alliance Benediction gang at
---
As a warrior main I've always hated them. Just it only kept increasing since pve they were at one point top dps for being arcane with a simple rotation. And then frost mages...well I'm not gonna start
---
I like shit like this, I sometimes get angry when I'm the ''victim'' but it's fun. It's random... It's vanilla. 
---
Like priests MCing me off the boat etc. yesterday. Happened to me twice but now writing this I think it's funny
---
Omae wa mo shindeiru
---
Nani?
---
So, yesterday, we hat a run in Blackrock Depths. I searched for a group advertising for first half and invited players that were lvl52-53. I thought like „Yeah let’s kill some bosses and see how far we get!“
---
We, that was a prot warrior (me), a resto shaman, a hunter, a mage, a rogue. Except some hiccups and bad plays from the mage, it was a very good run!
---
We ...
---
-	protected the orc in his cell
---
-	cleared all of first half
---
-	after vault, darkvire, incendius...
---
-	cleared all (!) dwarf packs 
---
-	completed baelgar q for +2 hit shoulders 
---
-	angerforge? down!
---
-	golem lord? down!
---
-	dwarf inn? all 3 down!
---
-	flamelash? yup, down!
---
-	7 dwarves? down, omg!
---
we wiped in the lyceum because 2 players didn’t know the room and stopped moving, but overall it was a glorious run! :)

Nothing like falling and charging into something to save your life. Always a rush. That and like 1v4ing something. Using blade dance(?) And barely surviving.
---
Thunderbluff is my home. I always hearthstone back there when I'm logging out for the night even if I'm doing quest in the Eastern Kingdoms. Thunderbluff will always be my hearthstone location. 
---
I started laying down in the hammock in the inn before I log out also. I tried lying down in the coffin once, but they don't make troll size coffins.
---
Mirage Raceway doesn't feel as alliance heavy as this suggests. In STV atm and feels pretty equal.
---
Sorry to be so late replying but they had a quick patch.  It's back to 20y lol.
---
Retaliation lol. 30 minute cool down for a couple seconds of guaranteed crits. It was amazing. And most of the time dying mid cooldown
---
Just because everybody speeds doesn’t make it right. Let’s say somebody is speeding and crashes into somebody else going the speed limit. Perhaps the accident might have been avoided if the victim was going faster. Do you blame the victim? 
---
&gt; what will I do? 
---
Continue lying to yourself.
---
Yes. Just create your guild in such a way that a always offline level 1 is the GM and the next rank down is the “co-owner” rank. Either person or a third party can control the level 1.
---
Let me dumb it down for you. 
---
If you don't pull aggro. You don't die. Simple stuff.
---
What level cooking do you need for jungle stew I have like a whole bag of tiger meat lol
---
Yes check this thread somewhere,  I posted the link but im on mobile now and don't have it. Bg's
---
Will be like they were later on in vanilla, cross server battlegroups.
---
This is an example of the SPELL CLEAVE mage who only leveled through SM and ZF.  Love to see it.
---
You can also use WoWPro which just tells you what to do to level
---
Yeah this game truly shines with high res/fps.  Every once in a while I look at the screen and think "this is a 2004 game looking this nice!"
---
146%
---
You could make a rank that has all the privileges in Guild Control, but two people can’t share the top rank of “Guild Master” (or whatever it gets named).
---
Is it a big pain in the ass? idk man BM got really boring even with bestial wrath
---
I heard from friends it feels better. Of course, Stalagg apparently has the worst A:H ratio of any server according to wowhead so anything will feel better.i checked at 730 the other day and they only had 25 60s online on alliance, though, and that was enough for me to not transfer.
---
Buffs also generate threat
---
Yer which ones.
---
I straight up rerolled to a quality server. Worth it.
---
Omfg that explains why I keep seeing random ass low level ally running into WPL every now and then lmao.
---
Yes, that's what I'm saying. You're also under the assumption the person who by your definition actually needs the item isn't gonna turn around and put it on the AH

Have you ever walked the barrens not to mention horrible drop rates for quest items  there.
---
Have you visited IF yet?   That joint was the lag capital of WoW.   😂
---
What is your rep with Everlook? I believe they don't help you if you aren't at least friendly.
---
Thanks! So the "stance dance" is normal? For some reason I thought when tankingn i should always be in defensive. But I'm spec'd fury, so I have the trait to retain rage when switching. Which made me realize I can swap back and forth. I just wasnt sure if that was normal.
---
True though
---
In 2004 I played as a healer priest. I have been playing a healer priest again but I want to try something new, either a Warlock or Warrior. What should I play?
---
Ah yes, the classic "No u"
---
😂
---
You aren't supposed to be able to kill hundreds of mins without a break lol
---
Well played sir.  😂
---
It’s not fuck you got mine mentality at all as I wouldn’t  wanna roll need on a Boe if someone else needed it either. It’s just a different and safer way of playing if everybody needs to nobody ninjas but the problem with that is if someone is actually gonna equip it to use I’d rather them get the item whether it’s me or someone else.
---
Ain't no one crying but another UD male mage with absolutely no concept of how to play the bar-none strongest class in the game.

Im gonna twink a 39 war or pala eventually

Fortunately for me druids are peaceful creatures that hug trees all day.

True.  Every generation has its "thing".

Yeah god forbid some hilarious hijinks like this were to happen
---
We got wiped by a few 60s shortly after lol 😂
---
They get the mount skill when they get the class mount
---
Hit 20 on my shaman last night.  Used a scroll.  Buffed the fail troll.  
---
Didn't need it, fortunately.  22 normal.  The shamblers in Silverpine were worse than that.
---
Jesus, there were over a thousand 60's on Stalagg tonight.
---
Guess that's that.
---
There is.  And it works well.  Sometimes though you get some real trash talk in general but there isn't much that can be done.  I usually have general chat off on my son's account.  He doesn't need it anyways.
---
Yeah a pala team can do it 
---
At 20ish there is no true role difference so they can cover whatever with the right gear
---
And the bubbles and stuns make up for a lack of taunt
---
Ithought the exact same about WotLK! Except instead of ugly I would say it was incredibly bland and flavourless.
---
Outside of those two raids mind, they were fantastic.
---
I though its called end game content
---
My guess is they will “fix” this once there are more higher level characters. Because 3 warlocks could shut down the use of the auction house for a while with how low level some people are right now. 
---
Is it annoying right now and not like retail classic? 
---
Yes. 
---
Do I think that they’re doing it this way because it’s something that would/could ruin some people’s night after waiting 3 hours in a que to check auctions? 
---
Yes
---
I’d say give it a few more weeks and then they’ll take off the training wheels...
---
It takes a bit more thought. BM seems pretty faceroll but with MM i have to at least think about when to use aimed shot over arcane shot and weather or not serpent sting is going to be worth the mana cost. Scatter shot is pretty nice to have as well when a situation gets a little hairy. The crit damage is nice to, though i can often pull off tanks at the begining of a fight with a fat aimed shot crit. I think you end up using more mana but i offset the cost by not buying any food for myself and just giving it to my pet lol.
---
Your maximum skill is still 185.  The +5 is boosting your actual skill above the maximum. Makes perfect sense to be on the left side.
---
Watching Bob Ross on twitch
---
Oh I'll definitely give it a try.  I played Destiny and raided alot ( not the perfect comparison ) and it always felt good taking down the baddies.
---
I wasn't trying to knock wow raids.  I wouldn't be able to do so until trying them.  But hopefully rewards are handle well with whatever guild I settle into.
---
Just like you wouldn't hit harder without stat buffs. Im confused here are you a shitty druid lock or paly tryin to pad your numbers here? Calling out thorns like buffs but giving a blanket argument of how all buffs work doesnt help your case. In actuality people do understand the value of your buffs, they love having them, but you dont get bonus dps numbers because you have a no effort buff you can throw on people. If your dps is bad just look up a guide and work harder.
---
For Holy as well, though?
---
That's my end game, since I won't be raiding.
---
Meaning a month at least
---
Some AH goblin gonna pay a lot for it
---
How are you gonna take the piss out of people when you substitute having a girlfriend with a spinx cat? I'm done lmao
---
It is not the only one, check Icy Veins for some decent builds for levelling.
---
Best? Its the fastest mage levelling.
---
If you do want to AOE grind though, then yes, respec. Frostbite won't proc on every mob if using a blizzard which will cause them to spread out, this is something you try to avoid when AOE grinding.
---
Trying not to.
---
Or people gonna think u dumb for wasting such gold
---
Tell me which one you did
---
I wish Jim Carrey didn't age

It absorbs all damage starting in either TBC or WoTLK, so either it's an old habit, they're 13 years old and don't know any better and haven't bothered to check, or they're retail bois.
---
It’s been many moons since I last heard this. The nostalgia is real.
---
This. Ladder paladins were just better priests due to how powerful Holy Light was. Sometimes they were also movable barricades thanks to the bubble.
---
World of Warcraft replicates these roles really well.

---
Thanks.  I hate it.
---
That was beautiful!
---
I thought you were saying people were willing to pay that much money for the in-game bird LOL
---
Is that a red shirt as part of it too?
---
If you worked half as hard on your dps as tryin to mount that high horse you wouldnt need thorns to count for your damage.
---
Bro on the real you framed that camera perfectly
---
That's his point
---
I don't have any illusion that I'll ever kill a world boss, at least this year. Bosses will be controlled by a few guilds per server
---
I think he can do the quest by himself now...
---
Spriest is arguably the best 1v1 class in the game. Not that a mage should lose to one 11 levels lower, but still. Mage is absolutely not the “bar none” best class in the game.
---
Yep I got mine at 42
---
Garrote maybe?
---
Eh maybe it's useful again, it was a novelty with no real purpose last I played.
---
Hell of a hammer, and quite a fun quest. I'm hoping to retire mine tomorrow (Lv 35) and upgrade to this Bonebiter that I have zero weapon skill for.

He said “Leave. Please.” Lolllll
---
I have this one, takes time for it to learn I think but it’s worked great
---
That guy should be like lvl 110 at least. Ruined my immersion.
---
I can't even describe how much I like Classic. I never played Vanilla,started in Cata all the way to MoP so I don't have nostalgia altering my opinion.
---
The social aspect is amazing, adventures just happen abruptly and everywhere, the people are awesome and the world feels real, well done Blizzard, please don't ruin it a second time.
---
So grinding is best xp
---
Which happens to me all the fucking time lmao

If taking an item against the wishes of everyone in the party isn't ninja looting, then I'd love to hear your super unique definition.

I have 6 days played at level 38.5, what kind of sorcery?

Mograinne so damn shame its like 80/20 horde. Hillsbrad and athari, SM are FILLED with gsnking horde
---
WUUUUT!???
---

---
Seriously? This is the hill people are choosing to die on? Blizzard (probably accidentally) make a change that prevents you griefing lowbies on your own faction and you /ragequit?

It's always kind of irked me, from a "this doesn't really matter, but it's still immersion" point of view that animals drop cash.

Shouldn't all the income from them come from trash drops? Stacking amount, value, and drop rate can be fiddled with easily to make it stay in line with inventory clogging you get from farming.
---
Why not both?

If they’re similar dps, then speed is better, but generally speaking you want a sword over a dagger so you’re actually getting use out of your sword spec.
---
Nothing subjective about dinosaurs. They're the coolest beasts ever to roam the Azearthroth. So raptors are quite objectively the best mount.

My friend completely quit in mid 30s 2 days ago. ''I'm too old for this shit'' and he went to retail with thought he might be back when he's bored in retail and roll a pve server. I was really sad about it, he apparently couldn't quest for 2 days straight because of all the horde ganking.

What addon is he using for the nameplate bars?
---
Haven’t tried Perl frames. I did try easy frames though which seemed to work at first but whenever I did anything like move or target, it would reset only the y axis on my frames. SUF has always been my goto so I’d like to get it working
---
His boy pussy *
---
It didn’t feel worth it likely because it’s unsatisfying to kill trash mobs to vendor trash loot. 
---
Much better getting levels and gold rewards. Spend the same amount of time at the keyboard, get your mount at a higher level.
---
I don't at all understand where you're coming from. You know you can keybind stances in the same way that you can keybind abilities, right? And can be swapped during gcd. You say having to switch manually like it's clunky, but I'm not missing out on any dps I would have had otherwise.

Eh, no lol.

Leveling a warrior currently with my Druid wife. I think it will be a good team
---
Yeah had some ~5v5 open world pvp today and one warrior would just isolate me every time and it felt like there was nothing I could do personally. And nobody in the group would help peel so every fight was just instant death after tossing a few hots on people.
---
Are your graphics turned way up or something?
---
Game recognizes game!
---
Another violent addicted gamer! World health organization says u guys are addicts and diseased from gaming! Not surprised!
---
Try to charge as many pulls as you can and use bloodrage a bunch.  The issue is you're generally using a one handed and shield you're not specced for while leveling, but it's best to just deal with it.  As you start running endgame dungeons and still want to tank, you can switch to protection and be able to generate more rage with a shield, deal more damage with your one hander, increase your aggro output, and get cheaper sunders.
---
Good gosh I'm sorry. You actually had 4 rolls to win that and still lost. Absolutely no justice in the universe...
---
I constantly question my decision on what class to play. These videos make it so hard

Any mob in STV has a chance to drop it, I looted it off one of the pirates south of booty bay, I think that is one of the more popular places to farm it!

Swords outperform daggers while levelling in instances, backstab scales on % weapon damage and “good daggers” are ludicrously rare while levelling. Flat damage, plus higher base damages mean swords are better.
---
On private servers they went super flying off into the distance. I once sent someone past the river to the barrens from the org zep. Does it still work anything like that?
---
They said it was a bug and didn’t happen in vanilla, from what I’ve read.
---
I never considered consumables. Very good point. God damn I was so spoiled by later expansions in PvP, and in general. I guess we all are/were, though.
---
Thank you.
---
Bleh
---
I think the video would have been funnier without, personally.
---
Nice assumptions kiddo
---
Or they decided beforehand to just need on boes. Thats how I prefer to do it.
---
Had this a few times myself.  Yup, i bet him to death with my 8 slot leather quiver... I bet him good!
---
bare is 4 tnak lolz
---
BiS for tank is warden staff not pummler. Pummler mostly used by cat dps but only in raid bosses. The warden stuff is mainly used for the insane amount of armor you're getting from a single item.
---
Honestly I could not fully function for the rest of the runs I did. literally was a kick in the nuts. I ended up logging off and debated not touching this game again.
---
Moonguard was where normies went to dip their toe into ERP. Scarlet Crusade was where the thin veil of humanity was truly stripped away.
---
Arcanite Reaper is still showing as low as of tonight.
---
Keep grinding quests and dungeons. Post-40 you really start picking up gold much faster that it's a huge waste of time to just farm gold. I'm assuming you're asking because you don't have mount yet, but just keep pushing ahead and try to minimize travel time if possible without mount. I just hit 49 and I made enough after hitting 40 and getting mount to buy two mounts if I wanted. Not doing anything special or getting lucky AH drops.
---
Canibalise, bandages and food. Rotate through while you're waiting for cooldowns.
---
I'd save the pots for emergencies.  
---
You can Gouge and bandage a little health in the 5 seconds.
---
In my 30s as a druid a frost mage and I killed moraladin some elite undead. Only way we could be it was with the mage siting in the center shooting while I ran circles around him with the mob chasing me. Kiting things you have no business killing as one of the pleasures of the game.

Watch Payo, dude is hilarious.

Check out [this](https://f00l.de/wowtranslator.php) website. The translator doesn't work for most sentences but there's some popular examples.

Never said it was *just* a raid leader, but it was usually the one it was referring to. People who need roll on BoP items they don't need are also ninjas.
---
oh my god not again  
---
When will these worthless loostposts stop?
---
Gotten kicked from groups because my dps was subpar even though we were clearing the *simple* content just fine. I didn't have addons (dps meter) and nothing was said to me, just kicked.
---
They then quickly spammed lfg and world and summoned their new dps with their warlock. No different than retail at that point.
---
axe of the deep woods and flurry axe is pre raid bis for orc fury warrs. me as a warr would actually need those two but i would equip them right away
---
THAT was brilliant
---
What the fuck did i just read.
---
Green monkey does not belong to the family of monkey but it is a very expensive type of a horse
---
Druids are fantastic in BC, but they were really subpar in vanilla.  If you're flexible enough to switch roles in a party or a raid, you can sometimes pinch-hit and save fights, but typically, if you were better at your main role, you wouldn't need to save the fight in the first place. 
---
They're one of the fastest vanilla characters, though, and that makes them very good in, um.  Crap.  I lost the name.  It's the first PvP arena, where you're trying to capture flags.  Druids are excellent there... not because they can get the kills, but because they can run the flag so well, and toughen up some when under heavy attack.
---
If you cringed you’re probably insecure lol. You see the flair huh
---
/u/vredditdownloader
---
Pretty reasonable.
---
You’re bad then. Mages have literally always been the best class in the game. There’s no fight that a good mage can’t win.
---
As far as I remember, It’s same server only on classic, not account.
---
Thats pretty unfortunate. It's a high ticket sell item tho.
---
Just about every dungeon grinding grp ive ran we all just agree'd to need on every epic or valuable item drop that can be sold.
---
It's just common sense unfortunately and I totally sympathize with losing something you want to use for someone else to sell. With 800 gold i could easily buy 2x pre-raid BiS items for my character lol
---
Does it seem to you that almost every hordie that's here is at their menstrual cycle peak? Or is it just me getting that vibe?
---
Notice a general lack of anything constructive and more 'QQ cry more noob'.
---
&gt;You’re bad then.
---
It's the 2005 WoW forums all over again 😍
---
Yeah. I think you just answered your own question! :D
---
But yeah, it's an multifaceted question. Usually on these scenarios I dont roll immidiately, and see how the party reacts, then roll accordingly.
---
Exactly! I’m happy to hear you choose to play a class and spec that makes you happy over what is considered  “best DPS”
---
The way I see it everyone should be able to play whatever race, class, or spec combination that makes them happy. Especially if Raids can be beaten with 1/2 the usual amount of raiders. 
---
Go out, have fun, play whoever you want and however you want. Glad to see more people playing for fun this way :)
---
This is why I randomly give noobs who are 25+ 5g.
---
If you make it past level 20, you're gonna actually play, so I'm not throwing my gold in the dumpster.
---
If you can equip it and use it within a few levels need it.  Otherwise greed, or you’re a PoS.
---
This is Classic - reputation matters. Find out who his guild leader is and mail them. Don't complain - just warn them that he did this to you and he might do it to them too.
---
Dude, red welps on north east wetlands. Decent loot and Xperia, and a 0.05% for tiny chromosomes welp drop. I literally just got mine an hour ago and could have shit! Sells for 30-50g at AH. I kept mine though, named him Edwin
---
Add a 360 no scope in and I think you could hit the big time
---
&gt; But if people get impatient and you lose aggro at the start of the fight, and they keep attacking (or worse, running away), good luck getting it back.
---
This happens on low level warriors too.  Taunt costs rage, has a cool down and is melee range.  If impatient dps don’t wait for sunders and/or don’t focus fire it inevitably goes to shit.
---
Keep your soul shard bag on the far left slot, create this macro for your drain soul, thank me later

```#showtooltip

25g on Kirtonos
---
When you described that whole „once i am slowed i am doomed“ part i just thought... yepp thats hunter pvp...hunter is all about control
---
But it is generally a hunters job to avoid this scenario all together
---
Sure if a rogue opens on you that is kind of an exception but you have tools in your kit to get away again and again and again
---
Depends on what lvl you are and which talent tree you go for but as soon as feign death comes online you should be able to trap anyone reliably mid fight
---
Skilling improved wingclip and more defensive skills in the survival tree might also be an option if you think you need them
---
Intimidation sure also is nice 
---
But for the most part use your tracking skills so you will always see a threat coming ,use shadowmeld if you are a nightelf ,lay traps behind you pre fighting a mob if you thing someone is around and always stay above 80% health an you’ll be much better of
---
Truth is timeless.
---
You need to take a break of a game is going to give you an anxiety attack lol
---
That's awesome!
---
Because my stealth button is on the main bar, it switches to something else when I'm in cat form, so there's no real need for it to be there. In cat form that button is the regular prowl button, that just takes me in and out of stealth.
---
Reminds me of the day wow upgraded the graphics on the water... what a time it was
---
While feat by itself, you'll be lagging behind in PvP simple by being unable to strafe and fast 180° turn while jumping through your target. Also this limits your ability to get out of void zones in PvE.
---
I found an add-on called Character Notes which accomplishes what I wanted in an even better way.
---
Ok, we'll go with the info we have. Since it isn't a  PVP-server the downsides aren't that bad. The biggest one is that there are few Hordes in total, making it harder to find groups and guilds.
---
Oh this reminds me of the guys who used to kite anachronos to org hoping they do that again when AQ comes back
---
If it is a limited recipe just be aware if someone has bought it recently it will not be visible for purchase until it is off CD again.

What use is enchanting going to have for me? Can’t I just buy the BIS tailoring piece / get someone else to make it for me?
---
Also which piece is it
---
having a lot of trouble finding this in the community; what is the exact name of your steam shortcut to wow classic?
---
I assume it's not "world of warcraft"
---
Holy shit, that UI is the best I've seen
---
my guild was considering it until we checked it at 10 pm last night and there were 5 level 60s online.
---
I can't remember the item, I think it was the snowman. We took our raid members account in vanilla, jumped over the lava in I think ubrs or brd somewhere, he got stuck in midair dancing and then we logged off
---
It s sad but at the end it s just pixels
---
That's the Shadow Weaving talent (your spells add a shadow vulnarability to your target). Only Undeads have Devouring Plague. They use the same icon.
---
3 100s rolled. Idk it's probably 1/10000 chance
---
As a feost mage, would you recommend leveling with the single target shatter build or the aoe build? 
---
If you do use the aoe grinding build is it still usable for questing and dungeons or is it really only good for aoe grinding solo?
---
Rush 60 then transfer to pvp realm
---
Yeah which is why it’s on a 30 min cd :P
---
Maybe im thinking about the wrong orb
---
There are some note addons you could try out or just use the notepad on your PC or phone.
---
It's funny how different people have different responses to these kind of things. Again, no judgement - but my response was "it's nice that he's taking it slow and just getting a couple of levels each day".
---
roflmaoed
---
It's 14 vs 18 spell damage. Last I checked that's more than one
---
People with jobs and families have more free time than you're giving them credit for, at least most of them. There's a ton more resources today to help streamline a lot of things that were difficult during vanilla vs today. There were way more roadblocks that Google had no answer for.
---
What’s stv
---
Bruh are you high, it’s 100 times easier now, I can literally leave a group and go right into another one
---
Maybe it's me, but I think Infernals shouldn't be able to kill random lowbies. A little too easy to summon.
---
Doom Guards on the other hand? They should go hog wild. You had to kill someone and make a small cabal of 5 people to summon that bad boy.
---
Exactly. It's like complaining about a single player campaign being too short because the world record speed run is only two hours.
---
I’m ootl what happened with planet fitness?
---
I’m past that point I need a place to farm now man
---
I played a warrior (very underplayed class in early vanilla) back then so I always knew mage was op as fuck ;(
---
Min maxing is very much alive. Just notice SM cleave groups. Twitch culture is awful and persistent
---
I'm playing on Wyrmthalak and it feels extremely horde-sided. Or maybe the alliance are just hiding in the dungeons or something. Everywhere I go since level 30, there are 2-3 horde people for every alliance member.
---
It is, but u need atleast 5/5 t2.5 with nef spell damage mace and stuff
---
RP server?
---
Moo, Moo!
---
It's an annoying quest chain, and a 1 hour cooldown...
---
Yea I also died inside

I fished it off of the Stormwind Auction house for 4g. Sauron came running by in Stormwind with his elvish name displayed clearly, and I showed.
---
It pairs up with that lost sock.
---
I thought I was only gonna play a day or two for the hell of it.
---
Ended up switching my subscription for a year instead of a month
---
I am experiecing it for the first time. 0 nostalgia.
---
Back when i was a kid i was a huge warcraft 3 fan but me being just a kid in south america there was no way i could get into wow back in the day. Even when i grew up and adquired tje ways to pay it wasnt worth it since i had to buy the game, then buy each xpac individually and on top of all that the subscription.
---
But with classic out and you having access to both games (minus last expansion) i finally gave it a try.
---
And of course this being my first time i tried both versions. And while i dont think retail is bad it clearly is a complete different game than classic. 
---
Classic is the reason i never stuck with other mmos. Because this may be the only true mmorpg i actually played since you actually interact with people.
---
I've been making "first timers only" dungeon runs and its a blast. I love the fact i have to actually use my brain while playing and use skills according to the enemy/situation instead of spamming a perfect rotation for the whole game. I like having visual clues to find quest locations instead of having everything on the map.
---
I have a couple of friends in the same exact situation as me, i could elaborate for hours on what i love so far but the truth is the game isnt just good, its a superior experience.
---
This is my opinion as someone completely new to wow
---
While admonition is lazy af he is the most viewed wow content creator currently active 
---
By a BIG mile
---
Well at the end of the day, it is a wild lvl 60 mob and it should be aggressive to everyone. It is an hour cooldown. It was in classic, it should be in it again.
---
I think you pop the buff from gnomes staff then swap to wardens but I could be wrong. It’s a hella good staff I bought it for a Druid in BC made life eazy mode
---
In interface show % and number. You're just showing %.
---
I was glad that i got to milk heavy leather before it crashed, was using skinning as a cash supply before swapping and boosting engi with ores i mailed to my alt
---
over 9000!!!!
---
Nothing like MCing a mage off a cliff and quick switching to silence him so he cant blink/slowfall.
---
Oooooh. I was trying to figure out why either of the items themselves were "whaaa" level of confusion. 
---
Guess I need to look closer sometimes. Puzzles aren't always my strong suit.
---
Okay... so im new to WoW... like completely. I have two chars, Alliance. Human-Warlock &amp; Gnome Mage. I have warlock learning engineering &amp; tailoring. On my Gnome Mage to complement my Warlock, I should learn Enchanting &amp; Mining right? Enchanting for the tailor and mining for engineering, right? Or should the mage learn skinning &amp; mining. Looking for whatever will help both chars the best in the game. I dont care about making tons of gold. But I will need an epic mount at some point and I heard those things are 900 gold! OMG. So anyways, what would you run if you were in my shoes? (maybe Im doing it all wrong... i dunno) lol xD. Thanks in advance (srry so lng)
---
Oh wait I dont actually know if you have your bis in tailor, I was thinking of mages. 
---
Ench will always be usefull when you get to 60 and start raiding. 
---
Im not sure wdym by having someone make it for you, buying would cost a shit ton
---
Not really, just usually one corpse run and then zone in.
---
Sadly theres 0 chance of that happening anytime soon, Blizzard probably intends to leave Classic as it is for a few years (at least 4 imo).
---
In the recent "playing with devs" Pat Nagle said that he loves that Classic will be always something that people can return to as the game was back in 2004.
---
Stop posting trash
---
Exactly. Since we don't know the amount of reports per server and side we can't really compare the numbers. I'd take the report with a grain of salt, since some of the most popular servers with the longest queues don't seem to have the highest population according to the report. There might be other reason for this,  number of alts, more players that play during different times etc.
---
Have you picked up engineering it gives you a great toolset.
---
Find a group running Scarlet monastery graveyard and farm with them doing runs. Use the auction house for items that are harder to obtain. I sell herbs for 10-50 silver per stack and I’m literally just collecting them along the way.
---
Yeah iam a Minecraft graphics style fan too.

Great, another screenshot/video taken with a phone...
---
(Nice! Is latency / "input lag" bearable using your mobile connection? How much data traffic it generates? And how long your phone's battery lasts if you have to be connected continously to Steam Link?)
---
Sweat, smells, dirty sheets, a few minutes of pleasures and expendature of energy vs that sweet sweet upgrade, watching that dank blue bar grow and an ice cold drink in a race to not be left behind.
---
So $10 a month and free pizza once a week? Sign me up, I'll just go there for the pizza. Sounds like a good deal.
---
&gt; moving him into the water and using the swim pot was a great move.
---
As soon as he charged me all I wanted to do was get away. I don't have a mount yet and he did, so I knew the only escape was getting in that water because I keep Swim Speed pots on me. I was sloppy timing my stuns, I should have paced it for when his HS was about to end. I still thought *If I can just get in the water I can take off and outswim him regardless of HS.*
---
Where I really goofed was letting the combat flag end. He got a free charge on me and a HS in the water because of that. I tried to get away from him so many times; I did not want to stand toe to toe with a guy 7 levels higher.
---
There were so many variables and I was shaking like a leaf after those two parries at the end.
---
What he said?
---
I am not sure but I think that the pummler buff will drop off when swapping. I know that feral dps keep the staff for 90 sec ( all 3 charges) and if boss is not dead yet swapping to another pummler. About tanking I am really not sure but I don't think druid tanks are using pummler at all
---
How does the game determine who wins in the event of a tie?
---
Holy shit so many delusional people in that thread trying to twist that shit...saying the guy is abusive etc lmao
---
You can also check out http://classicrealminfo.com/
---
Make sure you always outlevel a new zone you go questing in. Don't go to Desolace as soon as the quests there show up for you (lvl 32-33) but rather spam a few dungeons first and go once you are lvl 35-36, etc. 
---
That should be somewhat of a ganker deterrent, as long as you are not outnumbered - so look for questmates as well before leaving town.
---
If i could segway off that... So if I unlearn my talents on my warlock... I will have to re-train every spell again also? at same cost as before?
---
I've had similar experiences to what you had too, groups struggling to find tanks and opting for unconventional picks. In my case I've been tanking a lot on my shaman for 'regular' groups (not specifically melee or spell cleave). So far I've tanked everything up until sunken temple which I'll hopefully be a high enough level to tackle soon enough :)
---
It's not the most efficient, but it's fun and definitely gets the job done!
---
I have a similar situation with games, though it seems to have a narrower focus.
---
I'll play what I term as "Long-term" games for a long time, then after a while, it starts getting boring, frustrating, annoying or any combination, and I'll just give it up. Quit playing as much, play less and less until I'm not playing it at all. 
---
Then, after a period of time has passed, which has been as long as 7 years (in the case of WoW) or as short as two weeks (This one was Warframe) I can find myself thinking about picking it up again. I might or might not, but sometimes I just need that away time, take a break, play other things. I'm pretty sure that Zelda Remake coming up in a few days is going to take a substantial chunk of my time in the near future. 
---
When I say "Narrower Focus" I mean it's just limited to those games that take a long time to play. I play other things, too, but "Long-term" games tend to have their own "time-slot" as it were.
---
From my private server experience the only really rough patch is the last 10 levels before you reach shield slam, so 30-40. You do no damage at all at that point and questing gets extremely slow. At any other point it's super comfortable. Although I have to add that I didn't play dual wield, I stuck to my shield at all times.
---
&gt; Cry me a river. Its then internet not your personal hugbox.
---
Is not an edgy statement. It is a fact.
---
So I could drop tailoring, herb or mining for profit? Wanna save for mount.. I’ve only got about 20g
---
I read your whole story, but did you ever stop and talk to them, sit them down and explain? Could’ve probably saved a lot of headache. Not everyone is competent or smart enough to realize LoS some people freeze up or are just shit at the game. 
---
Sorry buddy, sounds like a shitty experience.
---
But it is the point of the thread
---
Basically everything in the Prot tree that doesn't have to do with PvE (aggro-increasing talents, taunt CD reduction, etc). It's pure PvP-related Prot and Arms. 
---
You *have* to dip into Arms early. 5/5 Deflection -&gt; 3/5 Tac Mastery is vital.
---
super lucky, i leveled in a cleave group we farmed 3 of the axe and leveled in there forever 
---
number of tabbards 0
---
That’s a shame. Still, it’s useful information- you know to steer clear of that guild. Plus, you get to /lol at them in a few weeks time when said priest cleans their guild bank out.
---
Who rolled first, i believe
---
Yeah I think you could herb. But id still would say fish so you dont have to drop anything :)
---
It isn't eventually in German
---
yea I did the same for alot of SM runs, we'd have 2 shamen to make up for not having a healer. Or a hunter to make up for no tank. SM had times where finding healer/tanks was impossible
---
Who hit the roll button first, I believe
---
Only issue is with fishing I’ve gotta stop questing. Herb I can quest as I pick herbs
---
Nah got a year to write on Reddit tho
---
Got the pants today, beat a hunter on the roll thank god might have lost my mind if he won. 
---
Still haven’t seen the shoulders drop in 20 runs, last piece I need for the set but I’m 42 and not sure I got the patience for more armory lol
---
Prepping for ‘a quest’ as a warrior. Fixed title for you.
---
You can easily still do everything alone in Classic apart from the raids (which are a joke anyway) and a few high level dungeons. Regarding the dungeons for example you can already solo Deadmines at around L30, RFC and WC even earlier.
---
Wiley trap set up by night elves to catch orcs
---
It's ninjaing a BoE if you need without discussing, or are just planning on selling it. Everyone "needs" gold, like, with that logic you could roll need on literally anything.
---
There is a fair bit of grinding in a lot of phases of the levelling process. Killing all/most of the things when running between quests will save you a lot of headache later on.
---
do both, start with shatter build until you reach SM grind, then take 2 or 3 points into improv blizzard.
---
Yes that is normal. Welcome to Classic.
---
Epics should always be needed. The entire group contributed to getting the item to drop, just because someone can equip an item that might be an upgrade until they replace it 3 levels later doesn't mean they have any more right to an item worth several hundreds of gold than someone who can't equip it. Of course it varies group to group but that's how it has always been in any group I've been in, same with expensive blues. The only exceptions are cheap blues that sell for little more than vendor price.
---
the aoe build even if you don't plan on grinding mobs will give you a bit of a safety net incase you accidentally over aggro
---
"But I'm not a raider"
---
Same sort of thing happened to me last night doing the (horde) Stromgarde quests. We even picked up a person late, got him up to speed, and finished together.
---
Yeah man, heals all day and bottoms all night.
---
Read that with Chris Traeger's voice.
---
Hey how can i see the amount which i get healed as combat text over my char ? :)
---
Ungoro raptor gang
---
Sad
---
Scarlet tabard
---
Yep pretty much.  I duo a lot with a warrior friend as paladin and most mages simply have no idea what to do when the warrior has freedom.  A lot even still try to frostnova and run away from him....
---
Also a lot of them seem to be very confused as to why when they sheep me and start hitting the warrior - I seem to immediately break out of sheep :O
---
But yes this is the thing in general with theorycraftijg on reddit - it assumes people picking the best counterplay every time to every event in a matchup.  And of course 95% of fights you might have are usually full of mistakes on both sides.
---
Druid tank at endgame. Nice meme. What you mean is healer and you were going to sell it just like that guy did.
---
Bruh, the rashes. Shit bucket all the way.
---
I knew arugal faction balance was worst than what was touted. I’m afraid this imbalance will only worsen with how difficult ally have it
---
You're expected to do multiple zones in each level range after around level 10 or so. You should probably head to Redridge if you're level 17.
---
Tailor makes some bis recipes at endgame and has the moon cloth recipe on 4 day CD starting at 250. You can always get some value from just crafting yourself and friend bags and making moon cloth. Enchanting however is very expensive to level since you will be destroying greens that can be several gold each to the vender. Even worse than that you have to actively seek out people to enchant their gear a few at a time if you don't want to destroy the enchant. You will likely only make tips starting at 60 when people actually plan to keep their gear for awhile. Some of enchants that are high demand come from patterns so might not even have what they want like fiery weapon. I did tailoring/ enchanting would go back and take herbilism instead if I could.
---
Have you thought of making a "controll" orr "reference" study where you for ex. are simply standig somewhere in the room just idleing?
---
Would be interesting to see how these percentages change depending on you paying tribute or just "being there" (how many ppl are sparing you just because of your intentions).
---
Bad memories.... there’s a reason I’m avoiding classic.
---
My experience on pservers is the same. In fact it never even occurred to go DW instead of S&amp;B until I ended up with Sword of Omen (SM quest) and Vanq's Sword (RFD quest) at the same time. I found myself debating which to use, then it hit me:
---
*¿Porque no los dos?*
---
With Sharps and spamming improved Sunder (12 rage) I was surprised that your white damage gets pretty damn high.  
---
^^^^when ^^^^you ^^^^actually ^^^^hit

Holy shit the gun shot did it.... I burst out laughing

Actually about 1/1000000

at least this time it feels different, horde seem full of tryhards and edgelords but I've rarely come across good horde pvp'ers.

someone asked the difference between horde and alliance in world chat the other day and got the reply alliance are virgins, horde are edgy virgins which made me laugh.

Yeah good idea if you want to bore her to death.
---
Zandalar eu last night!
---
It's ninjaing, certainly, but you have to consider whether you feel obligated to 4 random pubbies to sacrifice your fair chance at a few hundo gold, aka hours of future time of your life, because a stranger bear claims they want to tank in a few weeks...
---
If you want to really experience all forms of the story then playing a character on each faction would benefit you. But you won't need to have say an alliance priest and horde priest.
---
you must be avoiding the global chat channels
---
Seems super accurate for mograin
---
3ven tho it feels a bit more Allianz favored sometimes
---
Why does one mage have a different icon lol
---
Hey,
---
I accidentally created multiple accounts on the battle.net website and want to delete 2 of the 3 now. But I can't find a way to do so. Can someone help?
---
Thanks in advance.
---
Some may call this junk. Me, I call them treasures.
---
It is a good lookong set!
---
For leveling, sure. But keep in mind that many enemies in the current Endgame are resistant to fire damage.
---
I mained a mage since launch but I was clueless back in the day. Rogues or warriors would always seem to kill me in 3 seconds flat.
---
You know that what you are saying is the same thing as another roll. How exactly do you think randoming works with computers?
---
leveling enchanting and tailoring is why you only have 20g
---
It's interesting how different opinions are :) I love the barrens. They're absolutely beautiful in a way, and questing there is super chill. Definitely my favorite area in the entire game.
---
Ive chosen mining and blacksmithing. Its nice to be able to craft your own gear. In hindsight skinning would have been the smarter option simply because of gold.
---
I played on something like 256 mb ram and like 64 mb video memory. My hard drive was 30 gb which barely fit Wow. Now I can queue in Wow, play some Overwatch while waiting and watch favorite streamer lol
---
Did silence work on ice block? I can't remember.
---
There's 120 ping on US and that is the fun of it you hunt down those fanboys and even more!
---
Look I don't want to call you a "lawyer", but in 2006 noone knew that draenai in their holyfied eredar form would be an Alliance race. This card is somewhere from feb 2007- Sept 2008 or later.
---
!RemindMe 3 hours
---
If you can manage two characters, your solution seems good.  
---
I would probably have mining + engineering and tailoring + enchanting, because then the corresponding professions are on the same character.
---
Ultimately it makes little difference, as to which characters have the professions, since I think engineering is the only profession that is needed on the characters to use the items.
---
No you shouldnt, also get used to grinding. You will do a lot of it.
---
Modern times when democracy is used as a weapon.
---
Happened to me too. I think we had 2 lovks and she died to their dots before she revived him. Didnt get quest progress either
---
Sounds like you should have spell cleaved
---
I assume every server has a few versions of that. Herod's is You Think You Do, which is a better iteration imo.
---
It's a race horse called green monkey, not a type of horse. It's just bad writing on the article.
---
Dabu
---
That's a nice way of looking at it.
---
It is now.
---
hitting/criting a mob is a dependency for a bunch of talents/chain of events. All AP and SP do is increase the hit's damage. Warrior is the easiest to understand. 
---
If I don't hit or crit the mob, I can't proc flurry, which get's me rage faster, which lets me do more damage, which in turn lets me proc flurry again and repeat the process.
---
ElvUI will also give you debuff durations along with dozens of other things you'd need additional addons for.
---
I don't know about spells from the talent trees, thought.
---
I literally just had this happen as well. 
---
It was a thing way back in the day, kinda surprised they kept that feature in
---
I did pick blacksmithing but I have an alt as a miner. I was thinking of something other than a gathering profession.
---
Omg ty
---
Wow classic finally playable.meme
---
Level 53
---
If you do all dungeons at least one or two times and kill mobs while going from one quest to another, you won't need to pure farming, also there stages in leveling where you have to goto another zone, do some quests there and then finish the quest in the initial zone, alot of zones have 10 to 15 level range difference. One level an hour is perfectly fine, latter levels will take alot more, enjoy the leveling experience.
---
That's Romey Rome, you ain't heard of him?!
---
I don't get it
---
There are not even enough mobs to quest normally in mograin
---
Hes upset cuz blizzard changed freaking #nochanges game, is it really hard to understand?
---
Not on my low-med pop realm
---
It is the same thing in practice, which was mostly my point. It isn’t the same thing theoretically. A hidden roll could tie infinitely until servers fail. It is the same thing practically though because it’s extremely unlikely.
---
Yep it's a well known thing and should be mentioned before the boss if the party has DoT heavy dps in case they dont know :)
---
Durotan's crotch worst enemy; Classic crotch
---
It might sound cheesy but in classic I feel I am in that world. I have to choose where to go, which quest I can face (or ask for help). The world feels dangerous and I feel like an adventurer in it, with crappy gear and spells slowly progressing.
---
I realized this the other day when I played retail. I wanted to change from the grind of leveling fishing in classic, so I hop on my retail to level my MW monk. I played one dungeon using LFD and while the gameplay was fun I didn’t feel immersed in the world. It felt like playing diablo 3 for me.
---
So after the dungeon i went back to grind fishing in classic, that although much more boring it “felt good”
---
U can group for it!
---
That's really cool but totally ruined by the awful name.
---
I saw him there a few hours ago wondering how it got there
---
This
---
I always had similar arguments with the missus. She felt neglected, because I have two more or less fixed evenings a week for raiding, or gaming in general. Of course, I do play more than that, but I won't say no on spending time with her instead. 
---
It just, well, got better over time, probably because I didn't give in to her comaplaining
---
Gaming is a hobby of mine, and this has to be respected by my partner.  If my partner doesn't respect this, and even tries to play the 'abusive relation' card, well, gtfo.
---
If I was doing any sports or so, I would have even more fixed appointments a week (trainings, actual games, 
---
..)
---
According to wowhead guide hands and chest is bis for warlocks from tailoring and some other slots are close behind. Pretty much the same for priests and mages they have something. I know shadoweave set is awesome if you can get the pieces starting at 37.
---
I would argue that its a waste of time to farm gold now. You start getting a lot of gold after level 40. If you dont have the mount at 40 you will have at 45. Personally i would rather walk 5 more levels than farming the little gold you can now. Only thing i would do is not learn spells you dont need while leveling
---
Had the same question. Did you ever find out?
---
not getting engineering on a tank is a sin
---
Huge reason why I played a lock.
---
I knew I wanted enchanting and tailoring, but also knew 90g at 40 would be impossible if I did this.
---
Im lvl 35 and have 200 enchanting and tailoring.... And about 13g.
---
Look up a class picking guide to help choose and end up wanting to play every class :D
---
Got to 51 friday last week, barely been able to play since, so 3 bars from 54 now
---
Wtf is going on
---
For the love of god man! Turn off the “not enough resources” speech in your settings! How does that not drive you mad?
---
I really wish they would make some sort of trailer for phases. Atleast for those that have raids.
---
Always wondered how the faction translation worked
---
Lmfao no they're not
---
I've just been solo leveling on my 50 mage, I've been attacked by horde once while I was afk in the last 5 levels
---
Shockadin was actually a hilarious classic duel spec. I honestly legit think it was better then retribution for PvP. Assuming you could find the gear.
---
Ofc not
---
I dunno man walking for those 5 levels = time lost which means less money over and exp overall
---
both will fall in under 2 hours of release
---
This is an epic so its even less surprising
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mobinfo2-classic
---
I'm new to this game so this might be a stupid question but what is actually happening here?? Is this something to do with "X place is under attack!" message I've seen?
---
I wouldnt consider that a ninja
---
Their equipment actually sucks.
---
Go to your account on the blizzard website. You should be able to delete them. I also removed one a while back
---
What would life be like at 60 if I wanted to be an Enhancement shaman? (mostly for PvP reasons)
---
I'm also wanting to go feral druid for the same reasons, wondering what kind of life I can expect at 60. I don't want to respect to resto really as I won't have the time to farm the gold to keep it up, but at the same time I'm not opposed to healing if people asked me to in groups.
---
Any insight would be great.
---
Most jobs in countries that aren't totally shit.
---
Mining...
---
Im horde on westfall, lv48. Not hard to get groups but it gets noticably quieter during off hours.
---
Im more worried that seeing these stats will cause people to leave.
---
This elevators don't have collision on the ceiling/roof, hence why he passed through
---
play at 4am
---
Ok so if you don't like bloodfury (which i disagree with), you get +5 to axes and nice armor models. Hardiness will be very noticeable in p2
---
People like engineering because of those dank goggles for tanking...
---
personally I’m a blacksmith and miner because it’s fun making my own gear and eventually weapons...
---
Rockbiter Weapon and Lightning shield.
---
Necessary totems.
---
Earth shock to build threat.
---
Keep weapon enchant and totems up.
---
lmao you can't get over it, can you?
---
Said nobody ever.
---
I just did the same thing. That damn oger is now buffed as hell...
---
Need is only for equipping the item anyone in the group can sell the item on the market. I would be mad about my group needing and selling a Boe.
---
My lv 20 shaman uses more abilities than my 120 demon hunter. 
---
He also still has his totems and shocks and I finally understand what the class is supposed to be. My lv 120 shaman (which I started in legion, never played them before) is pretty much a malfunctioning version of my fury warrior who waits for stormbringer procs and has a healing wave instead of charge. It doesn't stand out and the stuff that should make him unique is so watered down that it doesn't matter because other classes bring better or equal versions of it.
---
It doesn't even hold water in comparison to itself from last expansion. Sure, enhance wasn't rocket science and also a heavy casino spec, but at least it looked cool with the lightnings that jumped to your friends, the lava tornados, the elemental wolves (now a talent, fucks sake) and the burning earthen spikes that crashed into your target. For whatever reason they also took all of the eye candy from us. It just feels like massive regression.
---
The part that I enjoy about classic it that everything I do actually feels like it matters, as it progresses something. I get a level, I get a fancy new totem that I maybe sometimes even use. Meanwhile one of my alts sits at lv 80 in retail and gets no new ability up to 120. It's weird.
---
Get a swing timer and a decently slow wep and it's magic
---
It depends on the rest of your gear. In pure PvE situation for sure, but I level on pretty heated PvP server. Therefore, I prioritize Stamina after SPower above anything else - if I get ganked, I need as much health as possible. Stamina also gives more mana than Intellect. 
---
For this reason, I kept the warlock robe for almost 20 levels and got other shadoweave pieces instead. Balance out the stats to your liking, but if on PvP server, don't neglect Stamina.
---
I want to grind mobs that drop loot that vendors for lots of money while leveling. Tried to find guide with suggestions of spots but having a hard time - does anyone know one?  
---
Am level 28 atm so any recommended spot in that level range would be nice!
---
Hmm I didnt know carbs burn before fat
---
Redridge, Westfall and Darkshore have quests for your level. Get ready to run and pick up flight points, you will be swapping zones a lot. And do the defias chain in Westfall, dont skip Deadmines.
---
I play alliance on ten storms. From the graph I was quite worried but 40/60 split isnt that bad.
---
Psssht, unless you like to PVP.
---
These people wouldn't have lasted the first week without layering, they're complaining that there's people playing an mmorpg game
---
how does stealth for rogues work in this game? i was sitting in a bush stealth not moving and this horde player saw me and killed me.. can anyone explain?
---
I love classic barrens
---
Ehhh no? It takes a bit more than "curved roofs" for something to be considered SEA-architecture inspired
---
There should be quest lists online 
---
You can farm cloth and turn it in for rep too
---
It didn't click for me until I tried a new class. 
---
I was a mage in vanilla, and thought about trying to recapture that feeling. Only I got to 10 and it kept nagging at me, the thought of "You've done this before, and you'll keep doing it for another 5 days /played", then I tried a hunter and it clicked again for me.
---
I only played a Hunter in Legion when I used the boost that came with the expansion, so I didn't know too much about it, but it's been extremely fun so far. 
---
Just learning about the class, skills, the different strats I can use with my pet. Not to mention there is pretty much zero downtime, which keeps me focused. I remember hating how often I'd have to eat/drink with my Mage.
---
I've binged for the past week, have 2 days /played and level 36 and loving the game as much as I did when I was an 18yr old in vanilla.
---
If anyone else is having a similar issue, give another class you haven't played a shot.
---
savage lmao
---
Goblin or gnomish and what does engineering provide a tank?  I honestly don’t know.
---
hmmm my keybind I have for "toggle bag 4" from keybindings opens the bag right next to the backpack, but ill try
---
You will get more money by completing quests.  
---
WoW was designed without "grinding" mobs, but dungeons and raids.
---
It's perfectly normal and you'll be looking at this level range as the "good old days when it was going by so fast and there were reasonable amounts of quests to do per zone" soon enough.  What I'm saying is that what you're going through now gets magnified a great deal later on, especially after level 30.  
---
17 you can start redridge and wetlands, or if you haven't done westfall you can knock out all of those for a level or two then start redridge and westfall before heading into Duskwood and finishing up westfall and redridge and just back and forth those zones until you're 30 and done.  Then it becomes "do one or two quests in this new zone halfway across the world, then go to back halfway across the world the other direction to do one or two quests" for the rest of your time until you hit some good chunks in STV/Desolace/Hillsbrad/Arathi later on.
---
Grinding is part of the experience.  It's also when people quit depending on their tolerance/how often they get ganked while grinding etc...also why SM runs are so popular since people can just skip the whole affair for 10 levels as the game opens up a bit at level 40 for questing.
---
You can hear this in most crypts I think?
---
Awesome, yeah that makes sense. I see what your saying about engineering. Because the guide I read I thinkn im only doing it for something that is Best-In-Slot at 60 for cloth gear? But you have to have engineering (300) to wear it  If i remember correctly. Ukulisti, thank you very much! Im gonna get back on the grind now that I feel I'm not totally screwing up. And I think I will switch the mining over to the warlock/ tailoring to mage w/ enchat. Thanks again! (its hard out here solo... but this game is something else... WAY BEFORE ITS TIME. 04' like what? Saddens me I missed it but glad I found it the 2nd go around. GLHF friend!
---
We need more census data!
---
that just casts drain soul?
---
I played Undead Rogue back in orignial wow. Orc is pure rng whereas Undead can simply push the botton and its there. Plus, Fear lasts way longer than Stun so I would go with Undead instead of Orc in a heartbeat
---
This looks like something that would be given to employees.
---
What class are you, rogue? P3 where everyone has iron grenades coming out the arse will be a whole different ballgame to levelling pvp my friend.
---
Lmfao 8g an hour?
---
Oof
---
I’ve looked and it’s not easy to find. I’ve done cloth but it’s only 75 rep now for 20 runecloth. That’s a lot of cloth.
---
there are no transfers
---
I will never get tired of saying it, alliance has no honor.
---
It's in no one's interest to roll greed. It's like leaving your backdoor unlocked and expecting no one to rob you. Sure, the thief is in the wrong, but you ended up screwing yourself.
---
All need prevents ninja looting by acting as a forced greed roll.
---
it's a 15 year old game, you aren't going to magically find some new spot.
---
The reality is that the BFA tourists won’t even be playing classic by the time Naxx is released so it’ll mostly be older players who quit retail years ago or newer players who were attracted by classic’s Internet hype.
---
Speaking on behalf of the old-guard. We’re not as good as we used to be. I’m OK but I can’t track CDs and DRs like I used to and make mistakes. I would imagine the newer players would mostly be more casual.
---
Naxx will be a lot more accessible than in actual vanilla but I believe it will be a satisfying challenge for many.
---
Go farm dungeons.  
---
In general WoW was designed with questing as main progress way.  
---
It give you money, loot and exp.
---
OP is talking about subscription time, you can only check it if you choose retail subcategory in Battle.net launcher, switching to Classic removes indicator.
---
I believe in pre-cata only pirates in stv can drop this
---
Cant you just write "check out my signed poster from 2005"? Let's see a receipt pal!
---
Grob Gang!
---
Yes it is.
---
The retards yelling "go to retail" got me good. This is the top tier autism that is actually this community in PvP
---
Lul nub l2p, Judgement has 10 yards range.
---
I would love it if hunters wanted to run Armory.. Bigger chance of claiming Ravager! Speaking of which, i've probably ran that dungeon 15-20 times by now and i haven't even seen it drop yet :(
---
what does "of jumped" mean?
---
All my mates are on Firemaw EU, but with a 2-3hr queue every night I can't really join them. So 2 of us have reluctantly moved over to a lower pop realm just to be able to actually play - since we only have 1-2hrs free each evening.
---
Fuckin rogues man...
---
Stop putting words into my mouth 👄
---
Friends screenshot, I'll pass on all your concerns to him.
---
I asked a simple question, out of honest curiosity, and you give me that. Thanks mate.
---
And I'm not smarter either, as I feel that question still stands.
---
Jumping around like that hahaha
---
Also what does DeleteCursorItem mean
---
D'oh!!!!!
---
BECAUSE if everybody greeds, some asshole can and will ninja it by rolling need after the others rolled greed. So it's just more practical and safer to use all need in these situations of jackpot items , as I explained above in detail.
---
nah man the bread is baked with dragon fire
---
I am not gonna ever grief people with this but this shit needs to be fixed. I am sure blizzard changed it themselves and its not a bug. The times we live in, something like this would make the snowflakes mad. No changes.
---
Have*
---
Vanilla will stand on it's own for a while, but not eternally. They *will* need to push some update down the line if they want to keep this version alive, because MMO ultimately need progression to retain players. 
---
Old School Runescape is a perfect example of such a phenomenon. People deserted RS3 in mass to play it at launch, but it still nearly died for lack of update. It's when they started making update in the spirit of Old School that the game found it's second wind and will now likely outlive RS3.
---
Im a horde mage on smolderwebb and i would say it averages at least 30-45 mins to get any group. Its not unbearably long but i can't imagine it being instant unless you're a warrior.
---
Shadow priest is the king of general 1vs1 but play what you enjoy since it takes so long to level up.
---
Did you get the scarlet chest piece? I remember that shit going for a 100g back in the day.
---
Same! Was 20 something when raided HC wotlk 4 Times a week. Now I got a kid and GF, lucky to get 1/2 hours a day of play time. Don't matter since I love playing it and even though I don't got time to hardcore raid it's just fun questing.
---
Darkshore is amazing zone. But Jesus F. Christ, could they make the quest givers and quest targets any further apart?
---
ok cool, yeah ill google magic that real quick... i messed mine up bad, i can afford to erase them... but I can buy all my spells back. lol. thanks. ill reply with what I find!
---
It's because while Dalaran and Boralus seem to be full of life, it's really because it's all NPC's walking around.
---
Yeah. It's my first time playing vanilla, too.
---
Started WoW in WoD and played all the way until a few weeks in BfA.
---
I just switched from engineering to alchemy, and I must say I'm pretty happy that I did. My shaman really did not benefit from engineering apart from the dynamite, whereas alchemy is always useful (and not so complicated).
---
That’s fucked up , but fucking hilarious
---
I just hit 57 and took no time off work, it's just being efficient, the first week maybe no lifers, but now not so much.
---
I really like these small emotional bits that are in the game. 
---
The one that hit me the most was the cata quest in camp taurajo. I saluted every spirit and waited for it to disappear before going to the next one, and killed all looters (not only the ones I needed to complete the quest). and I’m not even a RPer!
---
Gotta say I was really glad to see all those npcs just “living” their daily lives in camp taurajo in classic
---
Warsong Gulch. Druids are the kings of Warsong Gulch.
---
And he took durability damage lol
---
from what i've seen this is wrong. it's imp coc&gt;imp frost&gt;piercing.
---
alliance scum
---
I’m a warlock on Whitemane
---
I remember a trip to stormwind on the family pc involved clicking "follow" on my friend and zooming in fully looking at the floor while it chugged along in single digits. The only time I could go into SW alone was at like 3am when most people were asleep.
---
Yeah just hit 7 days played at 57, getting hard but the goals right there and my guild needs me, enough to keep me going.
---
Demons are like ogres.
---
The higher the level compared to you, the further away they can see you. Lower levels than you have to be very close.
---
What's it like to be a filthy casual?
---
You mean something like Need before Greed?
---
I'm on deviate delight, have a 16 undead rogue right now.  It's my first RP and pvo server and I love it - gonna transfer my main (41 warrior) to DD.  
---
Seems like there's decent amount of role play.  I think it's like ally 60% horde 40%, so join us on the horde :D
---
( I do love it but only experienced it for 8 hours of gameplay so its a pretty small sample)
---
Not really. Normally people move to a different area to fill the gap. Unfortunately OP didn’t know he could take the underground train inside Ironforge to get to Stormwind
---
Purely "best"? Alchemy and Engineering. That's because every "crafting" profession give you some bonuses, while mining\herbalism\skinning just give you resources.  
---
But if you are looking for "best comfortable" selection - mining\blacksmithing is nice pick.
---
Pom Pyro
---
Training would be a hasle until you get Teleport: Moonglade spell, after which you can go there for training and HS back. I suggest staying in Elf starter zones until you get that.
---
I personally went from Elf starting zone to &gt; Darkshore &gt; Loch Modan &gt; Redridge and it works fine.
---
You could sell the stacks of silk on the AH for twice as much no ?
---
yea I also find it very easy
---
The other day it took me 57 Oozes. I honestly thought it was a bug at first....
---
I wonder if its unlockable in retail.
---
i have never played wow in my life and i have no clue what is going on here, but this is hilarious
---
No, it's to stop people like you from being TURNCLOAKS!
---
Well any stun will also lock you in air.. except charge stun maybe?
---
There is no worthy come back for this. You're right lol. I just wanna be your healslut.
---
I don't understand why people think Epic BoE items aren't fair game to need on.. It was a group effort to have it drop, if you don't like it you're free to solo farm the dungeons or simply do them only with trusted friends.
---
I don’t understand.
---
&gt;I am having an anxiety attack and could not function till i ate and got beer to calm my nervs.
---
Uninstall the game, you shouldn't be playing this game.
---
All of the streamers are on Faerlina, or at least all of the well known ones. Some are alliance but most are horde.
---
Why were you even wasting the int scroll on yourself?
---
Because classic servers don’t tell you the hp on mobs or targets unless they’re in your party or raid.  There are addons that will guess and cache the hp of mobs based on matching percentage damage to damage done numbers to find the total.
---
Yeah talking to a wall doesnt get much done
---
Ok, been playing Hunter as either my main or main alt since '04, you feign death and drop your trap and that gets you time to do your thing.  But here's the thing, it's bugged in Classic.  So you're a free kill.  It works "occassionally" and that's not good enough.  Imagine if a rogue's vanish worked "occasionally" or a Mage's frost nova worked "occasinally" and you get the picture.
---
FD/Trap is the core defining move for pvp in the Hunter skillset without it you're going to need to spec into Scattershot to have a chance and then you'll be using everything you've got with perfect actions and mad skills to stay on the level of even the most basic skill level players of other classes if you're not the one getting the jump.
---
I quit at level 35 on my hunter and just rerolled, felt terrible and nothing like the Vanilla experience where FD/Trap was reliable and extremely rare it failed but it's bugged right now and no word on a fix or even acknowledgement of the issue.  So if you're feeling like this now? It doesn't go away.  That's real.
---
I myself bit the bullet and rerolled to Mage and no problems there, working just fine.  I mained mage forever so wasn't much of a switch for me but I feel bad for Hunters right now, it's free kill status honestly and that just feels bad. Also why you're not seeing many, because it's fundamentally broken.
---
i actually wrote that without knowing your class. and then checked the pic again and found the bubble icon on your bar. intuition haha :D
---
Ah yes the tattoo post. Now someone needs to post a picture of them forcing their young child playing and r/classicwow will be just like every gaming sub.
---
hurray for rational thinking! spread the word!
---
Convinced my friend to reroll from mankrik to westfall horde... Regrets have been had
---
For the Horde!
---
I agree
---
Yea
---
A disgusting act!
---
Yeah but not like that clip.
---
Also because it's a lot more people that are leveling now and many don't have big guilds that can do enchantment for them. Give it a couple of months and we will see.
---
I’ve actually seen druids perform decently these days with a Heart of the Wild/Restro build. They absolutely are NOT DPS machines, but as a bear they can tank a surprising amount of burst.
---
I think the trap that most druids kind of fall into is that 1.) they go for quick kills and 2.) they try to out warrior warriors or out rogue rogues. A Druid that knows how to pivot around the class they are up against is pretty scary over all. Although, that being said, I think most druids don’t really commit to that so well. It seems like a lot of druids get into a mind set where they are just a cat or bear or caster or healer. Whereas the druids that I’ve seen have relatively decent success in PvP can effortlessly move between those roles (which is why I think that particular spec is so good since it’s such a flexible build)
---
It encourages you to go everywhere rather than retail where not only entire zones are skipped entire expansions too.
---
they never fucking do...
---
They sure helped in the third war didn't they?
---
alchemy looks fun... harvest... make pots... ahhhh dont be saying these things to me. Now i want to go make another char and do Alchemy and Skinning for gathering.... ahhhhhhhh. lol xD (lets stick with 2 and see if we can even get the support char to 60.. lol) 
---
If you ever feel like chating or are bored in que. Im normally on and @ twitch.com/choveswow . I started streaming when vanilla launched too..lol newb at everything right now. Im on Thalnos NA server... what server you runnin? Shaman horde or Alliance?
---
“Plus rogues are pretty boring”
---
Wut?
---
I think that's what he's saying, that it was intended (but made to look as a bug), and that they will change it back later

---
Rogues are boring? He should try ret paladin.
---
You can tank as arms or fury, just equip a shield. What’s important is that you hold threat which is easier with a fury or arms spec. It’s very common to tank with a 2h until the later levels and then at high gear levels at 60 to swap to duel wield tanking.
---
Very impressive, could be an NPC with how well put-together everything is.
---
Unless the staff was reserved beforehand all he did was not miss out on couple of hundred of gold.
---
If things not going your way give you anxiety attacks maybe you should reconsider playing this game.
---
Level 26 mage. I have enchanting (130ish) and tailoring (120ish)
---
Thinking of dropping tailoring and maybe going for skinning. I’m not sure tailoring is going to be that useful at 60. Any thoughts?
---
This guy would be great at marketing
---
cant hit me if i jump

Pretty sure this just means they haven't posted on the forum before.

Buffing someone in combat generates threat and puts you on the threat table for that mob. Also generating your resource puts you on the threat table aswell, for example if a warrior is in combat but hasn’t done anything to the mob and whoever the mob is targeting hasn’t done anything either and he uses blood rage to generate rage he will pull aggro off the guy not doing anything. Same goes for drinking, if you’re drinking in the same scenario you will pull threat.
---
This stuff is why Cataclysm was my favorite wow expansion, despite it's other flaws.
---
It was a chance to rediscover and re-explore the game world again, and it brought the playerbase back to the capitals and game world just like in vanilla.
---
”Divine Shield does not wipe threat, but mobs will ignore targets under the influence of Divine Shield unless there is no other valid target for them, which can lead to death of raid/party members if used in the wrong situation. On the other hand, if a Paladin healer or DPS pulls aggro, they can use Divine Shield to make the mobs ignore them.
---
It sometimes is helpful if a tanking Paladin activates the shield and then immediately remove the Divine Shield again (best through a macro) to instantly remove all harmful spells, but since this means a temporary aggro loss, it is highly dangerous.”

Me and my guild mate made frost mages at lvl 15 or so we kept this one higher level warrior frozen for a very long time. At least till his guild showed up.
---
20 lvl Frost Mage - What is the fastest way to make money? My professions are operating at break even at best. (After operating at a loss for long awhile) Money seems always to go to new spells,profession mats, etc. Grinding out quests is a logical answer, but at this level is there an accelerated way of acquiring $$$?
---
That little thing is called nostalgia and people who wish they'd be 14 again.
---
Yeah that corpse run is killer too, it's a looooong way from the GY. Also he had to have been too far out to rez from the hill, he had to jump down to the water to rez... and then swim all the way back around.
---
Regardless I didn't hang around to see, I actually swam towards Hillsbrad and logged out immediately in a nook on the coast, then went straight to making this video \^_^
---
Ive been casually playing wow since cataclysm but I'm really enjoying classic. I am however confused on how exactly I can find people to play with since theres no dungeon finder or anything, I'm only lvl 12 but even now there are elite quests i cant do alone.
---
I didnt know about aoe leveling either lol.  Whilest leveling i just dumped talents in all three trees, until someone told me I should pick a spec. Then i constantly respecced between frost and fire.
---
After finally reaching 70 I had 36 days /played haha
---
I’ll give you a conjured life stone
---
This makes me want to set up a config for my Steam Controller.
---
that's why people have brains.  A 300g item drops?  Everybody need is fair. Just see it as a 20% change jackpot lottery ticket and not as a gear upgrade.  Equal chance for everybody. 
---
A 1g87s boe green item drops?  all use greed, unless you can use and equip it, feel free to need.    It's not rational to play the 'everybody needs cash' card for 1g, but for 300g it certainly is. 
---
So where do you draw the line? Use common sense and your experience and you will work it out together.  Oh and it always helps to discuss this at the start of the run, when playing with strangers
---
Tailoring has a BiS robe for mages if I'm not mistaken? Might be pre-raid BiS however. Plus the ability to craft gear, if used wisely, can net you some cash later on.
---
Might not be worth it to pick up skinning now as you would have to back track and grind low level mobs to level it?
---
Dicks out.
---
I’m on phone so excuse formatting, you just need a simple macro. It will fall through and do what you want.
---
/petattack , with [target] with the name of the totem e.g “Grounding Totem”.  List all the important totems in the macro and the pet will attack your target, or if one of the totems exist it will attack the totem.
---
Wen I get in the computer I will update with a useable macro if someone hasn’t already.
---
Best zone in the game.
---
You guys have serious trust issues there. All this downvoting, talking about ninjas, holy crap, what game are you playing? Maybe different people and gaming experience in US servers, havent ever met garbage like this in EU.  Everyone "explaining" me what a ninja is, gosh. I played vanilla. Ofcourse Ive heard about them, you think those ninjas get invited to raids in the future? Why smear your name for some shit anyway.
---
I’ve seen streamers using an addon displaying a big number for the ilvl on top of the items in your character panel, what’s the name of the addon? It will make deciding which item to upgrade next much easier.
---
No, that guy is just delusional
---
Not only that: being Prot specced and geared, even at low levels, makes a big difference when questing, as threat increasing talents are very early in the Prot tree.
---
I get parties for everything, and at lvl 24 I managed quests like Stalvan's (which is 32) with the odd offheal: just manage shield block, taunts, Demo shout, and the others go to town on mobs and they love it.
---
Don’t worry. You can easily make enough gold for your mount between 35-40 if you spend enough time doing mob grind. Start with tigers in STV. Sell Bristly Whisker that they drop. It sells for 6s each and stacks up to 10. Skin them for extra silver. If you don’t have skinning, badlands is another good place to farm gold. Those earth elemental mobs drop stones and you can sell those to vendors as well.
---
Versus time lost at lvl 31 farming gold?
---
Im staying on my server (flamelash eu). It will be fking amazing when our bg queues are instant:)
---
im playing a shaman, but main back in the day was a warlock.   i used to think WOTF was not that great because i didnt think it would have won or lost me many fights as a warlock but a shaman if a warrior gets a charge off im basically dead
---
Lol nice explanation as to how I'm wrong. What I said clearly made sense, regardless of being right or wrong. Nice communication skills. 
---
Btw you're wrong and not making sense.
---
maybe you picked an empty realm? on lucifron-ger there are like 5 groups for every single ini open at all times
---
Prob cause you stayed in loch midan till 17.
---
How does warrior hamstring kiting work? Mobs can hit me from literal miles away.  Even if i can't hit them, they sure as hell can hit me.
---
Yeah, I play WoW and never go to gyms. I work as a paver, so I do plenty of heavy lifting at my job.
---
Wow
---
Let me explain the 'all need expensive items' school of thought.
---
BoE's are different than BoP's You can sell them. For some items, they are so desirable for somebody in some situation, that they are worth a LOT of gold, much more than the intrinsic utitlity value. A certain lvl 19 boe sword is worth 100g, while the exact same sword at lvl 20 would only be worth 3g.
---
So let's say a group of lvl 22's are doing Shadow Fang Keep . This sword drops. It's an upgrade for the rogue and the warrior. But both would be STUPID if they would equip it at lvl 20+ Because they can buy an equally good or better lvl 22 weapon for 5g and keep 95g.
---
That's why all 5 Need. Each can win the same 100g (or 95g + some AH buy)
---
This is an extreme example, because lvl 19 twink gear is special. But the same applies for money epics. You are a mage and staff of jordan drops? What do you prefer? 150g and a slightly worse weapon or 0g and the best weapon? since you will replace the staff anyway, almost everybody will chose the gold, and have a free mount + money for professions to spare...
---
So the staff is not for the party, but for the rich lvl 60 who buys it for his pimped alt. That is why all 5 NEED on the staff.
---
Stop seeing these items as gear upgrades, start seeing them as jackpot tickets , with a 20% win rate.
---
and remind yourself, sure, the mage rolls on your rogue weapon, but you can also roll on their mage stuff, so it's the same for all.
---
EVERYBODY has the exact same chance under this system, and ninjaing is NOT possible when everybody needs
---
WHEN TO USE THIS SYSTEM?
---
IMHO only for big money items. for low value stuff, just use greed and need when it's an upgrade you will use.
---
I've played both sides forever and hands down Horde has it easiest.  Alliance has a bunch of continent hopping whereas horde just chill in Kalimdor which the Alliance rarely ever goes to and is always outnumbered there, even Ashenvale which is usually Horde dominated due to early quests for Alliance there being sparse and you'd be better off elsewhere at that level for Alliance.
---
Horde basically (most horde heavy pvp servers) have 1000 Needles, StoneTalon, Swamp of Sorrows and Desolace pretty much all to themselves to get them through the dry spell that the Alliance have, I mean Alliance still quest there but are always desperately outnumbered in those zones so grouping is harder and getting ganked is life and everything like that is a real concern.  Then you've got a nice Tanaris to Southern STV to Badlands thing to keep you busy until you're 50.  After 50 questing really picks up for everyone as the end zones open up.
---
So in short Horde has way less "dry spells" when questing.  But all that being said, in the end the Alliance have it better due to most of the time in game spent in and around Blackrock Mountain and Alliance having better access to that part of the world overall.  But for leveling absolutely it's easiest for Horde in my experience in retail and private servers over the years no doubt, for the above stated reasons.
---
Yup. At lvl 30 I had like 10g, I'm now 35 with 35g, just do quests.
---
From what I understand, those addons are actually showing the durability of each item. ilvl as such doesnt exist in classic.
---
Thats because of the spellcleave losers.  They think it helps them level faster.  Its going to be funny laughing at them all bitching about competition for raid gear though.
---
Maybe this’ll help
---
Try binding your bread and butter heal to up+down scroll and/or use a mouse over macro/addon (I used clique on a pserver recently, I dont know what the Classic equivalent is). Makes healing the wrong target a thing of the past, and spamming the same spell super simple. Just make sure your arm is in an ergonomical/relaxed position!
---
2v1d a 60 mage and 60 warrior on my 57 Shaman yesterday WHILE fighting a mob. Felt amazing. The warrior charged me with like 15% hp for some reason, I guess he thought i was an easy target?. I WF 1 shotted him and then outlasted the mage's mana.

Good to hear.

i fought plenty of the crocodiles that have the crystal gaze in stv.  unless i grounding totem or earth shocked it felt like i got hit with the stun every time
---
as we try to explain in dozens of posts and threads, your system works fine with all bop gear and normal low value boe greens.
---
But we are talking here about those special jackpot cash items, that are irrational to equip for anybody, and get sold to rich ah tycoons or lvl 60s pimping their alts or twinks.   Please read other posts for detailed explanation
---
:(
---
This site is amazing, you see A/H/ ratio and somewhat the population
---
&gt;Retail has actual boss mechanics and has evolved to challenge the ever growing skill the player base has.
---
Sure but most of the elitists are actually playing normal raids and outgearing the content to beat it. They want the best, but they aren't the best themselves. It's an attitude, not a skill level. 
---
Considering the prevelance of full raid finder lfr heroes I think wow raids are right on par for the level of skill many players bring to the table. Didn't blizzard come out and say they made lfr because most people never did raids? I know I've been in guilds that couldn't clear the first boss of the first raid after it was old content.
---
Go into a city and right click on your chat window. Go to channels and you will see all available channels. Join Looking For Group and Trade. You can also write /join world, so you join the world chat. But keep in mind that the world channel isn't blizzard moderated. /1, General chat is good for local quests and dungeons. In classic communication is key! 
---
On my server when I join LFG (/3) and the world channel, my chat explodes.

Weak Auras, or just pay attention to when it says your attack was dodged.

Nope, game internally rerolls for each person who tied.

My hunter is lvl 47 and currently looks like someone bloodvomited on him.

Can't even find it on the website (where I created them) :/
---
That's not the combat log on the bottom right of my screen, that's Tuk's default "Other" tab. It's actually just a chat tab with custom filters to show things that are normally in the combat log. When I first started using it I pulled the combat log out of the left box and put it over there (nixing the "Other" tab as well) but I found that limitations in the client itself couldn't be gotten around, like making the "What Happened to Me?" popups and such go away.
---
What I ended up doing is leaving the combat log where it was on the left and just sticking things I needed to see on the "Other" tab (things like tradeskills and such). 
---
I use *Spy* (a combat log parser) so I don't need to see enemy player stuff in that window, since Spy always notifies me anyway.
---
If you ever want to reset the Tuk chat windows, use "/tukui chat reset".

At one point he was hired by blizzard to do some work, they never said on what, but his style and the timing makes me think the [7.3 trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0N2XcaMsmOU) was at least in part Hurricane's doing.
---
Why won't they?
---
And yes, they are just starter accounts beside my one main account, that I have for years now.
---
Horde failed taking Ironforge as well
---
It’s literally the definition of “greed” 😂
---
This is why I never roll until I’ve seen how the rest of the group is going to treat it.
---
Nothing to worry about since you play on non-pvp server
---
It’s a little late to make the swap, you’d have to go back to grind the herbs or ore or skinning. You can make money from tailoring selling bags or mooncloth. With enchanting you can make a lot of money if you have a rare recipe. Even without you generally enchant someone with their mats and they’ll tip you (typically 10s). Whatever you would do now would likely be less efficient than just levelling and selling trash.
---
Highly recommend google chrome remote login. Get used to your servers queue lengths and the times of them and plan ahead. You’ll be golden.
---
This lmfao
---
I've gone Arms so I can stance dance and maintain rage. Gonna get to MS asap (lvl 40) then get the 5% crit chance in Fury tree.
---
Tanking is much easier if you can charge in and get 20+ rage instantly (I've also macroed Bloodrage with charge so every 1 minute I get over 30 rage as soon as I charge in) which means I can get a couple of sunders off instantly so dps can start nuking instantly.
---
I feel you man.  Today was the first time since Classic launched that I've encountered toxic people.  I'd tried to talk to them politely and explain how classic is different from retail, but was promptly told to STFU and was called a pu\*\*\*.   That's when it hit me.....The hype of Classic is turning into truth for everyone, and since retail is mostly barren now, those that play like that are moving over to Classic.  I'm hoping we can weed them out or that they'll learn soon.  That said though I'd be lying if I said I wasn't afraid that the same type of people that cried out to Blizz in the first place and turned WoW to the garbage it is today, won't now try to do the same thing to Classic all over again.  
---
Until today, Classic has been nothing but great feels and great community.  But today I certainly felt like I was playing retail all over again, only this time the toxic mouths actually had to speak, and it sucked.  SMH 
---
I'm not gonna stop playing though.  I'll just try harder to find a good group/guild.  And as for the toxic ones, ...I've got my own spreadsheet where I keep up with the names of those that are really nice to play with and those that I'll never group with again or cast a heal on.  ....At least we have single servers again where rep matter.
---
Lol leveling a warrior is absolute hell and definitely the least noob friendly class so props to you
---
blind and sap. Use those back to back and you can reset stun DR. I can explain more about rogues to you if you want. Rogues are not nerfed at all lol
---
I finished this quest for the first time two weeks ago and I gotta say these stories really bring out the RPG element.
---
Haha. Okay
---
Thats like it always was
---
1,000,000 cool points
---
Yeah it’s nice but non-essential.
---
Your normal approach to solo mobs will be 3x frost bolt, nova, strafe a few steps back, 2x frost bolt. I find that’s usually enough to deal with any mob up to 2 levels above me but sometimes they may need a fireblast to finish them off.
---
All a frostbite proc would do is save me a bit of mana as it’ll probably take one less spell to defeat the mob.
---
Where it is quite useful is vs ranged mobs as it can give you shatters when you normally might not get them. Ranged mobs become a lot more manageable once you get ice barrier though and in most cases, you can nova them and stand in their ‘dead zone’ similar to actual Hunters.
---
Don’t take it if you want to AoE.
---
The thing is, mages are so overly powerful that 1v1 it's almost no point vs most classes. It is frustrating for all of us, plus they can AoE grind elites and make more gold than anyone else easily. They also top the raid charts pretty easily. Why anyone plays anything but mage for a farmer I'll never understand, it's easily the most played class on my realm(11,400 of em according to census) vs the second most played class(Warrior @ 7k) it's STUPID how many mages there are. But as multiple streamers have shown, you can raid with only mages, 2 tanks, and 4 healers like Asmond did and down rag in under an hour and a half.
---
how much are those worth?
---
Luna still works great for me
---
Going by the Hooped Earrings and Volatile Rum, I'd say the pirates in Tanaris.
---
Hamstring is used to turn the fight into 1:1 hit ratio, so download weapon swing.
---
You use sunder armor and auto attacks, later execute if it’s a single mob.
---
This improved my day.
---
Isn't that the goblin rocket helm failing?
---
That's what I thought though
---
I understand that. except you cant get far enough away in the 3.8s it takes for your swing timer to fill up again. they can still hit you, from MILES, away. its kind of dumb the range they get.
---
thunderfury is fun
---
Depends what class you're fighting. Most cases you want to sap, cheapshot on a 45 degree angle expose armor. If you do it right you won't break sap. So basically making you have 2 point expose armor on your opener. This works against most classes. But you'll want level 58 or w/e it is for max rank sap.
---
 Otherwise just make sure to have crippling poison, cheapshot, gouge and try to restealth (must have imp gouge). There's a .5 second window where they can attack you but most of the time they don't do it fast enough (spam the hell out of stealth).
---
From there it depends what spec you are, daggers or swords/hemo etc.
---
Well, hate to break it to you but that's your problem if you go to play a 15 year old game you know everything about.
---
You can either ignore your knowledge and just pick what you feel is cool or simply go play something new that you don't know anything about to get that feel again without knowing you're willingly picking something weak.
---
Can't AoE grind for tons of cash, not nearly as many survivability tricks for 3v1/2v1, much slower to level due to lack of AoE, a great priest will kill an average mage, but a great mage will dominate a great priest.
---
I wouldn't even be mad, that shit was pretty cool.
---
Ya, I love ppl trying to give some sort of reasonable answer, but in reality its just to play a A LOOOOOOOOT
---
If you are lv60 and do lv50+ quests you get 2-5g per quest.
---
Also you get like 10g per dungeon per 1 hour
---
If you die on the boat don't release, you'll get a res after the loading screen
---
I used to play a game called darkeden a long time ago that had a similar language barrier system. Although at the time there were only two races so there wasn’t really the detail like with gutterspeak as you mentioned.

yeah ? u gonna duel inside a dungeon ? good luck w that

Which ones are they :)?

There are guides on classic wowhead for most class builds which include pre-raid bis.

Not sure why you got downvoted - I agree with you. +1

Lvl 32 alliance rogue. Should i quest in desolace or STV? I get killed a lot more in STV than in desolace. I'm like 3-4 quests in for both zones

Hi warlock here. Rank 13 the first time.

This change if intended makes sense.

I’d put bills in the horde jar just to be spiteful.
---
Gz man.
---
As others said, IMO 225 skin is enough to net you some more money with heavy and thick skins (I'm vendoring heavy and auction thick). Costs too much for what it could give, because next thing after mount at 40 for me is gonna be a swap to engineering

There's no input lag if your computer is using an ethernet cable and you have good quality Wi-Fi.

I did the Firehardened Chest and was super happy about it, put in quite abit of time and got some friends to take out time to help, only to find that SM GY drops a better tanking chest. It’s not a guaranteed drop, but it’s a nice dungeon at your level, and will be super fast to speed-run.
---
No, thank *you* for being 60 and not in STV right now.
---
Looking for the same! I don't get why people like one big bag, how is it organised!
---
Type /who. It'll show people in your zone around your level. Whisper some people and talk in zone chat for more nerds to play with.
---
Well you can either write some column for our newspaper, or start your own - actually, what we used and I can recommend is Arthur (https://www.newspaperclub.com/) which pretty much just does the job for a fun paper of this scale.
---
Awesome I think that’ll be my build for 60 for awhile probably until p2. Unless I end up really wanting improved cs for open world encounters
---
Disagree. sPriests are fantastic duellers but the lack of mobility options hurt them a great deal in solo roaming. Anyone who doesn’t want to fight you can escape you and you have no tools to escape a bad situation.
---
I'm not familiar with how the story works in WoW, but how did she die to the same mob that is killed in the story progression of vanilla wow?
---
Different schools of spelm deal different damage type: fireball deals fire damage, frostbolt deals frost damage and etc. 
---
Since you are shadow priest. +10 shadow damage will only increase damage of shadow spells like mind blast, mind flay, SW:P . It wont increase damage of Smite or Holy shock.
---
So you've completely misconstrued what I've said; well done.  All I said was that if you took that attitude with me I'd tell you to fuck off.  I also said, if you're capable of reading it, that I ***give the shit away all the time and never expect tips***.
---
Pull your head out of your ass; the smell is clearly messing with your brain.
---
I assume they just disagree for whatever reason. Maybe the Electrocution Leg isn't a good weapon for rogues, or maybe there's a better weapon earlier, or maybe players shouldn't run Gnomeregan at level 26, or maybe you should never ever ask a group to carry you.
---
Or maybe I just smell funny.
---
Efficiency kills the experience. But some people don’t care about the world they just wanna game the system, because their enjoyment comes from (essentially) comparing dick sizes.
---
It makes me feel sorry for them because they aren’t able to enjoy the artistry and aesthetics because of their crippling inferiority complex.
---
So congrats, power levelers: you have gained the world but lost your soul.
---
Gj mate. Whats ur professions?
---
It's intended. Enchants do not get replaced by totem buffs. They simply should not be applied in first place.
---
Probably has a lot to do with Pagle being overpopulated.
---
Why would you do such a thing
---
"Losers" lol. You have fun laughing from the sidelines whilst they actually raid because noone will take non mages to groups.
---
All classes have issues. Elite tames for hunters don't retain the elite name plate. Druids have shifting bugs etc etc.

Draenai were announced very late. And we had no images of em. Everyone thought Alliance will get ugly broken draenai, while Horde gets Blood Elves. And even blood elves males had other model at preview that time. People who wanted to play paladins on the Horde started outrage forcing Blizz to make make em more muscular.
---
Sunder armor is your biggest aggro tool. That and revenge. Focus on using these abilities over others. Demo shout is just okay but does a little bit of aoe threat.

Taunt puts you at the top of the threat table and forces a mob to attack you. When you taunt make sure you follow it with at least 1 sunder or the mob will likely go back to who it was fighting before. 
---
Your threat while in defensive stance is much higher. So you’ll do better while in defensive. Some stance dancing can be helpful, but it doesn’t need to be a key element throughout fights. 
---
Marking Skull and X for dps to focus on can help a lot. 
---
Here is a mega basic macro to mark a target with skull. You can also set keybinds for markers in the keybind settings.

Best of luck out there.

No fun allowed.
---
Well 6 ap is still probably huge for the warrior too. 
---
Just because it has agi doesnt make it a rogue piece. Warriors are worse than hunters when it comes to gear.
---
I remember getting absolutely shithoused by Borelgore in vanilla. A few times.
---
I saw somewhere on a reddit links to site accumulating info on server horde/ali ratio, class distribution etc. Can anyone share the link, please?
---
This is so strange to me. I wish I would be on the minority side on my server. Would trade places with you anytime.
---
Total populations seem inaccurate. I play on Flamelash EU and while still being high pop almost all of the time, it’s not nearly as often full as Mograine is. However, the data still says Flamelash has more players than Mograine does. I guess it’s possible but unlikely.
---
Oh wow thanks for clarifying. I usually know that, seems like i had a brainlag...
---
Omg Roman spend some raaaaaage
---
Time to roll a mage.
---
Rend doesn’t produce nearly enough threat to spend rage on. I only use it if I have solid agro on everything and even then it’s questionable. It might be better to pool the rage for the next group.
---
Did you just vendor the leather and cloth, or did you use AH?
---
Badlands is great at that level, STV too. Tanaris I would go to closer to 45
---

Rename this what it's like being a dwarf lol, y'all didnt even get to tha pet
---
I've rolled Tauren and war stomp is useful everytime it's off cooldown. Let's you heal, save a group from a wipe, run away and combo lightning bolts and shocks together.  I know orc is technically the best race for pvp and troll for pvp but neither have such a useful on demand stun.
---
I don't think Gnome would be a good choice, believe me.
---
*You think you do, but you don't*
---
If you are using drain tanking i suppose you are using succubus.
---
1st. When you get get attacked seduce them! Get a macro to seduce people on mouseover, it will make your time easier.
---
 If its a melee which can break/immune seduce and fear, cast amplified CoE, run, dot, on safe distance try casting, fear them after immunity disappears.
---
If its a caster dot them up, use curse of tongues if they cast a lot. Try to fear them, if you get interupted, spam searing pain/wand.
---
Always have a healthstone, healing potion and a soulstone. Consider wearing a spellstone(and using it!) if you are in a pvp heavy zone. Get more stamina. You NEED to survive in order for your DoTs to gain tempo.
---
Sure let's give one class the ability to wipe out a whole lowbie town whenever they feel like it because it was a clear oversight in development 15 years ago.
---
Why not bring back Geddon's bomb on pets as well? Or maybe even the curse of Hakkar?
---
Some of you are so obsessed with griefing that you try to pass a normal behavior as a game breaking bug and whine really hard to make it look like you care about anything else than wiping out players and towns when you're bored.
---
Pull your head out of your ass, nobody wants 20 warlocks on one server killing all the lowbie towns and completely halting the leveling of others except your selfish self. You probably didn't even think about the implications of this, you just wanna play god for a few minutes.
---
Staffs or 2h maces are usually best since druids just care about raw stats on a weapon. The DPS or weapon speed do not matter for a druid. 
---
Equip the item with the best stats

I played wow for years and always used shitty all in one bags. I found CargBags Nivaya yesterday and it's the best thing ever. Search on Willitclassic.com 🙏

It depends on how the economy is. On my server light and medium leather sell for basicly vendor price so i just sell it to npc. Cloth was good and always sold on AH 50ish silver a stack(wool or silk). Vendor linen or just give to lvl 5 mage or something
---
Spirt set is my go-to. Absolutely amazing Regen. 120 hps out of combat. That with a bandage and I'm full health in no time.
---
You kinda need to better define by what you mean by solo PvP but I’m going to assume you mean fighting players out in the world as that’s all that is available at the moment.
---
For that, you want to pick a class that has good mobility so it can finish it’s kills and escape when you feel the odds are stacked against you. This rules out 4 classes right away: warriors, paladins, priests and warlocks. Two of those are excellent duellists but the lack of mobility will get you group ganked a lot.
---
Next you need to find a class that is decent in 1v1s as those are going to be your bread and butter as a solo wPvPer. That rules out warriors, paladins &amp; shamans.
---
So some good options are: 
---
Rogue or Druid - both have access to stealth and escape mechanics giving you lots of survivability. Rogues are definitely more powerful with more burst and control but druids are extremely hard for your opponents to pin down as they can shift out of snares/roots and use travel form to escape bad situations.
---
Hunters - track humanoids and track hidden to make sure you’re always the one initiating combat on your terms. Whilst not quite as good as stealth, it’s damn useful! You have great damage and excellent kiting tools so against certain classes you’re almost untouchable if you can initiate from range. DoT classes are your counter so steer clear of them using tracking an superior mobility.
---
Mage - a hard-counter to the most popular class in the game (warriors). Poly makes 1v2s possible and huge burst is useful for securing quick kills. Shadow priests and locks wreck you but thanks to blink, they can’t catch you if you wish to avoid them. A decent option but mages excel more in groups where their control becomes downright OP.
---

---
this one?
---
I saw a guild called General Goods. That one's got me a couple times cause those NPCs are normally just randomly standing in buildings.
---
Lmao except mages arent really that great dps until BWL and AQ.  As a decent healer and a priest, i dont usually struggle to find a raidspot and theres only a handful of people i share loot with.  So yeah, ill laugh all day long as mages melt down fighting over loot like warriors over ashkandi.
---
And theyre losers because 90% of spellcleave groups are a waste of time between wiping and resetting and trying to orchestrate the perfect pull which always fails.  Surprisingly, most mages really suck at their class (even though they posture like theyre gods gift to wow).
---
Its a giant waste of time but they all think its an amazing way to level because they get one decent large pull done and circle jerk over all the xp from it....despite it taking them 3 wipes and replacing multiple group members to get to that point.
---
If I remember correctly it is in UC at the shadow tailor master in the mage district
---
And in this corner we have the fury warrior in berserker stance chain pulling elites without a shield on

Hes just talking about the lost 'magic' it is nostalgia

That skinning knife needs to go on the mantle
---
And nobody ever took the elevator again without clenching their butt hole.
---
That’s why I’m single. Yeah... that’s why
---
No one knows yet. But presuming they don't do anything new with it, I'd imagine a lot of the PvE-focused players will begin to leave a year or 2 after the last Phase release.
---
Having said that, I can imagine the game keeping a healthy number of casual players and PvPers, as those 2 camps of people are less influenced by the lack of new content. 
---
Who knows what would happen though if they did a Classic+ or started giving the Classic treatment to TBC, etc.
---
I just healed instances. And i was doing great. The tank i have been running with was surprised when i told him i had not trained in 10 levels. Which is really surprising because after that he told me he's fury.
---
Retaliation counter attacks everything for so many seconds as long as you are facing it so you had it right. Or rather it can save your ass in a pinch too against multiple mobs.
---
In vanilla I became friends with 4 other people from around the globe and we did all dungeons together up to 45 as a warlock, 2x hunter, mage, and shaman. The shaman main tanked while main healing. Every pull was coordinated and it was a blast.
---
Make about 30 gold selling lether 50+ lvl and half of the lether is from not my mobs

Neither, you require + hit till cap period. It doesn't really matter what your stats are, it's +hit

I don’t farm for gold pre-60 because with every additional level gained, your potential gold per hour increases dramatically.
---
Just focus on levelling. You’ll get your 40 mount eventually. 
---
Once you get to 60 you can farm gold effectively (and boy, you will need to!!!).
---
Bullshit. Before the mage class patch mages were pretty mediocre and winning against any caster or healer was pretty unlikely unless you specced Arcane Power / Pyro
---
Happened to me when I was getting ganked by a bunch of Horde as a mage. They chased after me to the platform, I blinked towards elevator and, with low HP, I jumped onto the elevator then Ice Blocked.
---
Thing is, if you Ice Block, it stops you mid-space whatever you were doing. 
---
So for an awkward 6 seconds I watched as a Hunter and Warlock waited for me mid-air floating with 12% HP as my ride left 1 mile down.
---
Luckily, they were too busy /laughing and /patting my little gnome ass and I just slow falled down the rest of the journey xD
---
Time to get out then.
---
I understand that. I just think that saying "that's not how MMO character picks are supposed to work" when talking about a 15 year old game is... Unwise.
---
That's like going to USA and expecting cowboys and bandits and "wild west".
---
You can remind yourself how it was 15 years ago. Remember it and cherish the memories. You can't relive it. The world is a different place and you're a different person.
---
And my opinion: every character pick in any game is supposed to work like this: "pick something that will bring you fun"
---
For someone that means cool hair. For someone a vision of epic stuff they might do. For someone a guarantee of good numbers. For someone being valuable to your group composition.
---
There's no one perfect reason to pick a character, it's individual. If others pick differently than before, it's because their interest shifted and this is what they enjoy now.
---
And if you pick differently... That means your interest shifted as well. And cool is no longer enough. And you should accept that you're a different person now.
---
There is an internal value related to any item that was used to assign values to items (as far as I understood that) which is the item level. But it's a value that isn't relevant in classic since a lot of items are just used for the on use/passive effect it applies
---
You totally can, but MM pulls threat like a bastard vs a none beast master spec pet.
---
You'll either need to slow down your opening burst, or just get use to kiting every kill
---
Golden pearl worth about 10g I believe, the other two are less, but drop chances for every pearl is pretty low so getting three of them at the same time is very lucky
---
Wow head classic is probably the best database and chances are dungeon gear will be best indoor till 60
---
If you're asking about addon then it's Ark Inventory
---
I am pretty sure it proposed me Judgement when I tried. Maybe it is for the 2 severs?
---
Where did it drop
---
Correct (except for exceptions like manual crowd pummeler
---
The other day I got MC'ed by a random priest running by. Sighing and resigning myself to a slow death I was pleasantly surprised when the priest just cast Fort on me and ran off.
---
You see, the problem is the only thing I find fun about WoW is the end game PvE content. The longer dungeons, and the raids.
---
If I want to have fun with the game, which I know I can, I have to suffer through at least 55 menial, repetitive, grindy, and stale levels of kill, gather, and collect quests.
---
In before "reeee go back to retail". Half the player base still runs AoE cleave dungeon spam to skip as much questing as possible.
---
Cool thanks man, I'll await the correct format.
---
So basically every PvP server?
---
Awesome video but sorry just a quesiton. Isn't it harder to play with 2 1hand weapons as a warrior as you level? I heard warriors get a really big hit chance penality as soon as they use 2 weapons and you should level with a 2hander until 60 and you can get some hit% gear.
---
Good, got balanced sleeping pattern, social life and work life. You?
---
I just realised my friend got divorced 2 years ago. Just another random rant lol
---
I can't say what you are doing wrong, it also depends on your class.
---
It does 😌 You hit the earth as a giant ice cube but you're safe when you thaw
---
Nothing wrong with that, play how you want my man. Just trying to answer your question.
---
Theres 27 cents in the alli jar...... big spenders. .
---
I played in vanilla on a PvP server with a major faction imbalance. It wasn’t so bad.
---
It was even really fun at times, running small skirmishes against the opposing faction and being a nuisance.
---
Wasn't a free transfer provided to everybody? I got a bit worried when I saw the shop button at the login page but saw the only thing it had was a free transfer.
---
I feel so sorry for warriors. Especially the ones who are up for SVT....
---
Yes, thank you very much
---
And yet this is *literally* how English works.
---
Glad I'm not the only one who has done this.
---
Depends on time and angle.
---
ClassicAuraDurations
---
December 2006 only puts this one month before BC launch. We certainly knew everything Draenai by then.
---
But is it really much cheeper for warlock when you have to buy all those spells for your pets?
---
took me 5, and I got my yummy bag. It's ok, I'm a warrior though, so you know I was suffering in other ways anyhow.
---
I don't think that's a stun, but an incapacitate.
---
Always said it. Content is the least important part of this this game. It's all about how you do it.
---
For example, I had a lot more fun at the end of the 14th month at the end of MoP than I ever had since
---
I guess it depends, to a casual player, I have about 7 days played now since release but nowhere have I been exclusively playing on my time off.
---
Looks dope - is it strong for the 30-39 bracket?
---
He got hired by Blizzard after making these. So it kinda got real real quick.
---
Just by default I think Classic wow looks better than BFA.
---
Wow didn't know that
---
Can not relate. I’m on a medium population server which becomes a “full” server at peak times. AoE farming outside of instances is impossible.
---
I got mine by 41lvl doing quests and selling the stuff I don't need. In general don't buy or don't upgrade spells that aren't vital and don't buy stuff from the AH like items or bags.
---
I mean, it kind of depends on severity and all.  Getting owned by an infernal once might be funny, but if it was frequent and to the point of constant griefing it would be bad.
---
Generally though allowing breadth of experience is fun.  It's always fun to come across a player kiting an elite somewhere and watch it murder stuff.  Or to see the chaos of players camping an enemy faction boat.  If stuff like that happens every once in a while, it's good and entertaining.  Just not every day.
---
A bit funny to see these numbers to me. My friends have been complaining about our server being so extremely hord heavy and I have been saying that there is no way that is true, they may be a bit more but it looks fairly even to me. With results in hand it is 44% Aliance 56% hord, that is pretty even and no where close to the 70+% hord my friends have been claiming.
---
Hahaha i get too distracted when i try to focus on quests😂 i walk 10 meters, why is that boar lookin at me? SHOOT IT
---
ere... whatever happened to the daily blink?
---
Absolutely baffling, and watch them jerk eachother when they agree.
---
This is nothing but griefing your own faction, it isnt funny for the people it affects now and wasnt back then. WoW version of "it's just a prank bro!!!!!"
---
Group up with other players around you doing the same quest, especially kill quests. If Horde attack you, punish them. Even if your group dies you will slow them down by taking one or two out. Res, regroup and attack them when they are busy with mobs.
---
Sometimes you have to flex your muscle. The best defense is a good offense. If you’re in a group, kill every solo Horde in sight, pick off any easy target. Sometimes they’ll group up or call for help and roll you but more often than not the solo players scatter and will avoid the area or stay on the fringes. That means less Horde around to attack you and more quest mobs for your group. (None of this applies if your server has a big faction imbalance)
---
If grouping is not an option try fighting mobs slightly out of sight. Drag a mob to the other side of a hill or behind a tree and fight it there. Stay on the fringes and keep your head in a swivel. One less horde that notices you is one less potential attack.
---
I’ve spent way too much time in STV this weekend. Hope this helps.
---
Atlasloot will show you what bosses drop but that doesn’t look up bis for you.
---
I'm actually seeing it written as 
---
LF HEALER SM SPAM
---
And I'm like.. well yes.. that is spam.
---
Honestly, you might have a point here. Haven‘t thought about that! Damn.
---
Blaumeux 50/50 boiiiii
---
Yes you can block them. 
---
Then you know that since you have them blocked, it was probably for a reason.
---
Questing is grinding with tiny little mini-goals. Read the quests, learn some lore, and you'll start seeing your character as a character and not an empty vessel anymore. Your character will have seen things, done things, remember being the hero of this village or that zone. They'll have stories about how they barely survived killing an elite mob, how they almost died to them until another hero came along and helped them just in time. Questing creates stories. Stories create character.
---
Questing also earns you money, items and rep.
---
Holy fucking health and mana potions.  I go through those things like crazy, I'd love if I had that many after a grinding session.
---
this is a weird ass hatejerk over """retail""" considering there's no solution to that 'problem'.
---
They did! They made a movie a couple years back.
---
Everyone is telling you, you're doing something wrong.  So the proper response is put your fingers in your ears and scream "you're not a real loot council, you're all out to get me!"
---
Normal people don't struggle to do the right thing.
---
It was always easy to find a lvl 60 group.
---
Zul Farrak was the first dungeon I ever got a group for when I levelled my vanilla characters.
---
Should just give the free transfer from [Over populated faction] on that server, wait to see how the balance goes, and then if necessary offer a free transfer to [Under populated faction]
---
Ty
---
Well if you are IN the pack you will have lots of groups going on and lots of people to chat with in the zone.
---
Lvl 28 ftw! \^\^
---
Sounds like it could be the DNS server if all devices lose their connection, might be worth changing the router DNS servers to Google's: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4
---
Have you considered trying to figure out what you're doing wrong, instead of blaming your groups for expecting minimum effort?
---
"Haha! I've been waiting for a real challenge!"
---
Why is engi particularly useful for tanks? Curious
---
This needs to be higher up lol.
---
When you get to max level in classic you will also get the latest Battle for Azeroth expansion for retail and a level boost there for free. 
---
So eventually you can try out both pretty efficiently, in my opinion current endgame retail content is pretty underwhelming but the game still looks very nice with some beautiful zones and has a ton of fun solo content and immersive quests, I think that's the only part of retail that might be worth your time.
---
this is fuckin amazing
---
Hunter is super fast, im 27 right now with 24h 15m played
---
They don't think it pvp like it is but it do
---
I could never quite put my finger on why I missed OG WoW so much before. Since playing Classic, i've figured out what I was missing. It's the chaos. The chaos of mobs, fights, quests, and even the land itself. Playing retail requires the equivalent brain usage of playing farmville. Classic enables you to employ strategic positioning and tactical forward thinking to complete many of the quests; because deaths are very punishing and your time invested into a quest often leaves you feeling accomplished in the end.
---
This is complete bullshit and needs to be fixed ASAP. A Warlock losing control of a powerful demon and having it just \*poof\* out of existence is a huge blow to class flavour and power fantasy.
---
&gt;I hope that this game doesn't die off. 
---
That's for you to decide.
---
Dungeons and raids dont change. 
---
If you don't have fun in them or with pvp.
---
You'll lose interest. 
---
I have zero interest in retail wow for as long as classic exists.
---
It's up to you whether or not you'll stick with classic.
---
Classic won't die out unless they add mtx.
---
Im still lvl 35 but i was so busy last week i didn't even have time to launch the game :(
---
who gives a shit how good your threat is, threat is pointles if you're dead.. people will have to spam heals to keep you alive, every pull will be oom for both tank and healer.. its dumb
---
Dominos can make transparent w/o mouseover. I think you can make macro for show bars but need to know lua or someone who know.
---
What you do in the game is not cannon, for exemple in the lore it is Varian and not the adventurers that have killed Onyxia.
---
r/doggohate
---
I totally want that. Internals aren't a big threat in capital cities where elite guards and NPCs are swarming the place. And it only takes 2 relatively good 60s to take one out if you drop it elsewhere, 1 60 could manage of it's been whittled down by lower level guards, I distinctly recall coming to the aid of some low levels in Menethil Harbour in Vanilla while the lock that dropped it was cussing me out in whispers for spoiling his fun.
---
Why is this not higher rated? The trailer is absolutely amazing!
---
I can't right click my windfury/rockbitter/flametongue weapon. It doesn't work
---
ya it's look so cool
---
What is the fishing add on?
---
I dont see the option ..
---
Is it worth it? Is the sleep patterns, most likely falsified social life (we are all on reddit after all...), and work life really worth not being able to stomp a lv 30 opposite faction player into the ground?
---
Yup, this is by far the most reasonable way to handle loot in dungeons.
---
Fishing Buddy
---
Is it good game design? Probably not
---
But that's not the real question here. The question is, in a game trying to replica the design of vanilla, should the design/mechanics be different? The answer to that question is also "probably not".
---
Adibags does that, by default it shows one big bag, but if you click on the little bag icon it will show what's in every single bag
---
They already have your money, they don't care.
---
So, this was something I did see. But, is there a way to make my router/modem have this as a DNS server automatically? Please forgive me, I'm not too terribly great with modems. When trying to figure it out, I was seemingly able to set a DNS on my computer itself, which I chose the same you posted above, but part of me wonders if I even did it correctly. Should I be trying to set it up on each computer, or is there a way to change my modem itself to this, affecting anything connected to it?
---
Probably shouldn’t have rolled on a high pop server then pal
---
I think it contributed a lot. Just today we wiped twice in Gnomeregan and still completed the dungeon. Why? Because we were invested: it took us time to assemble the group, collect the quests, and travel to the dungeon. Why would you spend 5min on a corpse run when the next dungeon is a click and only 1min away?
---
Pet Bombs and curse of Hakkar are different because they were patches when pre-BC was retail. 
---
The question is which part of vanilla to use classic. At no point during vanilla was this nerf on Infernals/Doomsguards in place. Therefore it's not an option.
---
We might as well "rebalance" talents and spells if you think this change is acceptable.
---
I had the same issue. I found out it was Firefox messing it up. Not sure if it was a setting or an addon i had installed. But i tried it with Edge and i was able to post.
---
Bugs? Yeah, great game.
---
I always said this! Albeit s little expensive, still viable! :) Everyone else just jumping on the hype train of he say she say, thanks for posting this :)
---
You dont need to be lvl 10 in BFA.
---
Bis mage ring btw.
---
This thing can last you until your Archmage's Robe from LBRS if you wanna. It's absolutely worth the grind!
---
back with another video for you
---
I’m a 36 horde rogue and only have 40g+. Where is a good place I should solo to farm up the gold I need for mount?
---
I love being able to have free time before work, waking up just in time for work only makes the entire day feel like I'm only working.
---
"I cast Frostbolt but he didn't die???? Vurtne lied to me."
---
Well that's because you're confusing the horde and the forsaken. For the Forsaken here the threat ranking :
---
* Anything that is a direct threat to the forsaken (scourge and scarlet crusade)
---
* Anything that believe in the Light 
---
* Any humans believing Lordaeron belong to humans 
---
* Any member of the Alliance 
---
* Any pacifist member of the Horde 
---
* Any non dead neutral creature 
---
* Any non dead member of the Horde 
---
* Any undead that is loyal to anything else than Sylvanas (like loyal to the Horde)
---
* Any undead that refuse to answer the loyalty question of the previous point
---
* And for security, anything not yet on the list
---
yeah just change realm. No one is going to fix this for you you baby
---
Class fantasy. Immersion. 
---
2 very important RPG elements that are affected by this. 
---
People like you just read the headline saying "possible to kill players" and assume that this "griefing" happens all the time. But you are forgetting that the Inferno spell has a whopping 1 HOUR COOLDOWN.
---
A counter point to mining though is that its *very* easy to farm. Because everything spawns along mountains they make predictable circuits you can loop through. And because not a lot of people run it the products can be quite lucrative. Mithril bars go for 10s a pop on my server, and I get stone to make my own sharpening stones.

I am enjoying the game with my partner, but most of all I'm enjoying the lack of pressure and how it feels to earn something like I dont need to follow any overly thought out progression system that rewards me to keep me playing. It's awesome holding onto items 5 or so levels later as that particular quest doesnt give you something  better.
---
The amount of spells is fun as well makes you understand and play to suit your style. 
---
Very happy with the experience- hope it reaches a community driven content system towards the end of its cycle.

Damn, that's a nice outplay, but why aren't you using your wand, almost at all?

While on the subject of likely nerfed aspects of the game, what is the current status of kiting elites? Do they have a radius they're allowed and then despawn if pulled too far? I want to kite stitches to Goldshire like I used to do in real 1.12.
---
what do you mean "reset"? i've been sitting here for about an hour now waiting to turn in
---
lol, I guess everybody has to 'click' individually, thx for bearing with me^^
---
start looking up your pre raid bis, some of it comes from chain quests that are annoying to go back and do when you're maxed. might as well get some exp out of it.
---
definitely get your tailoring up too, mats are the cheapest they're gonna be on the AH right now.
---
Cute dress :P
---
From my point of view is good for the community. You can look for KOS lists for your server and hunt those players :) . That was  my intent, to make the hordes in STV hunt that player.
---
It's a 25% miss chance for any class when DW, not just warriors.
---
There are dozens of advantages to using two weapons:
---
* Warriors need rage to do anything, and using slow 2H-ers that only swing once every three seconds means your rage comes in big slow chunks. Two faster weapons, even factoring in misses, will generate rage more reliably over short bursts
---
* Prot has 1H weapon specialization, so by using a 2H you are completely nullifying 5 talent points
---
* Chasing perfect hit-cap in classic is a pipe dream and cannot be attained, even with full BiS. You will always have higher chances to miss with two weapons vs a single one. This is an accepted part of the deal that can only be minimized slightly
---
* Two 1H-ers is a bazillion more swings at the target which means a bazillion more times for them to accidentally dodge you, and a dodge = automatic Overpower. 
---
There are dozens more reasons it has its own strengths but the primary ones are the Prot 1H specialization and the fact that your rage generation is more reliable. You can get off sunders faster in the fight, and those white damage swings (when they hit) add up to a fuck ton more sustained DPS vs a sundered opponent. In fact, 3-4 sunders on a typical mob and your white damage swings hit so hard you will be swimming in rage. 
---
&gt;I heard...
---
2H Arms is meta as fuck and has plenty of shortcomings like the ones I mention above.
---
fixed :D
---

These pieces really bring out the emotion I imagine when reading their quest texts.. Really well done.
---
can someone explain how and why this works? what benefits so much much from spell power?
---
what level are you?
---
questing, dungeons, professions and auctioning off good greens will earn you a fair bit. helms, necks and shoulders especially you can get a nice bit for.
---
Isnt this tos?

The LFG tab was like the perfect balance between now and DF. Summoning stones are coming soon!

1 counter. And even then it's about 60/40 from what I saw on Nost.(As a high ranking shadowpriest)
---
I'm torn about the chest piece. Which one is better between the shadoweave robe and the warlock specific one from the quest?

I feel you.. contemplating about buying a razer naga and keypad myself :p

WASH YER BACK!
---
Has anyone had success with running this with Ubuntu? I play priv. server cata, tbc, and vanilla on this with no issues, but I heard retail was more painful?
---
You won't replace that in a couple of days mate!
---
Even under the  threat of death I will never stop jumping around in wow
---
Orgrimmar in BfA also looks like that. Only a lot of people have (\*) next to their name and nobody ever talks with anyone. Even if you talk, you're like the crazy man. And everyone looks badass and everyone's riding ridiculously huge mounts and flying above the place.
---
I love that we have dps logs from private servers proving that feral dps isn't even remotely competitive but you're downvoted for some reason.
---
Except the empty house, it can be used as a LAN parties. It sucks living alone without being mentally strong :/
---
I found it very unreliable for classic, still using classicdb
---
What are you talking about? Priests can absolutely AoE grind with holy nova.
---
Fitting environment too
---
I don't kill anyone unless they give me a reason, besides my realm is like 55% alliance 45% horde. So you are wrong.
---

---
I don't understand this thought process that people were retarded in og vanilla. They had the websites and spreadsheets etc etc all the same. Mmorpgs have always attracted the number crunchers and theory crafters and always will. I think it's far far more likely the number of people who would go hard enough back then was simply smaller. The game was smaller and the player base overall was to. Now you have people with 15 years of "training" with the system. And 15 years of fan growth. Anyone who can do a mid level m+ now with enough time and give a damn would likely get thru naxx.  I didn't play in vanilla and from what I can tell so far it's more of an endurance test than anything  super leet. Based of people's current ability to focus target or not break cc or watch threat I think your giving current players far to much credit.
---
You don't tank dungeons as prot until L/Ubrs, even then its not totally necessary.
---
Two gathering professions helps. Skinning is great in busy areas because you can go around skinning other peoples kills too. 
---
It helps to look up quests and see if they have a good reward. And unless a quest reward is genuinely an upgrade then just pick the one that will vendor for more. 
---
Running dungeons you'll often get item drops that aren't particularly expensive bit will add up far more than normal mob drops.
---
But you're only getting 40% of the experience you get from killing same level
---
Damn you're totally right.  It was changed in late BC to incapacitate apparently.
---
Does this really work for Classic? Can't seem to make it work... When I install it and try to do /luna menu config or whatever it doesnt even allow me to punch in the text.
---
Pretty sure jeremy regularly streams.
---
As long as you can find people to party with it doesn't matter on PVE servers.
---
Yes, they can...but they cannot do what a mage can do. Please show me a priest AoE grinding normal mobs for gold at the rate a mage can with the same survivability.
---
If you can’t prioritise these aspects of your life, then that’s on you, my friend. Try focusing on studying/spending time with your girlfriend first and any spare time after that on Classic.
---
Heeeey you read brando sando
---
47 and I’ve felt massively behind. Looks like I’m way ahead of the curve.
---
Probably quest mobs with low drop rates :P
---
the issue is a lot of the damage you see happen with WoW is due to logic fallacies. in WotLK you had to do a certain heroic dungeon every day for the badges it is so piss easy why not just make an automated system for it? everybody is happen come cata and heroic dungeons are back at TBC and start of WotLK level people complain about it beaing impossible (it is not you just can't do them with pugs wait a bit and you can)
---
then in retail blizzards fix to keep dungeon relavant (since they are correct that dungeons needs to remain relvant) is creating Mythic+ which just fosters this toxic faster GOGO shit in a systemic matter.
---
you can see all of these pit falls of logic WoW has gotten itself into and can't get out of with out majorly upsetting the current playerbase.
---
Ok, I'll take a look. What I did was went into Network Sharing on my PC. Yours sounds closer to what I should be doing, which is dealing with it through the modem itself. I'm currently at work for another 30 minutes, so when I get home I'll try to see if I can log into my router and take a look. Much appreciated!
---
Started doing drugs to keep awake? Nothing beats a 4 day gaming streak!
---
Lol its pve!!!!
---
it's Dumbledore actually :D
---
Just did it on my warrior, who's also 38. I ended up buying the boots on the AH because I was impatient and had been farming SM for ages for them, but it was totally worth it. I don't think I've ever had a WoW character look this stylish.
---
Sell a pair of pants a buy a shitty pc with the money.literally any pc can run this gamr.
---
That throneroom has not seen anything else.
---
Too bad you can't transmog it to stay like this forever
---
god i know #nochanges and all, but transmog would be so freaking cool in classic
---
Absolutely 😂😂
---
Ignore it, jokes on them same as the ones who think you can tank with a two hander. They simply havnt realised it yet.
---
I feel like you want them to be better at it than they really are. I’m guessing you rolled priest after reading they were awesome in duels (which they are).
---
Priests have zero ways to lock down a fleeing enemy and only one trick for escape - fear. If they trinket or wotf your fear, you are not escaping. All those engi tools you’ve mentioned are available to everyone else too you know. 
---
Priests can delay until help arrives which works great in group wPvP or BGs but true solo, they can be pretty frustrating.
---
Just... how.. I am 36 and I have 20g \^\^ I do train professions though
---

Hacking or just visual bug
---
Thanks man 😁 Told the party to go on ahead as this picture came into my mind.
---
yes for one project... that one with two comsical objects :-). He played there for a long time.
---
When I first started reading I couldn't tell it was sarcasm at all until I reached the part where you said it is
---
Amen. The tears of wallhackers give me a lot of joy.
---
Why did he explode when landing?
---
Thanks! It works like a charm :)
---
Oppphh that was cold man.
---
There was a time when shadowbolt warlock was basically top DPS. The rotation was a single button.
---
Actually.... I am a hunter hmm
---
Nope, human, so UD shadow resist doesn’t explain it.
---
I just hit 55 today after doing all of the BRD quests (outside of returning to get the princess and prison break, which I will do later along with the atunement for MC).
---
Now that I’m 55, I feel like for the last five levels I have a few options: Re-run BRD spams, LBRS, UBRS, Strat, or Scholo. The nice thing about moving to LBRS, UBRS, Strat, or Scholo is all the quests that come with them.
---
What should my gameplan be? I want to avoid questing because it’s a zoo out there so I want the best dungeon-led way of doing this.
---
I do both
---
How does this compare to the Dreamweave set? Seems like Dreamweave is better tbh but more expensive to craft
---
Brand new to this game and started playing as a warlock. I heard the voidwalker pet can tank for you in pve so I start fights with him but minions keep changing to attack me whenever I attack. Am I doing something wrong?
---
If they aren't getting hit then I am. There is no work involved from the person with the buff only from the druid spending mana to apply the buff. Without the druid that damage isn't there. Should be considered since dps is a large factor in getting groups and class viability
---
I had a run of blackfathom dephts with 2 hunters, a rogue, me (a priest) and a druid THAT DIDN'T HAD BEAR OR CAT FORM AT LEVEL 21.
---
He didn't even know what tanking was about.
---
Luckily, we had 2 hunter and the rogue was level 26 and well geared. So we finished the entire dungeons, winning by pure attrition because of having two healers (me and the druid) and at least 3 people that could take a beating and hold aggro (the rogue was strong enough to take any elite by himself without support). Also, faerie fire is STRONG when hall your damage dealers are physicals.
---
When the druid had to leave, we continued and cleaned the dungeon, methodically, little by little. Our rogue suceed to pull all the mobs one by one without any mass aggro.
---
It was long and hard (two wypes) but it was awesoe.
---
did this quest with 4 tandom pallys 2days ago. It felt so good to have it done after close to 4h. Was never this proud to be paladin
---
I'm reading all you lots' stories and have a big grin on my face :)
---
yes
---
Yeah I couldn't find it either
---
I bought caffeine and guaraná bubble-gum, but i think i need to go harder if i want to raid this week
---
Tanking is like herding cats into a pond during a rainstorm next door to a puppy mill.
---
Filthy casual, BEGONE
---
Thank god odour isn't transmitted through the wire!
---
On Benediction at least mining supplies *vastly* out perform herbs. Most of the herbs go for the 3-4s range. Iron ore, a very common ore and quite easy to farm, goes for 8s. I guess it comes down to personal preference. A smaller trickle of income passively, or a larger chunk actively.
---
Anyone else has to choose the realm every time they log in?
---
Should I be going straight into my last played character screen? Minor issue but quite annoying to have to go through the Realm Selection screen every single time.
---
Well your prot. So you might have better sustain, but you also kill mobs slower
---
agree, GW2 has a similar system and it's perfect
---
Been trying to sell my gut ripper for over a week. I dont think it will sell above 20g :/
---
Random comment but I missed so much of this stuff. Retail has rendered a lot of places like the Tram obsolete. Which is a shame.
---
Until the point that you lose your 3 pre raid bis to the same guy in 1 run :(
---
Anyone could please tell me the best server to play alliance pvp? I'm looking for a friendly server if possible, thank you so much!
---
My mother is happy that i stayed home this weekend to watch the dog, plus, she doesn't like my girlfriend, she is actually happy with WoW
---
&gt;You can easily still do everything alone in Classic apart from the raids (which are a joke anyway)
---
I don't mean soloing lowlevel/old content, I mean doing content without even interacting with people.
---
&gt;to say that the community is somehow totally different from Retail is just not accurate.
---
I never said the Classic community is different from retail. What I said was, that the community changed a lot, back when Dungeonfinder was introduced. And I liked the community better before. Of course it isn't going to magically change back, just because you release a 15yo game.
---
Random question. On my main, when I access any bank, it goes straight to the bank inventory screen, however when I just made a bank alt, I go to SW bank, but everytime I talk to the person, I have to always choose the option "I would like to check my deposit box"
---
Why is that the case? Is it just unique to certain banks? Cant figure out why the disparity exists
---
Lmao 😂
---
Soloing the first dungeons when your well beyond their max level, and everything in them is useless to you isn’t an example of being able to do everything solo.
---
Sell it to a vendor tbh, also make sure to get a receipt!
---
Or learn to tag. That's how it be.
---
You know, I don't think they do.
---
Lol!, don't take that crap too personal!
---
Nah not insecure it was pure cringe and not funny
---
because I'm not having any fun tanking and soloing as a warrior wasn't very fun either.
---
In europe its too hot aswell
---
Was MC'd by a nelf 2 days ago as it pulled into Ratchet. WotF saved my ass though.
---
Oh, and the funniest time to play a mage was when blastwave had knockback. You just went outside any raiding entrance and knocked ppl out of air. (Get close, dismount, blastwave them off their mount, spam macros laughing at them, slowfall/blink down) Man, those were the times!
---
Awesome thanks, just wondering why is the first prtattack necessary? How do I make this addon attack the target's pet incase its not a shaman?
---
So 500x60 runecloths right?
---
Yeah seems pretty accurate but guess it also depends on how many hours you played on each of those days. Do you play on PVP server and had problems in STV for example.  
---
I dinged 60 on thursday and had a similar pattern accept i got to 18 on the first day 23 on second I believe and then each day a bit less xp bars I completed. Struggled a bit with the right quests at 28 and also ended up at 59 with almost no quests to do good solo. The last 2 levels were a lot of grinding as well at 3 or 4 other levels where I grind at least 30% of the level to make up xp.
---
It is a problem because it’s not how the game is meant to be played. And having a band aid fix by outleveling it till you can solo it might work to get the job done. But it will still leave you with an empty feeling of loneliness
---
Okay well I’m not sure what tf this even is but all
---
I can say is don’t quit your day job
---
Sorry i think you mean this serious, because there is no sarcasm tag.
---
This is account sharing and can get all parties banned.
---
Counterpoint: running around the world without knowing anything can be really fun! Even dying a lot can be part of the experience :)
---
not much people will get this sadly
---
I’m on this server. Plenty time til battlegrounds come out so it may even up yet. Plus the figures aren’t official - may just be plenty of Horde are too busy enjoying the game to upload to random file to a website. I know I haven’t bothered so maybe it’s 74%.
---
I mean it has been three weeks, that’s one week sleeping, one week playing WoW, five days working, leaving 48 hours for literally everything else, including even the most basic stuff like actually physically traveling to work, basic hygiene, dressing and feeding yourself, and so on.  Yeah, I’m assuming you get 8hrs if sleep, but I’m in some ways even giving you like an extra 36hrs of time (it has been 19.5 days, not 21 days.)
---
How can you exclaim that Stalaggs the best realm when a realm named Bigglesworth exists. Where my Biggle Boys at?
---
Tauren remind me more of dinner.
---
Feels like you're getting yourself real worked up over nothing. How much layer abuse have you for sure like 100% witnessed? Because I have a 48 orc warrior and a 20 human warlock and the little I have seen hasnt come anywhere close to even remotely interfering with my gameplay. I kind of feel like your just creating crazy scenarios in your head wherein people are getting wild advantages over yourself and other players that really just isn't happening, or maybe is happening to such a minute extent that it really isn't worth concerning yourself over. What I mean by this is like how people are freaking out over like layer abuse with regards to farming rare items; the fact of the matter is that even if people are doing this to the extent some players think they are, all this serves to do is devalue rare mats. The beauty of the AH is it's basically a miniature functioning economy, and aside from the master economists who have it all worked out most people are at the mercy of the AH rather than some wall-street level commodity manager.
---
Alright thanks!
---
Cant wait to style all over the horde plebs on flamelash
---
[Wasn't sure if you've heard of this](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Children_of_Goldshire)
---
Party up.
---
This is nostalgic. Yes, mages are the best. This is why. I've had similar experiences
---
Im on a PVP server. Using full spell/shadow power equipment (140!) it shows and a lot.
---
Stam for pvp in these levels is over rated. Power is the way to go. You may have higher stam (negligible) but I have better stam.
---
Void sacrifice (2x with fel dom) heals the same amount regardless of stam. Just from there locks have 3 health pools at these levels and stam only affects one of them. You do significantly more damage with each of your “3 lives” with power.
---
Healthstones, health potions same concept.
---
Drain life: heals more with more power.
---
Focus on power and get your stam from pieces were you can’t get power at these levels and you will be a wrecking ball!
---
Yeah I’ve been seeing that, seems they all go all in when I get to the pull rather than waiting.
---
Just looked it up since I should have for the post but the one item I know about is the Truefaith vestments that you can only make for yourself through tailoring.  Def BIS gear for now. [truefaith vestment](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14154/truefaith-vestments)
---
the rogue poison macro does nothing for me
---
BiS at 15? Lol yeah mate you're rocking God awful greens because that's what you wear at level 15. There are blue BoEs to get but there's no point since you're gonna be out of the teens in less than a day playtime.  If you spend time looking for "bis" all the time, you're gonna be spending big gold every 5 levels and then you'll hit 40 with no money for a mount.
---
Sorry this game doesn't give you legendaries in westfall
---
Didn't black out the eyes, now we know your face!
---
A lot of the people with mount I know leveled with dungeon farming. They ended up with around 400-500g on 60, and because they were pretty early they could super easily stock up on mats that would usually be rare.
---
Expansions, emphatically over the other 2.
---
Yep, just when you hit 60 is when you pet's at its max, since they don't scale with gear. Gonna switch to marksman eventually, until then, I'm enjoying the hell out of BM.
---
Dat ass tho.
---
I mean in terms of grouping endgame.
---
recieves screenshot, decide to take phone photo anyway.
---
There are plenty of quests there at that level
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/tanaris#quests:0+3+1+2
---
I kind of want a mix between Classic+ and Classic expansion. 
---
They could reuse the expansion and all their asset/story, but give them a complete overhaul to bring them closer to the Classic feeling gameplay wise.
---
You would also need to actively transfer your character from one expansion to the next one, so that you could enjoy the endgame of each expansion at it is suppose to be. Or find another way to prevent the next expansion to just kill the precedent and take its place.
---
Sap her and then take her credit. Just like a rogue.
---
Alexa, start playing Someday
---
/cries in memories of low res videos and great players
---
Something is up for sure, I sat my warrior down earlier and was afk for a good 3 or so minutes and as I came back a tagged mob ( grey from someone else's damage)  ran up to me and wanted those hands. Having done nothing to cause any threat and with the afk tag even, also was full health prior to sitting. It was funny but is a +1 to your theory. Not a huge deal in the scheme of things though.
---
I cannot comprehend the mindset of a person who dies to the blood plague and gets upset because they value the 1-2 minutes it took to run back to their corpse more than they value such a unique and interesting experience. I really do think players like this should stick to retail.
---
I gotta thank god that i have a bathroom 2 mts away from my computer
---
Ally rogue here, I was helping my mage friend do some quests in hillsbrad, had a nice tactic of using him as bait if we saw horde, I would instantly go stealth when I saw and enemy and stay within melee range of the mage and used him as bait, they never got him down to even half health before I creeped out of the shadows and ruined their gank
---
This hour*
---
&gt;able to trap anyone reliably mid fight
---
Yeah, that's simply not the case in classic
---
Yeesh, I'm a 45 Warr about to start Tanaris and this is a few days after being unable to do anything in badlands because of extreme horde presence (constantly killed for my quest mob tags) and getting pissed about it. I'm not going to dungeon grind to 50 so if I have another Badlands experience it might force a reroll
---
Alright, I kinda avoid quest texts like the plague, but I'll give it an honest try!
---
I do that whenever I run past an Alliance character that's low enough leveled/geared that I can hope to at least escape them if just casting it aggros them to the point of attacking me. I tend to start with a /wave, /wait
---
Can't bartender do this?
---
Doesnt look like anything to me
---
Get bis everything at level 24 so you can outlevel it literally as you're collecting it lol
---
its all relative!
---
What a Dick move
---
tbh zul farak is a bit easier
---
I still can hear the sound in my head... After so many years...
---
thats pretty shit
---
Just do it!
---
I did it yesterday as level 41 which was to low as a offtank. Didn't hit anything in the end, but we finished. My teammates were 44+ and carried me 😅
---
Thelsamar is my favourite town in the game. Do chill.
---
Every dungeon run I’ve done people need gems and such, seems like the norm
---
Welcome to the tribe.
---
Barrens sucks and it’s great. Alliance 10-30 is a hodgepodge of zones on opposite ends of the kingdom...bouncing between West fall, red ridge, loch Moran, wetlands and dusk wood. Horde is 20 levels in barrens stone talon and ashenvale. And it’s like long periods of time in each...then you come back to barrens then to 1k needles...which is suspiciously barrens like.
---
So it feels better to play alli 
---
But once you know barrens, it’s so fast. The routes are so good, massive xp, good quest rewards. There is nothing quite as god tier as the Icicle Rod is for alliance frost mages, tho.
---
Got to admit, I thought for sure Gehennas over in EU would be the biggest server. But damn, the germans are representing for SURE!
---
Is shaman raid gear interchangeable between resto and elemental spec?
---
Apparently there is a working solution AGAIN.
---
Probably spec, i was full afflication until  41 and had the deathcoil icon, now with 11 points in destro its just the warlock icon on details
---
Reading these comments gives me hope that Classic is here to stay (still a bit skeptical :s)
---
many people I know play vanilla since 2013. (various pservers) people sometimes take a break but then they come back, start again with a different class. 
---
As long as blizzard makes new servers, once a year  they could keep going for many years  Old servers could be retired after a few years, giving people the option to keep their characters on some 'hall of fame'  server. Or they could launch TBC
---
Your BiS really doesn't matter till high levels even then it takes long to get, you will out level before you gather it all, just look up weapon progression or wand progression, I'm level 57 wearing level 40 greens, it happens.
---
How could you tell?
---
I don't even have a dps meter.
---
That hammer has carried me from level 22 to 35 so far. Treat it well and polish it daily.
---
Redbull is marked as mature too.
---
Don’t quest at peak hours if you’re around the average level (30-45). Its an exercise in frustration. Find a decent grinding spot away from quest hubs, run dungeons or play an alt. I prefer the latter.
---
This is exactly why I play RP server, I've had this kinda shenanigans happen out of nowhere too often.
---
Yeah. Unless Vanilla uses a different formula from TBC, it should be 13% + (level - 3) * 7% for PvP.  With 60% miss chance, only 40% of your spells should hit a target 10 levels above you, baseline. (Nowhere near as bad as PvE (17% + (level - 3) * 11%)) = 94%, where only 6% of spells would hit)
---
Now it's quite likely that this shadowpriest has gone 5/5 Shadow Focus for levelling to make fighting +3 mobs easier, so he'd have +10% hit chance with shadow spells, giving him 50% hit chance against the mage.
---
There's no gear at his level for +hit or +spell pen, and no talents for spell pen, so we can ignore that.
---
Lets give the mage the benefit of the doubt and assume he was using Ice Armor instead of Mage Armor (which could give him +15 shadow resist), which seems quite likely his mana didn't show any noticeable increase during the 5s rule. Lets also assume he hasn't put any points into Magic Absorption, a fairly unpopular talent, which could give him another +10. That leaves him with 10 resist from his racial passive, which he definitely has.
---
10 resistance at that level isn't enough to give you full resists for spells with partial resists. At best you'd get a 25% or 50% resist. But he's a shadow priest, and most of his spells are binary.
---
For binary shadow spells (spells which apply all of their effect or none of it, with no partial resists), the 10 shadow resist passive on the undead should result in (resistance=10 / (MIN(20, level=49) * 5)) = 4% extra resist chance for binary spells, but on a separate roll. Since base hit chance is 50% and half of binary spell casts should miss anyway this means 2% of all binary spell casts will result in a resist due to the passive resistance.
---
Silence, Vampiric Embrace, Shadow Weaving Proc, and Mind Flay are all binary spells, and I think SW:P might be too.
---
* Silence  
---
* Vampiric Embrace  
---
* Shadow Word: Pain  
---
* (Shadow Weaving Proc)  
---
* Mind Blast  
---
* Mind Flay  
---
* (Shadow Weaving Proc) - RESIST  
---
* Shadow Word: Pain - RESIST  
---
The chance of getting 13 of those non-resists in a row should be about 0.01%.
---
I'm pretty sure I have used a command to get my own coords, if I remember that correctly you could create a %t macro with your coords to alert /1
---
I saw your edit about the fall damage and wanted to flesh it out a bit: there were dozens of variables that contributed to the outcome. For one, I had him stunned for a total of 11 seconds the entire fight (2x Revenge + 1x Conc) but only beat on him for ~3 of those (the last revenge stun in the water). If I had instead gone zerker stance and wailed on him while he was standing helpless in that Concussion Blow, it would have made a big difference.
---
I fled every opportunity I could have otherwise used to hurt him. I also kept spamming Shield Block after already using Shield Wall -- I should have gone purely offensive with that rage at that point because Shield Wall doesn't care what stance your in for the 15 seconds it's saving you.
---
There's lots of variables but the fall certainly made up for my lack of pressing any advantage. I just wanted to get the fuck away from him, not kill him. Bit he was soooo pushy.
---
On the login page there should be shop button bottom left that has the free transfer.
---
They're populated.
---
These dorks will tell you it's because they're sharded from other realms --Usually true-- But that's because they're all in Boralus/Dazar'alor, the current expansion's capital, or out in the zones they need to actually do things in. 
---
'Your server' starts to look very thin when you have 3x as many available servers and many more times that in available zones to be in.
---
I also question the logic to "hey look at all these people afking in Orgrimmar!" as an argument to how involved the game is, anyway.
---
Will never jump again
---
Yea, if you're outgeared, or outskilled, priests can be tough to play.
---
But if you are of equal skill and equal gear, priests have the upper hand in most 1v1s
---
Oozes porn
---
its a shame :(
---
I'll check it out thanks
---
sure man.
---
Adibags- you can make that there are x nimber of "bags" that contain for example only herbs, ine for only cinsumables like water and potions etc
---
It's not quite that bad. The worst changes came in TBC.
---
There are no reinforcements in the 1.12 version, so games probably won't last days, but probably will still last hours.
---
/ignore &lt;playername&gt;
---
Once again, following just what the user wants is not always a good choice for the overall longevity of the game. Players want flying, players want lfg, players want faster mounts, better gear, going to the newer raids, more max lvl characters, max professions etc 
---
But if you give all these things easily and for free then you basically fuck all the current players over, in favour for getting new players in. Its not a good design and we seen what happened after many years of it. Nt saying that having to go through ALL the raids is a good solution, but catch up gear shouldn't be a thing in classic
---
Can someone direct me to some hunter macros? Also gun or bow?
---
Literally same thing can be said about alliance.
---
I’m on Arugal - OCE 
---
I feel I get ganked the most when I’m fighting a mob or half health. When on full health everyone seems happy to let you go
---
That's not my played experience so far. In every dungeons I've ran so far, people needed didn't just need all boes. They needed stuff they could equip and greeded the rest.
---
Could you develop on that ?
---
Cannibalizing alliance after you gank them is just... the best.
---
This is amazing considering the shit that generally gets posted by people looking to find or fill groups.
---
I mustve been in that gro if here was a 27 ot 28 rge with ua
---
Taunt costs no rage, but I agree with everything else you said.
---
Feel sad for you man. I really feel, but at the same time I feel good for the guy that won lol
---
Exact opposite of my experience from about 2004-today
---
Depends on faction balance. Once it gets 2:1, usually it becomes kill on sight.  And if it’s nearing 2:1 the smaller side will start leaving to go do instances or whatever.
---
All it takes is two wipes in a row due to your bear being crit before a guild gives up on that experiment. Sure, it can work, but can you convince the 35 other people in your guild that just want a warrior tank that can't be crit or crushing blowed?
---
Whenever I see Alliance around my level and I don't feel like ganking them I wait until they're finished with whatever they're killing, then a /pat and /lick before running away. If I really want to drive the point home I might help kill a mob.
---
Probably not but there are likely a handful of people at least close to 10k. Lots of people been grinding non stop since they hit 60 a week into release. Especially Devilsaur which they could have stocked up on without effort since no one was close to their level.
---
I think he means the level 1 can be owned by either of the GMs or a third friend who has no interest, not that both players have access to that level 1.
---
You kinda dodged the question lol
---
The void Walker has an ability, I believe it's called torment, make sure that's set to auto cast. If that's on, let your voidwalker build threat for a few extra hits before you start dropping your big damage abilities into the monster. Hope that helps
---
Ogres are like cakes.
---
Hey let's give them the ability to remove hots too
---
I have seen a little bit of discussion about this in the last week, but thought I would bring it up again to see if anyone has any new information. 
---
Is anyone else noticing the queues start to get longer again? 
---
On my realm (Arugal-OC, the most popular OC realm), realm queues were absurdly long for the first week and a half or so, then they started to really slow down, to the point where I could actually get into game without a queue at 6pm (previously impossible). 
---
Now it seems that the queues are getting longer and longer. Not quite so bad as launch week, but worse than it has been.
---
I saw discussion about the possibility that Blizzard reduced the realm cap, removed some layers, or both, but have yet to see any confirmation. 
---
Does anyone know what the deal is?
---
Haven't found a way around it. Annoying that you can't even hit enter to select the first one.
---
This is literally every warrior and paladin look between level 35-45, maybe even some hunters and shamans after 40.
---
I tried to explain LoS pulls a couple of times to people while tanking dungeons now but all I got was ‘ok’ or no response at all and the same behavior.
---
But maybe that’s also because I’m playing in EU and sometimes get the feeling that people don’t really understand English which makes communication hard :-)
---
You have to use both, classicdb doesn’t show patrols very well. Look at Rok Alim for example. Or Fozruk.

I had 1 removed a few years ago, it was a manual process so I guess it's up to whoever is helping you.
---
Sprint is only 10% faster than Dash, and not ttwice the speed of travel form either for reference.
---
My main in vanilla was a 60 Undead Rogue. Tons of fun but I found that caster classes truly call to me. I really enjoy healing. I’ve also considered playing a hunter as I hear they are challenging to master. Plan on leveling a Druid as well.
---
Looks cozy man!
---
It really is the same theoretically. A hidden roll is never going to cause the servers to fail, you clearly are unsure about what you are talking about.
---
Yep. Just look up Monara
---
I wonder if you would have sold it if he offered less, like 5 gold or something or maybe even 1 gold. 
---
I think the 20g tipped you off that clearly it was valuable. So you went to check up on it.

The tailoring chest is basically BiS until naxx. It's bind on pickup so you have to craft your own, but you can drop tailoring after. I just like herb so I can farm my own pots, and enchanting so I can disenchant.
---
Tbf, I played retail for like a year, then classic. In classic, most of my dungeon runs are made up with personal friends and guildies, with a few randos filling out the rest of the group. Maybe I've just been lucky so far, but so far people have been playing the system as intended so far in my experience.
---
&gt; shit, I need to learn from this guy, at least when he can't find a group for 2 hours he can complain about it.
---
Just a Tuesday then?  it's everyday this, at least 1hour++ to find a group with luck...
---
Oh it’s cozy as, especially in the evening when the little LEDs are on.
---
&gt;My lv 20 shaman uses more abilities than my 120 demon hunter.
---
As lvl 20 Shaman I am certainly not using more abilities than a 120 DH. Do I have quite a few? Sure, but most are going unused.
---
Also DHs are the easiest class in retail...
---
I certainly do agree, that the leveling process matters more in Classic, Class Quests spice things up, having to go to the Class Trainer makes you eager to see what you can get now (or even afford!). I do think that Retails Talent System, at its core, is better, but it probably shouldn't be every 15th lvl you get a talent, but rather every 10th (this would also mean a lot more abilities and customization, which can be both positive and negative)
---
Don’t worry, soon you’ll get to [this point](https://youtu.be/7m7ewouLQXA)

All that matters is leveling.  Just keep leveling and only train moves that help you level and you'll have your mount at 41.

Cataclysm tried gating epics. Had to get a psuedo attunement by having to run to the dungeon for the first time before you queue. You still had to mark and CC for their dungeons initially and I remember people complaining about it being too hard or time consuming to have to fly to the dungeon at least once
---
it doesnt really matter lol, if u cringe over such things, you are definetlyn insecure lol
---
That last for 2 mobs
---
I mean when a warrior has freedom there is nothing you can do since that means there's a paladin right over there that give him that. FAP you can counter with a polymorph but there's nothing a mage can do against a 1v2 of Pala/Warrior if the Paladin gets freedom off.
---
Just get soul sort
---
Exactly. Prices are relative. Just like gold now is more valuable than gold in a few months. Or gold compared to retail which is already out for a good few years.
---
hey i have been trying to work an adrenaline rush/blade flurry macro but i cant make it work, and i cant find anywhere any new info for a macro like that on classic, i tried the castsequence or simple cast but it only uses the first skill, anyone can fix that?
---
It’s a pve server how is it even relevant lol
---
Bring it on noob!
---
Your red ur ded in this pvp world!
---
Maybe if u guys where above 12yo and knew how to play u made a chance :-D

For the Horde!!

---
M2 models such as trees did not break LOS in vanilla.

So how close is “almost”?

Quest Completist or All The Things Mays help you here.

A reminder that MC was cleared by a private server guild that probably has MC on farm/able to do it with their eyes shut.

I’m sure the content will be challenging for people that have never done MC / any raids / new people.
---
If you grunt, rack your weights too loudly, or do anything otherwise possibly deemed "offensive" they set off an alarm, essentially public humiliation. I believe it can also lead to you being kicked out of the gym.

It's the Dominoes addon castbar!

Pretty sure they know that, part of what the post is about.
---
This is how my shaman looked at 40 on... another server (except I think I sprang for the 1% crit leather gloves because they were cheap).
---
Yeah it'll just get worse and worse. Look at modern wow most high pop servers are super imbalanced.
---
I guess it is gate keeping but as test go it’s a very mediocre one at best to see if you have the skills and knowledge to be great. Killing a rock as paper is such a basic test it shouldn’t be classified as gate keeping.  
---
It’s not like I’m telling people to kill a warlock with a felhound out, as entry points to be a good mage as that the point you go put the kettle on so you have something to do as you run afk back to your corpse.

I’ve wrecked a lot of horde several levels higher than me when I had to be mostly it’s peaceful in my experience. Lots of helping/saving.. except a few ganking rogues
---
With 44 absolutely. Although the endboss is level 47, about half of the dungeon (in the beginning) the mobs are level 37-40 and the other half of the dungeon it ranges from 42-46 mostly. With 44 you have a good level for uldaman. I tanked it with level 41 the first time, although the endboss can be a bit challenging if everyone is around level 41.
---
44 is also a good level to do Zul Farak. Most mobs there are around 42-46 level range, with the endboss having level 48.
---
I don't really get why he is asking this even.
---
Some enemy's especially those required for quests are often overfarmed. That's annoying but at least the world is alive.
---
Wait a few months and you'll probably see way less people and more mobs up.
---
If I can't progress on quests I'll just switch to another questing area.
---
Are you honored with UC? IF SO IT WILL ON COST 90 G
---
44 should be high enough. Hell went in with myself (43 war), 45 war, 38 heals, and 42 rogue and we downed everything but the last boss (at which point we agreed we were all tired as shit, and didn’t want to continue)
---
Ménage?
---
I think back in the day you picked your realm then toon. It’s been a while though so I might be incorrect.
---
hahahahaahhahahaha oh man thanks for this
---
He’s rare and it’s only been 6 runs . Some people played all of classic and didn’t see a rare spawn in an instance . RNG , all you can do is keep running if you really want it
---
If you care about gear and bis, the priest and mage bop chest from tailoring is bis all the way to naxx
---
The Worst Kind of Person: YouThinkYouDoButYouDont
---
The most lucrative AoE farming in the game is DM lashers. This is well known since vanilla. Priests and Warlocks can farm that the same as mages because you are ultimately limited by the instance reset limit and not how many different ways you have to slow and root groups of mobs.
---
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa :_;
---
&gt;am i missing something?
---
Probably life or smth. Fuck social life but I wouldn't tank my exams over wow
---
Yes. That's what I said. In Vanilla you could "see" through most objects. And the mobs could too. OP is rallying against this.
---
What are those?
---
I don't understand how you made 0 misses against a skull target
---
Frogface ... I thought it's a mustache 😄
---
Mate can't you use wowhead?
---
I honestly think it’s the fact that there is so many different ways of playing the game.
---
And to me personally the feeling of actual character progress, which has been gone from retail for years.
---
Same, and it got even worse during TBC, like 70H to 30A, but we made do and had a blast.
---
Where do I get one of these? Asking for a friend
---
How does master of deception work exactly? Did anyone figure it out? Why specifically 1 point in it? It makes a big difference? Is getting 2 or even 5 a waste?
---
Are you saying its the same thing? loooool
---
If you're a healer you could make dungeon farm groups. Get all those mages to AoE for you. You heal them, they chain sheep or ice root. 
---
They'll even make you water.
---
Started grinding spideys today, can’t wait
---
I really dont care about my server alone. Im intresting in how far people are into the game in general.
---
That's sharding similar concept and was later than wrath, layering is temporary to alleviate some of the early rush.
---
Rebind all your keys (q, e, f, x, c, r, t)directly around ur WASD and put your most important abilities there, such as hamstring, rend, intercept. Rebind your stances.
---
Any idea what the one from Deadmines is worth? I had it drop and didn’t even think that it might be  worth selling before I equipped it 🤷‍♂️
---
It depends on the spell type.
---
For partial-resistable spells which just deal damage, like Mind Blast, your resistance gives you a chance to resist 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of the spell (a 100% resist is displayed identically to a resist from spell hit). With only 10 resistance you wouldn't have enough to reach the 75% category, let alone the 100% one, so it would just cause Mind Blast to occasionally do less damage. You'd only see a resist when your spell missed.
---
For spells which don't deal damage and/or apply an important non-damage related effects, the behaviour is different. The average damage reduction applied to partial-resistable spells becomes an extra resist roll. These are called binary spells, because they either have full effect, or are completely resisted, with no inbetween.
---
(eg, suppose your resistance gives you 8% chance for 25% resist, and 2% chance for 50% resist, and 0% for the other categories, you resist on average 3% of all damage, so 3% of your binary spells that hit would be resisted).
---
Note that spell-hit resist rolls and resistance resist rolls are separate, so for a binary spell with 40% spell miss resist chance and 50% resist chance from resistance, it would be resisted 70% of the time, not 90%.
---
So basicly when mage applies int buff some of dps also should go to mage because it increases cirt and without mage you would not cirt.
---
 Nah, it’s definitely a thing. Was a huge controversy on this subreddit. Blizzard said for phase 1 they’d have it to balance the load on the servers and make it an overall better experience for everyone. Rather than 1000 people all trying to kill the same mob.
---
Could you go further into detail abojt the cs 45 angle into expose and why it wouldnt break sap? Doesnt cs do damge? Anyways i appreciate the wholesome advice!
---
Gotcha thanks :)
---
Sounds even more boring than AoE quest farming. I'm envious of the speed they can farm quests with really, that's about all
---
It never did you have to replace the enchant with another ie windfury for rockbiter. Unequipping won't work either, the shaman weapon buff remains until replaced or 5 min is up.
---
The most fun I've had yesterday was when I saved a couple of people from being swarmed by mobs. This and forming temporary groups to kill quest mobs together.
---
It's those small things that have the largest impact.
---
Yeah I’m pretty sure I said they’re amazing at duelling. The problem is that wPvP isn’t duelling and if I see a geared shadowpriest that’s not already engaged in combat or oom, I just wont fight them and there’s fuck all they can do about it because they’re slow as shit.
---
If you want to spend your day running after people that are twice as fast as you, go play shadowpriest. 
---
In BGs or duels they’re a different and more attractive proposition, however.

Wotlk was when I quit. I know a lot of people enjoyed that expansion but it was nothing like vanilla and tbc. Both vanilla and tbc have a very different mentality due to lack of cross servers and dungeon finders.

Obviously, but its easy way for me to mark a target without rebinding abilities i use frequently on multiple mobs or having a bunch of hotkeys.

The main thing I love about these is the raids are Alliance AND Horde.

Can be learned at 56 in the cave located in southeastern STV, where you used to buy the Bengal Tiger mount back in the days.
---
As a Warlock why would you need this? Why are you draining when you have a full bag, it’s a terrible DPS spell and sanding does more damage.
---
Alliance scum.
---
Rogue here. Can relate.
---
I agree with you there. Classic will never get back the feel of original WoW back in the day when everyone was still figuring everything out and experimenting with all kinds of different builds and possibilities. Holy shockadin PvP, Boomkins, etc.
---
Everyone these days just want to min-max without caring about what's fun or interesting just big numbers. Instead of levelling being something that happened naturally as you played the game, almost everyone is now playing with the sole goal of reaching 60. I blame retail for instilling this mentality in the playerbase.
---

Yesterday someone posted server pop stats and I saw flamelash is around 62-38 horde favored . I also play horde , should I transfer to a more balanced server if it’s available or are there no big repercussions to this ?
---
I’m a level 27 Hunter. Currently have Engi and Mining, but I rarely ever use it or get a chance to use it. I hate spending time searching for veins, and at level 27 I’m still only able to mine copper.

What’s a good alternative prof combo I can do to make gold at this level? Tempted to do skinning/lw or tailoring instead, considering all my quest mobs are dropping wool, and silk like crazy. I’m not making any money with my current skills so I’m looking for a recommendation. :) Thanks in advance.
---
The risk you took was calculated...
---
There are still lots of bugs i've encountered. Mostly around the 30-50 range, a lot of housing areas have the mobs run away through a wall and attract more mobs through the same wall, they all have the ability to walk through the wall like its a private server lol. This was  happening to me all of STV near the medicine men houses, and the boats and the bottom
---
Rogues can kill anybody 1vs1 when they get opener. Its not like some other class can survive outside maybe mage with ice block.
---
Cool thanks for the explanation thats why I asked you seemed like someone that knows what he is doing and I wondered If I could learn something knew. Really appreciate that you explained it to me. atm Im a lvl32 warrior and I got the wwaxe (thanks level50 friend) so I will stay with my 2hand weapon for the next few levels but after the wwaxe drops off maybe I will also try 2 1handers. thanks again :)

He should’ve brought more mages

It drops from the mobs they come in after you kill the last boss in armory.

That optimal thing gets real annoying. I love running a dungeon with a group of maybe not the best makeup, but we work through it and have some fun along the way. A few near wipes but a good save adds excitement. I hate that dungeons become mechanical and how fast can we run this.

It's under "status text" or something similar. It's the same setting that shows your health and mana percents, but for whatever reason they're all linked together.

&gt; According to the rules the best way to do what Tourguide did, for example, would be to name the character something lore friendly (Roseita or Sarea or whatever they came up with) then his/her guild be &lt;Tour Guide&gt;. 
---
That's obviously not feasable and defeats these spontaneous user generated RP event. It kills the suprise, and it's unlikely to get 10 people and have 10 g to sign up for a guild called "Tour Guide" just so you can be a toue guide.
---
Ah my fellow brothers of the light
---
What server is this?
---
Ross' Rage Bar
---
Yeah, I tried searching Wago for several keywords, including swimming, but no luck, so far.
---
I'm still very new to Weak Auras, and mostly can just edit existing displays. I'm much better, even a bit advanced with TellMeWhen but it unfortunately can only detect the swimming state and options for mirror bars.
---
I believe that's what the "breath" bar is called; it's one of the "mirror bars".
---
The whole continent is. Best bet, even after layering is removed, is to use the LFG chat or world chat (remnant of the private servers and basically every classic server has one).
---
i just had a break up myself recently. tldr you are better off my dude. enjoy the grind, make great memories while doing that grind and get back on that horse eventually. MMOs have always been there for me during my dark days. this week has been no different. GL on the grind and the community is always there when you need it.

You'll never miss class quests if you visit your class trainers, which you'll obviously have to do every two levels.  You *only* get them from your trainers.

It's fun.

As a healer i love the ones that rush in frost nova, ae ae ae ae ae, gets surrounded and dies in an instant despite mana shield and pw:shield then shit their pants:  "why didnt you fuckin heal me you trash priest! Learn to play noob shitter! REEEEEEEEEEEEE!"
---
That or the classic frostnova right but then they split off in opposite directions pulling the mobs 5 different ways and scattering them so none get aoed down together, everyone takes damage, only half get slowed, and again somehow its my fault for going oom trying to heal 4 cloth tanks while my castbar constantly gets reset from getting hit and running around to stay alive.
---
 See people spamming for spellcleave groups and i just laugh at all the expansion idiots who dont quite understand you cant just faceroll aoe your way through classic the way they do in expansion play despite blizz nerfing alot of the damage in vanilla.
---
You do realize the issue OP brought up has nothing to do with PVE right? Be careful, your stupid is showing...
---
:D :D :D

If your a Rogue...AWESOME!

So I have transferred from Gehennas to Earthshaker recently and love to actually get to play the game. However, the server still feels quite empty and not alive (even at Saturday night). Will the server continue to grow? Or would you recommend re-rolling? Would Blizz open character transfers from empty servers of population falls below a certain threshold?
---
You could drop Engineering and pick up Skinning if you're not enjoying it.  That will give you two gathering professions while you level for extra gold income.  Some people just aren't into professions.
---
You could also drop Eng and go Skinning Leatherworking for armor or drop them both and do something alike Herbalism Alchemy.
---
lmao so true, I hit 24 yesterday :D.
---
This was a thing in Vanilla as well.
---
Nice, i had forgotten about that. Thought perhaps it was from a quest or some rep.
---
Having missed (avoided) the whole melee hunter weird-to-me-ness, I’m having a blast wracking on stuff while my bear tanks. I’m eating crow . 😆
---
Ive done 400 lb squats in their smith machine(yes im aware its not as good as a squat rack so ido other exercises to compensate) and benched 300+ with a spotter... Never had a complaint. Seen really buff guys there do even more than that.. The only people I've eve seen get kicked out are those slamming the weights or screaming when they lift
---
It really isn't likely to be an issue, 60-40 isn't a particularly significant imbalance.
---
fixed.
---
I took the first week off, no lifed through it, focused on leveling, got OK xp/hour etc yet still fell 5 levels behind some of my guild at end of week.
---
It's not just time to play, there is sheer efficiency involved and the bar has been set high with experienced pserver players.
---
Yes, but do all the trainers give quests? There are a lot of them.
---
xD
---
Looks like a horde was having some petty fun. XD
---
There will always be new raid guilds forming. Hell, my old guild didn't even start up until halfway through the server's vanilla lifespan and we were the top raid guild by AQ40-Naxx.
---
But you already outlevel them by 5 levels. I wonder if this talent simply makes your stealth act as if you were 1 level higher per point.
---
You can drag him from his spawn all over the place.  People do it for the F of it, ruining other people’s fun is fun for a lot of people.
---
Hmm considering how long queues and packed the starting zones were I think you would have chilled in queue for 5h and then be happy if you killed 2 boars that night
---
So it is a gym for people who basically don't lift weights? It seems kind of impossible to push yourself without making some kind of noise.
---
This one gets it!
---
I don't know the exact numbers but the weapon specs are important as melee as it reduces the chance for glancing blows which reduce your damage, as a hunter your ranged attacks can't glancing blow so it's just not as important.
---
Excellent advice, thank you. 
---
Your last comment though. You mean because of the amount of S or G that you gather from dungeons/raids etc? Or that there is another viable way to make a crap tonne as a lvl 60 character?
---
Because they ain't as good as other dps. So you can take them. And they can clear all the raids. But it will be worse off then having another mage rogue or warrior. So its harder to find groups etc and people who think they are hard core or want a carry will be less inclined to take you. 
---
Still its vanilla play what you want and I'm sure you can make It work. Shamans fun regardless
---
You're friend picked bad.

Thanks a lot, I appreciate it!
---
These private servers folk also said Rag would not be able to be beat within 2 months past release. 
---
The classic dev team even mentioned the inaccuracies of private realms. 
---
So these private server people you’re citing are not credible.
---
Depending on how much im earning hourly, no need to go out of my way to help someone with a grey dungeon if i put my own hourly gold income aside.  
---
I would go 20% of the income since it seems fair to the buyer

I grinded week 1 non stop for 24-36 hour days with my group of guildies and friends in dungeons 1-60.
---
1 priest disc spec, 1 pally holy spec, 2 arms warriors (me) and a rogue. We were the among the first 10 60s on Herod alliance.
---
It was really fucking hard. For the record we all took vacation from our jobs and I had to sell my soul to have my wife take care of the house.
---
We set scheduled sleeps for 3-6 hours to dodge queues to purposefully wake up around 3am.

Question.. Spell power vs Shadow Dmg.. 
---
Is spell power all encompassing.. That is to say, does it include like Fire, Frost, Shadow, Nature, etc.. 
---
Is a Shadow Damage specefic better than a Spell damage specific chest piece if they're about the same in added damage and stats? Thanks.
---
Very small number of people are 60 at the moment. It takes a while if you aren't power leveling.
---
Unless your top teir raiding is a lot less strict about gear and such and later phases will include the teir 0.5 catch up quests.
---
Hell, the world first kills were even full raids, and of those the majority weren't even 60. Don't forget players know what they're doing better and understand these fights better and that means most people understand the poor itemisation of Classic means you don't have to be perfect to do well.
---
Level 60, if you even do it then.  Past Last Stand, almost every talent worth taking is about threat.
---
Yeah I got my hunter to mid 30s before remembering all the shenanigans like this Warlocks can do. Started a Warlock and got him to level 15 when I read that these summons don’t work like they used to and there’s no word if it’s a bug or they changed it to prevent griefing. Went back to my hunter lol
---
Hopefully this gets back to how it should be, bug or intentional. The reason we’re playing Classic is to enjoy the silly shit like this. If I wanted to play an mmo that takes itself too seriously by removing all the fun spells in a poor attempt at balance, I’d play retail. #nochanges
---
Did u dl it through curseforge?
---
I thought fishing buddy was against Bliz’s rules?
---
Is this with the MCP? Again I love both Ret and Feral but having to farm that item kills it for me.
---
Bingo 5:45a ! Server load is low too
---
Shadow, lock, feral, disc, rogue is kinda 50/50 all can beat mages. Especially SL locks with felhunter and ferals is so one sided its not even funny.
---
Shroud and sodapoppin are on it too, just to name a few more.
---
/who also only allows you to view up to 50 players at once.
---
No focus in classic so no macros for focus will work.
---
Link?
---
same
---
Feral is the only hard counter. Shadow can SOMETIMES get one vs a good mage, Rogue has to get the jump, Disc is not a thing that challenges good mages. Someone good at mage will fucking wreck just about everyone 1v1.
---
I have beenw aking up between 2-3 (i usually go to bed at 9). As long as I get my 6ish hours I can still be a productive human being the rest of the day lol
---
OP is a paladin, not a warrior.
---
Yes, people get away with it and it isn't really a scam. Not everyone has first aid (especially the people would be selling their cloth like this) and playing the market like that is how you make money. That's just an exceptionally blatant one. I should say that I am not tailoring and I don't do this specific method, largely because I doubt the profits are actually all that good. Making 10s for a stack for 15minutes minutes of spamming trade is terrible g/h. I kinda see it as small time profiteers trying to take advantage of underinformed players. If someone is willing to sell at that price, that is their proragative.
---
wow.
---
Wow it’s amazing that it works still haha
---
Each major city generally has three trainer NPCs, and they're all close to each other, and one of them will always offer class quests if they're available.
---
Low-level class quests will usually also be available from the random class trainers in lowbie towns like goldshire, but they won't offer the higher ones because, well, you won't be training with them anyway.
---
Is is significant. There are 50% more horde than alliance.
---
Just a reminder that there are always mobs inside instances/dungeons, so do those if you need to grind exp/loot.
---
If there's no loot, the mob won't be lootable again after you checked it, possibly with the exception of some quest items.
---
/stopcasting will cancel the wand autoattacks. But it's not very useful as any action will have the same effect and you'll still have to wait for the gcd in order to cast DS. I don't use any macro, i just use DS to cancel the wand attack and then DS again when the gcd is over.
---
Someone kited this mob to Stormwing. The message "X place is under attack" means that a player from the opposite faction is killing guards of your faction.
---
You can stunlock someone for about a minute using a hemo build, and it's pretty effective even while naked. You won't see many people doing this though. It's mostly just a gimmick rather than something that is actually practical in pvp.
---
But how is it different to mages demanding money for mage water and food?
---
They go out of their way to make it, i go out of my way to help a low level group get through a dungeon, how is it different?
---
They have SSAO turned up which makes things feel more “connected” to the ground. Looks nice.
---
I never really played cata, but I wished they kept that. LFG still there, still crap
---
Wait how? It’s not like it’s automatically fishing for you, it only gathers statistics and lets you fish with double click?
---
Go rogue. You’ll have a lot of fun and you won’t have to fight over loot with them, and you don’t have to worry about tanking, and you have the best skill in the game, stealth.
---
&gt;1 counter
---
Beside shadow, locks and ferals can easily beat frost mages. Healers too
---
I have the VoD
---
Also just because the item is higher level doesnt mean its an upgrade sometimes. Stats are huge in classic.
---
&gt;People seem to get a little sour here, what i am talking about is not demanding money for tanking a dungeon you're going to do for your own sake, but demanding money for a dungeon that doesnt do anything for you, exp, gear, mats wise, etc etc.
---
 "People seem to get a little sour here, what i am talking about is not demanding money for tanking a dungeon you're going to do for your own sake, but demanding money for a dungeon that doesnt do anything for you, exp, gear, mats wise, etc etc. "
---
It just means Aoe
---
Honestly staying arms is fine and you can both tank or dps the whole way. You only really want it for high end dungeons. When you hit 52ish you can start farming brd runs for exp, at 55 I recommend doing the WPL + EPL quest zone, at least just the cauldrons in wpl and the tirion fodring questline up to the stratlive part. After that you can respec prot and farm LBRS and get the 3 keys, after that it doesn't matter just farm 5man dungeons until 60.
---
Locks are pretty rare, Feral is a hard counter, Shadowpriest is a 50/50 vs a good mage. If you don't believe me, wait and see who the best PvP'ers are on your realm =)
---
What's the best source of mods? I bet this has been asked all over, but I didn't find it in the FAQ collection.
---
Imagine constantly drinking for Mana while you grind while the Chad priest has spirit tap. Also the absolute fastest way to level is spamming dungeons, and priests can knock out just as many if not more than a mage because they can heal, I'm constantly getting invites even when I don't want them. Also, no mage survival trick beats actually being able to heal yourself, levitate is op for jumping off cliffs or water walking away, fear is great for escapes too. I had three guys try to gank me in stv and feared them into mobs for a clean getaway, and one of them even had a mount and I didn't yet. Priests also have access to the best silence in the game so that's pretty unfortunate for mages in the priest v mage matchup.
---
Pretty sure that's still the case for raiding locks. The debuff slots mean no/fewer dots so Shadowbolt spam with DS or SM is the best.
---
I don't play shaman so I'm not familiar with their bis, but in case you don't get any other answer, their bis probably has a lot of just +healing, which isn't interchangeable. Some of the stats would be interchangeable, and it would probably be manageable for farming if you don't want or have a second set, but if would be far from ideal.
---
you'll end up in the stockades for that
---
I would Respec feral, your damage will be great for solo questing and you can also tank dungeons or heal fine if need be as offspec, just keep gear sets for both handy
---
It isn’t but I don’t charge for water or food to my groups. 
---
If you’re in the level appropriate range for a dungeon and you ask for gold to tank I’ll kick you from the group but if people are asking for boosts from a higher level player, that’s different. Paying for boosts has been part of the game for a long time.
---
Me too. 103g at lvl 39 as warrior.

No professions, only looting and selling. I only bought the viable skills.

Unsure if they have exclusives here vs CurseForge but sometimes updates will happen here before anywhere else as was the case for Grid for me a couple times.

They have a section specifically for Classic add-ons.  I come here for exclusives not usually offered anywhere else for whatever reason.  It's messier but they have goodies in there.

Every time I try to play my alliance character I feel homesick for Thunder Bluff. I never cared much about it until I heard the tree frogs come out at night. Was sold after that.

Welcome to porn, where all the girls look too young and all the men are un their 40s

What about SP dots?
---
By that logic, shouldn't we remove rogues' ability to stealth for other players? Those love camping lower level areas.
---
I've seen people with briarwood reed, so he does
---
There is one issue - spam. You can't play the game and look for group at the same time as the chat moves way too fast. Also it slows down forming of groups as people are missing messages. So many times I can see some dude looking for healer for X instance and right below there is healer LFG the very same intance and they keep spamming for minutes and can't find eachother.
---
Is mp5 different than spirit?
---
They are for classic.
---
What is the maximum range of player levels that can group together for the lowest levels to still get XP?
---
I have seen tables out there that show range of mob levels vs. the player and how XP scales off. But what I'm looking for is, if I am say level 35, how can I tell what are the lowest levels I can carry in a group without them being nerfed to zero XP for mobs that they normally would get XP for. I'm not concerned about my own XP but more, I'm level 35, what's the lowest I can carry through this dungeon run and have them all still get XP for it.

Transmog might be the only thing I miss.

I don't want to look like a crossdressing Pennywise.

I'm really curious about what he's doing on his end. I see a LOT of hamstring spam, but I don't think I ever see him do an MS. He doesn't seem to keep Rend up.
---
I mean, I guess he's HS fishing for an overpower? Or he was just so sure he was gonna win he was just trying to keep you from getting away.
---
Oh, interesting! Good to know, thanks.
---
That's awesome.
---
Like to see what it looks like on a female orc
---
Before diminishing returns I drowned a human by keeping him poly’d in the small stream next to Nessingwary in STV.
---
I've been waking up around 3:30-4am to play before work. I was in STV/1K needles this past week so it was just really nice to be able to quest without getting ganked. All of the horde I ran into have been very friendly, actually.
---
Yeah, this is what shapes the high-end PvP meta. Paladins are ten times more impactful than any racial, and alliance premades have a gigantic advantage for this reason. On top of that, the fact that horde has more casual PvPers means alliance typically have short BG queues, further incentivizing hardcore PvPers to go alliance.
---
On private servers, this gradually evolved into a situation where nearly all premaders were alliance, meaning they just get to farm PUGs all day to rank up while horde can barely premade because of insane queues. Hopefully cross-realm BGs will alleviate that problem a little, as well as the fact that a lot of people will be done ranking by the time BGs come out.
---
The beautiful thing about classic is there is no major catch up mechanics so people will always be running MC.
---
Yes, they are real, and they cut glass!
---
I don’t even know what part of the game this is, but the emotion really kicked me. You really know how to get the emotions to kick in.

I know her! I quested with her for a while :)

i fricking love classic.
---
Currently leveling a Enchancement Shaman which is now 34. I've got one problem; I find the Ench playstyle extremely boring. I'm doing 2hander + rockbiter, as it's supposed to be the quickest. I recently also got the Corpsemaker, and don't have a good 1hander yet so I won't switch to 1hander+windfury/flametongue as it'll be way slower.
---
My question is. Could I switch to Elemental now, before 40, and do alright? All my gear is agi/str/stam, with only half my pieces stored with some int/spirit in them. The playstyle of Lightning shield, totem, (maybe shock) + AA to death is tedious, so hoping to switch to ele asap.
---
If I were to switch to another class, I'm considering either spriest or warlock. Do they have a more varied leveling rotation and flavor?  Appreciative of any input
---
Well that sucks.. that means i have 1 less zone.. how did people even get to 60, when vanilla launched..
---
A normal sight in vanilla as well. Those tigers were well sought after.
---
I have to load a blank profile then reload my profile for it to work.
---
Also move anything very much affects SuF and you shouldn't have it running.
---
if you
---
Theres two download buttons, ones for retail and ones for classic. I was doing the same thing.
---
if you want a mount at 40, and don’t have the gold, it’s 110% because YOU made mistakes with saving gold... everyone who got their mount at 40 will tell you, it takes NO PROFESSION. just don’t go crazy at your class trainer... and run more dungeons :) (never pass either no matter the roll &lt;3)
---
If I do a quest that is low level to me, do I still get the same XP for it? Or does the XP reward scale?
---
How do you get the faction and class icon?
---
by solo types, i mean those hordes gangin up on you are not actually grouped but just see the opportunity nearby. however coordinating as a group of 5 to wipe them does still require some skill, so youre probably still shit out of luck.

What are your guys best solo warrior levelling tips?

I’ll never understand this.  I played 5 years of wow and came across rares and other aesthetic items and if I could make a lot of gold I’ll sell that shit every time.  I would buy my way to 300 cooking/alchemy/1st aid those are useful having a purple bird is stupid
---
Blizz nerfed Classic?
---
Don't forget there is still layering in play too, so once that's lifted you will be playing with more folks you can see.
---
I would fight that ban because kids are allowed to play on your account.
---
Well when it launched they usually ran out of quests around 57ish and dungeon spammed to 60. Winterspring elites and epl elites are the way to go.
---
And because of that I'm only level 29
---
If people experience difficulties on their realm due to the opposite faction outnumbering them then they will just move to a server where their faction is higher represented instead of staying and creating a positive alliance presence which could attract more players to the alliance side and help with the balance
---
Just spec a bit owl
---
in vanilla D stance reduced fall damage, so you could survive any single drop you suffered at 100% health
---
Note how i mentioned "best" players and by that i mean hardcore raiding community.
---
No 2 players are alike and you can always rank players based on their performance in raid from 1 to 40. Now less then 0.1% of wow population have a game knowledge required to read logs to that level and do something like that. I am sure a casual guild is perfectly fine with rolling.
---
Since you are a warlock, you should find him easy. He is in UC, next to the summoning circle on the right side when coming from the tailor.
---
It's not better, it's a different game. A lot of quality of life features are missing, but classic is more immersive. Retail has years of content that can be run to see the story or get collectibles, too. The gameplay is the starkest difference, as classic is slower paced but more strategic.
---
Mobs in spellcleave groups do not last long enough for tab target dotting to be effective. I was doing a bunch of BRD spellcleave grinding to get from 57 to 60 and would often start tossing corruption on things when I got shield bashed out of hellfire, but it was really pretty pointless and I mostly did it just to feel like I was contributing -something- during the fire school lockout.

What's a good amount of money to have at level 26? I've only got about 3-4g which doesn't seem like a lot, I'm blowing a lot of my money on mats for engineering (which was recommended to me in a guide for a warlock) but the only useful thing I've crafted are a set of goggles and explosives I never use
---
The reason I swore an oath never to let a tomato ripen.
---
One thing that hasn't changed between classic and retail: the UC elevators are deadly as fuck!!
---
I hear that ele becomes a lot more viable at 40, so I'd say try to hold out until the. This is second hand information so take it with a grain of salt.
---
Having 2 crafting proffs and keeping up with them plus buying skills. You will be low on gold for a while. Make bags and sell them would be your best bet.
---
Go any non cloth class or you guys will be competing for loot constantly.
---
I recommend Druid so you can tank or range dps or just be your groups tank and go warrior.
---
With that set up you guys will get everything done even most elite quests, not all but most especially pre 40 ones
---
What was that explosion at the end? Sorry i am newbie
---
Damn, lots of assumptions being thrown around.
---
No, I’m about as quiet as lifters get. Hard to make much noise while squatting in particular lol.
---
I’m not the only one either, I’ve talked to several nice, respectful lifters at my current gym who were also told “you can’t do that here” for simple heavy barbell work.
---
Are they going to consistently be like that at every location? Probably not. But if anything about the goal of your company makes people think “you can’t do that here” then you’ve fucked up.
---
I’ll reiterate: fuck Planet Fitness.
---
I mean to be fair it COULD have been me. I don't camp but I do often KOS &lt;_&lt;

Yeah there should be a back camp area behind the fields with just runners.

Feels bad, I've tried out in two guilds who advertised with similar messages. Feels like I didnt join a guild at all. *Nobody* talks in guild chat, nobody does dungeons or wants to quest together, they have discord but it's mostly spam. Is your experience similar?
---
A 100 is just the rounded or shortened number. An internal roll actually has multiple decimal places.
---
I may be wrong, but it feels like tanks are actually more common. Plenty of people enjoy the warrior challenge.
---
You can't take off the Shaman weapon enhancement. Shaman can't even do it, they need to wait for it to expire.
---
best one so far
---
Warden Staff i  BFD? That's something!
---
I would like to know as well.
---
The enchanters in duskwood drop a tailoring recipe needed for a warlock class quest. That recipe atm will sell for 20g or more. So try to get it while grinding exp, and sell it in the neutral AH, horde warlocks need you.
---
The attention to detail is truly admirable.

People say that warriors are very gear dependent. 
---
I’m running a permadeath dual wielding fury spec dwarf warrior (warhammer slayer) I’ve been playing through without equipping a head chest back or shoulder slot. I’m only level 11 so far but it’s going smoothly. I’m wondering if making it to 60 is possible with this setup or if I’ll run into a gear related limitation.
---
I’ve never leveled a warrior past 22
---
I’m also playing on a pvp server (lmao) but on a less populated server. My ultimate goal is to die gloriously in an endgame raid.
---
Can it be done or is this a fools errand? Tips from more experienced warrior players?
---
Is there a recipe like that for Horde aswell?
---
How many times to you use the word nuts in your daily life
---
If you want \#nochanges, you gotta escape the hash with a backslash (\\#nochanges)
---
I bought the chest and boots (17g total), but I got Ravager, shoulder, and helm in THREE runs. Legs took me forever. I didn't keep track but as I've spent almost all of my 30s in SM I'd estimate 50 Arm/Cath runs for legs :).
---
But they have to do it one person at a time and only against the opposing faction and only if PvP is enabled. Warlocks can drop an internal in their own towns and go get a snack while it kills people of the warlocks faction until it dies regardless of PvP status. I loved the infernals, but that's just pure grief for huge amounts of players that aren't supposed to have to deal with fried from you. (Your faction)
---
It's a BOE item.
---
Alliance also get it outside Orgrimmar, for an extra challenge
---
Sulfuras also fits that bill!!!
---
Your girlfriend was great healing me last night ;)
---
Ohhhh this one came very good! I can feel his hate!
---
&gt;Here is a copy pasta if anybody wants: "My Infernal does not work the same as in vanilla. In Vanilla, summoned Warlock Infernals, when released from control, were aggressive to everyone, had an AOE immolation aura, and stood in the area they were summoned until killed.   
---
&gt;Now, they are only aggressive to the summoning warlock, have no AOE ability, and despawn after a few seconds of no combat. Why is this? This is not a simple "bug fix", you changed a core mechanic of the infernal. Why does it despawn? Why is not not aggressive? Why does the aoe not hit everything? Instead it just attacks things that attack it. Please let me know how to fix my Infernal spell, as it is clearly bugged and does not work as it did in Vanilla."
---
Thanks, will use. &lt;3
---
Even as a non-warlock watching a grand ball of green fire fall from the skies only to poke the warlock to death and despawn is immersion breaking as hell. I still remember the first infernal i saw in Vanilla. It's existence ties back to WC3 very well.

I am also wearing a red shirt yes! Quest reward in Westfall.
---
Leveling other weapon skills doesn't take long. I went from 1 - 175 guns in probably 30 mins on low level grey mobs after using bows exclusively. Go with the weapon skill relevant for whatever your BIS weapon is. If the next BIS weapon you pick up is the other skill, just level that skill for a little bit and use that. Gives you a bit of variety.
---
Thanks, man!
---
Yeah, it takes ages to turn those into bandages, but you can AFK it.
---
Necrosis have a setting for both bag max and max shards in total.
---
Cool, thank you! And how can I tell what level a quest is? I'm mainly not sure if it's worth doing green quests!
---
your lies need to be at least somewhat believable
---
or dont be a puss and get honor wherever you go. or if youre on the dominant side then, carry on.
---
No rogues are intended. Infernal dropping was properly purposed as a fun ability that was abused and ruins towns.
---
Towns are suppose to be safe. Gaint leash tags are likely where unintended I'm sure whoever did that was like no one will waste their time, but the second it crosses the city someone shoulda programmed a leash trigger. They left that in because well everyone would be in an uproar.
---
If I'm the smartest person in the room where in trouble, but yea causing mass chaos in town isn't a great thing 99% of the time sure the first few times you see something in a town it's like yeah that's fun let me help out, and guess what I experienced that 15 years ago, and I'm happy they left it in for everyone to see that didn't experience it, but no I don't need soon to be locks getting their rocks off in towns.
---
Towns are places people go to afk with the expectation of relative security people running things to town is relatively rare, and time consuming, and you can mess up. 
---
If you can't see how that's different then say a lock that shouts hey all locks drop your infernals in the bank. Well then I can't help you see the light, but again this isn't a good thing, and I'm a long time lock player.
---
Things like getting mind controlled off a boat again are different your not within the confines of a town danger is a reality anyplace outside of town on a pvp server that's what you sign up for. I knew what I was signing up for and the cost and benefits of picking that server type. I doubt the orginal designers intended you to be griefed at will with zero effort in towns, and fully believe this would have been patched. I sorta blame 15 year old me for not bringing it more to the light back then. I guess I had 15 years to grow up.
---
It's rough though, because you have to abandon and start from scratch. If you're serious, it's worth it but takes some effort.
---
Should be possible, but pretty time consuming. You will have to farm stuff quite a bit lower level than you, but that just makes it slower, not necessarily hard.
---
these posts are just so silly. everyone is not moving as one big group or some shit.
---
Hey I’m a complete noob that is wondering around enjoying the game but I don’t have any idea of when to do dungeons. I’m a lvl 16 Tauren Warrior and I’m following a skill point guide to be a tank, but thats all the guidance I have.
---
Should I be getting ready to do a dungeon? If so, what and where?
---
I got irrationally angry at the rogue part lol
---
At first i thought going back to mob tagging would be a pain, but it’s one of those mechanics that fosters connectivity and cooperation. It’s small, but one of my best moments so far is stopping off at that spider cave in wetlands to farm spider silk for my tailoring gear. Met a gnome warrior doing his class quest and teamed up. Helped him burn through spiders and in return he gave me all the silk he picked up, more than enough to make my robe and shoes. More than anything i miss those “power of friendship” moments from the old days. WotLK is still my favorite expansion with regards to content, but lfg changed the social landscape so much that it was a major factor leading to me leaving the game for years.
---
I use Necrosis, which automatically deletes shard, and you can customize to permit X amount of extra shards in your other bags. It’s mainly known and used because of the handy and minimalistic actionbar. Can only recommend it!
---
As many locks have stated before: Any lock with respect for themselves has Necrosis.
---
Never happened

whats the recipe called?

DIRECTED BY MICHAEL BAY
---
I'm sorry if my enjoyment upset you, but the point here isn't "LOOK AT MAH LEWT!" the point is things like the Scarlet set are what set Classic apart from every other game, including retail. Retail needs more fun stuff like this to chase :)
---
A shield that damages nearby monsters when you block. Literally the best aoe tanking shield there is. Then you have bombs for additional aoe threat, and all kinds of gadgets for pvp and pve purposes.
---
Why?
---
Is it green?
---
It’s great, isn’t it? Love the versatility of hunters.
---
No where is safe from the horde you coward ally scum
---
That's completley different your talking about opposing fractions.
---
I didn’t wanna spell it twice
---

---
&gt; no, that's on blizzard not being transparent.
---
you're an idiot go back to runescape
---
That's how it's always been though. The words and definitions we use today have come to be accepted in much the same way at some point in the past. As such it can hardly be considered moronic that natural languages continue to evolve and change as they always have in conjunction with the people that speak them, wouldn't you agree?
---
Just some of the reasons I rushed leveling:
---
Killing Lowbies
---
Killing all quest NPC's while dishonorable kills are not in game
---
Killing escort NPCs
---
Letting NPCs get killing blow to reduce durability
---
Killing hunter pets first
---
Camping dungeon entrances
---
Fearing tagged mobs to cause chain pull
---
ZG crocs become more valuable iirc, and anyone besides mages might have a tough time w that one
---
I was in Hillsbrad last night heading to Tarren Mill, I was trying to remember the route, looked around to see what the environment looked like and had a moment where I was like "I know exactly where I am". Memories from playing back in the day coming back to me. Great moment.
---
I’ll drop the hammer of justice on you, you horde scum.
---
It's such a fun chase! Retail needs more stuff like this.
---
How big of a difference would my leveling be if I switched from Affliction to SL Demo at 40?
---
I’m a couple bars from 40 on my warlock and would love to try a different talent set up.
---
Ok thanks
---
You have to talk to people mate

I've been there before.

It's not worth it. 
---
Yes this game is great but don't fuck up all the 'real' stuff in your life. Especially if you are studying
---
Don't make our mistakes for a game's second release
---
No because warmode LUL
---
But.. why?
---
Justice demands retribution!
---
In the video. Many people have reported this.
---
Personally sounds fun (hope you don't get a lag spike and fall off a cliff), but the pvp server part is pushing it. There's no way to avoid contested zones really, all it takes is one level 60 who feels like clicking a few buttons to ruin your day.
---
Camp T quest, caged quilboar has you take out a bunch of other quilboar for revenge.
---
Yeah that happens. Might have something to do with that I was killing Horde all morning so they started baiting me into traps XD. #PvPLife
---
The GOAT wow assassination.
---
Yeah you'll sometimes find these quests that take you to other zones and those are the game's way of trying to get you to see the other zones too. Between 10 and 25 you should atleast partly see Elwynn, Redridge, Westfall, Darkshore, Loch Modan and Duskwood.
---
cast bar is quartz
---
Holy shit, that's super interesting/awesome! Thanks for the insight.
---
Honored is 81 and 9. It’s a 10% discount from 90 and 10.
---
It's there now. Don't know why that says phase 6. It was always there day 1 in classic
---
By that logic you are retarded. There is a reason that you cant kill lv7 Horde people in Tirisfal as Alliance unless they attack you first
---
Fishing Buddy automatically adjusts the volume when you start fishing but no API trigger is available for the bobber itself. The bobber is in the sound effects channel, so if you turn down music, ambiance, and dialog, you'll hear the bobber better.
---
&gt;"I like it because it's awesome, it's awesome awesome awesome and it's a bonus so it's awesome!"

Yikes.

Cheers man, thanks for that.

youre the reason why blizzard shouldve stuck to the idea of only having locks be on horde. you sound like a complete bore.

White but BoP 0.o
---
Your rotation would be the same, your damage wouldn't be very different. You might notice you get a little tankier and your demons getting a small boost. 
---
Voidwalker sacrifice is amazingly powerful, especially if you got points in Fel Domination - Master Summoner, so you can sacrifice one voidwalker and summon a new one immediately after, and sacrifice that one too.
---
I think he means why is it necessary to have the toons actually there and naked when it can be done via whisper while they quest or something lol
---
So many reposts
---
Why wouldn't they?  At the very least most people are creating bank alts, [which would explain the vast majority of characters scanned on Incendius being lvl 1.](http://www.classicrealminfo.com/Chart/Incendius)  Then you have people that want to try the different classes to see which one they like best, one char for Horde one char for Alliance.

Plot Twist: Dog didnt make it...

lovecraft not warcraft

thatd be retail

No. Better but not gone for Herod.
---
Many servers have no queue.
---
This felt like a RoadRunner episode
---
5k 😂
---
Dude, that is the cost of 6 epic mounts. No one will spend 5k on anything except real life goods and services. 
---
5k was probably its cost in WoD, where people could farm thousands of gold a day.
---
only smart ppl join lfg
---
I had a similar experience a few days ago. We were looking for a DPS to run Scarlet Monastery Cathedral. After 15 minutes of searching, we finally found a mage. We weren't able to pull more than 4 mobs because we lacked AOE-Damage except his Blizzard, but we managed to clear the whole instance with 0 wipes and only 1 death. So i asked all of them, if they want to do another run on which the mage replied: "WTF? hell no, the exp/hour is so shit in this group, who runs this dungeon with a hunter? learn to spell-/ or meleecleave retards"... And then he left.
---
I don't know, i see way too many tryhards rushing the journey instead of enjoying it.
---
dude get real a minor inconvenience for a great event.
---
DUDE. You need to shop these images out somewhere as frames for a show or something. Imagine an anime-esque/cartoon World of Warcraft: Classic TV show? It could be based around a group of 5 adventurers who do dungeons and specific questlines. I definitely think there’s someone out there who would pick that up... If you ever need help writing a pilot, hit me up :’)
---
What levelling add-on are you guys using? Tried AllyRoute but switched to guidelime - Sages guide, because AllyRoutes numbers don't seem to add up with live servers, sometimes asked to grind entire levels. Just wondering if anyone found something that works great for them?
---
Many people are saying that video is bs. I remember the myth in vanilla.
---
Soul bags have counters on them.
---
Man. Such intense hate in this one. God it's good.
---
I lead a raid in desolace to pvp last night. Alliance doesnt pvp I'm fun enough.
---
If you think we shouldn't take things we've learned in the past 15 years if you were under some assumption classic wasn't ever going to see a patch your in for a rude awakening buddy.
---
You can Block as you're about to hit the ground. Duh.
---
By the light!
---
Are you sure it was Gnomish and not Common?
---
Nope I bought it for 82 and 8 if I'm remembering correctly. 90 in total though, correct
---
Sucks that he decided to include both factions but couldn't hide his love for the alliance. lol
---
Yeah man everyone is gank thirsty. Getting ganked is just another coefficient in the xp/hr formula on a pvp server.
---
Hunters can get aoe threat easily using a pet with screech. If I use screech instead of claw my pet ends up tanking half the trash in a run at least.
---
Why tho
---
Anyone know if they're going to allow name changes in wow classic?

I'm just about to respec without imp drain soul because I find it just about useless. It only lasts for a few seconds and I barely regen anything in that time. What am I missing?
---
Might be. Quillboars are always up to some wack shit so it's better to just kill them in case
---
Was expecting another Distract clip.
---
Was hilariously surprised, well done that rogue.

Azeroth Auto Pilot is amazing. Quesie is also nice - I use both at the same time.
---
For AAP, make the macros 
---
/aap reset
---
/aap skip
---
That's rather rude.
---
Who still goes across layers AFAIK, and servers like the PP mentioned as really very quiet. I doubt there is much if any layering on those servers.
---
I never knew. and I'm using a soul bag right now, and didn't see the number... thanks for the info!
---
I'm playing on the most popular PvP server in my language and people are super rude. I constantly buff everyone I see but I rarely get buffed. I'm levelling up herbalism and mining and I constantly get my nodes stolen while I'm fighting next to it. Same thing for quests where it requires to kill X boss. Trade/world chat is constantly spammed by people who wants to rush the content. Sure I've met some nice people but I feel like it's rare to meet players who enjoys the game as I do (not rushing/optimizing everything and putting the social aspect above all)
---
I kinda want to stop or go level up another character on a more chill realm. How is the community on the RP servers ? Is it any different or is the community the same everywhere ?
---
I think that’s the problem with a lot of players — the games ARE their lives.
---
Unfortunately they can’t. It can still be drawn, though 🤤
---
Cool, thanks. RFC was fun so I’ll definitely do it a couple more times.
---
Because the toons are so damn sexy.
---
Nice. Never been, I’ll check it out.
---
Yea they do. The shit part is on thunderfury a lot of mats in the beginning are on the AH lower that vendor prices. I think we are using auctioneer and not understanding. So I’ve been saving a lot to sell in a few weeks/months
---
Whats the required lvl of tailoring to craft it and whats the best spot to farm spideys?
---
You could actually go further than this. So the the rest of the group aren't waiting around when the final member is found, it could even teleport them directly the dungeon.
---
Does anyone remember a really old addon called [Linkerator](http://fizzwidget.com/notes/linkerator/)?  
---
I used it heavily as it had the very nice function of being able to type:  
---
[ITEM NAME]  
---
and it would autofill/autolink the item you were trying to show. It later became [Linkepedia](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/linkepedia), but has been discontinued since circa 2015.   
---
Hoping that some addon creator will revive it, as it was massively useful. Hope this post draws some attention to it. :)
---
I just hope they won't add bc to it after the last phase it would make me quit again just like the last time they did it.
---
I leveled through questing and had ~300g when I hit 60. Did every dungeon quest for another ~400g, made the last 200 doing a few days of herbing.
---
Nah it wasn't there m8. Also full Ravager warrior cleave groups didn't happen.
---
Yeah as long as you have engineering, and mining on an alt, the secondary doesn't matter hugely. Pick whatever you like. Blacksmithing offers weapon chains, so you don't need another blacksmith to apply it for you.
---
What was your end goal? Was it to feel smart? I can’t see why you’d write that. I’d understand if I wrote "literally forever" but that wasn’t the case. In this case is an Idiom and properly used.
---
So fuck off little girl.
---
Then it should be sold and split between all group members. An item worth several hundred should not go to one person when they don't want to equip it.
---
&gt; STV 
---
just created a new character on ten storms, pm me ig "Norgul" :)
---
It simply parses the combat log. Going to be pretty hard to break it and not break a ton of other things
---
I quested for about 3 hours in Desolace and Dustwallow without being ganked once. Anytime you see a Horde hit your /tickle /wave macro and keep on keeping on.
---
Wish I knew as well. Also using AllyRoute but I'm also running into those steps where you're directed to grind out to a specific XP threshold. Also while questing in Desolace it had a step listed to do an elite quest and a few deaths later I decided to move on from that entirely.
---
Guidelime seems okay but I can't find a guide that works best, and AzerothAutoPilot broke for me as early as level 20 (and the Discord doesn't seem to be entirely helpful + no update since August).
---
Zygor seems to be the one with the most features and detailed to the bone, but of course the unfortunate part is it's locked behind a paywall. I've tried it a little ~~(friend may have shared the add-on with me oops)~~ but I can't really give a solid review yet. For example the 35-40 guide has you cover parts of STV but AllyRoute sends you there before level 35, and then sends you back again a little after 35.
---
connection issue, not the server, there are anything upto a dozen hops (or more) which your connection is routed through to get to the server, if any one of them is faulting then you can have problems, lag spikes, DC's etc.
---
First thing you should always do regardless of what you think is the problem is to power cycle your router.
---
If the problem persists, download WinMTR 0.93 and find the games IP address, then play the game while the test is running, if it is latency/packet loss it will show on the test where it is starting and that will help your ISP in fixing the problem, if it's their end easy enough if it between them and the server it's a bit more work but they should deal with it.
---
Yep, a nose and a mustache
---
"Who are you?"
---
"I'm ya, but stronker and hairier."
---
Ohhh yeah gotcha, when you said make I thought like in the game
---
Not only what the other guy told you but humans have a skill they can use that increases the length at which they can detect invis targets.
---
Whenever you're in a settlement just check out the some of the trade good vendors because it's common they'll have a couple in stock. Not so much a blacksmith but the generic Trade Goods or Alchemy Supplies et cetera do.
---
Im pretty low level still but tailoring has so far been 100% profit.  I make bolts of cloth, make bags of that tier and put them on the ah until I’m able to make the next tier of bolt, repeat.  Its not a ton of money but it hasn’t cost me anything so far.
---
Ain't nobody using TellMeWhen and WeakAuras
---
No, deviate delight is the designated ERP server for classic.
---
I'm not sure 'who' does... I've seen people message on the local chat, done /who and found they're not there.
---
Spellcleave sm gy and am lib until 36

Yeah I have no will or interest in raiding that seriously. I'm still level 23.

I never knew every 38 warrior in existence took selfies and used reddit

I have never been to a gym where the people werent super enthused about showing a new guy around. And I mean the patrons not the employee trying to sell me a membership. Possibly one of the most welcoming environments I've ever been in
---
So is half a brain.

Ralph pls leave
---
You should sell your healing services to the highest bidding party lol
---
Patch 1.12 is long after the multiple waves of pet normalization. Typically pets are the same speed, with the only differences being attack speed and stat weighing. wow-petopia has a lot of helpful information in this regard
---
Target green mobs. They do much less damage to you and you have a much smaller chance to miss/parry. You may be getting less exp per kill but you will have less downtime due to eating/bandaging. I also talented into improved gouge for the extra 1.5 seconds for the gouge/bandage combos.  Plus when you get in your mid thirties you get to start stunlocking your targets and will take much less damage. 
---
Good luck!
---
They didn't, he's made that up.
---
Wife and I started on d1. We're 26 I think now.

Any chance you could see what's wrong with this?  
---
 Why does this macro not work?
---
"#showtooltip Viper Sting(Rank 1) /cast \[mod\]Viper Sting(Rank 1);Arcane Shot(Rank 5)" (clicking shift doesn't do anything)
---
But this one does work: 
---
"#showtooltip Serpent Sting(Rank 5) /cast \[mod\]Scorpid Sting(Rank 2);Serpent Sting(Rank 5) /cast Rapid Fire" (Clicking shift casts scorpid sting.
---
Im new to wow can someone explain what just happened
---
It's good against casters because of the spell interrupt.
---
I was the Druid in the group when the pants dropped for you. Funny seeing you post about it and congrats
---
If you’re only healing then you can probably do it fine if you set up some auto targeting for party members. 
---
When out in open world as a Druid it’s difficult to weave healing in because I need to manually mouse over them and it gets a bit hectic.
---
You don’t like the armour?
---
Oh you mean where I had to travel around the world find unique sources of water bring them back to a trainer who isolates and purifies them and then use that to find and fight a corrupted water elemental?
---
Of course!  And that's fine :).  The point here is this was a super fun loot chase and's nowhere near endgame.  Retail and every other MMO out there could learn from Scarlet Monastery and the Chain of the Scarlet Crusade.
---
literally just kill mobs and sell things
---
Find a good place with mobs 0-2 levels below you that drop trash worth 5-10s+ and just kill til your bags are full.
---
Make sure you’re training you pet abilities. A lot of hunters seem to forget this for whatever reason. Good luck!
---
There is a gym by me where the cheapest package is 200$ sign on fee and 80$/mo after that. For the minimum package.
---
Can you animate? I think you could make some good money doing youtube shorts of these quests being played out. Id definitely sub to that. Your art is perfect
---
As a hunter, we hate these guys too, don’t worry. Not all of us are inconsiderate morons. Melee items (even if a massive upgrade) go to melee first, then us. That way when a ranged weapon drops it goes to us first. Balance.
---
peak performance

---
You could go Wetlands, in the northeast there is dragons with low hp and they drop pet, alchemy mats and they are skinnable, I belive levels 25-28, but only the higher lvl ones drop the pet. So this would be nice until lvl 30 atleast. Most of the mats are more valuable later, but it's not a long time until everybody wants to buy fire protection potions for raid night.
---
What kind of profession setup are you running on your main? Cooking? First aid?
---
Do you have an alt with few other professions?
---
If you cast fort while you MC someone, it ends the MC and they get fort. You can buff horde with it
---
Oh we’re horde BTW! :D
---
Thanks.
---
We are long way off from then as well. So you might :)
---
What server?
---
I remember there been 8+ mages in raids just not all this AoE dungeon farming bullshit it’s not for me and I’m a mage prefer a well rounded group having a laugh and a joke to been efficient
---
We will see :) i mean nothing wrong with butting those face melting a holes in their place ^^
---
Are you playing alliance? Because in my horde pvp guild lock is the second most represented class after warrior and mage.
---
So I never played vanilla. And I thought that the idea of internals being hostile and having to be enslaved while it weakened them a bit was really cool. Though you mentioned infernals being kinda useless now. Did they actually really serve a purpose or do anything back in vanilla other than troll low level zones and cities? Cause you couldn't bring them into raids or dungeons right? And they didn't offer anything for pop other than their aoe damage. So as a lock that's getting close to learning inferno. What is it actually good for?
---
Multiboxing is blizzlike. There were never any rules against multiboxers, only account sharing. Besides, it’s not easy, costs money, and requires a lot of time the more multiboxing they do.
---
Oh and I’m lvl 19 btw :)
---
Unfortunately I don’t have unlimited data so I only connect via wifi. Other people who do have said that it’s playable though. Unsure about how much data.
---
Also get a 14 slot bag as a quest reward
---
Back in my day, "cleave" meant a 3v3 arena team with two melee and a healer.
---
HIS NAME IS WHY
---
As a level 31 Alliance dual boxer, I'm stuck on quests.  Been grouped (duh) so grinding xp is lower, and the quest xp hasn't taken me up to a new zone yet.  Been farming the Rotting Orchard in Duskwood as it's great for leather, mining, and skinning, but xp has plummeted.  
---
Can rarely instance as I get family aggro often.  
---
Are there any areas where the mobs are level 30-31 and it isn't a high horde traffic zone?
---
Tbf if you went up to one of those dude-bros and said idk how to work this muscle I'll bet they would all fall over themselves trying to be the one to help you
---
I’m a level 19 warrior. Do I use the twin blades axe if the tiger or edged bastard sword of the stamina? I’m guessing axe for its strength and stamina?
---
I think you'll find your experience is more of an anomaly then his was.
---
I had about 80 gold @ 40. I'd only train tailoring with bug making stuff. So I didn't' spend gold on much. To me, Professions will be easier to handle when I'm maxed.
---
Being a jerk?
---
He was eating. You are correct.
---
This is how I got 300 fishing!
---
What is the name of this set?
---
I didn't have an issue in STV groups realized quickly if you kill me with more than 3 I will camp you when it's a 2v1 till you Spirit res. I also have more time available then most.
---
People have been playing private vanilla servers for years and as such have time to perfect and master every element of the game including each and every class, this master-minding of the game resulting in breaking everything down into cold hard calculations including; ranking every class and spec, the highest possible damage rotations, the 'best in slot' gear for each spec, where to grind for levelling or gold, how to defeat every raid boss to perfection etc etc.
---
all of this information is published on various web sources and available for anyone to read, these hardcore 'pro' gamers that play for 12+ hours a day have been making use of said information to choose the most optimal class/specs/professions/leveling routes etc.
---
Nah it's the commitment issue. I never have a set weekly schedule so I dont commit to raiding guilds currently. I plan to just pug MC/BWL and call it a day.
---
What is layering?
---
It's not that big of a deal, it's a low lvl wep, big upgrade for me, but hey ho, few more levels and theres an even better weapon from razorfen. Just a little annoying that he waited ages before rolling then instantly left. It was an obvious ninja. Rest of the group were a little annoyed by it.
---
I'll give it a try
---
Tried today. Didn’t work for enemy faction.
---
It's ok to go a little crazy when first trying a game and WoW itself can be addictive.
---
Even though this is probably a sarcastic post, take a breather, see yer gf and get some assignments done for school.
---
WoW is ment to be run like a marathon, it will be there when you have free time, don't run it like a race, sacrificing time to play it.

No, it is perfect fit.

They don't. I tried a couple weeks ago I had a bunch in my desk from one I bought Wrath of the Lich King and mist of Pandaria on cd. My friend who is making me account said that it would only work on retail
---
It's more about people's perceptions, most people will write it off before even entering a gym because they're worried they'll be made fun of or stared at for being fat/out of shape/weak. But yeah, the vast majority of frequent gym goers/rats won't even give anyone a second glance, they'll be really focused on their own workout and usually are glad to share their knowledge.

I was looking for like 5 minutes for places to cook food near SW AH yesterday. Then it dawned on my that I'm an idiot and I can make fire myself. I was getting pissed that the inn didn't have a cooking area and was seriously considering going to IF to cook on the light barrel things.
---
I got Iri and golden pearl in clam the other day aswell, but on my server golden pearls barely go for 1g. :(
---
I like the "Rage: 0" indication. Yea, fishing does keep the rage away :)
---
It is

Zul’Farak is better for grinding xp/gold. Uldaman is good to run once for quests, unless you are a hunter and are farming the polearm for your pre raid BiS
---
I'm on Skeram and we still have queues occasionally, but not every night. I'm hoping that the queues now translate to a healthy population 6 months down the line. I wouldn't want to be on a low pop server now, that's for sure.
---
I’ll just go to 24/hr fitness where I can judge to my hearts content.
---
Transmog is trash.
---
Honestly, after having tanked all but the last few dungeons (I'm 54 atm) it's dawning on me why vanilla was considered so hard. People are so incredibly bad. People panicking and running all over the place, no spatial awareness, had a rogue pop blade flurry and focus the non-marked mob every single pack for all of maraudon despite me telling him not to do it at least every third pack. People charging in and pulling 3 extra packs when I'm LoS pulling despite me telling them to stay behind. Honestly tanking isn't hard because of tanking but because of herding the geniuses that are most dps players. Also fuck spellcleave.
---
Awesome! Thanks for the tips mate. I'm an Ork, should I bother with swords or just stick to the 2H Axe?
---
Biggle Boi checking in!
---
Mik’s floating combat text gives you heal information as well I believe
---
Vendor price also shows the price of the stack you have.
---
My flatmate is level 57 and said he ran out of quests to do? Did that happen to you as well, what did you do to get the last couple of levels to 60?
---
Yeah I’ve done very few dungeons on my mage, leveling a rogue in between and I’ve done more on him.
---
I work nightshifts at a hotel and if it's a dull night, I can essentially play WoW or watch Netflix for about 6 hours on an 8 hour shift. 
---
Which I do. 
---
That doesn't impede my ability to do my job properly, on the contrary, it makes me not fall asleep the 6 hours where nothing happens and keeps me awake should a guest walk through the door or any other situation arise.
---
Started minute 1! Took a week off work, don’t have a character above 25! I’m too much of an altaholic
---
It's like with everything else to day. All about efficiency and beging optimised to hell. Dont get me wrong not bashing it, it's what I do with my RL. This is just what the mentality of the human species is evolving into now that everyone is connected and we are by nature competitive, natural selection and all that stuff. 
---
So it bleeds into gaming as it does with every facet in life. 
---
I mean compare any sport in the 80's and to day. Same stuff going on here, benefit of wow begin wow its totally optional to partake in the min/max culture. 
---
It's also worth keeping in mind that the min/max minded players are most likely the most invested players and therefore, more likely to be posting in this sub for instance or spamming LFG. 
---
Try making your own groups if you have not already, and friend the players you enjoy playing with.
---
\#showtooltip \[nocombat\]Charge;Intercept
---
/dismount
---
/cast \[form:1,nocombat\]Charge;\[form:1,combat\] Berserker Stance;\[form:2,combat\]Berserker Stance;\[form:3,combat\]Intercept; Battle Stance
---
Here's mine. It shows the tooltip of your active Charge/Intercept ability. You'll dismount if mounted. If you're in Battle Stance and not in combat, you'll charge. If you're in in combat and out of Berserker stance, you'll switch to Zerker. If in combat and zerker, Intercept. Else Battle Stance.
---
You can remove the /dismount line to not have it dismount you.
---
Okay? Try being a cloth wearer and have a leather+ take your gear at max level. It's not looked down upon either.
---
There is bananabar (but only useful for raiding/dungeons). It gives you basicaly a list with marked enemies, so you can easily click them.
---
All the time
---
Blizzard, hire this man. I would kill for an animated classic WoW series
---
Spellcleave = 
---
**Cleave**: To split something, aka split damage, aka splash/area damage
---
**Spell**: Specifically causing spell damage
---
Thus a **Spellcleave** = a group designed to cause splash/area spell damage.
---
Damnit, I might have to reroll now...
---
Here’s a pro tip, l2p. You just stretched out an 18 second per mob time to 47 seconds. If you just stood there you would increase your mob xp/hr by 250%.
---
Also, only one L in “below”. A “bellow” is something that blows, which coincidentally, is something in common with your clip.
---
Funny that you dont mention locks because a mage wont beat a soul link lock with equal skill in a duel. Theirs just no chance that its happening.
---
Accept the request, and whisper them a link to a dick-pic.
---
They won’t be at the peak dps now though.
---
The +Axe skill racial doesn't have a noticeable effect while leveling but if you get whirlwind axe, and then gatorbite from rotgrip in Maraudon, you're good for a long while. If you do get your hands on a decent sword, you can also go that route.
---
It gets better after lvl 40 or so when you receive higher lvls of stealth , moving at 70 %..
---
I didn't play cataclysm at all and I remember instant mail. I can't seem to locate patch notes indicating when it was changed, but I seem to remember it was just before VC. 
---
The WoW Vanilla Wiki, which contains info based on 1.12, says the following:
---
&gt;**How long does delivery take?**
---
&gt;* Simple messages arrive immediately. 
---
&gt;* Mail from the same account, regardless of attachments, takes one hour. 
---
&gt;* Mail from another account if items or money are attached takes one hour. 
---
&gt;*Mail from the Auction House to the buyer with the purchased item arrives immediately. 
---
&gt;*Mail from the Auction House to the seller with the money attached takes 1 hour. 
---
&gt;*Return mail arrives immediately.
---
False advertising, where is your dress?
---
I dont get it
---
Which is perfect because you only want smart people in your group
---
I'm looking for some addons that can show enemy player buffs and duration like berserker rage or ice block etc.
---
And ideally a threat meter like in retail that's shows threat percentage above the nameplate. 
---
Thanks :)
---
Hey bro, I don't have much right now but I promise when I get paid I will sub you. Please keep it up
---
I have a job because I need money to live. I do IT support, so my job can be busy at times. However, I get so caught up that when things do come up during the day I take care of them immediately. This does two things: I don’t fall behind, and people are happy their issues are taken care of quickly.

Stop calling these pet "problems" bugs. It's well known even before classic launched that private servers had no way to find values or anything at all on pet stats don't hey made them up. P servers had pet very very wrong  classic has pets the way it was in vanilla. This is not private servers.
---
Guest pass are a deprecated system.
---
You can currently play Retail WOW for free, for an unlimited time, up to level 20, with a handful of other restrictions.
---
Wow Classic however does require an active subscription to play whatsoever.
---
Oh well, that's a bummer.  
---
jfc youre actually scum. you got that from me calling you a panzy? i am by no means one of those people. no idea how you came to that conlcusion but you dont seem to bright to begin with. youre missing a verb in your first sentence. you also use your when it should be youre and at first you use apostrophes to seem like you have a clue when you dont. i understand you just fine just like how i can understand the writing of a child.
---
As I’ve said before, I found this amusing when it was an every so often thing. But look how many people were frothing at the mouth to do it now. Look how many priests are MCing people off the boat *every* chance they get, and at least that’s real PVP. 
---
Some things are ruined when too people are in on them and infernal terrorism is definitely one of those things.
---
Well yea.... it defeats the purpose of adding cool graphics, animations on items when you can just grab any ole piece of shit green and then just transmog it.
---
People hate the idea, that it devalues the work and effort you put into getting the gear.
---
Now when you see a full decked out T1 set, you know he put the time into it.
---
The big things are cool too
---
In my bags for when Daddy Warrior groups up with me :3
---
I recommended my friends to even stop leveling at 56+ as its waste of time, its better to literally just spam and grind BRD as you would do the same on 60, with one difference that is XP on the way. Two bugs with one shot.
---
Nope
---
Don’t worry it’s good touch
---
No doubt. I'm not saying they're bad people. It's just not the right environment for everybody.
---
When is Blizzard going to allow Faction and Realm transfers.
---
My gut told me to go Alliance on an RPPVP server, but I followed my buds into Horde on a Horde dominated server. I just want a 50/50 world pvp experience, without having to put 10 more days played in on a reroll.
---
Just cast it while channeling. The timing let’s it work. But the MC does break.
---
Zandalar on EU is quite balanced &amp; friendly
---
Your pet is so cute!
---
lmao, good one
---
Yep that was dope AF.
---
/r/ShittyLifeProTips
---
What
---
Funny you say that but back in the original classic i also rolled need on that exact weapon with my hunter haha. But i think no one else wanted it. But felt so great to have my first blue weapon.
---
Hehe, you never know 😁 It might, it might not.
---
Alliance sucks!! Hehe
---
Thanks for everyone that commented. I think I’ll pull the trigger based on how friendly everyone has been! See you there!
---
If only I didn't put 2 weeks into character I realised I didn't like that much but bought mount anyway so I don't even have money to transfer to my new character. FeelsBadMan
---
People didn't do this on the private servers either.
---
You beautiful bastard never change
---
Thanks i was trying to find this info last night searching through old patch notes lol.
---
I do this to find tanks and it works!
---
Yes, the other day I clipped through the door as it closed but the floor already started moving so I followed it down falling to my doom.
---
Which class specs make the best pvp partners for hunters in world pvp? We are thinking druid is a good choice so we can both kite and disengage when needed
---
Is there a list of key mage quest loot to look for when leveling?
---
just hit z tho m8
---
Is the same in every PVP server, but RP sure is more chill like you think
---
Im playing frost mage.
---
I spam frostbolt and frost nova on cooldown 24/7
---
Congratz my dude!
---
Just ask Lúthien to go.
---
Ah I see
---
I am playing properly and went much faster than anyone with voidwalker. Look up Draintanking.
---
Even on private servers this strategy wasnt used like it has been on Classic.
---
Im a madman that went mining/herbing gonna see how it plays out.
---
Or you get gather professions and sell on ah
---
I though it was 18G for the skill and 72G for the  mount.
---
90g total at Honored
---
"So why were you permanently banned?" I sent a dick pic to a gold seller :/
---
I'm playing a priest and am unsure on how to prioritize item stats.
---
I'm looking for INT and spirit, but what kind of balance do I need?
---
For example, which is better of a 13 INT item vs a 7 INT and 6 spirit item? 
---
With items that are closer together that both add up to the same amount of stats, I'm guessing I should pick the one with more INT?
---
&gt;demo Shout/roar
---
Likely doesn't have anything to do with it, I've seen groups of just mages/healers doing fine.
---
I honestly think it's just not something people were very aware of the possibility of way back when.
---
This is amazing hahah!
---
A lot of us came from emerald meme I feel
---
I'm not italian, but I wouldn't mind some ravioli!
---
That's your fault lol not blizzards
---
Always
---
His username would be perfect as "Bendova".
---
Let's say it is. Who cares? It's a cute and funny story.
---
What do you mean? When my auctions sell I get a message in chat that says "Your auction of whatever has sold"
---
wow thats like 700g worth of runecloth, how do you farm so much gold?
---
Bro, come to thunderfury
---
As a Horde player, I found this brilliant. Also to top it off, I think the soundtrack was from M-0-0-N who did a lot of the tracks in Payday 2, good listen on Spotify. Solid 9/10. Would have given 10/10 but fuck the Alliance. :D
---
It's not perfect but it does work
---
i tihnk the party members may disagree lol
---
#showtooltip Charge
---
/castsequence reset=2 Charge, Defensive Stance
---
No, i mean in chat when I loot it from the post (open the mail)
---
Bro, thank you!!! This has been so frustrating.
---
Immersion
---
You should be, it's an awesome set of gear and an iconic look for mid level mail wearers.
---
bro 😎💪
---
Genuinely me right now.
---
I got my mage to 60 and got my epic mount &amp; robes of the archmage. Will be starting a rogue as an alt sometime though
---
I wonder which one of you was more disappointed.
---
Falsified?
---
My god are you okay? Its not that hard to be friends with your colleagues and old college/high school friends and make plans with them to do things.
---
It really isn’t that hard. To be fair I am only Lvl 34 and I was around for launch. Only really play during weekends.
---
Do you mean like the loot message or like "your auction of xx was succesful, amount pending 1g"
---
So true
---
TIL. Guess the addons are pretty similar to each other.
---
Feels like theres been alot more great creative names then ive seen in retail for years.  
---
Just yesterday's highlights on Atiesh-US that i can remember:
---
&lt;Whiskey smells like father&gt;
---
&lt;Furious Pantaloons&gt;
---
Are druids worth twinking at 40 something for World pvp healing in a duo?
---
This is not true, I tried this with a low lvl friend and even when we were not in a party he got just a fraction of the xp he would’ve gotten for killing a mob solo. (And yes we tried it on multiple different mobs etc.)
---
Which bug ?!
---
Arathi Highlands always seemed pretty Alliance heavy.
---
Weakauras can do this.
---
Then again the information regarding also displayed on every ability that costs a shard.
---
What server do you play on so I can ignore you before I have to group with you
---
Is this the chain where you have to kill ths elite in the graveyard? I remember that from back in the day
---
bro i'm so torn rn... BRD spam or BORDI 3?
---
It didn't exist and the game was better for it.
---
People say each to their own, and I guess that's true, but I don't know if there's much of an honest argument to be made for ignoring 98% of the game's content in favour of doing one single thing repeatedly and en-masse.
---
That said, the main thing I fail to comprehend about this is: why Classic? Must every single thing be tainted by this "new way"? The entire - I mean literally the ENTIRE - point of Classic is to relive a game and an experience that came out 15 years ago.
---
If spellcleave is what you want, how is Classic possibly a better game for you than BfA?
---
Fittslem.
---
You continue to fall while IB'd.
---
Me too!
---
As mentioned in another comment, thanks for trying but that's stuff that's all been attempted already as mentioned in the thread on the forums. This isn't an issue that appears to be client side or is more likely an issue that is a l combination of client and server side and as of yet has not been acknowledged by blizzard due to it being swept up amongst the DDoS and general post launch load.
---
Thank you though irregardless for coming through
---
Instead of talking about how great you are at the class (VERY good kiting), take a beat and think about what tools you have to address your weaknesses. If you have no tools, what kind of tools are there that you can use to address your problem?
---
What are you doing when someone gets in your dead zone? Are you scatter trapping?Are you using grenades? Are you using a spider belt? Nets? 
---
There are a lot of profession gadgets that help fill gaps in a hunters toolkit. Are you using any? But there are lots of native tricks too. Did you intimidate into a scatter?
---
Great idea! I just installed it and, while it's not terribly intuitive, it's a great start. One issue I found is that when I go to CTRL-V to turn on friendly name plates, I get spammed with "No player named "Name" is currently playing" in my chat box. The names it throws up are a random mix of players and NPCs.  
---
&lt;blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/drPVSZ2" data-context="false" &gt;&lt;a href="[//imgur.com/a/drPVSZ2](//imgur.com/a/drPVSZ2)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src="[//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js](//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js)" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
---
If horde play a Feral Druid. Don't have to share loot. Can DPS in form. Plus all the buffs would stack well with your friends.
---
Maybe try paladin if alliance. Same reasons.
---
-1 to this.
---
The information is there but it's attached to a rather clunky add-on with some questionable utility functions and messy layout.
---
No, when you open your mail, say you have sold some stuff and some stuff didn't sell and you hit "open all" on the mail box, the money you made doesn't show in chat, only the stuff you didn't sell.
---
Thanks his name is Snoutius!
---
Bear in goblin voice: Heheh, glad I could help!
---
Ah okay so you basically have had a month to do nothing but play wow that makes me feel better about myself lol
---
No, it's a new spell called trolling :)
---
Another badly made 
---
"DAE CLASSIC SAVES WOW" thread implying that WoWhead was basically dead/dying because of retail but now that it has a 'classic' specific subsection it's thriving more than ever.
---
Just your usual circlejerk bullshit.
---
21 and can't get myself to log in again. Way too much travel time between the sparse quests... with way too many mob and item grabbing going on, especially when I have time to play. 
---
Think I'll wait till early winter and slowly grind up to 60. Maybe ding before Phase 2 hits. Or not, got a lot of time lol.
---
Better question: Is someone going to? Most likely Iran.
---
It’s all about having fun if you want to play a mage then play one, no rush is hitting 60 it’s not like the level cap is ever gonna increase :)
---
[Bryce Canyon is the real Thousand Needles. ](https://images.app.goo.gl/T3pqur2gA7mGjsV39)
---
Gotta have a cheevo for it to be fun aye
---
Play what you like.  The game is meant to have fun.  If it feels like a chore or a grind either switch it up or maybe the game isnt your cup of tea.
---
you mean, make another character? yeah i think lots of people have multiple characters.
---
Harpies from stonetalon and thousand needles stocked me up on feathers.
---
And every single other class, while we're at it.
---
Hey man what server do you play on? R u a 55 hunter?
---
If you play a good deal of solo and can craft or get it cheap it's ok. The difference in levelling speed of just mediocre spirit gear vs shadoweave set isn't that big. It's not worth going out of your way to get, but if you have the mats go for it
---
Total population =/= concurrent online.
---
These feels
---
how do you find a gold seller?
---
dont worry, theyll find you
---
I see my main and my bank alt on both extremes!
---
Play whatever class you enjoy.
---
Desolace always seems to be safe for Alliance or horde.  A lot of people are just running SM on repeat during the levels when you'll be in desolace.
---
Booty booty booty booty docking everywhere.
---
are there any quest in Dustwallow? The only one I found was the Stormwind quest chain and some quest to send me in Thousand Needles. Or am I too low level?
---
Apparently in later tiers they will compete. Not sure how close it will be though.
---
I was only a joke in tbc... in vanilla it was reality.
---
Congrats! And happy Birthday!!
---
How's the alliance/horde ratio on Earthfury?
---
Next version will have a fix for it. Fix is already implemented, but I'm working on another issue before releasing the next version. Unfortunately, you have to disable the addon until then :(
---
I think he meant bag. He makes bags with tailoring and sells those
---
Now you can finally play the game.
---
4 months old 
---
newborn
---
Pick one
---
I think he's RPing being a dad.
---
You should have kept it. It'll likely be worth much more later on.
---
Not sure what level you are but spirit is very good for priests, especially since you should be running spirit tap for leveling. I would prioritize a good balance of spirit and int and would probably use the int/spirit piece.
---
Gnomes 😂😂 you got me good there.
---
Man, there's not many of us 55-59.
---
Ahead of the regular people curve, but, behind the turbo-nerd 60's group.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
*mobs run directly at healer*
---
Foda
---
The Void isn’t perfect for tanking...I usually get the mob to 2/3rds to 1/2 health before it turns on me. One thing that will help is putting points into demonology for leveling. Improves void walker increases voids abilities by 30%.
---
And for pve mage bullshit,  faxmonkey videos are great:
---
https://youtu.be/5frS6BjaiD8
---
What’s the easiest armor set to get for mages?
---
Uthers tomb is surrounded by 50+ ghouls.  I had to corpse hop 3 times at level 30.
---
Honestly the design of the class for over is just... bad. You never get up in combo points until you have to get SnD up again. Literally don’t think I’ve ever spent 5 CP.
---
You may just be ahead of the leveling masses.  As a current lv 28 I can say I have been killed in every contested zone and definitely had some pit stops in hillsbrad for random pvp encounters.
---
Just because a server has a higher total population doesn't mean more people are currently online.
---
No problem bro
---
The trick is coordinating bathroom breaks with flights.
---
How is arcanite reaper? Think I'll still be able to dungeon spam to level?
---
You won't get that it's a rare elite, spawn like 1 time out of 20 instances .
---
Priest wants to prioritise spirit, it gets an extra boost from spirit tap, and more spirit means less downtime in general. Later you'll want +healing gear unless you're shadow.
---
Prove intention.
---
 You can't. They can say they needed it too for x reason. You need a line and blizzard defines that line.
---
I'm level 30.
---
Huh, will have to check spirit tap. Been following some healing spec, so have 0 points in shadow atm.
---
I haven't used this or any other wow related sub much, but I too found myself to classic.wowhead rapidly when looking for info on some quests. So even google is favoring the site quite well now.
---
Look at his class.  Guy just kills humanoids with blizzard in every high level zone.
---
At lower levels I wouldn’t worry about trying to find the best gear , cause you will inevitably level past it’s usefulness quite quickly. 
---
But if you really want to go look for gear, I think you can use something like classic.wowhead.com to filter out cloth up to your lvl.
---
probably a tolkien reference
---
Back in vanilla I was falling and panicking as well so I decided to charge on the first thing I can attack. It was a level 60 warlock. I was lvl 32. not even a pvp server he was flagged. Needless to say it didn‘t save me
---
Where dk they drop?
---
warrior is a little easier bc you don't need to buy as many skills. but still holds mostly true
---
Why would it equal 2?
---
This was a given in STV
---
Hi, hunter questions,
---
 1. Will Enrage (hunter talent) proc off of skills? Like claw and bite that crits, or only autos?
---
2. Also will bite and claw cause the spell delay like normal attacks?
---
3. Will Son on Hakkar lighting spell also cause spell delay? or do spells not cause spell delay?
---
4. Is Surefooted good for pvp? I read the hit chance needed is 5%, dont you get that just from gear ow wtv? So the hit chance should be irrelevant?
---
5. Can you not block and parry from the back?
---
Well, in classic if you're a ninja looter or shit talker you will eventually blackball yourself as there's no x-realm and ppl talk! Once your name gets tarnished it's not good
---
Endgame dungeons (they all drop from different bosses in different ones)
---
Weird, my pink dude was named "Epic exclusive."
---
&gt;So many times I can see some dude looking for healer for X instance and right below there is healer LFG the very same intance and they keep spamming for minutes and can't find eachother.
---
That's not because of spam
---
That's because these people are stubborn as all hell and are expecting the other to initiate the conversation
---
This was so me early this morning! :D
---
This is how it was in vanilla. Well actually vanilla didn’t even have an open all button.
---
You messed up with 72 and 8. Because you were thinking of the 20% discount (honored and sergeant). You tried correcting it by just adding 10g. But that messes with the %
---
10% discount on 90g is 81g and 10% discount on 10g is 9g
---
Am I the only person who thinks it’s beyond stupid for people to whine about blizzard fixing a mechanic that people learned to use purely for griefing?
---
Literally, once people realized what they could do with this it became something they should remove from the game.
---
The wow neckbeards always provide the best copypasta
---
employ the /hello then /cry maneuver in that order
---
Those percentages must be gathered (sampled) by the player? Or does the addon automatically show the percentages of available loots as soon as the bobber lands on a zone?
---
That's how it is in America, too. Unfortunately, some people (mostly out of shape women) feel intimated or judged by them, for whatever reason. So planet fitness, a business, saw an opportunity to make money catering to the type of person who wants a casual workout without the "meathead" types around. It's a gym for a different crowd.
---
Exactly this. There seems to be a few individuals  in this thread that can't understand this simple concept.
---
Yaaaaaaa heeee heeee heeeee!
---
The first time they were so I tried again with someone who was definitely low enough and I got the same message. People are saying it works though so I'm not sure what's going on.
---
How do you manage to stay alive there? I'm just hiding in the bushes and shit. (I'm questing alone)
---
I don't understand your comment. The Corpsemaker drops from the 3rd boss in RFK and is an absolute godsend.
---
Accusations of arrogance in broken English written out of arrogance.  That was an absolutely spectacular display of stupidity. 
---
Can you even properly read and write or does it end at "u" , "ur" and "makes".  I get English is hard for some but just wow....
---
If you want to farm Armory, it’s pretty smart. Raging Berserker Helm is really good for you.
---
:/
---
What does a 4 month old panzar tank look like?
---
Take a wild guess
---
Having the same experience as alliance, in the mid-20s now. I figured I was just behind the curve.

It’s growing everyday! It is easier to find groups if you are in an active guild. I got a rando invite to “Filthy Casuals” (fitting name for what I am, lol) which is a pretty active group with at least 30-50 people on at a time with different levels. I am lucky though to have my fiance and 3 other irl people to do dungeons with.
---
I leave Valley of Trials everytime for this beauty.
---
Thanks guys! Currently running around leveling mining and slaying horde to get revenge for being ganked, sorry horde!
---
It’s just the demographic planet fitness has decided to market too and this is how they do it. You’re thinking into it too much
---
On a beer pong table..

I made my main a priest this time around as I have only ever really played melee and dps focused characters.  I have a lv 10 rogue on a second server as well but want to stick it out with the priest until at least pre raid bis level before deciding if I’d rather do something else.
---
I think it is always in your best interest to try something you think might be fun, vs playing something “needed” or suggested to you.
---
This is pretty oddly specific, so the answer is if you would find enjoyment out of it. I don't really see the point in twinking for world PvP since sooner or later level 60s will be involved and you'll be outclassed. Twinks are usually made at levels ending with a 9 so they have the best stats for their level bracket in a battleground.

What’s a decent gold grinding spot for 40 mount? I’m at 40g and just dinged 37 on my priest and feel like I need to do some grinding if I want to get my mount right at 40
---
I had the BoE epic Ardent Custodian drop yesterday (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=868/ardent-custodian). It’s on the auction house for only about 20g from other sellers. Apparently it is pre-raid BiS for Druid tanks. Any ideas on if this is a good price to sell at or if I should hold on to it for a while?
---
What is this? Why is there a dragon in SW?
---
I know draintanking. With stam gear you won’t be fastest than a juggling voidtank lock with s power gear.
---
Lol I have probably carried worse
---
Yeah that’s what I’m thinking, nah I love the game ! Just concerned about not being able to find groups because people are already higher level
---
Yep another character
---
They are great with pallies too.

---
No info yet but I'm hoping the same thing!
---
What was the point of this post?
---
That’s true, just sucks because I put so many hours into that character. Not worth it if I don’t enjoy it tho so might aswell restart right
---
If you want a spevific faction mount make sure to move to the right lvling zone before lvling up.
---
I’m at work and I can’t remember what lvl I got to. Is there a way online to see that from mobile?
---
With what..?
---
Paladin does not have a Taunt skill so it sucks as a tank.
---
By the way, Curse doesn’t actually work for Classic. If you select patch 1.13, it shows you a download for the 8.2 version. You usually have to navigate into “More Versions” to get the correct download.
---
Not Ubuntu, but I’ve had only a few problems running on Manjaro Linux using Lutris to manage Wine.
---
One thing to know for sure: since the ddos last weekend, you need to tweak the network TTL. There was a thread about it last Sunday with the workaround: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d1lncq/reddit_linux_wow_classic_players_are_getting/

That's how it worked back in the day.

My main has 119 mining 58 blacksmithing he’s level 31 and my alt has 75 skinning and he’s level 14

Particularly in that zone.

This is why you use mouseovers.

Oh my

Hmmm yes, would you rather play a priest or rogue end game ?

So the world's fastest leveler in classic WoW ([Jokerd](https://dotesports.com/streaming/news/jokerd-wins-wow-classic-race-world-first-level-60)) got to 60 with "three days, 20 hours, and 40 minutes" /played.  
---
With your reported play time of 2 hours on work days, 4 om days off, that is a solid 2 days /played or 48 hours since launch. It is known that half the time to 60 is spent from 40-60 so that means the world's fastest leveler got to level 40 with slightly less /played time than your friend.  
---
So again, unless he's ignoring most the game and min-maxing xp gain per playtime like the most intense hardcore, you ought to ask questions ;)
---
Whatever it takes, horde scum!
---
Ok, first things first:
---
* Blizzard should hire you
---
* Please make some cool sweet 4K Ultra Wide Wallpaper
---
* Keep’em coming
---
* Remember about Thex
---
* I would kill for animated series
---
* You promised naming change to sth like: S01E07

* Seriously, why this man is not in their art team?!
---
* Leeroy Jenkins

* Kungen 100k revenge crit

* Someone please call Universal Pictures

I’m addicted now, thanks.

---
I wouldn't think that Blizzard would go out of their way to deny their service to anyone. Even if they are forced to do so because of some regulation, it's simple enough to use a VPN.
---
You’re right, there is no rush. 
---
But those aren’t mutually exclusive. 
---
You can grind and farm at the same time. And don’t assume every lvl 40 with a mount had to sell a kidney for it
---
That guild name
---
If you are just dungeon grinding you might not see a benefit from spirit tap because you have to get killing blow to activate it. But if you are solo questing, everytime you kill a mob you'll get a massive boost to your mana regen significantly lowering downtime.
---
aoe farming existed in classic and you’d be crazy to think that it didn’t, it just wasn’t as prominent and you didn’t see 100+ posts a day outlining it or whining about it on the general forums (reddit)
---
i fear those hands
---
Well, I'm 30 and have under 2g...  But I've trained all available skills. That's the easiest way to spend all your gold.
---
Re-rolling after hitting 45 on my pally stings a lot
---
If you enjoy PvP absolutely. I also started on a PvE server and plan on making a character on a PvP as well.
---
Cooking is good too cuz you get the thisle tea pattern from the rogue quest line as well
---
Yes Alex Jones.
---
As much as I hate rogues I wouldn't even be mad, that's impressive
---
Honestly. I was the opposite way around, started in classic and now im playing bl3 nonstop
---
But don't you see the irony here?
---
We're both playing the same game.
---
Haha same, of all my friends I was the only one who got to play at launch (they queues like 15 mins to midnight). I’m level 21 and they are 40+.
---
This ss making me want to reroll Druid :(

You've convinced me, seen so many posts about this topic lately and yours is the first pro-need roll explanation that made sense to me. I get it now, cheers.
---
Bet you get your helm in the mail, warcraft prime next day shipping by kodo.
---
I like the art style, your troll has a lot of personnality in it !
---
I travel too much for quests, instead of just committing to a spot to grind out a level.  So much time wasted going back and forth between continents.

---
Thats why have a castsequence macro bound to one of the side mouse buttons just constantly switching while running from quests to quest works decent so far. There used to be an addon in wrath that auto switched ever few seconds
---
Funny his name redridgeboss,  probably where he will be stuck the rest of Classic.
---
Bushes only slightly help because when you do get close enough to be seen, you’re slightly camouflaged.
---
When the enemy player does get close enough, they’ll always hear the stealth sound when you become “visible”, so it hardly matters how well you’re camouflaged.
---
Your bread and butter are searing totem, the shocks, windfury, lightning shield and the heals. 
---
Other than that get the PvP utility you feel that you need.
---
Get self-ress and the water walking stuff.
---
You can buy every skill up until 20+ without it affecting your mount money by much.
---
Helps that you can't charge 200g for rares, because nobody (well, no warriors) have 200g.
---
Still have 2-3 hour queues and I think I’d have 2 60s by now haha
---
I agree with you in a year.  I'm not sure anybody is getting ridiculous prices yet.
---
Supply is high.  Everybody is going through leveling content.  Assuming drop rates are the same, there will be more of these items on the market than ever.   Especially since the high value items are known and people are less likely to equip them. 
---
Demand is low.  There are no twinks and there are very few level appropriate characters who can afford to spend crazy coin on something they'll use for 10 levels.  Even after twinks become a thing, it'll still take supply a good amount of time to dwindle. 
---
So right now, an amazing BOE drop doesn't set you up for life.  It's more likely to be a short term drain of endless listing for auction looking for a buyer.   I would prefer to see it equipped rather than it sit in a bank for a year.
---
I would have to assume the first one landed without any visual or sound confirmation, which is not always the right assumption...
---
Also, shouldn't the global cooldown prevent what I am describing? Does this mean the visual or input lag I'm experiencing is greater than GCD?
---
I guess its better that way, altough it makes hunting rares a bit less attractive in a way. thanks for clearing it out for me :D
---
As a lifelong hunter I feel like I get the opposite treatment.
---
&gt; 10-15 gold
---
where did you come up with those numbers ?
---
if a level 30 can make 10g in a couple of runs in gnomerane... then a level 60 can make 100g in that same time (due to faster clear times).
---
we will have level 60 groups spamming gnomerane for free money.
---
which is not the case.
---

Fret not, friend! I have been pulled away from my adventures due to the accursed ‘wife aggro’. I’m saving the entirety of Azeroth, honey! I don’t have time for cleaning the garage or doing laundry!
---
Rolled a priest and am still really happy with it.  I normally play DPS in every game, but this time I decided I'd switch to heals.  It's actually way more fun to me.  Keeping everyone alive, not pulling aggro, buffing everyone everywhere all the time.  Feels good man.
---
I seen a unicorn once, I tell you I did!
---
grind mobs
---
So how did you get them? Caught them at one in a million price in AH? As obviously you didn't go to Scholo as lv47.
---
Do you know how to start the defias quest chain? Thinking about heading over there on my level 17 priest
---
Not sure about the mod - but I do know you can create macros with "items" in it (not as efficient, but still do able).
---
That was a dick move, but goddamn I gotta respect it
---
yeah cause thats what life is all about
---
Classic Plus, make Demo Shout better...
---
Found a few buddies on there. Thanks !!!!!!
---
Bought them for 70g and 90g through Trade Chat!
---
Just seems less efficient than using those talent points on other ones. To each their own
---
Did the same thing.  Really enjoying the priest playstyle.
---
I feel in general there's a overall delay on everything in classic.

Looting, turning in quests, abilities etc. My friend complains alot, i feel it but cba.

It's what i thought, what i was afraid of, but, it's far from reality, the pro's far exceed the con's and not by a long shot, by several galaxies.
---
This is me, so not being anti pve. Of all people i get that you don't want pvp, you're not alone, everyone's time is limited, i mean i loathed pvp anything, and now i think that pve servers should not even be an option and that they should rename pve to pvb (player vs boredom).
---
I only went pvp because i was wondering why there so many pvp servers, as they far outweigh the pve options, what am i missing? Now i know, classic was built for this 100%. The fun factor is off the charts compared to pvb, errr sry i mean pve :) lol
---
ENHANCEMENT SHAMMY!
---
10-15 gold is what I need for the items. Was just wondering how many runs it would take to make roughly that.
---
Is that blizz nameplate? Or what is that addon?

You haven't been to the class trainer yet , minus 10/15 G to that number :p
---
&gt;We are isolated from the rest of the world and games are one of the few ways that we feel connected and welcome.

---
Yeah the dude in Westfall's main town has a quest called The Defias Brotherhood if I remember correctly. It starts with a lot of running between Westfall, SW and Redridge but the end quest of that chain has nice rewards for killing the last boss of DM.
---
I have a guildy that did this, made his day as well.  He stopped after people would literally thank him, then start spam selling them in trade 5 seconds after he handed them over.
---
For some reason to me it sounds like he tried already before the post and came here because it wasn't working. 
---
I actually had the same issue (despite still having a bunch of lvl 80s on my retail account) and it took me awhile to figure out it wasn't working in chrome, but if i went into firefox I could select my character over lvl 10 and post.
---
I missed the jump to the docks, it was worth it...

Shout out stalagg Alliance! Lowest alliance to horse ratio but WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER
---
It's an okay time for a beginner. My first level 60 (also with afk time and exploration) was 11 days played
---
But us Pallies have near limitless reserves! #FreeMountAt40
---
Yea. And someone found a way to remove player names too to clean it up a bit
---
I haven't looked too much into it, but the tanking flask was 500g+ in AH few times I checked. Supreme Power seems like another one that should be super expensive. Quite possible you could make 1000g of profit if you didn't learn them yourself :)
---
This is what i live for sorting by New. Lul
---
I mean you paid for 30 days of game time.  The more of that 30 days you spend actually playing, the better that investment becomes.   Business majors are often lucrative.  You’re learning life lessons and making wise decisions with your money. 
---
Really though,  you can sacrifice everything about your social life and no one really cares.  Don’t fuck school up!

Not clear how blizzard would handle it, the dust still isn’t even close to settling yet so it won’t be a while until they even have a clear idea about population and activity on each realm.  But there’s easy solutions for pop and faction issues by linking smaller realms within battle groups like before.
---
Carebear servers are safe
---
Dungeons to get your pre raid bis gear. Farm gold, work on professions, go out and PvP in the world, help people out with free food and water, do things with your guild or find a guild that you like and does things. So many possibilities
---
Thank you sir.
---
If the past tells us anything, you are screwed. I have 11 chars with 2+ years /played on a server that has been dead for 5+ years with the exception of a month after expansion releases. Blizzard doesn’t care. I rarely sub for more than a month at a time because the dead server saddens me. At one point during prime time I could /who all levels below max and get less than 50 people.
---
What are the chances they have someone capable of healing in their party?
---
Zug zug comrade!
---
then please tell me all the million other ways you can grief a low level quest hub on your own faction
---
If you stop playing gungeon for other games your skill level will drop. Don't do it. never stahp playing gungeon
---
Yeah Titans flask is going for 500g+, Supreme Power is on AH atm for 140g and Distilled Wisdom for 100g. Think it's a buyer's market as the level 60s that can farm it haven't got round to leveling crafting professions, and the people who have leveled crafting professions don't have the gold to pay their true value!
---
watching lord of the rings - and when Im not doing that I usually listen to viking playlists :)
---
I've noticed very few hunters as well. Stick with it. Hunters will be sorely needed at 60.
---
Did spending so much on recipes restrict you from getting a mount at 40?
---
What an odd guild name
---
those Eastern hours? Because I usually get on around 6 eastern during the week and usually don't have to queue over the last week.
---
I have been wondering this for days. Thanks to the ones who took the time to explain it.
---
If you want 100g by lvl 40 you kind of need a strategy or at least some experience with wow. Here are some mistakes people make:
---
1) Buy skills they don't use from their trainer
---
2) Spend money on AH for gear
---
3) Putting stuff on AH for it's vendor price(not realizing what the vendor price is and the fact that depositing stuff on AH costs money). Weapons etc. are expensive to post so only post them if they're good. Vendor these things instead. 
---
4) Ignoring AH deposit price in general and posting items for 8 hours when they should be posted for 2 hours to save money. Lots of low level herbs/cloths/leather have been at vendor price in the AH since launch.
---
5) Spend money to level their professions before 40.
---
Here are some things you can do to make money:
---
1) Get an auction addon and an addon that shows vendor prices. That way you don't make losses posting stuff on AH. Also they track historical prices. 
---
2) Buy things on AH at vendor price and wait until the prices rise. If they never rise you can just sell them to vendor without making a loss, no risk. (Kingsblood was at vendor price on AH on my server for a week now it's 2-3x vendor price)
---
3) Put a lvl one alt character at one of the vendor that sells rare limited recipes and resell them at auction house for profit.
---
4) Sell items that are needed for common quests. Frost oil, gyrochronatom, blue pearl, deadly blunderbuss etc.
---
5) Questing/grinding gives way more money than dungeon grinding.
---
  I'm currently lvl 39 with about 160 gold. Got no rare drops. Herbalism/skinning. Made a lot money reselling certain vendor recipes on the AH. Since they nerfed layering the prices on some of these rare vendor recipes have skyrocketed.
---
I haven't done a PvP server on classic. Back during vanilla I tried it and it was horrible. Now that could have been because of population (server was older then) or it could be because I didn't know what I was doing (probably the biggest factor) I have toyed with the idea of trying a classic PvP server but I have ADD and if I try too many alts I'll never get to 60 on any of them.
---
He's right you know
---
What I keep seeing mentioned on classic wow is spell cleave for Scarlett monastery. 
---
After running a few, a proper group consist of three mages, a priest, and, a warlock. The warlock will summon an eye, the priest will bubble it, and they will get the instance in 4-5 pulls. It's a really cool way to run cathedral after doing it many years ago.
---
Unfortunately, most spell cleave groups I've joined counts it as running aoe casters and doing pulls of 4-6 mins. There are times when I was join a group who say they are doing it, but are really just filling spots. I leave those as soon as it becomes obvious.
---
Some groups will use a tank but in my experience it's been easier having 3 mages with Frost Nova cooldowns.
---
I highly recommend being 38 at minimum and 40 for the smoothest.
---
9 chances out of 10 the guys telling you to get laid are projecting their own needs and are the true ones who need to get laid but can't b.c of their toxic IRL attitude jokes on them.
---
Help out the warrior tank with his repair bills lol. 
---
I know I could barely stay afloat in vanilla.
---
Spy.  or make a combat log filter that shows enemy players only
---
It’s like the Dr Thunder vs Dr Pepper.
---
I hate missing those elevators when I'm like right there. Get's me moist every time.
---
To be fair, they do attempt to take TB eventually and their leader has.been plotting against Cairne for a long time if I remember correctly.
---
I never really enjoyed playing hunter until all the QoL changes happened.  Not needing to deal with ammo, having a massive stable and being able to travel the world and tame all the rares, that’s when the hunter mini-game really became fun for me as an alt toon to just have fun with.  Don’t stick with a main if you don’t enjoy it.  It’s definitely still early enough to play out all the classes a bit and see which one feels good to you.
---
So many to choose from though. Check [this guide for tips](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/race-to-60-choosing-the-right-diapers-i-know-its-gross-to-talk-about-but-ive-reviewed-a-few/77276).
---
The server population is slowly growing, I am currently playing on Anathema and we get medium population pretty often now. 
---
I would imagine they will offer more moves and such which will be good injections of players.
---
It clicked for me that I suck at this game! I horribly played in ZF by not understanding actual mechanics and using my shaman to its potential and assisting with the dungeon. I need to work on kiting, off tanking and totem management if I want to succeed.
---
Happy Cakeday dear jehny!
---
Man, can’t imagine how dry the shit on my ass would be if I replaced candy crush with that
---
It basically is, which is why it's not a thing in inn where you are safe
---
Now I value my 2-3 hours like the gold that it is.
---
 Stay on the highest pop servers. Trust. Gonna end up there eventually.
---
&gt;tainted by this "new way" ... game was better for it.
---
feel free to play like a scrub if you want. there is nothing wrong with it. you won't get invited to do dungs and raids with the tryhards, and that's not a problem because you clearly don't *want* to play with those type of people.
---
and if you are tilted about them getting far ahead of you by playing optimally, then maybe you care about it more than you admit.
---
Oh so thats just total characters, i thought they were active characters average or something like that.
---
Naw breh. Life's too short not to let your flag fly... especially in a pirate guild on an RP-PVP server at 1am Grinding. If that's full-retard to you, I submit, you probably need to get out more.
---
It's part of the experience! It's just that a lot of us had that experience 15 years ago.   
---
Dont sweat it and have fun (=
---
What is the use of winning and killing alot as a twink? You would get high rank for that character, but the high ranked items, and transfer to your main?
---
It's ALT, Shift and CNTRL no right click option under that setting.
---
It's the same in Spanish ;)
---
rofl that was amazing.  what caused the explosion?
---
i heard the game stutters like crazy up to 2080 cards, not good
---
Perhaps. I was mostly just being a jerk lol I too am a button spammer. Very possibly could just be from the whole spell batching mechanism. If it’s a consistent thing then I would assume it’s a byproduct of that.
---
Totally individual preference. If you're worried you're missing out, why not give it a shot and see if you like it?
---
Magical moments
---
In level 18 and I have a level 50 girlfriend.
---
punch.
---
I had a similar experience running stockades with 2 hunters a warlock and a mage. I want to try running a dungeon with 5 BM hunters next.
---
You know the art is A+ when a Quilboar is giving you shivers.
---
For raiding spec. I’m not sure that many people get 5/5 shadow focus while leveling. Huge waste of points. Even 3 is excessive but sometimes in vanilla you randomly come across a quest mob that is 4 levels higher than all of the others.
---
That was so badass.. I'm sure his only thoughts for a few minutes was "no way.. noooo way"
---
So you can’t sleep on full moons ?
---
there's nothing they can do. people don't wanna join imbalanced realms but they always want to join the most populated site which creates imbalanced realms
---
it has always been this way. people always take the easiest road and in classic, the easiest road is the most populated side
---
when bgs launch and the lowest populated side has instant queues vs the 30 min queues for the other side, it will help more than anything
---
Play that way, imo. There is always the most optimal - but who does it affect? Only u, man. Follow ur dreams. Swing those 1hers.
---
How are you on the ship btw
---
Still, you have one very close to it.

Went into gnomergan with my two brothers one is a priest one is a mage and we just AOE grinded with my voidwalker. Was so much fun and challenging.

I'm enjoying the aoe grind thb, it's not that monotonous because I sometimes fuck up, or something spawns in my wake - so it feels more dynamic
---
Jokes on you, she's too busy carrying my squishy priest ass through Ashenvale for anything else.
---
How did you manage to do it at 30? With a group of others that were also doing the quest or did you pay someone to help? I'm looking on starting the quest line tonight.
---
Warden staff is far better (also far more expensive).  Apparently unyielding maul which will come out in phase 2 is also better.  I don't think the price of this item will really increase as the options out of Dire Maul when released will push it farther behind.
---
If this is not a shitpost you should definitely get your shit together. This is sad beyond measure. Don't play wow if you literally have zero discipline or it'll ruin you.

Not many people know this, and my guild will kill me if they find out I told people, but our MC strategy is to get Rag hammered drunk then /dancebattle.

Zero transmog required!

These guides give me hope of being halfway competent at a class I look up to but never succeed in.

Ulda is tougher to get to and tougher to navigate.  ZF is more commonly done, very easy to get to (short run from Tanaris) and is easier IMO because a lot more people have done it and know the fights.  Kill the totems!

I've got a 40 Druid on Incendius, profs near maxed, mount money nearly achieved. But I gave it up to play on BB, and I have to day I don't regret it at all. Great community over here. Enjoy the game or stop playing, don't let all these min/max boys bring you down with them!

The way this video interchangeably uses 'u' and 'you' really bugs me
---
I mean, who doesn’t?
---
Anyone have any suggestions on where to farm mobs for some good stuff while herbalising what's nearby? Somewhere 30-40
---
I'm a new player that's having a hard time using these controls. I want to use the mouse for all character movement, like in Runescape and Path of Exile. Am I going to be at a disadvantage later in the game if I don't use the keyboard to move? Just asking cause that's the default.
---
Leaving it to the community, just like they've been doing for years.  Yes it means servers with completely lopsided imbalance, but they've shown themselves to not care about that. 
---
PvP servers need a balancing recommendation if not straight up lock,  but that's too much effort for Blizz.
---
About 15 groups of other people doing it over 6ish hours
---
&gt; My guess is they will “fix” this once there are more higher level characters. Because 3 warlocks could shut down the use of the auction house for a while with how low level some people are right now. 
---
No they couldn't.  AHs are only in cities and city guards kill infernals.  The only reasons warlocks released them in low level cities was because if you tried it anywhere with 50+ guards they would kill the infernal.
---
They can cause a ruckus but it doesn't last long.
---
Rattlegore so close to 50%!! Best server that no one is talking about
---
Not offended, honestly surprised this many people are defending such a sham gym. But it’s Reddit, so maybe I shouldn’t be surprised. 
---
The very presence of something like a lunk alarm is pretty absurd.
---
My lvl 7 bank Alt has 30g. My lvl 30 Druid has about 6g
---
I’m looking forward to my dustwallow marsh spider cave grind in a few levels. 
---
Herbalism is over 200. Enchanting is over 200 but I can’t train the next tier of that until 35. And I haven’t made a single penny for any enchants I’ve done so far.
---
Im not hiding my responses, im hiding guild chat :)
---
Well for me, I played at tbc and leveled a few guys legit to 70, so I've already seen a lot of the quests and most areas. I never experienced classic so I do want to get to higher level dungeons and then raids as soon as possible I guess. I'm still doing certain quests but I enjoy just seeing those levels go up. 
---
Also I actually find Aoe farming more enjoyable than questing cause at some points it is challenging in trying to find the most efficient way to pull packs. Other wise it's just go here kill X bring back shitty drop rate items which doesn't have skill. Just my opinion since you asked.
---
31
---
Saw another post of the same problem, I dont think there is one for classic, the other guy found the solution of having a friend joing his party and reset it from outside the instance (should work from anywhere) then he would log out and back on and would be in the beginning with a fresh instance.
---
I think that's how he did it, might be a little different but I know he used a friend to reset it.
---
Plenty of these people have already spent time on pservers and experienced the leveling. Some people don't like that aspect of the game. Some people like speed leveling. Maybe they just wanted to get leveling out of the way and will park their character until more content is out. Maybe they wanted a high level to be able to farm for an alt.
---
Its like people have different experiences
---
Isn’t the mace better for humans?
---
Not to mention the tram in IF goes straight to SW. So you blew it on two levels.
---
It made me laugh so much that my face hurt
---
Or they are 13
---
the highest ilvl with your mainstat on it. if you want BIS guides for leveling then look up VANILLA (not classic) twink guides from private servers, they'll tell you the BIS at 19/29/etc
---
but that's a giant waste of time, just use the gear with the higher ilvl that gives you more of what you want, you aren't gonna minmax while leveling because it's impossible
---
That's fair enough. Part of it is just coming from a warrior who is jealous of the crazy XP you mages get. As long as you're enjoying your experience though, that's all that matters.
---
Paladins kind of like this.  Warriors probably don't.  Shaman don't care.  
---
Actually I wonder- can you put a shield spike AND this ench on a shield?  Given the choice, paladins would rather have a shield spike.
---
Yeah, I've been playing non-stop outside of work, but said work has been busy. I was thinking about how much higher of a level I could be, but then I realized I don't want to be a higher level, at least not yet, because one you get there it marks the coming end of potential content, and so the faster you get there the less time you'll  spend playing.
---
I'm just enjoying my nice slow pace, I'll get there when I get there.
---
Borderlands 3 not coming to steam was a blessing in disguise and I just didn't know it yet.
---
Gives me more uninterrupted Classic time.
---
I think i will, i just am worried i pick a server with an imbalance on horde / alliance (and pick the wrong side!)
---
Also, i imagine being behind the curve on most people currently leveling, there will be a lot of malicious ganking
---
I’m a tellmewhen fan
---
Yes its just everyone's favorite YouTuber made a video about how you have to play gnome mage and spam blizzard in dungeons or you'll be level 10 for a year, so it's a lot more common knowledge now
---
People can get trinket to remove fear to, that's worse imo because you cant predict who will break your fear with the trinket, undead you can be 90% sure they will WoTF.
---
I ganked you last night
---
Humans have axe and sword specializationd
---
Yeah seems to be the case for a lot of items - "true" value won't be reached until months later. Even stuff like herb prices will turn upside down if people ever start mass producing flasks. Which I suppose shouldn't be necessary for months, maybe not until AQ40/Naxx.
---
Except that the horde have a giant encampment in the north and the alliance have a broken down cart.
---
HOW. am level 37
---
Dude, your art is the highlight of the sub. It's so good! Keep up the amazing work, and I hope one day it makes you bomb ass money.
---
No, you could transfer them for free. You're a liar.
---
I knew an Adlai Stevenson and he would never go to a planet fitness you’re an impostor
---
Wait... Did someone say \[Thunderfury , Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\]?
---
You hate to see it
---
As someone who didn't play on the private servers, I didn't consider that. I suppose if that's all you'd be doing prior to Blizz shutting them down, that'd make sense that the Classic leveling content would feel dull to you.
---
Oh you’ll be in for a treat if you can ever get your hands on a thunderfury then. It’s part of the gear for pvp melee Hunter. I’ll see if I can find the video.
---
I’m more amazed by how bears are not made of bear meat, boars don’t have intestines, and these spiders don’t actually have legs.  Like bitch, you wanted 3 spider legs, that mfer right there has 8, wtf.
---
Find a group.  Be social itll help a lot
---
Yes.. yes you are.
---
Yeesh. Sorry. Thought it was a funny term I remembered that people used to use for hardcore players so figured I would make a post. Realizing now that I've triggered some folks. Look I wish I could be hardcore but I don't have the time so I figured I would add a bit of encouragement to others like me who want to be "poop sockers" but can't lol
---
I wanted to, but my brother is Alliance.
---
Odd. Mine has mace and sword.
---
I’m starting to hunt my BiS items. Is there an addon that let me add items to a list and whenever one of those items drops in group loot I receive an alert? 
---
They would probably ask you; why do you wanna be slow to 60?
---
I mean, levelling as enh you don't drink at all hardly.
---
If you are, you're using up way too much mana inefficiently.
---
Ele drinks a lot, but it just deletes mobs (ele at 40+ enh before).
---
The bigger let down for me is simply getting toward endgame and realising what am I going to play?
---
Ele - worthless
---
Enh - worthless
---
Resto - fine for raids but outside of raid in 5 man you feel like such a gimped shitty version of a priest. You have literally nothing pre 60 in terms of like a swiftmend or a shield or anything. You just LHW reactively and that's it. You have no big/small cds etc.
---
If you go full resto and not ele resto you'll hate life outside of group, and you don't really gain that much either except NS earlier and mana tide.
---
NS is nice ofc but its not a short cd either.
---
Sad but true
---
Gz!
---
You can get under Org and SW but UC has been fixed.
---
Actually you are playing the game the "right" way.  If you press both mouse buttons that by default It makes you run forward.
---
Should have traded him some milk.
---
Ever hear from a GM? I also had Murky but lost the card (although Murky is still on my retail character)
---
I did it because I wanted my epic mount before the AH is flooded with mats from the pack. Worked out well
---
Because any warrior that specs prot before 55 (maybe even 60) is doing it very wrong.
---
You won't have the rage to maintain aggro on anything.
---
2H Arms tanking with backup sword and board for hairy pulls is actually preferred midgame.
---
This would fit in nicely on r/classicwowscreenshots, along with any others you might have.
---
I agree, that's what my first part was about, a "Hey this server is 60 / 40 A/H are you sure you want to be Alliance and skew this more?" message on the character creation screen.  
---
 Then if it gets to say 70 / 30 the lock kicks in with a, "We're sorry, you can't currently make characters of this faction.   For the health of the server and community, we need to keep a balance that will ensure everyone has a chance to enjoy their time in wow. "
---
Yes I realize that might mean people can't play together with their friends, but that's where your idea kicks in as well: free transfers for the over represented faction to the opposite faction or a different server where their faction is under represented and they can play with their new friend who can play on that server. 
---
In reality though, Blizzard's stance has pretty much been,  "Eh, they'll figure it out on their own. "
---
I'm level 30 because I was away for a week few days after Classic launch. But I'm also not rushing anywhere, I mean rushing is the reason why I left retail in the first place.
---
you know you can level more than one character? i mean if you love leveling so much, wouldnt you want to hit 60 so you can start up a new character?
---
for me tho i want 60 so i can be gearing for pvp come phase 2 as well as the 58-60 dungeons being more enjoyable for me, what with real drops and all that. i like the 60 zones far more for farming for professions and gold making. also i need a rogue, druid, hunter, lock for various reasons, each class has a unique attribute.
---
so how about you? you just gonna level up to 60 and quit? why not pretend you did that and quit right now cause itll save you time.
---
In classic? All the time. Retail I have no idea, I've been out for a long while.
---
THANK YOU!
---
Looks like a fish bot tbh
---
They’ll never allow faction transfers but realm transfers in the future are entirely possible.
---
seriously though retail has been catered for players like you. Play that. don't change vanilla
---
Slower bow's is so much better than fast ones
---
There's alot of this in this version of classic that wasn't the case in Vanilla. I'm not sure what happened
---
Wowhead has a Thottbot theme. Closest you're going to get, now that they own Thottbot.
---
It is not wow classic experience, it is you being limp and pointless shit.  Your post is pity, not fun or anything else positive. Get on with your life.
---
Haha yeah that's fair enough, I never thought about it before though and remember the first few 1-70 took absolutely ages. Now I'm 44 and my playtime is like 5d. Yeh I am actually enjoying it, I'm used to grinding out for hours anyway so staying in one spot for a while is fine for me. 
---
I just like getting those levels in and trying the next dungeon.
---
To be fair, mages are KoS just because they are metaslaves.
---
They gotta have some disadvantage in this game atleast.
---
Yeah this is fucked. I saw this coming though
---
Does Carrot on a Stick stack with the Paladin talent Pursuit of Justice?
---
I have ran ubrs around 30 times now and my guild way more and we have yet to have a main hand drop, only a couple off hands. Take into account the amount of rogues and warriors we have, I will have farmed the 300g for kB much faster than getting dal rends
---
Did you get your infernal at least?
---
go back to retail please
---
Are you talking about [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
Rotting?
---
I really like your style- the 'cut' from an animation look is really so awesome and it really captures the feel I think many people are experiencing with classic.
---
It’s insanely fun to 1shot people and not be able to get killed 1v5
---
A good twink feels like hacking. It doesn’t exist in retail because they balance gear.
---
Getting bis gear in vanilla matters, a level 39 think rogue can have 3k HP and crit 1600 on people who have 1k HP normally.
---
I use Stoneskin totem while leveling... helps with the damage I take a little bit. A lot of the mobs in fighting hit for a decent amount so every little bit helps. But that’s about the only resistance totem I’d use - if you can call it a resistance totem compared to like fire/frost resistance totems.
---
Depending what level you are there should a breadcrumb or something leading you to eastern kingdoms for Michael Moran, red ridge,etc...
---
lame, well thank you
---
Tips for taming broken tooth and go! Layers? Camp? What's the trick
---
The Adibags addon makes a good compromise.  It’s an inventory manager, it makes all your bag slots just one large bag, but also sorts everything into groups within that bag, so trade goods are in one place, armor, weapons, consumables get their own spot, and newly acquired items will be in a “new” group for easy viewing.  It’s an absolute must have imo.
---
Wast that on thunderfury? Alliance controlled nessingwary camp for quite a while, which was a pain because I had shit to turn in there haha
---
I've been doing a split talent spec in all 3 trees but now that I'm at 40+ I was wondering if shadow is better to level for a priest? Can I still heal dungeons fine like this? Any recommendations on specific talent builds?
---
Doesn't work like that on classic, for you to be teleported out you will need to have timed out for a long time, longer than it would take to walk out or die out
---
This is the warlock equivalent of full Herod/Scarlet set. I'm never changing this.
---
Transferred to Heartseeker, no regrets.  Playing more, no queues.  Why on earth do I want to sit in line for hours each week, stressing that I might get logged out.
---
Rest and Relaxation completed.
---
What can one do if there is a bad faction imbalance on PVP server. I am on Flamelash- EU and it is impossible to do a quest in STV, but also other location, since the ratio between alliance to horde is 1:2. My only choice atm is to farm SM and then ZF, which is pretty bad experience tho? Anything else possible to do?
---
If you want to get to 60 as soon as possible that's true. But for me it's such a huge quality of life improvement that I'll still try to get it as fast as I can.
---
Been going to a planet fitness for almost 2 years now and have transformed by body. I feel damn good. Maybe different locations differ from each other but the one I go to has plenty of free weights. I get it’s not for the hardcore, but 80% of gym goers it is great.
---
That’s funny.... 
---
In all seriousness itemization for paladin and shamans is bad leveling and even prior to tier 2. Most best in slot ends up being cloth/leather/mail until further into T2 and beyond.
---
It's been a very conflicting few days for me
---
Lol as a gnome, I like to /sleep under night elf/human females while they sit afk. Makes it look like they are sitting on my face! Lol I have a small album building 😂
---
Is he still there? I was just in SW but couldn't find him.

I've been using wowhead for years with an adblocker and I cant remember seeing any ads.  I'll have to pay more attention next time.

my server opened up 4 days before they announced there would be transfers, and they only announced transfers like 2 days before transfers were actually available.
---
they knew transfers were coming soon, and they knew the realm would get transfers, they should have told us, or just opened the realm fresh to transfers like the other realms they opened when they added transfers.
---
This is why I play rogue
---
... If you get a poll on reddit you won't get a representative sample of players. You're better off getting a random sample from your server, and take into account the time you take the sample.

lol
---
Tried to give but that feature isn’t in classic
---
A shadowpriest just beat the ass off a skull mage???
---
I think they meant you can have multiple rejuvs at once, and that means groups may not want as many druid healers.
---
Lol NOT
---
Because i just dont eat after a fight and let my health regen on its own.
---
I was able to casually get 129 gold by level 29 while still keeping all the herbs in the bank. I stopped trying to make gold to level to 35 and am now 153 gold with all the herbs still in the bank with skill 191 and tailoring to skill level 176. I bought and sold a rare item since early game and wasn't really even focusing on it as an activity. I'm a warlock too so I'm saving the gold for robe of the void and epic mount quest mats since I get my first mount free.
---
I'd say Arathi Highlands 32-36 and just kiting around) and then Swamp of Sorrows til 40 =)
---
ooooh a horse girl..
---
I'm happy to wait for a Steam release, Bordlands isn't the kind of event game where half the fun is getting in on the ground floor. You shoot some dudes in a desert... That experience will be the same in a year, but better because they will have fixed things and added more by then.
---
Beewwwwwwww........
---
Spell damage is almost always better than stam/int, though if you're farming dungeons, you might stick with those for extra mana for AoEs, and your fire AoEs also don't benefit from extra shadow damage.
---
You can definetly get under Stormwind still via the wall/torch jump in west Trade District.
---
First thing I tried when I first entered SW. To my surprise, it worked, but I didn't really have a plan for if it worked lol (I hearthed recently already); I ran to the free-fall square nearby, got disconnected, re-logged in, died, took the spirit res, and had to run back up to SW :p
---
Faerlina.tv LUL
---
As a a undead priest I just mind control drown them
---
Keep drumming
---
The thing is there is not much reason for a high level toon to be in a lower level zone and waiting around there.  Sure if they catch you on the road they might throw a spell at you maybe even chase you down but there isn't much point in waiting around to camp you.
---
Yes. It says it right there when you mouse over intellect.
---
Dude, after out levelling duskwood, it is impossible to quest for levelling. Every 30 plus zone just has no alliance to group with and so many horde. 
---
Makes me want to think about going to heartseeker but I've heard that's really dead compared to stalagg
---
ice block, ggs
---
Not sure what server this guy is playing on
---
I know one thing. It also does enable physical disabled ppl to enjoy wow. So I absolutely am a big fan of it being a thing for those.
---
No joke! That sound like a lot to juggle! I’d get it when you can it’s really good though.
---
I feel like I have been no lifeing hard outside of work and I have 5 days played
---
Can you really not hit the hit cap from other items before then?
---
He's an old art director or something I forget what he did for wow exactly but he's an old blizzard guy.
---
I mean... that's how it should be.  A rogue's best ability is stealth.
---
What the fuck.... This needs attention.
---
They sell the 60s when they level them up. Also they can farm to do vendor shuffles from all the junk and make pretty decent gold while leveling.
---
Yup, removing layering is going to suck. I hope they change their minds
---
Horde literally has an extra flight path AND a zeppelin that lands there, though.  I find it hard to believe that anything outside of a live server is really seeing massive alliance zergs in stv
---
Ok but it’s still there now?
---
Also what UI add-on is that?
---
No worries...I'll be keeping a close eye on this because I already love it lol
---
No, in retail the skill level associated with your Pick Lock ability is just 5 times your character's level, so you would have to be level 1000 to unlock something with a skill requirement of 5000. Also, they changed this item to no longer be considered locked. It just has flavor text that says, "All the pages are blank."

Aaand I have 2 days 13 hours played and it has been most of my free time...
---
just got this while tanking, and boy does it feel disappointing
---
it maybe procs once during a fight, near the end. WOAH 7 DAMAGE. less attack speed actually means that i get less aggro because i block less often
---
Enchanting takes all of your valuable items that could be vendored or sold on the AH and makes them into profession skill points. My tailor enchanter is broke because I spend all of my tailor mats on crafting greens to DE for enchanting.
---
If the pop doesn’t drop significantly it’s going to be unplayable with 20k on at once per faction once layering stops, really high pop are too high and low pop are too low
---
WHAT CAPS!?
---
What a dick move
---
You are in no way forced to go two handed as a warrior, i leveled as dualwield and it's viable, a lot of fun, and it makes the occasional dungeontanking easier since you keep your one handed weaponskills up to date
---
Rogues are third played class, and I never really struggle to find groups so far. If you do start to struggle, just make your own or find a good guild
---
Basically. If brush up against the side at a certain spot it drags you along as if you were on top.
---
I have played since Vanilla launched and can’t remember hearing this, however I think it is wonderful and will try to find excuses to use it.
---
Do you guys think that server transfers will come again eventually where we can transfer to all servers to reunite with friends? I am on Silverspine but my friends are on different server, do you think that they will allow server transfers one more time or should I just level up again from level 1?
---
Seemed much harder and as a rogue, the lock boxes in p server gave wayyy better money
---
Makes me sad, early reports for stalagg were much more even. So I wonder if transfers ended up having more alliance leave than horde.
---
Careful, 2K might send goons to your house lol
---
I saw a streamer get into Mount Hyjal the other day so it seems its still possible.
---
KEEP YER FEET ON THR GROUND!
---
I'm aware of that, but that quests involves a lot more than grinding low drop mobs, mainly a lot of PvP and flying into IF to buy the tailoring cloak most likely sold for an inflated price, none of which gives XP.
---
BREAKIN ME DOWN, BREAK ME DOWN!

It's ok, buy it on steam in 6 months when:
---
* it's cheaper
---
* it's patched and doesn't have game breaking bugs/run like shit
---
* it's not on EGS
---
* DLC will probably be available
---
Is there an addon that will simply add hp/mana bar above my head , nothing fancy just 2thine lines and will not kill my classic wow look ? Or maybe convert existing one in sth very simple? Thx.
---
Seemed much harder and as a rogue, the lock boxes in p server gave wayyy better money. But by the time I joined the server was in a weird state because classic was coming and people knew their toons would go away eventually

The worst part of this is that BGs are cross server. So not only does the under represented side have to deal with a harder leveling experience they also dont have a BG queue advantage.
---
"But wait! There's more horde on all pvp servers so that will still be the case" except in vanilla they mixed pvp and pve servers in battle groups of which the pve are more alliance heavy.
---
Alliance on pvp servers get screwed which make less people roll them which has feedback effects for absolutely NO benefit.
---
I got addies lol
---
Rock would beat scissors but it can’t find scissors, cause scissors is invisible.
---
Love this! Brings back some fun sap memories...also what was the explosion at the end??
---
the tiger was a myth back in vanilla
---
Honestly havent had much time to play it. Just been doing coop when mates on so no campaign yet. The horde mode is fun and long can last a few hours. And the escapes cool too. I prefer the coop elements. I'll do the campaign later. But it's really nice game graphically and the weapons are fun, some difficult to use but rewarding. Always liked the movement system and wall cover system so it's just great fun

Their is also a tram that runs non stop from IF to SW. don’t kick yourself too hard.

Well after what the nobles did to the masons after the last reconstruction I can totally see why nobody took up a contract to repair it this time around.

I mean - maybe not the guild for you?

You and 50% of the classic wow population

Whitemane? I think I saw Ardros.

I have a 22 rogue, 11 rogue, and several under 10. I’m playing around with faction and race combos to see which animations etc I like the most for my rogue. I’m enjoying it.
---
If it makes you feel better I play mage (on retail as well) and am rolling fire spec for leveling.  I’m sure it’s slower but I enjoy it more.
---
a mouse over macro such as this one:
---
\#showtooltip

/cast \[@mouseover,help,nodead\]\[help,nodead\]\[@player\] Heal

will cast on self if nothing is targeted. that might help you?

Omg this is great.

Hopefully things work out for you guys. I know I purposely waiting a week to let the storm stop and joined one of the servers that was released a few days later. There's hundreds of players all over every zone it's exciting lol. And our q during peak times is 10min the highest I've seen or reported on our discord.
---
I am saving for my 90g for a mount when I hit 40. I am a nelf priest. Currently, I have 17g and I am level 27. Is this around where I should be? I have only been buying spells that I use in my levelling rotation. Thanks.
---
Those have reasons other than purely griefing.
---
Even if that is true my point still stands that people would rather be witty than helpful on Reddit for the most part.
---
Hey dude, I agree it’s not something I understand either. If you google it a little you will see that players paid far more than 5k during older expansions.
---
I don't even play warlock but I'll write a ticket man. Fuck this handholding from blizz, it's what ruined retail in the first place.

RP, or ERP?

Is there any hope to merge low population servers if they don’t grow? Or will people start moving to them as they get sick of queue times?

Ams, id like to see the spot ( i cannot found you) looks like an useful technique

It’s a stat stick. You can wingclip with a gray dagger, and if you’re counting on Raptor to do damage, well, you’ve got bigger issues.

On Skeram, it seems that Nesingwary's camp in STV is always guarded by a ?? Alliance.  My biggest issue in STV was competition for tags with other Horde, even in a group.  For the most part, I ignored Alliance and they ignored me, except for the occasional higher level Rogue who would gank me while I'm grinding mobs, but that's to be expected.
---
Haven’t seen a single one.
---
I'm pretty close myself. 39.5 and 80 gold now that I found a thing to farm and AH.
---
Third? Wow. What’s one and two? Mage?
---
I got hatemail from a guy (either bought a new account or was borrowing someones) I  got banned for stealing mats in vanilla. We had a clearly arranged deal in chat and he broke it. Got my stuff back a few hours after submitting the ticket and another report sent in for harassment the next day. Good times.
---
do it and I'll MC you again.
---
Lawl, just RP. Noch is just a grumpy old man who likes his quiet time and fishing.
---
As a wow noob, what is this? lol
---
Arathi highlands (especially if you're horde) for 30-40. I just went to bad lands at 41 and am getting good higher level herbs now.
---
No water?
---
Ublock origin, problem solved in case you wanted to try it.
---
This is how all the high level groups are finding me, I don't pay any attention to chat when I'm out grinding (furbogs in Winterspring right now).
---
Get whispered, heal BRD, go back to grinding, get whispered, heal Scholo . . .
---
I know I'm not the only high level priest, but I think some tanks have figured out that if you whisper me I will say yes.
---
Echoing others here, in addition to the +smog, yes my drain life and siphons life heal much more. I chose the dream weave parts over shadoweave where applicable, but my total +shadow damage is 151 at level 47. My drain life can out heal one mob attacking me very easily.
---
Throw on curse of shadows and you heal for even more.
---
Frost mage. I didn’t know there are sets before 60. What sets can you get before 60 for frost mage?
---
TIL
---
Hunters use their melee weapon a lot 
---
In dungeons they don’t 
---
Actually only in Level phase and for pvp 
---
But a bad weapon means a bad time for hunter 
---
A strong dps melee weapon is just helpful as a hunter 
---
If a hunter doesn’t need it as much as melee classes doe but a hunter needs a good melee weapon way more than a warrior needs a good bow
---
Funny how I've been feeling left behind lately even though I'm apparently still in like top 5% with level 47.
---
To grief lobbies in Ashenvale
---
I get lots of tanks whispering me as a priest.
---
Well everyone know OP is a one pump chump
---
I could ask him!
---
Oh man I miss talented... I've been using talent sequence and build them at Bobo-talents.
---
And "WhatsTraining" to see if things are worth going to a class trainer or if I can wait another 2 levels.
---
Only with shadow priest in raidgroup
---
I love priests. I have like 2 of them in the 20s and they're tailor/chanters. Questing isn't bad but since I wasn't on the leading edge the professions definitely don't pay off atm and the travel is just so slow. "Hey we're rerolling on yet another server" I'm told. I said fuck it. I'm leveling a hunter with skin/herb. I'm using the hunter to feed/twink my baby priest. I'll level the priest later when it's that much easier. Hunter leveling rules. I like money.
---
Fairbanks would like to have a word with you
---
you're welcome to try, but if you get caught by improved CS you're dead meat :)
---
I got a new SteelSeries mouse recently that features haptic feedback when a cooldown expires. Didn't have a chance to try it before my cat bit the USB wire in two.
---
That's not true. For leveling a good melee weapon goes a long way. It's maybe not as important as for a 100% melee class, but far from a stat stick, too.
---
You don't need the best bow as a warrior because you most likely only pull mobs with ranged attacks whereas hunters do actually attack in melee on many occasions, be it because of the positions they are in (certain caves los etc.),  or simply (like my case) both slow melee weapon and ranged weapon allow us to use both string and swing timers to be as efficient as possible while running to and from target in melee and bow ranges respectively.
---
Hah you should see STV in EU Stonespire, it's probably around 4:1 horde to alliance.
---
I think it also greatly depends on how hardcore raiding guilds there are on your side of the server. Just random collectors may not be paying 500g+ even later for any recipe, but those involved in year+ long classic raiding might. My server has several guilds who have their eyes already on that naxx40 clear so at least some of the flask prices should remain high for a long time.
---
So to my understanding we dont get most of our damage mitigation until we get ice block so you arent doing anything wrong, we are just squish af. In terms of dungeons pace yourself, throw in wand hits you can drink and run by making tons of water too. Use dispel if you get dots, also we use more spells i believe for pvping than we do for pve not sure what the rotation is for pvp.
---
I can handle level 60 players with my level 40 drain tank warlock. And up to 3 players simultaneously. Just saying, mobility is usually not an issue with +8% movement speed enchant on boots.

Mograine is huge too

Huge server low queues

Who knew being an autoattack oriented class would have it's advantages?
---
I knew something was off about the sheer amount of mages running around, hard not to notice them when so many blink around instatagging mobs you're going for...
---
Thank you. However, I’m get downvoted because “lul shaman one shot what.” Gotta love it.
---
I'd assume they'd eventually do a merge if it's warranted. Tbh low pop at this point is still pretty high relatively speaking!
---
#*NO. CHANGES.*
---
Mage and Warrior :)
---
Mage amazing for farming
---
Warrior amazing at everything once high level/geared
---
Yeah just wanted to say -- about 30-70 Ally/horde on Skeram. Numbers are released.
---
The #NOCHANGES people are so fucking annoying.
---
There’s already been changes, stop being a smug douche.
---
Yesterday someone asked me: "Do you know where to learn staves?"
---
I said, "the music teacher" and he still doesn't get my joke.
---
I just started too. Dont know whats the best but atm im just doing it with two screens just dual open launcher. I play two different classes so it isnt very easy to use mutiboxing tools
---
It would be funny af if they made a location that is always "'character name' peril"
---
There's a multi box group. You could ask there?
---
Already confirmed on the classic FAQ: 
---
Q: Will there be Cross Realm Battlegrounds when those go live?
---
A: Cross-realm battlegrounds were a feature of 1.12 and are important for matchmaking, so you’ll be seeing cross-realm battlegrounds in WoW Classic when Battlegrounds are introduced in Phase 3 of the content roll-out plan.
---
HUH!?
---
I get that it's not a tanking weapon it's an instant 1h fmg ability weapon.
---
But attack speed has nothing to do with block chance lol
---
Not an expert but I think if you can find an off hand sword with high attack speed it'd do you well yes.
---
Criticize it and get it out so u feel better. It is pointless to complain about it, however. What is done is done.

I just want classic BC servers... all of my friends play horde but all I want to play is a paladin

I was having the same issue on this. I don't know if you've extracted the zip into its own folder with each zperl subfolders inside the main addon folder or not but that is what I was doing and nothing was working whatsoever. I did download a xperl for 'vanilla' wow and it loaded but gave errors. it did however give me a tip.... EACH folder inside the zip is its own addon. so you need to make several folders into the main interface/addons.  Sorry if this is confusing.
---
It's an employee thing.
---
I like the name lol but pretty sure there will be some ass toons who get offended and report it. And blizzard is known to name change even the slightest form of offensive names.
---
First time playing wow, hit 100g on level 39 no guides. It's nothing difficult.
---
Like wow yeah (no pun intended).
---
The inclusion of hinterlands bridges that gap easily from what it was like in vanilla. You can quest all the way to 60 and still have some left over.
---
All depends on what you want out of the game. My co-main back in the day (I pretty much spent equal time on both) was a rogue and it was great for pvp and pve. I didn't listen to what anyone said and went for subtlety, because I enjoyed it the most, and I never looked back.

This link appears dead?

Sure, sure, you can include the dopey elf, if you must.... but I demand MOAR SNOUTIUS

This is it. Only the strongest rejuv. But' HT is far better anyways. Downrank for life
---
Same for me but replace Octopath with Fire Emblem 😭
---
I play it since release on PC and i have zero issues/trouble and also no noticable bugs so i don't know why people complain that much about Epic Games launcher/exclusive
---
To be fair, pretty much every class is absolutely boring to play when questing. You can make descriptions like that for any class.
---
And in Portuguese! 😊
---
You don’t really.  Pretty much just there for the boss
---
My vanilla raiding guild also used holy priest and ret paladin dps when we overgeared the raids. It's possible, but it's a pretty big handicap that you're putting yourself in past five mans. This isn't retail.
---
You're doing above average yes, if you keep up at that pace you should have no problem getting your mount.
---
Wow so true
---
"grats to my guildmates but i cant believe this shhhiiiiiittttttt"

I am in RFC right now and really enjoyed listening while playing. Thanks!

Definitely a Tolkien reference.
---
Surfing this subreddit as I watch Borderlands 3 download. Struggle is real.
---
Yes, probably some sort of invisible ink.
---
doubt any good multibox software is free
---
Mulgore certainly looks the best. But god does it take long. Long walks, low droprates, lots of killing.
---
I finished the Night Elf zone in like 1/2 of the time Tauren took me.
---
that is correct. as ret if you put in massive effort, you can compete with other dps classes whl are coasting. 
---
imagine how well youd do putting in that effort on a different class.
---
I haven't played retail since Cata. Been playing vanilla ever since.
---
You do this when you're geared out standing around in the main cities, showing off to all the other players so you can sit there and know who's drooling over your gear without acknowledging their presence. Truly next level snobbery.
---
If wowhead is full of ads you are probably using AdBlock. They sold out a long time ago and websites can pay adblock to still show ads. Ublock origin is your friend.
---
Just because you dont find it fun, or too much of a chore, does not mean something is wrong with it and others can manage it just fine.
---
Didn't they fix it in legion?
---
Should i save my skinning mats until the economy is better? stacks of medium leather selling for 20s when last night they were going for 70s.
---
It’s the lack of diminishing returns. I kept casting it and the drowning ticks did more damage than he healed for. It used to last a long time too.

Not like steam reviews are worth a damn anyway.

I was a vanilla hunter and I can assure you that even with a proper macro FD+trap would not always work (no dots). However it's right that it's bugged because in vanilla it worked at least most of the times
---
I'm not a hardcore no changes guy, but I wouldn't want this just for the fact that specs are so important. You aren't just a warrior that can Respec on the fly to be a tank, fury pve DPS, and then go PvP as arms. If u wanted to do that, that's a hell of a lot of grinding. Instead, you're known for your specific spec.
---
Is he in classic?
---
Just look at the time when you go in. Then do your 5 runs and go back in at the time you started 1 hour later
---
He does have that same angry look
---
Lol exactly. It is quite the opposite. A lot of horde
---
I'm on Kirtonos. According to the population statistics, my faction makes up about 30% of the population :D and I felt it yesterday in STV
---
Doors that way &gt;
---
It's not that unpopular opinion because in retail later expansions changed it, adding a bunch of different syst ems like dual spec, etc.
---
Classic though is not those times.
---
How does it remove the sense of accomplishment since you need to obtain the badass looking stuff in the first place to transmog it ?
---
Alliance Skum!
---
More like quick target checks on nearby and incoming Alliance but whatever fits your fancy mate.
---
Inner focus goes to using my mind flay
---
Players aren't allowed to discover things. They are supposed to follow a 1-60 in 5 hours guide or they are noob trash. OP isn't playing the game we tell him to play.  /s
---
What did kt summon
---
Fuck that. If i'm in your group and you see me do that shit. It because imma bout to go fuck someone up.
---
Questing gets a bit dull so mindlessly farming some mobs and focusing on a podcast for a few hours is a nice change of pace
---
Send me your gold.
---
I mean agree there annoying but why the fuck would they change 100000 things for the player base to make it easier defeats the entire point of classic. You stop being such a smug douche and learn when things should not be put in the game. So they have layering does that mean fuck it put in LFG, duel specs, free respecs, hell mine as well make a LFR for molten core and ony. Fuck off mate.
---
10 levels from the half way mark, hfhfhfhf :\^)
---
You dont have to farm nearly that much. I have my epic mount and it took a few hours a day grinding air elementals. 9g per @ 7% drop rate
---
This is awesome. An orc I can stand behind.
---
Then just play on a PvE server?
---
#roguelife
---
Lol you just proved my point.
---
you're really good at baiting, a year ago I would've definitely fell for it
---
Eh, I've had no issues on my 2080 running at max settings and 110-120 FPS.
---
No bc takes it all too far. I want classic +. Bc was ass anyway.
---
Oh really that sounds perfect to me lol
---
No, go ingame and test it yourself. If you cast a instant cast like Stam buff while MCing it will break the Mc, but the buff will be applied.
---
Are there any decent resources out there for mid-low level world PvP?  Guides, tips, things to do/not do?  Especially for Druid?
---
I've been in Hillsbrad for a level or two and there are a lot of the enemy faction.
---
This morning I saw 3 players (Priest, Warrior, Hunter) a level below me and decided to gank them since I needed some Murlocs and have been trying to get them for days and keep having to get into battles for some mobs.  The warrior ran off while the Priest/Hunter continued to kill so I snuck in and dropped the Hunter.  I probably should have gone for the priest but I was thinking about the Hunter's pet keeping me from healing if I needed to.  The priest shields and runs so I'm pinging at him and running him down, almost dead, fully heals, but I get him back down pretty quickly.  A Rogue joins the fray a couple levels higher than me.  I drop to half and leave form, stomp, and start healing (quick restoration) but I cannot get a heal off and die.
---
I just was not prepared (he had the element of surprise)  for the Rogue and didn't know how to approach the situation.  If I was just able to time that heal and gotten to swap to bear form I am pretty confident the Rogue would have been dust too.
---
But If you get attacked less often u get less chance to block
---
10/10 would heal for
---
totally, and theres no rule against switching back if you don't like it, or leveling your hunter after your mage or whatever
---
They make a little more sense if you have an entire family doing it since the add-ons are like half price. I think Lifetime Fitness is similar in that regard as well. 
---
For a single person wanting to go to a gym you can't beat Planet Fitness's prices though.
---
Fuck you i did xD
---
If you have a shield then yes, though you may have a hard time keeping threat up. 14 will be easier though as the other reply said. You can probably 2h tank but may be harder if your gear is as bad as you say.
---
Also this.
---
Faction locking is a suggestion not frequently discussed.
---
Oh sorry this space could've been used by another boat or zep catching video
---
&gt;At level 20 I didn't even I have a gold to spec.
---
I respecced at 20 and did have the gold, even as an enchanter
---
&gt;We would see less cookie cutter builds in general, while leveling or pve/pvp.
---
No, everyone would use cookie cutter tank build in dungeons and switch to cookie cutter leveling build outside. If anything it would increase the amount of cookie cutter builds because everyone would have the cookie cutter build for the right situation. I wish i was resto in dungeons (as a druid) but i wasn't because leveling build is more important, so i was doing dungeons without a cookie cutter build for dungeons, this applies to almost every hybrid player.
---
&gt;This replaces the need for duel specializations (introduced in burning crusade).
---
Was not introduced in TBC and not everyone even likes dual specialisation.
---
&gt;I literally need to replace 1 talent, in the same tree, at the moment because I got a faster attacking speed pet (went from a tank to a dps pet, and now I need more energy from this pet) like seriously?
---
No you don't. You want to reduce cookie cutter builds but here you are trying to have the best build possible in every situation at any time.
---
&gt;Because I've had this happen... what if you misclick a talent and now you have to start over for another 5+gold.
---
Don't missclick. Is it really that hard? You know it costs money so be careful. Although i don't think its a big deal i don't think it would hurt to let you change a talent back for a minute or 2 after you selected it.
---
&gt;As an aside, in 2008 I reached that 50g limit on my priest. It was literally impossible for me to grind that much gold to go from shadow to holy. Luckily BC fixed that, but we don't need that option. 
---
&gt;None of this makes sense. BC was already out in 2008, in fact Wotlk released in 2008 and like i said previously, Dual specialization didn't came with BC.
---
sorry if i cant help with more information :( is just that i already respeced 2 times...and i would need to waste 10 gold! to see how it is without it :O

That's why I bought the Krol Blade. In phase 3 the WSG weapons will be available with better damage and DPS, but that's god knows how far away.
---
Nope, but I also didn't get my mount at 40, I got it at 44, but like I said, it all works out.  When I hit 60 tonight I'll be almost a quarter of the way to my epic mount (or more probably buying Cassandra's Grace off the AH . . . sigh).

Enchanting is a back loaded money maker, sure it sucks while leveling, but pays really well at max level with some good enchants.

No, 99% of the time mana is your first aid
---
Well I'm someone who does think that even if people break rules that a 0 tolerance, ban them and delete all evidence of their existence as soon as they transgress policy is silly. So yeah that wouldn't be the guild for me. But I can still criticise it.
---
Just responding to this. I am aware, though.
---
I left after Wotlk. I had played since a few month pre-BC. What killed it for me was the lack of social interaction that brought genuine immersion. I met still to this day genuine friends who’ve I met and traveled with IRL. Friends from all around the world! And precious memories of local friends who would come over on the weekend for a 24 wow binge fest! I only ever actually used LFR/LFG system once or twice. I did pop back in for a month or so during Legion and I don’t think I spoke to a single person, I used wow as a distraction during off times while my dad was battling cancer. I can’t say how much it helped to refresh my emotional stamina. But vanilla/pre-BC will always be my first wow era love. 
---
Sometimes it’s hard to explain to a hardcore retail person the exact differences that make a person like my self so fervently pro-classic, I am pro classic because that was “my” era. That was the game I first played and loved everything about. 
---
I have yet to return to classic, only as with career/job and time constraints, I am worried that I will make time to play by sacrificing things that needn’t be sacrificed. But, doesn’t blizz have a parental control that could assist in helping me manage /time played?
---
Yes repair bills are &gt;20s that also helps
---
It's also very unhealthy to work so hard and never take a break.
---
i highly recommend warrior. but if you have a regular group to work with, you can consider paladin. learning to tank without a taunt and with randoms who cant be bothered to manage aggro is three strikes against paladin, to be honest.
---
tanks are in short supply so either is doable, im thinking about your experience.
---
Pls
---
According to the replies in this post, it is a very unpopular opinion.
---
Well, if i see a lvl 12 with a T1, that mean its player had to grind and raid for it, it doesn't remove its accomplishment.
---
Wouldn't you find it better if transmog was changed so you can't transmog down (so you can't transmog a lvl 12 item with any item of higher level) or can't transmog with a item from  a superior rarity (so green item can only be transmog into a green item, etc etc) ?
---
For me transmog is not only an incredible tool for Roleplay players (who are a minority yes), it add much more characterization to everyone since high-level guys won't systematically look the same
---
I mean yeah but im not saying that i want phase 3 quick after phase 2. Im saying i wouldn't mind phase 2 soon because it doesn't add any new raid so pve'ers don't feel like the need to rush but it adds pvp.
---
Please change it to Al Goretusk
---
Honestly taking the time to level mining/engineering would make your life a bazillion times more easy. Or if you have an alt for mining, Blacksmith/engineering is a nice combo, just expensive!

Wrath levelling up until the culmination of the Wrathgate questline was beautifully crafted. From there open world got less satisfying.

I’ve signed up for the beta client which I was told would correct this. But it hasn’t

---
Swamp of Sorrows is amazing in the high 30's- tons of mobs to grind (swamp jaguars are skinnable and drop great greys), herbs all around, and not nearly as hot of a pvp zone as other main questing areas like STV or arathi.

I’m sorry but his voice is incredibly hard to listen to; it’s too nasally for my taste

That's about to be me, but with Destiny 2's Shadowkeep.
---
On PVE servers, in order to engage in world PvP you have to flag yourself for PvP eligibility by typing /pvp. Afterwards if an enemy player wants to attack you they can. If you don't make yourself eligible then you can't hit or be hit by the enemy faction.
---
Just loving it.
---
I know nothing about it because I can't find anything but forum hearsay to back up your claim. You got any sources?
---
I’ve found more of these types of players in WoW than any other game. “Know it all neckbeards” is what my GM called them after we ran our first few dungeons with pubs. 
---
They’re everywhere, start a list and avoid them at all costs. There seems to be a fine line in WoW where trolling becomes inappropriate but these guys have NO clue where that line is and when/why/how they crossed it.
---
That sounds absolutely amazing to me.  I find joy in these things as well.

Dood, what do you use for that grainy texture? Would mind also knowing what program and brushes you use, but I feel like I'd be asking too much...

We fought back in hillsbrad last night on Benediction. About 30 Alliance ranging from 25-60. I haven't done that in over a decade. What a rush, a huge swarm of gnomes and humans and dwarves running together, with a handful of mounted players moving around us. Man this is fun. Just saw the realm pop post, and benediction looks like a pretty even 50-50 split. Glad I ended up there.

You can only be attacked by other players if you are flagged for pvp. To become flagged, you can either right click your portrait to enable pvp, attack an enemy faction npc or player (who is flagged), or enter a hostile enemy zone (their 1-20 leveling zones or capital cities). 
---
The difference on a pvp server is that you also become flagged if you enter a contested zone, which is most zones above 20.
---
i wonder why my experience is so different from others. either allies completely ignore me or a lot of them will /cheer me (do they know me as a good guy over there or somthing?) with the few exceptions of being blasted while i was really low an hp (those names are forever on my list).
---
The addon Fishing Buddy has a classic version up that adjusts your volume similarly when you equip a fishing pole too!
---
Won't buy that shit till it's not on the Epic game store.  Fuck that.
---
I get it, but did you die or what. All I see is an xp bar
---
The only way to get flagged is to go into hostile territory. So places like Capital cities/towns(crossroads/gold shire). Or to assist someone that is flagged so be careful when you randomly buff people/heal them etc. they will be green instead of blue if they are flagged for PvP.
---
Breaks are good. Also 4 day work weeks with paid vacation helps me get through life. some of us like nice things.

I understand that I can technically quest in whatever zone I want. Is just that I want to quest in the zone that the quest line would naturally tell me to go, like it does from the start (Teldrassil-&gt;Darkshore-&gt;Ashenvale-&gt;??). 
---
I'm pretty sure that I missed the quest that tells me where I'm supposed to go now. 
---
I'm curious to know which of the zones I'm supposed to go next in the "quest line".
---
Yeah man gotta push that 70/30 down to 80/20
---
Hey that's great! Glad to hear it :)
---
Playing the game outside of dungeons is impossible on full servers. Can’t quest without hours of Wpvp and even if there’s no wpvp, good luck tagging any mobs when they’re all perma camped.

In addition you could rapidly turn up high ilvl stuff doing world endgame content mostly solo.
---
Well, if u leave them alone they might just go sneaky on ya once ur low health. Make them fear you from the beginning so they get no closer than 50 yards and even then chase them away even further after every mob u kill, we have to show them that we are superior😎😎

Elvui

They're new players, almost everyone knows 2H tanking is completely fine
---
You have both toons only use one attack for example. So you hit one button and both toons fire for double dmg than what on toon would have done. See?
---
When should I respec from shadow to holy?
---
I'm level 55 at the moment and I was thinking respeccing at 56 to spam run BRD for pre-raid BiS. Thoughts?
---
&lt;20? 😜
---
Meh, I like being able to leave up a database on 2nd monitor/in the background. Wowhead leaks so much damn data while it's running that it is annoying and will even crash my browser. That is, if it doesn't just start blaring some random bullshit ad randomly.
---
classicdb for the win.
---
Any big difference between 4 and 5 tho?
---
It really doesn’t. I played since day 1 15 years ago. Once people figured it out I never saw the mechanic used for anything purposeful.
---
 
---
I just started classic wow last week and my current main is a warrior tank who I play with my wife, during the offtime I am looking for a great dps class for late-game content. I want someone who can stand out as we enter the first raids and as each new raid is released on the true servers. I'm torn between a lock and a mage, i like both classes and want to play both classes but i want to be very relevant and helpful to my raid parties, guild, and even farming.
---
I really want to have a powerful DPS
---
I want to be able to farm gold
---
i want to be able to run new players through dungeons
---
i worry that with a mage leveling will become to difficult, at the same time i'm worried that using a lock might be difficult because when i did DM with my level 17 i was bottom dps... if lock takes a lot of extra work to beome a great dps it might not be the best choice for me... i dont know what is everyone's feelings on the two classes (please no play what)
---
Body aggro pull, interrupt casters to bring them in original AoE spot, emergency taunts.
---
Just stop using the internet probably.
---
This is indeed how it’s helpful to disabled players.
---
Kinda crazy to put that on especially as a rogue
---
I remember in Vanilla I was a lowbie on Darkshore for the first time...and some level 38 Nelf named Havlat gave me 1g...i was so grateful...it’s fun to do this stuff.
---
yes. close thread.

Right there with the rest of us

Don't forget the struggle of coming up with a name!
---
they are a thing and it's hilarious that I can train to use them as a hunter.
---
why on earth would I equip throwing weapons as a hunter? it makes the whole class pointless.
---
that's 10 silver i'm never spending haha
---
I've been tanking all of classic with an arms warrior and I do the same on trash. If you weren't wiping and there were unnecessary deaths then thats on them.
---
I didn't complained, from my point of view this is a genious move.
---
Instead of having all the warlocks nuking the low level zones and causing a lot of drama between the people who not enjoy this kind of things (remember the naxx event?), they just delay it, avoiding drama and, eventually, warlocks will be able to nuke low level zones.

This is a literally "everybody will be happy thanks to this"

They’re either new players or don’t understand how classic is actually played. Probably the same type of players that would not understand a warrior rolling on leather because it is BiS.

I focused on LW heavily, so I've flipped and sold Devilsaurs, plus done a lot of grinding as rogue/skinning. Pickpocket runs and such.
---
I’m waiting for a used PS4 copy to pop up so I can return it to GameStop.  I tend to get bored of borderlands pretty quick.  The open world is empty, bland, and doesn’t have music....just your footsteps
---
It was a GRIND, so many dead animals.
---
Are you interested in leveling an alternate character? Try a new class and help them out that way until they get a little closer to your 31!
---
.....warriors don’t raid as arms
---
Well those guys didnt approach us until we started killing them, we got ran over at one point when they gathered around 9ppl vs 4, but it was a shitshow for 1-2hrs straight, a 38 warrior kept chasing us and got killed around 6 times.
---
However like u said, mostly i find that ppl ignore me too, maybe 1 out of 10 move in on me, but that doesnt stop me from attacking every single one of them ;) its The rogue duty
---
Touch them like they touched me
---
I love seeing shit like this in classic! I used to go on "camping trips" to level up cooking/fishing/gathering professions lol. 
---
You should totally take people on "guided fishing trips" to take them across azeroth to catch rare fish or help them level up fishing. Would be really fun rp
---
Healcomm is all you need. It shows a green bar for incoming heals so you know if it’ll overheal, or if another heal is incoming on that player.

Since when. I joined a party and switched layers yesterday.
---
Our tank gave me a spirit scroll, I said thanks and promptly buffed him with it.  🤦🏻‍♀️
---
I was unaware you could share them..
---
it's gonna be the same game in a year, just wait til it's on sale, it's a single player game 🤷
---
Enchanting is more a max level money maker tho, right?
---
+14 agility is really good for rogue
---
Dick move. Hilarious, but still a dick move.
---
These are nowhere near as good as on pserver. Pserver %drop rate was way off. You can maybe make 2g by hours max.
---
It’s rogue prebis.
---
I think in these scenarios you should announce before the dungeon "I'm ret and I'd like to roll on ret gear". Just make sure if you do this you're not needed on int gear over a caster as well.
---
We tried that but he only gets xp that seems roughly proportional to the damage he's done, so right now that's not too useful. Maybe at level 18+ it will be.
---
Try Threat Plates!
---
Sorry, SL and Feral Druid, 2 specs that can rock a good frost mage 60-70% of the time unless the mage gets a lucky crit. Wahoo. Now name any other class that only has 2 specs that counter it.
---
lmao this needs way more up votes.
---
I'll definitely check that out tonight, thank you for the suggestion!
---
On the blood sail server ally side has a guild called druid of the paw. It is a druid only guild
---
:O yusss thank you :)
---
Ahh sure you’re half way there ;)
---
Feels good to pass the good vibes on, we should all try to do this when we can!
---
epic bad
---
Warlocks advertise themselves as "purple mage LFG" when they want to go into dungeons, just saying.
---
Classic is so broken and unlike vanilla it’s pathetic
---
Here's my argument, gold has limited complexity. **Gold already limits a character to one spec via training and gear...** its not like i can train everything and afford, mounts/bags/professions/training/specializations. 
---
If I could afford a cheap spec, I would spend more on AH gear or profession gear. this would cause less bag space and more gold complex into another form.
---
Frenzy procs off any crit. 
---
Bite and Claw don’t cause delay, they’re abilities, not spells. 
---
It shouldn’t cause delay, but I’ve heard it sits there for 0.5s when using Lightning Breath. 
---
It’s insanely good. 15% chance to resist any slow/root? Yes please. 
---
You can’t. Players can’t dodge from behind either, but mobs can.
---
BLIZZARD HIRE THIS GUY AND MAKE A DAMN CARTOON!
---
They were made as private server release hype vids, so kinda real
---
More of a *SHWROooooo* if you ask me
---
Their DPS is really lackluster. Most serious guilds will have 1 enhancement/resto hybrid shaman for totems and nightfall.
---
While I see your point, I should clarify my stance.  In MOBAs I always play unranked.  I will grant that cookie cutter meta is useful for ranked play with randoms, but I’ve gotten flamed for not strictly following the cutting edge meta in unranked and that baffles me.  Similarly, in WoW I feel like hardcore raiding guilds are for those people who view any lost time in a raid as wasted time.  But for the broader more casual player base, it’s not a big deal
---
if you want to use a quest-addon, use questie. it shows all available quests in the zones (you can even display low-level quests), so you can check if you missed one.
---
Also as we've seen here sometimes finding a healer is harder than finding a DPS.  Maybe if there aren't enough healers or tanks who want to group the game could offer them rewards to join LFG too?
---
Weird flex but okay
---
They kept those in but removed raid exploits that were removed during the time.
---
Part of the classic experience is being able to do that so it got kept.
---
There are loads of bugs and exploits that got left in because they ended up being a part of the experience and removing them would change that
---
Second this completely, some people have been super nice when I'm just wandering alone as a holy priest or fishing and get attacked. I'm usually not brave enough to CC-buff high levels but I'll do it for lower levels.
---
Your name makes me proud of you alone
---
I already have it. And it's a looter shooter with end game group content. Not just a single player game.
---
Are people going to Steam reviews that will all inevitably be some claptrap joke or just saying a bug happened 10/10 instead of te actual testing done by people on different machines?
---
Same here.  Made a Warrior on launch day and rolled a Hunter instead on day 3 or 4.  Muuuuch better for someone who doesn't have a lot of time since hunters can solo just about anything while leveling.
---

Yeah I only fuck with Disc because of how much damage I can do while healing. Otherwise shadow is my go to!
---
You realise you are saying exactly what I said and agreeing with me right?
---
I'm surprised.  My server it's all about tanks tanks tanks.  Except for the super high level groups that always seem to need a healer (like ST, BRD and strat)
---
Most druids I've talked to are doing dungons 100% as tanks.
---
play horde aka easy mode pvp on pve.
---
getting ww axe at 30 isnt going to happen without help but its still worth getting, 35 to 37 is more reasonable. RFK and Gnomer do have the potential to drop good 2h axes as well. if you wait a few levels you may be able to farm the arathi elemenals in a group, if you do buy the charms, buy them last after farming troll tusks as the price is going down and will continue to.
---
ravager is a rarish drop off armory and bonebiter requires a clear of cathedral... neither are going to happen for you for a while.
---
The other day in BFD we had an enhance sham and 2 warriors. All needed on the blue 2 handed axe from the murloc boss. Instantly, we see in chat "&lt;winner&gt; receives 2 greater magic essence" and his weapon never changed lol
---
One owl per raid dancing in front of a boss gives a raid-wide +5 to morale

Is there an addon which shows if and where I have mats for a certain recipe?

As in, if I open a recipe in the cooking window, mouseover an ingredient, and it will show me how many I have in bags/bank/where ever?

I'm aware what it does, it makes it so all you have to do is pm someone "inv" and run a dung without speaking to a soul bc you're too scared to talk to people

Omg, you do realise that this isn't about classic but about class design right?

I can only speak from my experience.  Hillsbrad is busy, lots of world pvp but not so much you can't even progress a quest.

No. IMO the talent system was designed EXACTLY for the reason of hybrid builds, you PvP and raid? Try to mix some shit up. You heal raids and PvP as DPS? We may work something up.
---
The cost is punishing because blizz wanted you to play mostly the same spec almost all the time, it was designed that way and is fine as it is.
---
Thing is, people are so carried away by elitist min-maxing things that they think that a hybrid build will prevent them to kill a 40m boss, or mostly important: Have fun

Which will be done

path of exile has a term 'spellcleave'.
---
poe streamers start streaming classic wow.
---
suddenly everyone calls aoe dps 'spellcleave'.
---
if spellcleave actually existed in wow, it would be something like the old unholy DK ability that spread diseases from your target to x adjacent targets.
---
what it is is 'spellwhirlwind'.
---
Judging by how many of these pointless posts we get, I’m going to say no, you didn’t.
---
I agree. Nothing is really time sensitive. Take your time and enjoy the ride. Even though its the same game as 15 years ago, it really isnt. improvements with the internet, youtube, friends, online communities, everything makes this game so much different now. You can enjoy this game way faster and more efficiently than before, dont need to rush.
---
Have fun dude! For the Horde!
---
We raided with three ma in vanilla, me being one of them.
---
I didn't pick it back then because it was best or anything, I read the manual at thought mage sounded cool.
---
Not played classic yet, but if I do I would do mage   again. Again not because of how good, but because the ability to teleport!! Makes getting around without flying or portal rooms so much easier!
---
Yeah you’re wrong.
---
I don’t play warlock, but his class should work as it did 15 years ago, that’s that.
---
That's funny because I always thought that the paladins are quite elite champions In comparison to ordinary warriors of the world, and the players warrior character are just way over the common warrior.

Shadow is amazing as well, just not so much in raid/dungeon environment

Might consider a RPPVP realm if you are looking for large battles.  Last night on Grobbulus (North American mind you) there was a large 40vs40 battle in Ashenvale.  There was multiple fights planned out in this area.  It was absolute chaos but a great experience.  The night before there was one at the Crossroads.
---
Yikes. It's a game my guy.

You must have had quite a bit drop for you then. Warriors typically have the hardest time
---
Seriously? If you played even as late as Cata or MoP there were guild perks that made your mail instant along with "Have Group, will Travel".. God I miss that one lol. 
---
But yeah about an hour since there are no guild perks in Vanilla.
---
Was for sure not a thing, I know this because we laughed at how casual this game took aggro, leash ranges and claiming mobs.
---
I started warrior with herb+alchemy, I'd do the same again.

35 isn't even halfway to 60 :).

Wait til 60 pp brd, it’s pretty insane if you’re good at it

Bonebiter pulls slightly ahead in singletarget, ravager way ahead in cleave.

This is becoming more common place as experienced players know when to trim the skills they don’t need and are actually knowledgeable about how to make some decent gold before 40. It’s really easy to make 100 gold for the 40 mount the real grind is the epic mount

I would have him contact blizzard then

I ran UBRS about 117 times on a certain private server a few years back trying to get my Dal swords set. Got the offhand about 2 runs in...never even saw the main hand drop. Gave up around 120 runs.
---
I would have just broken down and bought a Krol Blade at that point but I had already made a hunter alt and leveled him to 60 since no one would take me to raids without better weapons. 
---
Finally saw it drop once while running it on my hunter and helping a guildies farm Rend...he said it was his 75th run to get the main hand.
---
Tl;Dr: fuck a Dal main hand. I've witnessed the struggle firsthand and I'll take you to my raid with lvl 40 green weaps over that shit.
---
No he doesn't
---
That makes the cape look so much cooler than they do in game! Would love if they wrapped around our chars shoulders
---
Yeah, back in vanilla I only made it to level 36 before giving up, coming back at legion. But this time around I've got a little more experience under my belt. But also while I love the classic feel, SOME of the quality of life updates are kinda nice lol. While modern dungeon design is a linear boring nightmare, trying to find my way around the sprawling vanilla dungeons with zero reference point and constantly getting lost tends to piss off the people I'm running with lol
---
3 silver? What? My level 26 hunter had a repair bill of about 70 silver and the gear wasn't even red (hell not even yellow iirc)
---
Good to know, maybe ill do another post for the next one. How much is epic?
---
bUT mY DpS tHo
---
It's part of the Hunter rotation to use Multi Shot. They have Feign death to drop the aggro if required. If they don't use Multi Shot their damage drops significantly. Asking a Hunter to not use Multi Shot would be like asking a Rogue not to use Blade Flurry on adjacent mobs. If you're having problems with it, have you tried asking the Hunters to take it a little slower instead of making a thread on Reddit?
---
For me, it's a nostalgic run through all the zones that made this game fun in the beginning. Even getting killed by murlocks! And that early on LFG  Hogger grouping. I too am taking my time, doing a lot of quests, running to the areas, helping lower levels kill something. It's all good.

I guess DK wouldnt be much different from when it was wotlk. They would probably be crap tanks if they could not wear shields. Also they wouldnt use runes but mana i'd suppose. They would probably be excellent off- and threat tanks. I would also assume they might have some kind of permanent ghoul mechanic in all specs, making them something like a melee-petclass that has a lot of skills to sacrifice their pet. I doubt that they would provide a lot of support. Maybe they could also be something like an anti-caster. I would have a hard time seeing them as an alliance class, as they are undead (and even back then sylvanas would probably not be fine with DKs in her ranks)
---
I highly doubt a DH would ever be added to something like current WoW. The basic class idea from WC3 was way to split up into other classes, mostly in warlocks and rogues. Modern Blizzard was not even creative enough to design three specs for them, so i think the classic designers back then would never have added a DH. Maybe later if subclasses or additional talent trees would have been a thing. Also thematically Demonhunters at the time were way to much of an antagonist class with way to much power. What we were shown back then was that DHs are highly specialized officers, not mere adventurers.
---
Monks would fit super well into classic if they were race restricted. Like only Human, Dwarf, Forsaken and maybe Trolls. They would probably have been crap tanks, decent supportive melees with good aoe capabilities and mediocre heal/dps hybrids. They would probably use mana and have a combo point system based on buffs/debuffs instead of chi, as developers back then were prob. not able to design a whole new resource system for them. But i guess, just like on live wow today, they would have been the least played class, because they just lack a coolness factor all other classes have.
---
dang you shouldve saved that for selling later
---
It wasn’t a bannable offense to play the Warlock class fantasy of playing a sadistic class that can reap havoc. This is an RPG you cheesecake.
---
Don’t make things up because you’re wrong, that just makes you look stupid.

\*pet chases fleeing mob and pulls half the dungeon*
---
Everyone knew that going in.
---
Us medium server players tried to tell you peoplr countless times but all we got in response is "my hardcore guild" or "dead servers" "cant wait for OTHERS to leave the servers".
---
Sorry I know this is aggressive but I'm projecting 1000 posts a day about complaints of big servers but outright refusal to leave even with unlimited knowledge at disposal
---
Sulfuras is pleasantly balanced. Slightly horde but we’re used to it at this point. 
---
Excited that it’s in the top 5 most balanced servers for US PvP!
---
Drop rates was even lower and there were horde players killing them as well.
---
Prime time there are no low pop. Also once layers get removed it will be more populated.
---
I love it
---
Lol true
---
all the SM spellcleave was just practice all along
---
There is a fishbot add-on that worked for years written in plain c# using. Net, but they finally detect it now.
---
Yea you're probably right. I've seen a few situations where it was impossible to find the correct answer, but I think it's more the exception. Even if 99% of the people are trying to be funny you can still find the answer most of the time.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d4mtqw/been_seeing_a_lot_of_alliance_warriors_showing/). 
---
Hasta la vista, baby!
---
Nah, I wish you could make it in game. There’s some sensitive people on reddit today. Lol downvoted for a comment that would make a cool piece of art
---
&gt; but not everyone finds their current quest hub being a toxic waste dump fun.
---
You're implying that it has been an issue. It hasn't.
---
Jesus christ youre a tool
---
where specifically did you fish?
---
58
---
Nope not yet, still looking for one that functions similarly to how I remember it being 7 years ago in MoP. Would LOVE for something like that.
---
You are also crowd control as well as dps. You may be asked to ice trap or kite a mob.
---
You lunatic sell sell sell
---
They already exists
---
Neither CS nor Expose Armor deal damage. I haven't tried it myself, but I assume if you angle it right, you won't start AA-ing them and they remain sapped.
---
What you get if you just sell to an NPC.
---
Limited supply items. You'll notice sometimes a vender has an item, but has a number on the tooltip picture. A big one off the top of my head is the pattern for runecloth bags. Bought from a vender for 1g 20s. Resells for 5-10g on the AH.
---
Perfectly valid to have a wrong opinion.
---
Very unique style, I like it
---
That's totally false because you need to spend money on weapon upgrades and food. And if you plan to run dungeons, which you should, you will need to learn spells from both fury and prot.
---
The devs didn't think of it as a race, because no one knew back then that the mounts would disappear and become rare.
---
I am not wrong. Obviously there is a priority system, yes. However, healing the life tapped warlock on ANY given pull should not mean the difference between a wipe and not wiping. If that’s the case for you, you need to re-evaluate how you’re healing.
---
The wholesomest &lt;3
---
This art style like this would easily take half a year for one short. Op could possibly make a fair bit streaming the creation process though.
---
Fair point
---
You also need to buy from skills from the trainer of that faction. In IF for example there's a gnome warrior trainer and a dwarf trainer. If your only honored with IF the gnome trainer sells at full price despite being in IF.
---
Who was the other troll in that game? Remember just sitting down one night and watching all of the clips. He had a weird goblin looking character like this, but a much weirder name.
---
Exactly, wait for a game's first release to fuck up your life.
---
Spamming SM at those levels takes about 2-3 hours per level.
---
Gold is like... No issue.
---
yea a should make another post about a question that was asked 235235 times in last 1 months, it makes more sence.. 
---
/facepalm
---
Ones with orc npc 😉
---
You can delete starter accounts yourself: [https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/10446](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/10446)
---
Removing non-starter accounts (that have/had paid game, expansion and/or game time) is more difficult, you may need to call them or terminate the license in a written letter you need to send to blizz. Literally not worth the effort if you ask me.
---
Side note: previous paid accounts with expired game time are considered "veteran accounts" no starters, even if the limitations are similar.
---
And people wonder if a pvp server is better than a pve server, as exciting as this is to watch doesn't even come close to being there.
---
Awesome vid Thanks!
---
Back in my days there was an addon called BAM
---
Uh, that's what this entire post is for.. Lol. Because I mention I'm great at kiting doesn't mean I'm great with the class, Classic/Vanilla speaking terms. This entire post is literally for asking what I should be doing, so, no.
---
listed
---
I just can't care about that set - the bonuses are so laughable I don't know if the devs were trolling people, or if they were untuned placeholders that never received an adjustment.
---
Turn around and accept your fate with honor.
---
You ask a irrelevant question then get tilted by someone telling you that.
---
Where’s your thrash blade
---
i agree. in my perfect wow there would be no BG's
---
My wife hasn't seen me in 2 weeks.
---
Yeah world pvp doesn't seem to exist at 50+ from my exp. I personally cba ganking someone then having to watch my back and/or get camped. I assume others feel the same haha
---
do they just frost bolt and blink you to death?
---
My server is 2:1 Alliance so definitely not the case.  Thalnos ftw.
---
Dragonmaw represent!
---
We had this yesterday, mage/priest duo looking for ANY instance in the 40 zone... no matter what. We searched for so long and hadnt had any success....
---
SOmetimes its frustrating!
---
That's some Moriarty llvl shieat
---
This i dont get. There just isn't enough time to get rage to actually hold aggro and taunt is on x sec cooldown.  It actually makes sense just being there to tank the boss and round them up
---
I say ban all guns in Warcraft. Infact all weapons. Lets make world of warcraft, world of peacecraft.
---
No? Why would i mean that? I wouldn't mind staying in phase 2 for literally a year because of world pvp
---
I think you should check out Benediction. Always medium/high. Never full. 50-50 split.
---
Grobbulus is RPPVP but the census showed us at 49% Horde, 51% Alliance.  Pretty close.
---
It's pretty hard to say at this point. There is a classic census post with some preliminary data, but it's hard to say how accurate it is. Some of the highest pop PvP servers show a lower overall pop than the medium servers. In a few months I think we will have a better idea, for now it's pretty much a crap shoot.
---
Problem is, I can't think of a scenario where I would want any ability to fire off inconsistently without me having control over it. If this happened 100% of the time and I could rely on it, that would be one thing.
---
Only solution I can think of is to have blank buttons on the non-stealth bar. Have no keybinds shared between the two bars. That seems unreasonable.
---
Training? HA!
---
NO TRAIN! ONLY BUY!!
---
MURCA!!1!
---
It was absolutely a bannable offense to grief players by dropping infernals in low level towns. You can pretend it wasn't, but to those who actually played back then this is common knowledge.
---
You can always just find people to group with in game. If you don't wanna do that, maybe stop playing or at least think about it. A game shouldn't always make you feel depressed.
---
Can someone *please* add in the Loony Toons fall sound effect?
---
I just got on there last night! I didn't see any names that I ran with though, or at least that I recall.
---
I'm glad people are having some luck though!
---
&gt; Also its hilarious how quick you classic troggs will turn on Blizzard as soon as something isn't exactly to your liking
---
Sorry that us “Classic troggs” don’t like paying for an inaccurate product every month, with that mindset I wouldn’t be surprised if you let your wife get fucked by other men.
---
Furtivo/a means pretty much the same as furtive. Sly, sneaky, you get the idea.
---
Its also the term for poachers.
---
Ah, I've been waiting for a real challenge!
---
They come from runescape, the lawless counterpart where anything you scam is yours to keep
---
dont spend money. otherwise play normally.
---
vendoring greys increases in money so much near and at 40 that explicitly grinding for money rather than leveling is counterproductive. which is more important, that you have 90g the moment you ding 40, or getting your mount in the fastest amount of played time?
---
lets go bowling!
---
I said rarer. Usable weapons are seen far less frequently than items to vendor and mobs that drop gold.
---
Objectively speaking dw is far worse for leveling as long as your 2h isn't trash. That said, if ur having fun dw then do it,n who cares.
---
I'm a lv 12 going on lv 13 Tauren Warrior, and just wondering about a few things.
---
\-I took up Leatherworking and Skinning, because while mining ores was profitable, it wasn't really that common to find veins. Is this still a viable profession set up even though I won't be making a use out of the leather materials myself?
---
\-I'm wondering if there's a list of guilds by server, as I'm on Bigglesworth and really want to group of more often.
---
\-I've completely disregarded Heroic Strike because it's just completely awful, what abilities should I focus on instead? I'm going into Arms by the way.
---
This post is just like classicwow... it wasn’t easy to figure out and I had to use my brain and read to understand the joke... but it was satisfying in the end
---
My playing experience is great, played since vanilla and am playing classic work my son now. Already have a rogue to 36 and a shammy to 21. I'd rather have a queue than a deserted server
---
What?! Where?
---
This is an idea that has floated around in my head. But the time investment needed for such a project is pretty massive and I have a job which allows me to pay rent and buy food xD
---
Hahaha yeah okay pal, whatever you say.
---
No. Usually it's a Night Elf.
---
Agreed, we can’t just give up on the world....of Warcraft
---
OH SHIT I just realized I should have named him Dogg.
---
It’s been around since vanilla and has nothing to do with retail. Stop being a baby and just ignore them.
---
Looking at your post history you seem to be one seriously toxic person. I think it's you who should gtfo of classic.
---
I recognize your name, i played on dragonmaw from the end of vanilla through wrath
---
I caught a boar and named it Elon Tusk
---
I remember hearing the 1 key press = 1 action thing back in the day and thinking, doesn’t that include macros? But then that’d defeat the purpose of macros.
---
I'm sure they will merge at some point. Seeing that data I sure am glad I moved from Stalagg to Sulfuras. Got to play the first few days without Queue, but now the populations have evened out and Sulfuras has a much healthier faction balance.
---
You don't think it's excessive he said to make a side project out of ruining this guys online experience? Seems kinda pathetic that you would make it a mission if you're stupid enough to get scammed by trading tons of expensive mats to a random you've never met before.. I'm coming from OSRS so it might be different, but you'd just get laughed at if you posted this.
---
Sweet Home Alabama orc
---
My ex was like that. I could play on a laptop in the same room while she’s messing around on her phone for 8 hours but she’d be mad I was playing. Or we watch Netflix for 8 hours and she’s on her phone half the time but would get mad if I was on my computer playing while we watched.
---
Apologies I'm totally new to wow.  I thought with barely any new content coming in phase 2 you would want more content sooner. Like dungeons and new areas or whatever. 
---
 But I dont even know how PvP works in the game at all so excuse my ignorance. But it sounds like PvP is where it's at when this honour system I hear about comes in. 
---
 I am excited to melt faces though I went shadow priest after reading some guides.
---
No armory?
---
You better hurry, people will run out of things to do soon enough.
---
Farm this one in SM Armory at 35 or buy a Guild Tabard in town for 1g
---
If you want to play it just as it was 15 years ago, then you'll agree that players who do this sort of griefing should be banned, just as they were 15 years ago. And just like the loot trading issue, it makes sense to save GMs the trouble of following down every report.
---

---
Do you have a link for that retail census? I’d love to have a look.
---
I plan to respec at 60 but the problem I'm having is a basically a bug with the spec. My pet won't hold aggro now because he doesn't have enough energy(its not level or taunt, I checked that). I can spec into energy, as a beastmaster... that makes sense. I'm going to have to respec into it, going from a tank pet to a non tank pet to hopefully get more aggro from my non tank pet. 
---
**If anything Blizzard should increase the difficulty on sub optimal specs (due to 'proper/community' optimal specs) to make up for low cost specializations.**
---
I do this daily when looking for tanks for dungeons, and it's more successful AND faster than spamming LFG with every other group also looking for a tank. Never had someone get mad by it, because why would they? Just say no or don't respond.
---
And if you pull multiple mobs, it’s much different. Also, if all you want to do is use offensive abilities, sure. Change it up some, use other spells to help keep it interesting.
---
:)
---
Jesus christ you already got your epic?
---
It's a shared game and everyone is there to have fun. If you're purposefully ruining the experience for other people then you need consequences. Want to just randomly be a dick to people? Play Skyrim. Nobody will be mad.
---
The op put time into gathering the gold/resources to make that gear.
---
The great thing about classic is reputation sticks around. So welcome to classic, don't be a dick.
---
Saw you running SM yesterday... Been grinding this weekend as well. Fucking love this game.
---
Can you fill me in about melee hunter? What do you need to play it
---
Yeah, you can still blink when stunned. You’ve always been able to do that :)
---
Bruh, +1% hit!
---

Can't speak for pvp apart from the fact that it fucks warriors up. In pve the utility feels endless. Has saved my life and the group on hundreds of occasions

While "mature" might be a weird way of putting it, that name is definitely against the terms of service.

I saw more ERP when I rolled a lowbie char on a PVP server circa BC, when my home server was down, than I saw in all my years combined on an RP server.  It's more a product of people being bored than it is an RP thing.

That looks to be just elvui with one of its default profiles for both the action bar and map. It even supports bartender style paging. That being said, bartender4 does work in classic

Nice! Does it remove the stun, or are they still stunned after the blink for the remaining duration?

In early 2005 we were struggling with Onyxia.  Our tank couldn't keep threat.  We looked at all the numbers, and I made the call to have him switch to tanking with his Arcanite Reaper.  We killed her the next try.

How is this so hard for you? Same-faction griefing has always been against the rules. If there's no in-game PvP counterplay, it's griefing. [You can see blue posts about it going all the way back to Kazzak.](http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-general/2375146.htm)
---
Heck yeah!
---
Enchanting is insanely profitable though—if you’re low level, you can often DE items that sell for low/medium amounts and get 1.5-5x the gold amount that they auction for!
---
This is why you might see a warrior tank with a dagger once in a while.

Similar story, friend worked as customer service and hooked me up with his friends and family. When they fired most of their staff he lost his job. Took a bit but eventually they cut off all the accounts on those workers friends and family plans, honestly they should have left with how messed up they handled their CS layoff.
---
I'd be interested in this as well. It seems very spotty though.
---
I love you
---
Aight, imma head out
---
Thanks Dude!
---
I did gorillas  to get my first mount right outside booty bay. Think I also tried dragons near onyxias lair. Then I finished it off by killing gorillas in swamp if sorrows got 2 six demon bags in 15 minutes and was done. Had to Sprint to gadgetzan to post and recover the second drop.
---
Thanks my man. But I'm in the ass end of Florida, near the Keys.
---
I watched this too long waiting for something to walk into frame.
---
I just started on earthfury last night and i love it!
---
Unless you play on Whitemane as alliance, then you’re completely screwed
---
I don’t know what you expected playing on a PVP realm it’s gonna be the same anywhere
---
those are babymode retail icons
---
I don't think you know what layering is. This has absolutely nothing to do with queues. Bu I agree that I'm getting sick of horde thinking it's fun to bring 5 man high levels to keep ganking low level questers.
---
How did you get MoveAnything to work? Do you remember where you downloaded it from? I tried multiple versions but it always gives me an error or startup and I can't use it at all :(
---
Yes, it's silly, thanks for paying attention.
---
Yes I know you want what people wanted in vanilla and got their wishes heard in the form of new talents and dual spec in TBC. Just know that it's not happening anytime soon and you will have to accept the role that your class was pidgeonholed in for quite some time.
---
If everyone posted on reddit their gameplay story every 10 minutes it would be filled with low effort content. Oh wait...
---
Funny you comment this because in my history of world of Warcraft pvp servers  I don’t know if an alliance of equal level has ever initiated a pvp fight with me if they weren’t with 1 or more friends, i was under 75 percent health or I had 2 or 3 mobs I was fighting. Apparently most people are just pussies lol
---
And republicans want you to practice shooting at schools to defend the kids from all the bad hombres, what could EVER go wrong?
---
This is a shitty situation, but have you tried using LFG/World chats to find questing party members? I've run into times where alliance overwhelmed us numbers wise and I started partying up.
---
It's usually easier to avoid getting ganked if you're not running low HP on every mob.
---
&gt; This type of analysis is completely independent of what the actual data set consists of
---
Yes, that's my entire point. You have no idea what the set consists of or any way of knowing. You can't correct for the unknown, so your corrections aren't effective. It's not the same as correcting for sample size, becuase when you do that you at least have a guess at what the greater set contains. Here you're just taking a shot in the dark. To act as if a couple hundred % here or the difference in 20 levels with the average isn't extreme is hilarious. Your scans aren't accurate no matter what analysis techniques you apply because you have no idea what the set contains. You can't correct for the complete unknown. Your scans aren't accurate, or even remotely so, by your own admission. At best you're hundreds of % off which translates to a huge difference in level spread, at worst your data is useless.
---
Loathe my friend that is forcing me to play on this hell hole of a server.
---
Dunno if there's one in classic, but there was once an addon called Altoholic that showed every item your other characters have/you have in bank. Look it up and see if it's got a classic version.
---
They might not be looking for group but they might want to do the dung for fun or the chance they get an upgrade, some people won't reply to your whisper some will, and as I said I've never had an aggresive respond. This might just help you find that last member quite fast compared to spamming trade/general/LFG like all the other groups
---
I’m horde. Why are sometimes alliance players’ names in yellow and other times red? Can I attack them either way (I’m on a pvp server). Also—how come all of their levels show up as skulls? I’m level 16–does that mean they’re all just way higher levels than I am? 
---
Thanks
---
&gt;As a rogue 
---
I hate to tell you this but us tanks actually WANT more rogues. The single target only is a godsend after 10 groups back to back of mages who only know how to AOE the same second you pull. The problem is when I advertise it's always six mages OR the one time a rogue whispers me they're not 'just the bare minimum' but flat out underleveled to the point they'll be doing NOTHING but wiffs and GBs on the second half o fthe dungeon and final boss.
---
Haha, good job, keep on wasting GM time on childish jokes.

there's only going to be bis lists for every *9 level.  look up twink guides for  what items are good and try and get the quest items on its list.  that's about all you should worry about
---
Life a Rogue!
---
Classic is my first WoW experience and I chose undead mage. Does leveling speed up once you hit 20? Currently I’m rotating between rank 2 frost bolt and fireball on my damage but am having a hard time staying alive if I pull more than one mob. Once I get blizzard will I have less of a tough time?
---
Warrior succumbs to venom after a hard fought battle

Hate it all you want. Fishing guild gonna fish, rods in hand.

Mind controlling as many players off of boats as possible. Preferably as late as possible.
---
I'd recommend tarren mill in hillsbrad
---
Wow, really? What was your character back then?
---
Almost!
---
As others have said, join LFG channel and quest while keeping an eye out for groups, or advertise yourself. You can also level professions to try to make some money for your mount while you wait, if you don't have any quests left in zones you want to go to.

Great taste in music

Day after I hit 60. Got my robes of the archmage yesterday too
---
The thought process of only needing a guild for the perks is what truly came from retail.
---
Because teachers are always pulling scissors on students.
---
I only took 2 days off and got most of the way over the 5 day weekend - just had to no life for those days. Finished up by that following weekend just playing a bit after work.
---
100% worth tho. I've seen how the zones are now compared to how they were when I went through and it would probably take someone close to twice as long to do the same thing.
---
I saw admin using fiery giving him that little bit extra on each mob while he spinz
---
You can jump on the windows, i’ve done it maybe 3 times since launch in fear of missing the boat.
---
Hmm I don’t think so
---
Yeah you can just walk through. It's not difficult or new at all.
---
I gave up on Golemagg alliance.
---
I remember when I entered Stonetalon Mountains. Out of the 20odd other players I came across only one was alliance and he was also a ghost. 
---
No point in even trying to level by questing on that server if you play alliance.
---
Wow what a nice guy
---
Check out Executus Gaming on YouTube. He's incredibly good at almost any class/spec.
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwLuoL5IEVKyFM_fS-4ZEzQ/videos
---
He's been doing this kind of commentary for all classes before Classic launched. He's streaming now.
---
Shaman are not quite amazing PVP in all 3 specs....enhance is fun...*when* the WF crits happen. Without those you're basically fodder.
---
I have never played vanilla but I totally support you. Classic players don't want to babysitted. Over the last decade world of Warcraft has evolved to be more and more assisting new players. The result being that retail is the less immersive game I have ever played. Everything tastes false.
---
Great memories are not made by completing a quest in the crossroad. I would have loved to be killed by your infernal when I was questing there.
---
On my server all enchanting mats are dirt cheap. Most items DE for half their vendor value.

I'm thinking more like patch 2.0 and TBC which is where the last several months of Vanilla's development work and class revamping efforts went.

I think there is. I can't remember what it was but I was testing out addons and I remember seeing one that listed out how many of the item I had in my bank and inventory, and I think it even included items I had listed in auction. I can't remember which one it was, though. Maybe TSM?
---
the lvl 10 wearing T3 and the lvl 60 wearing T3 both had to go trough all those raids to have this stuff. They are as accomplished as the other.
---
Hey man, what addon are you using for the scrolling combat text? Or is that just default?
---
I think that ERP can get tangled up in other terms of use regarding chat content and whatnot, but only if you’re one of the griefers that does it super publicly and/or graphically.
---
Yeah but I was level 12 or end of 11 after teldrassil as well
---
Where do I sign up
---
i bet you play on a pvp server
---
Brutal
---
Aww man :( I just got logged in this way and thought it was a bug. I usually play tauren, so didn't know
---
Linking something that is completely irrelevant to the topic at hand does not make you correct, I’m flattered you spent the time to try and find that though, you must really want to be right, too bad you’re not.
---
No player has ever been banned for role-playing their class fantasy in an RPG, no warlock has ever been banned for summoning an infernal on their own factions cities.
---
there’s no spell limit
---
Alliance can actually reply with “autism” which I often do whenever i see that
---
Yes. This obviously.
---
34k vs 21k is not going to be the same on a server thats closer to 50/50.
---
I don't doubt STV is nice, I couldn't stand being ganked and having to contest with 20 other people all the time though.
---
What I've learned so far is, that if you want any chance of holding just the slightest of aggro, you should get the Defiance, and having 1 in improved shield block is a very nice addition, plus I would probably go for Improved Sword Specialization over Improved Hamstring,
---
My server, Bigglesworth, has a queue if you try to log on past 5 PM. But it's never more than 10 minutes.
---
I assume you meant PVE. For dps the PVE spec is Fury.
---
If doing well on damage meters was a very important goal I wouldn't roll a Paladin.
---
luckily the game is filled with an abundance of +shadow dmg :)
---
This is why the forsaken needs to be eradicated by the horde and alliance together. Squash them like ants.
---
Okay, am sitting on the fence about and idea, and I need someone to push me towards an answer.  
---
Right now, I'm leveling my rogue as combat. I know that this is the fastest and most efficient leveling spec. However... I really think I want to switch to Subtlety to do a dagger mainhand ambush build.  
---
My thinking is this: My current ambush does about 180 damage on the mobs I'd like to farm around my level. With the 20% increase in damage from talents, it'd do roughly 215 damage. On a crit, that'd be 430 damage. This would be 70% of a mob's HP at my level, and I'd have a 95% or so crit chance with the talents I'd choose. Also, I'd be able to pickpocket farm SM once I get closer to 40 thanks to the increased stealth and speed. I could also PVP much more effectively as I level.
---
On the flip side, I'd loose the +hit from combat, as well as riposte. Plus Blade Flurry later.  
---
What should I do? Should I spend the gold to respec into sub, or should I stay combat? Has anyone had any experience leveling as an ambush crit sub build?
---
The only thing you missed was that he is a stealth class, so he didn't even know there was danger until it was to late.
---
Idk, because normally you want to send your pet to attack maybe three or four seconds before you do, and take the time to loot or skin or whatever. You can pull out of range mobs to your range with your pet.
---
I play with 1-6 and ctrl, shift, alt modifiers for 24 different abilities accessible.
---
Other than that Ive been using an A D joystick to turn but I do love your m2 usage to turn. I might try that out too
---
This is blowing my mind, what a time to be alive
---
Once you hit 40 grinding gold becomes cake, just run sfk, and rfc 5 times a day and vendor all the trash, then auction all the greens.
---
Tldr, you should decide if you want a dps tank or neutral pet. Ultimately, they all learn growl, the aggro mechanic.  You should buy beast lore when you can. The idea early is you tame one pet you like early ams gradually upgrade as you go shopping, too get new higher rank skills you must tame a higher pet with claw 5 for example, use it until you see you've learned it. Then you can swap back to your main pet. When our if you hit 37, I'd highly recommend getting broken tooth otherwise just go for any wolf
---
Dick lol
---
I've played both horde and alliance it's all the same shit. Only thing is people who are horde tend to want to pvp more. Alliance had more people that don't care for pvp.
---
You need to offer something to the player you want to group with
---
Red = dead.
---
Skull = You're dead.
---
Ah that makes more sense, the guy seemed pretty oblivious
---
Any link available? Im curious if he procced during spin or between spins
---
Every guide tells me to change, but I just can’t let go of my Boar I named Kenneth &lt;3
---
Also ugh. Just seeing the “mines is under attack” logo and non-chalantly just yolo’ing over the ledge expecting someone to be there. And it’s just a rouge sapping your defender and is stealthed. And naturally just ganks your dude while you are watching on the respawn timer.
---
Come to think of it. I had well over 120-150 days played on my OG warrior over the years and expansions....
---
I never hit exalted with the Warsong lol
---
Thanks for the lengthy reply :) - I guess I wont do PP runs until 60 though, might just stick to BRD then.
---
I look forward to it!
---
I did that in Ironforge! Was really fun!
---
communists advocate for an armed proletariat
---
To honest be
---
Huh, maybe I should try to find a more active guild. I guess we look for different things.
---
I want to find a community of familiar people to do stuff together. I used to play WoW with friends back in the day, and now they're all gone... playing alone isn't that fun.
---
If you're playing permadeath on a PvP server all I can say is never try to run any instances in a contested zone or you will die outside.
---
Serves you right. That be Alliancd territory... /spit
---
One pet in the game Broken Tooth? Or fang? something like that still sports higher attack speed then all other pets.
---
He never said he played that ENTIRE time. Even a single day of lapsed account disqualified you for the statue =\\
---
No spell limit. You’ll need the smite as your main shadow spell (Mind Blast) has a reset cool down. 
---
Being a Shadow Priest just means most of your talent points will be spent in the shadow tree as opposed to the other two trees (Disc and Holy) and that as you level you will start to use solely shadow spells to deal damage. You will deal more damage with said shadow spells versus holy spells as you spend talent points in the tree. That doesn’t mean you can’t cast discipline or holy spells.
---
You literally don't need to buy any gear at all from the AH lmao... It's all just a money sink that you'll replace
---
Don’t forget eating the main warrior spell
---
I have missed barrens chat so much
---
Barrens chat on Bigglesworth is pretty much T_D most of the time.
---
Frost Nova is really good for keeping the enemies away from you. I see a lot of mages frost Nova and then blizzard enemies to death, which is efficient if done correctly.
---
Yeah, ruin your life over a video game, that's a great decision that you totally won't regret in a few months after your girlfriend dumps you, you failed your courses, and you can no longer climb a flight of stairs without running out of breath.
---
I meant for the whirlwind weapon options. I agree with what you are saying though!
---
I’m Horde and some alliance helped me kill Cyclonian. They killed me after I looted him but it was great :)

For anyone wondering....TB
---
Who talks to random people running around? People might buff each other, but even in Vanilla people didn't really just talk while running in completely dif directions. As for PvP, you hit the lottery if you're on a PvP server. I can't imagine going 5 minutes without PvP.
---
People interact for quests, to find someone ganking others, for dungeon/raid grouping, to buy and sell things, etc. Just because its a similar community to Vanilla doesn't mean people are going to sit around and just whisper people like it's social media. They want to get things done.
---
Nice. I'll be honeymooning in Spain next spring. Enjoying it so far?
---
Explains a lot in GoT Season 8
---
I’m on the fence about this myself. The one thing still keeping me on Skeram is my guild. We are PvP-focused and will be doing massive guild events with 50+ members in the future. I doubt the horde will organize themselves to counter us unless it’s an opposing guild. 
---
I also have doubts about Earthfury being alliance-heavy. Who is to say that horde won’t also transfer there to avoid the Skeram queues? The majority of PvP servers end up horde-dominated, so this could just be a temporary solution—but I’m not sure. 
---
Also, does anyone know when the deadline is for the free character transfers?
---
How much did you have at 20?
---
you should also get new instant poison ranks but otherwise yeah... income really spikes up the closer you get to 40... i think i got the last 50 gold in the last 4 levels (got it at 41 myself)...
---
This.
---
Red - you're both flagged for PvP
---
Yellow - they are flagged, you are not. They can't attack you unless you hit first.
---
Skull - They're at least 10 (I think) levels higher than you.
---
Vendoring, until higher leathers like Thick or Rugged.  I'm at Heavy now, and its still only a few more silver per stack of 20 to AH, so not worth it.
---
Is this a really bad troll?
---
My bad, in the future I'll only ask questions you approve of, wouldn't wanna hurt your feelings
---
Yeah, it was my first time in there. Absolutely amazing place, I'll definitely be visiting again.
---
Feral and resto are viable, avoid balance like the plague
---
Must have been a term between you and your friends.. played beta to early wod.. this is the first time seeing it..
---
Does she have a WoW subscription?
---
No horde players have time for this casual foolery.
---
If you are in a non contested zone like the barrens you can opt in to PVP (its a lowbie ganking protection) if you you are in Ashenvale red is dead.
---
As for the levels...yes they are all 5 levels higher then you.
---
yeah definitely visit Hillsbrad.  Some really good, easy quests with tons of XP and really good rewards.
---
You see a lower level, but thats all there is to it. It is only visual and does not provide any other effect. The drunk effect from APES is most likely a item like this: https://classicdb.ch/?item=21151 or something similar.
---
This hits too close to home.
---
Horde are the worst

That is precisely where I experienced it. Once I talked about politics only in memes and TwitchEmotes.

Same dude lmao, specifically for WoW

All the paladins in WC3 were hero units though. you're right about druids.
---
I've been doing my part to inject class consciousness into barrens chat but I don't miss it when I leave the zone for sure
---
Mograine looks to be 50/50 and sits just under the biggest realms in terms of queues and such. Everything feels perfect. Have had some fun wars in STV with equal numbers on both sides.

I firmly believe that rich liberals hire people with everything to lose to shoot up schools in order to enrich their political agenda.

---
hahahahaha holy shit
---
The colour depends on you actually. If you are pvp flagged or in a contested zone it’s all red. If you aren’t pvp flagged in Horde territory they are yellow. Yellow players can not attack you, but you can attack them, but in doing so they will all turn red.

Anything with a skull is at least 11

I really wish I had the time to play classic. ;(
---
But it would still be a video game so it will incite violence 😭
---
Did you only put one talent point into holy? If so it's not a big deal at such a low level. 
---
You can reset your talent tree at the priest trainer in any major city. However it's not cheap, and each time you reset your talents it gets more expensive to do next time (up to a certain amount I believe)
---
Also consider that talent spec you had linked is best for pvp - you may want to change it up for leveling (recommend spirit tap for mana regen) and then spec into pvp later.
---
Just to throw another idea out there, you could also as a guild host fishing tournaments. Say you wanted to host a barrens (or whatever zone, it be hilarious to see 40 horse fishing in loch modan) fishing tournament with a prize of 1g. You get a raid together of people who want to participate. (In a raid to make sure everyone is actually in the barrens). It costs 10s to participate. Everyone starts in the crossroads and then goes and fishes and meets back in an hour. You have a "weigh in" where people show what they caught. Set up your own scoring scale depending on the rarity of the fish/items in that zone.
---
I think people just like it’s effect. Tbh unless it’s on an enh shamy, it isn’t that good. Even the whirlwind axe is far better than he ravager. Tbh idt warriors should even roll on it, the whirl wind axe is much better.
---

This video has a quick overview of the gear and play style. It’s a little more recent but the idea is the same.
---
Yeah the awareness is huge .If you are fighting with someone your camera is pointed foward and  rogue stealths somewhere in 20-30 yards or more you would never notice! But addon will tell you and give you advantage
---
Can I switch PCs if I'm fast enough or do I have to queue up again?
---
Damn that sucks. On top of that I want to add. Right before he tried all those he reinstalled windows and deleted his HD partition. I’m positive he still got disconnected after doing those 2 things. Then went on to what I linked and that worked for him. Sucks that doesn’t help. Hope you get it worked out.

The population on the biggest realms are unsustainable and are going to have real issues when Blizzard decide to remove layering.

I don't know HOW they are going to achieve it, but it's either going to be back to insane queues, insane lag or layering will remain. I'm not sure how else blizzard are going to be able to maintain the current population online.

FD+Trap in PvP is a horror atm. It doesn't work, you take time to get up because you KNOW there's a delay to drop combat and you desperately spam the button for one second or so, in the end nothing happens and you end up looking like a retard.
---
Lol this was an awful old post to post a comment too, but okay. 
---
And also, interestingly enough my entire server knows and loves me. Turns out I do top tier DPS and have no threat problems. Threat is easy AF to maintain if you’re not an incredibly terrible tank. Don’t know what you’re even getting at with your comment at this point.

This works great, it makes the mess that is lfg so much easier to use, very well done
---
Dungeon grinding is actually worth a ton of money. I make about 1-3 gold for each run of SM Armory. Each run takes about 20 minutes.  I would say the average is around 5 gold an hour grinding the upper 30 dungeons.
---
ENHANCE
---
The problem is you. Many people have been working together since classic launch. My most recent example: I explored Faldir's Cove last night and was a little underleveled (36) for the quests there, so I died on the escort. While doing my 10 min corpse run, I got a res notification. A 37 priest saw my body and decided to be kind! I thanked the guy and he told me this place was a bitch to get to. We formed a group and played together for over an hour and finished all the quests there. Both of us dinged while at it. After we were done, we both added each other as friends.
---
I’ve leveled a rogue to 60 in original vanilla. Changed specs a lot. Both those builds are extremely viable for leveling. 
---
My recommendation is respec. Gives you a better feel for the class the more you use the different aspects, making you a better rogue in the end. And it’s more fun to try different builds (as long as they are viable)
---
What census?
---
Yep questing in badlands/STV seemed like an 80/20 split and they're hostile as fuck in groups
---
Lol... I'm saving this screenshot for phase 2 when you complain you have an 8k queue on an 6k server cap phase 2.
---
 You realize that right? You realize server caps will be practically halved by phase 2?
---
If I see even one complaint from you (I'm THAT sick of people from highest server pops complaining of deserted servers that dont exist) or others I'm posting this screenshot.
---
I bet this will be banned like every other meme post in this sub.
---
Barrens chat on my server sucks its just LFG spam
---
There are 2 T_D guilds alliance side on Incendius. Luckily they’re small... but boy are they loud.
---
Frost nova and polymorph mean you should never ever die to two mobs as mage
---
Also, I saw someone looking for healer for over an hour. I was 33 but they wanted 35 minimum. My gear was good, and I'm an experienced healer (mana conservation, 5sr, etc) but nah.
---
I had this on my blood elf mage in BC. I miss that guy
---
I too play on Grobbulus it’s balanced and surprisingly a lot of pvp players leave the questers alone.
---
Ok, so this may be a long story. 
---
This started about a week ago and only while playing Classic. Every few hours, when I was on a flight path, or looking at my map, or simply running around, I would get this brown screen with vertical white and green bars and my computer would freeze. It was a mild inconvenience, but I restarted and things were ok. 
---
Then the freezes led to when I got the game back up, things would take really long to load. Like when I opened my character screen, most of it would remain black for like 5 seconds as all my armor icons loaded in. This also happened with the map. After a while, things would get back to normal then eventually freeze again with the brown screen.
---
I figure it's the video card since the freeze is so *video-y* what with the brown screen and white/green lines. So my brother gets me a new card, and everything seems to be working fine until it freezes again. No brown screen this time though, just image freeze and I have to hard reset. 
---
Eventually, I thought, maybe it's a software thing. It's really the only free thing I could try and it had been a very long time since I'd done it (I like to do a full reformat and reinstall of Windows every once in a while to fully remove old programs and installs on my PC that aren't easy to get rid of). 
---
I reinstall, drop in my backup files from my external hard drive, all the while everything is moving really slowly but I chalk it up to the 40 gigs of pictures and movies I'm bringing from the external. I download new video drivers and as I'm going to restart, I get a blue screen of death. Windows 10 blue screen restarts the computer on its own so I wait. As it's supposed to boot up again it gets a new blue screen and restarts. Only this time nothing happens. The screen is black and it beeps 5 times. I go to sleep. 
---
The next day, I Google it and it says 5 beeps is a CMOS battery issue. I learn what that is and change the battery. Nothing. Still 5 beeps. I regoogle and another post says check your CPU. I unseat it to see that the thermal paste has dried up a lot (it's a 5 year old PC). So I run to Best Buy and grab some new paste and canned air to clean the RAM and RAM slots since I also read that could be a problem. 
---
Spent some time cleaning the CPU, putting on new paste, reseating it. Then cleaned the RAM and slots. 
---
Nothing. 
---
Now the computer just doesn't boot. It doesn't beep or do anything. The lights on my case come on, the fans are running, but nothing else happens. Usually after the case comes on there's about a few seconds before my keyboard and mouse come on, then my monitor. But now it never gets that far. The case will just be on and nothing else happens. I've tried both the old and the new card and it's the same thing. 
---
So Idk what to do here. Google results go from check one component to maybe check that other one. I don't have the resources to be buying a power supply or new CPU just to test. I figure I'm just gonna save my money up and build a new PC after Christmas.

no lie tho this actually helped me. in the horde hinterlands village I tried logging out on the innkeeper and was surprised to see it hit me with the 20 sec wait, indicating no rest xp. after remembering this pic, I looked to see if there were any beds and there were little hammock things so I jumped sort of into one and tried logging out, lo and behold I got the instant logout
---
I blocked it
---
MMORPGs suffer from people who think they're better than they are. they could be better at their rotation and gain 10% more dps or they can pretend to minmax everything and gain 3% more dps
---
it's a lot easier to talk the talk and start your own group so someone else has to actually walk the walk
---
that's all this is. every single person minmaxing a random group is one of these types of people. they're not good players but they get bits and pieces from good players when discussing things over their heads and they try to copy it
---
today's gamers are mostly fucking pathetic. they're too lazy to pull their weight but they'll demand everyone else does

Haha, I will spare you the "play whatever you like better!" and cut to the chase.
---
I'd advocate for **warlock**. From 10-60, leveling is *very* easy and *very* engaging. Depending on which talent tree you pursue, you can have a very different leveling and dungeon experience. As you noted, Demonology does not have the best DPS output, especially at lower levels. That's to be expected, as the talent tree is more focused on survivability (which it provides in spades) and pet utility. It's my favorite leveling spec of any class, and provides enough "oh shit" buttons to get you out of many, many jams (similar to paladins). Furthermore, there's almost no downtime - you just go from mob to mob to mob without ever really stopping. Affliction is also a great leveling spec, as it maximizes the effectiveness of your DoTs, which you can pepper on mobs while your Voidwalker tanks 3+ folks at once. This is another spec with very minimal downtime. Siphon Life drains enemy health, and spirit tap regenerates your mana. It's an amazing loop that means you can consistently keep grinding. Destruction is awesome for PvP and end-game raiding, but I don't think I'd recommend it as a leveling spec - simply because it's a little mana-intensive.

Running into an endless train of douchebag mages who think that "cleaving" a dungeon means joining a traditional dungeon group, dropping all of their AoE in the first 3 seconds of a fight while I am trying to get threat established.
---
Then when I switch to DPS to join the cleave fun (while wildly outpacing the losers in DPS), getting themselves killed repeatedly because they can't kite for shit.
---
when can my void start tanking 3 mobs, he dies at 2
---
Boars are great and that charge is so satisfying.
---
As mentioned, that's already been done xD
---
To be more specific, the data I gathered in testing showed an issue going on with the et-0-0-2 issue on blizzard's peering networks.
---
This isn't related to the DDoS attacks, the post launch load, bad addons, problems with local computers etc.
---
A local component of it became a thing as part of a hotfix which the client keeps attempting to download causing a total logout back to the login screen but that is a compounding of the issue ontop of the issue on Blizzard's side
---
Sadly there is just not enough alliance players imho. Anyway thats not a solution to only play in 5 man groups or we are staying corpse camped for 10 min every hour by some bored retard. But i tried it to level in group but even a 2 man group is just not enough we just get zerget most of the time.
---
With a good tank a hunter can free fire multishot all day long and f you're running with a MM Hunter and you're not allowing them to do that then you're slowing the group down.
---
I'm a MM Hunter and I out DPS 99% of all classes in dungeons. The only time I don't out DPS is when the tank can't hold agro.
---
Stings can only be on 1 target at w time.
---
&amp; If hunter pets are agroing mobs then you need to pull back more.
---
Honestly this sounds like an experience from having a unskilled tank in your group.
---
&gt; I also have doubts about Earthfury being alliance-heavy. Who is to say that horde won’t also transfer there to avoid the Skeram queues?
---
It's something that tends to happen with free transfers. The underdog faction is more likely to move, since it gets them away from both the queues and the population imbalance. Earthfury won't necessarily be Alliance-heavy, but the imbalance on Skeram is only going to get worse.
---
Rogues lose all their cp if they switch targets which makes them pretty hesitant to throw out random kicks or kill totems. Obviously still worth it sometimes to stop a big heal or something but that’s why they don’t run around racking up interrupts.
---
I did not say money did I
---
All priests get the same base spells. The difference, in abilities, between priests are the ones obtained in the talent trees. 
---
Your goal, as a ‘shadow priest’ is getting to the bottom of the shadow tree to get shadow form.
---
One way starts in loch modan.
---
Ah lol. My bad.
---
Auto attack gang rise up
---
Yeah sadly I have to give up my lvl43 warr too I guess.
---
You knew what quests you were taking.
---
Whats the best way to make money from it?
---
It's probably why I have nicer things then you irl.
---
It was supposed to work like clockwork on old Vanilla too, then as OP says there might always be ping involved. Anyway, no matter how you look at it, in actual Vanilla it was way better than now on Classic ; source  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGli2EPbK-A&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGli2EPbK-A&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=41)
---
Oh yes, that charge 😍 I’ve been wanting to upgrade it, but I haven’t run into any more boars so I’m still working with lvl 1 charge
---
I am currently considering something similar. With remorseless and the ambush talent you hit 70%. I'm level 35 and only have 9% crit without anything from assassination. 
---
The issue you have here is consistency. Everytime you don't get a crit it's going to be hell to kill a mob. 
---
My feeling is that you'd go for an ambush, sinister strike, holster energy and kidney shot followed by two backstabs. If your ks is parried it's gonna be hell to finish that mob.
---
In short you end up depending on chance and some key abilities hitting. You also can no longer take on more than one mob at a time efficiently. 
---
If you can guarantee gear i.e. good daggers it could be really fun and you'll feel more rogue like for sure. If it were me I'd wait until 40 and try it out with the blue dagger from the Alli sm quest reward.
---
not gonna lie had me in the first half
---
I also did group on my main to do quests, but it was just
---
\-Hey, your on "Quest name" 
---
\-Yep
---
\-Ok
---
15 minutes later
---
\-Have you finished ?
---
\-Ok cya
---
Everytime .
---
The word irrelevant and approve are not the same word.
---
Try again.
---
One time chilling around waiting for a friend to log on, I logged onto my retail account to do some stuff there while waiting. Didn't realize it would log me off, but luckily I didn't have to sit through the 30 minute queue again. 
---
Guessing you could do something similar, just log on on your other computer before logging off.
---
kind of neat how almost all of the abandoned ruins in the game are either elven or troll, and then you occasionally find a book talking about the ancient elven/troll empires
---
Relatable stuff. Shamans have the shortest CD interrupt - 6s. Seems irrelevant to you personally given the list, just a minor addendum.
---
Also, for Mages: 
---
Just because you saw some streamer omgwtfpwnAoE groups of mobs in SM does not mean it's applicable every pull, or with just any group or comp, or that it necessarily is possible with YOU personally.
---
Boar
---
Hunter has been a lot of fun - I feel like I'm playing two characters at once - I can pull two mobs and tank them with my pet while my hunter aoe with multi shot.  
---
Questing is fast because of cheetah aspect and I'm able to handle most high levels ganking me if they do it alone (they generally don't but oh well).  
---
Plus unlike mage or ret pally I have multiple skills to use between serpent sting, arcane shot, multishot and my pets claw (I don't keep it on autocast because it burns too much focus) and kiting is a ton of fun because of auto shot requiring .5s of standing still to fire instead of being brainless like in retail.  
---
I feel badly for those without tools to use to make leveling fun but if you ever feel burned out on your class just roll a hunter.
---
How do dungeons work in classic? Can I run the same dungeon multiple times in one day, and still recieve exp and loot?
---
Fantastic, thank you!
---
They're not  in yet, coming with a later phase.
---
I'll try it, thanks.
---
Thats awesome, can you confirm this from some where?
---
Well done! I'm proud of you buddy :)
---
Yeah thats exactly what Im checking out right now! I heard it was "claimed" by the brits so there shouldnt be any language problem either. Ashbringer is the other realm Im looking at.
---
So... Is your girlfriend single? Asking for a friend.
---
Indeed.
---
You didn’t point things out, you were patronizing about mistakes people are making.
---
Might run into a lot of alliance here though
---
And isn't the norm, so don't base your consensus on such a small sample size
---
Yup, great addon.
---
Sadly no.
---
Me too man. Me too.
---
She needs an active sub.
---
That is in no way shape or form relevant to OPs question.
---
Alliance or horde? I’d say do a Gnomeregan run either way. Good quest reward for finishing and a lot of quests
---
You can easily tank everything up to Mara with just heroic strike and taunt.
---
If the mob saw you or you looted a chest or something then it's normal, try using sap from behind and see if puts you in combat.
---
It really does seem hated now.
---
I really can't give a shit about your ability to grief lowbies.
---
And then it fails and you die anyways
---
How much later and how much more? Time value of money is huge in this game. 3g now is way more valuable than 10g in a couple months, for example
---
Can you fish in Burning Steppes? Cast lands in the lava, I haven't gotten any loot, but my fishing skill increases and every cast opens the loot tab as if something would be there.
---
Other invuln states cause this as well?
---
Right! Playing on Alliance side which I mentioned paladins in the original post.
---
AH HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA
---
How is it? Seems it would be very tough to play that way
---

---
Yes, the snowball effect will be real, especially when word bosses are a thing. 
---
Also, when they remove layering completely, the ratio will go from 3:1 to 12:4. It’s the same proportionally, but the greater numerical difference is what will suck as Alliance.
---
Skeram will be 80% horde before the year is over.
---
Yeah Im waiting for my friends response about what server they want to play on. But I hope those servers will stay like that unlike golemagg. Golemagg was a pretty balanced server a few days ago.
---
Actually true though.
---
My mistakes, but remastered.
---
Bit ironic isn't it?
---
What do you think those school shooters are doing? Duh..
---
Oh fuck you're dating a horse girl oh gosh oh geez
---
I mean it's very niche and like very 80s. Like Hydrogen of course, but also guys like Daniel Deluxe who is my absolute favorite, and Dance with the Dead, Nightstop, Perturbator, Carpenter Brut and The Midnight. I highly recommend The Midnight.
---
just make sure you tell them you're new to tanking
---
i went into uldaman saying "i can heal and probably tank" thinking that it would explain how bad i might be
---
we wipe twice at last boss, one dude is raging at me for not being able to hold aggro on the adds, i say it's only my first time tanking since classic, and the dude ragequits
---
Level 60 druid and im 37
---
FACE
---
Well, if we're going down this road, then I suggest we remove rogue stealth since it lets players gank while other players are in combat.  
---
And we might as well remove hunter pets, since they could get the bomb debuff from lucifron and blow up the auction house. Actually, let's remove feign death too, since they can pull then wipe the raid.
---
You can’t raid, dungeon or pvp but simple questing or farming is easily doable.
---
Lol that would be a pretty cool feature if blizzard ever decided to intergrade it
---
How can i do such a witchraft?
---
This sounds like a good answer. Thank you for giving me the idea and yes i should do alchemy over skinning later on the game. As for now would it be a good idea to just gather and sell the stuff?
---
OP is definitely going on my blacklist. Elitism af.
---
You said you had a ret healing. I mean, you probably should have been wearing a shield for him.
---
It's kind of unpleasant to get advice from someone for whole working out is a lifestyle. Obviously they have a ton of knowledge and and it's good to learn, just seems it's kind a different vibe when working out isn't just means to an end for someone, it's the goal itself or possibly part of a larger scheme for everlasting life with a hot bod. It's a bit much if you're just looking to be marginally less shitty.
---
Steam link app
---
We need a anime narrator add on for quests
---
The fastest way to find a healer would be for this guy to do a /who priest (or druid/shaman/pally) 36-39 and start sending polite whispers if they are interested in healing SM.  It takes a little more effort than mashing a macro but I've had way more success with this method than spamming lookingforgroup or trade chat.
---
If you can actually get 600g for them (e.g. that listing you see isn't being reposted every day) then you should sell. That's a good price and a huge chunk of epic mount.
---
Guild Master Baits
---
I also had my first bad experience today, but it was followed by a nice experience!
---
I was trying to sell a Burning War Axe in /2, someone whispered me and wanted to buy it. 
---
I open a trade window- he puts up the gold, i put up the axe and press trade before realizing he had removed the gold. He immediatly logs off and blocks me. 
---
However, i whispered the highest leveled person in his guild, who just happend to be the guildmaster, he confronted him and he got kicked out shortly after, and the gm told me he was gonna repay me the lost gold. I also made a ticket and got screenshots, so with a bit of luck i'll get my axe back and can pay back the nice guild leader. It was only 5 g, but thats alot for me as im currently level 37 and trying to save up for the mount.
---
Planet Fitness member here.  They don't actually set off the alarm unless someone is being a huge huge douche and disrupting the gym.
---
Guys are walking around with tank tops and yelling amd grunting.  No one cares.
---
I only saw it go off once when about 8 guys in Golds Gtm shirts came in and took up all the smith machines and sat around on their phones yelling at girls.  Pretty sure they were just there to troll though.
---
amazing you got a bag, let's make a post about it.
---
Unrecoverable mistake
---
I base my opinion on what i see, is it strange?
---
I mean yeah. I ran around attacking things in holy spec with holy shock. Describe shockadin better than that
---
Oh I see. The spell you learn from the trainer are basic priest spells - all priests get them and can use them. I bought all spells up to about level 15, after that (from the holy tree) I've only been buying the healing spells (I stopped buying smite/holy fire as the next rank gets expensive).
---
Just a friendly note for you, when you buy the next rank spell you need to put it into your action bar from your spell book. Buying the spell doesn't automatically rank it up on your hotkey.
---
Ah i see. I might consider doing alchemist over skinning later on in the game
---
Yeah I think Hotline Miami is largely responsible for helping this genre grow so exponentially. And I love it for it.
---
*wowhead
---
Took me a second to understand what is going on here lol. Though you were massive for a second.
---
Axe is the best regardless of race.
---
I might try steam link on TV with a controller... phone sounds terrible.
---
My rogue is just 19 but I think stealth is a little wonky right now. I've been able to enter stealth right after a mob aggroes on me which shouldnt be possible but they still attack.
---
That Mason’s Fraternity Ring tho.
---
I'm pretty sure you can only summon an infernal outside, making them useless in raids. It's already effectively a useless skill.
---
People don't understand this. I'm always farming mobs that are 2-3 levels below me until my bags are full then either move on or go to a new area if it gets too crowded. Every place I go, I see people that are 2-3 levels BELOW the mob level going there to complete a quest and then leaving. I'm sure those are the people that are wondering why they don't have gold or why they are leveling slowly. If you find a good farming spot, you can spend 2-3 levels just grinding those mobs and making bank while doing it, all while leveling faster than questing or dungeons.
---
Yes. And you can check some tanking guides. This should give you an idea what to do and what to expect in group.
---
It’s not the greatest but it gets the casual job done if you’ve got a phone with some screen real estate.
---
Is there a list or something of white drops I shouldn't vendor but sell on the ah?
---
Chaplain heals in Scarlet Lib or Diviviner's mana burn. Trogg heals in Uldaman, Healing wave in ZF I can think of many times where I thought: Huh, weird that he isn't interrupting.
---
Tanks seem to be really rare in classic as basically only one class can do it and everyone of that class wants to play dps
---
so yes, and if anyone gives you shit they face up to an hour searching for a replacement if you leave so you hold all the cards
---
You can’t use MC on boats anymore.
---
Just for this comment, I'm going to camp Redridge and Duskwood for a few hours today and murder every quest giver I see.
---
warlock is literraly spam shadowbolt, mage is literally spam frostbolt, warrior is literally spam bloodthirst / whirlwind... imo rogues are pretty complex as far as vanilla goes...
---
Didn’t they expand the amount of people to make it into a realm by increasing the amount of layers?
---
To be honest I don’t get where realm limits and layering meet. But my understanding was they have layering so more people can play WoW Classic during the initial rush, but take away the layers as the hype dies down.
---
Is there any counter to priest fear? only class I have a hard time ganking as a rogue cus they just instant fear and dot. Do Free action potions work are there any fear breaking trinkets?
---
Hey, having to deal with that shit a tiny bit in WoW is nothing compared to having to hear the other side freaking out literally anytime you turn on a TV or radio.
---
Yeah rogue stealth hunter pets and priest mind control have zero beneficial mechanics to out weigh it. Try some reading comprehension first.

Hunter: 
---
-Out DPSing every other class in dungeons 99% of the time.
---
-Taming unique pets instead of failed and inaccurate popular opinion suggestion pets commonly found on forums.
---
-Absolutely destroying people in PvP. Watching the enemy run very far out of my way.
---
-Always surviving when the rest of the group wipes.
---
-Cleverly using traps in dungeons.
---
-Out dpsing Mages in mage-cleave groups lol.
---
-Out dpsing ravagers in melee-cleve groups.
---
-Not caring at all about getting a mount 40 and instead spending my money on awesome gear to further my DPS reign.
---
-Pretty much soloing anything that I want if I don't feel like grouping.
---
-Being able to always see the full Battlefield so that I can make tactical decisions that will dictate the outcome of the battle.
---
-The best part even though I'm a marksman Hunter, the best part is having an awesome pet that nobody else has. 
---
The end
---
Oh yeah it's not great to rage-starve the poor warrior. Thats a really bad move.
---
Cmon man, you’re seriously going to link a gamespot forum post as fact for a blue post? You’re playing the role of a redditor in denial stereotype perfectly.
---
You don’t need to do a google search for me anymore because I’m done replying to you, there has never been another player that has been banned for putting Doomguards/infernals on other players and no amount of covering your ears and yelling will change that :).
---
Have a good day.
---
Oh hi me, it's you again.
---
Wait, what WSG weapons?
---
Ashbringer is 50/50
---
This i don't understand.. If it's a player playing a class that i know I'd give em tips, not ragequit. Shit happens and people try new things, but ragequiting instead of seeing what is wrong and how to improve it..
---
:o Snoutius looks just like my pet Peppa

Ah you’re one of those. Everyone I know used to block the fellows who thought it was fun to release infernals in PvP.
---
The real ghetto Thunderfury is the [Masterwork Stormhammer](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12794/masterwork-stormhammer#comments).
---
Best leveling experience? Not really... Vanilla-Cata were all better leveling experiences, MoP was a slog but had a better story and introduced more interesting content and Legion was the previous two expansions fully realized. 
---
WoD was a slog and only good for the innovative raid mechanics, which took forever to release. Everything else was cool concept, bad execution. I mean their core concept was pretty much "play watered down Clash of Clans while you grind dailies!" when it could have been "build your own base from the ground up!"
---
Hej
---
I'd definitely go hunt bounties if this was a thing
---
Fair enough, so what offhand would you use with krol?
---
There's no cap on the number of spells. If your running out of slots on the UI go into options and enable the extra bars. There bars above the default and two on the right side.
---
Only pet worth buying is the cockroach.
---

---
Bro. Responsibilities... relationships... outdoors? All I know is Azeroth.
---
You dont seem to keen on wanting to engage with others, other than saying 1 or 2 things and giving up if no one replies. Even in real life that kind of talk would be ignored, so yeah, problem is you.
---
If this ain't the perfect personification of the cat on the pole saying I see no god up here other than me, I don't know what is
---
Boar is best pet imo
---
Imo it's just the people who follow what they see. They saw streamers and people running aoe groups, so then it was the only thing they wanted to do. Even if they wipe constantly, they won't swap to regular dungeon running.
---
 They see Ravager being popular because it's good, and now all of a sudden you MUST have Ravager. They are completely missing the fact that the top players had good gear as well with Ravager.
---
They are terrified of not doing what everyone else is doing.
---
Yep. I leveled a Druid from day one to level 35 and safety some thought about end game have started playing a Priest... I'm leveling with my husband so now his chosen main class is mothballed while we level together on my NEW main and his alt until we hit 35 and can do a little switcheroo... 
---
I just don't think a Druid is as useful/invite-able in endgame but I want to play a support class. 
---
I didn't have a Druid in Vanilla but I like the class so I chose it initially just to have fun, but already being behind the curve is a little rougher in some areas and smoother in others. It's a weird mix. 
---
I feel like we're missing out on certain things by not continuing our day one classes at the average pace. Oh well!
---
Level 38 warrior with 87g in the pocket. Got mine fishing deviate fishes. Couldn't really do instances cause of work this week and questing got boring so it was a nice break at times. Also mining and skinning come a long way
---
How effectively were you able to farm mobs leveling as holy? I’m thinking of making the switch. Just hit 40 but have about 53 gold.
---
Gotta put your one-eyed snake to good use baitin’
---
Maybe the GM's should stop wasting their own time?
---
That's always the way that wow has always been. 
---
That's why people who played EverQuest didn't play wow. EQ was all about community, teamwork, and perfect collaboration. You couldn't level without that in EQ.
---
When wow came out it was basically a huge massive multiplayer online role-playing single player game. Unless you're raiding or doing dungeons. Which is why, I only run Dungeons because I like grouping with people, and gaming with people.
---
Different Strokes for different folks but for me playing an MMORPG and soloing in your way through the game just isn't Fun. It's especially not fun when somebody groups with you to kill 10 things and then they leave without saying goodbye...
---
So I just run dungeons. Even if that means running the same dungeon, literally eighty times. 
---
I do not enjoy the fetch questing aspect of this game or any game that has copied this formula since wow was released which is basically every game. I do not enjoy the running simulator that questing is. I do not enjoy grouping for 4 minutes and then some dude just leaves. I do not enjoy run here talk to this person, run back talk to that person, run back out to me.
---
The only way I have fun in this game is the first 10 to 20 times that I play a new dungeon and 100% of the time when I PvP.
---
I recommend dungeon crawling.
---
It's not an opinion when it's a fact that flying mounts and dungeon finder ruined the game.
---
Hey man, if you're horde on kromcrush and you get your mats back, ill make a wolfshead for you
---
So to answer both your questions there is! I think world logs is actually tracking it? I heard someone chatting about it in guild. I'll ask again tonight. 
---
I'm pretty sure it's world logs cuz you can log in classic too. 
---
I think it'll only record if it's a majority guild kill -- this was a collaborative pug so It won't give either of us the credit from a guild perspective. 
---
Maybe this week we can achieve that :)

Ashbringer is pretty much the same tbh
---
Now that's the first comment you've made that's actually well put - good for you. If you find someone doing these activities, and misusing the tools provided them to them by purposely attacking those who can't defend themselves, the community should be responsible for counteracting this behavior - not Blizzard. You're finally understanding what an RPG is!
---
I whisper ppl and I get responses.... I think you guys are just stuck the fuck up lol

Not really effective. Ide just say group up with people for quests and just wand away, and keep them toped up ofc

Warlocks - please stop banishing things unless it’s literally to save a wipe. Some warlocks seem to enjoy banishing anything they can even though it nearly always just makes every pull much slower.

I've been making 10 slot silk bags and handing them out for 2-3 days.
---
  It was nice at first but now I realized my stash of silk and heavy leather are all gone and I hadn't made bags for my alts yet lol.
---
I also saw someone put all 4 bags I gave him up on the AH.  I was tempted to buy them back.  It was then I also realized with 4 bags I'm giving away over a gold.
---
Who can I whisper for an invite to the guild?

Or ya know, when I logged in there were only 8 full servers to chose from. Your elitist attitude makes you a shitty person.  Bigglesworth for ever.

That's cringe bro yikes
---
I really try to avoid killing grey level players, it's kinda boring. Sometimes they gotta be little shits though and then they gotta die.
---
Uh huh, we're sheep because we don't think the government went out and paid people "with nothing to lose" to go out and shoot people. Have you ever thought about the fact that you can't get paid by the government for shooting up a school if you die in the aftermath of the shooting? God, you people are so stupid, you can't even put two and two together. Next you'll tell me the government found a way to bring the shooter back so they get the money. Moron.

😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
I still have questions...
---
As Alliance:
---
1. STV first nesinwary quests and the northern camp until quests turn red / orange
---
2. Hillsbrad foothills southshore quests
---
3. Desolace doing the first part (mostly northern quests)
---
4. Arathi highlands most of the quests bar the high level ones in stromgarde / sunken ships cove
---
5. Shimmering flats all quests (You should easily take 1 level atleast here from all the grinding)
---
6. STV continuation on trolls,  tiger raptor panther mastery part 2, venture co, etc 
---
7. Desolace SM questline (lvl 34 minimum) + kodo graveyard + Centaur grinding questline till you have to kill a boss which you should come back for later. Best to do this around LVL 36-37
---
8. Arathi highlands high level quests you skipped earlier LVL 37-38+
---
9. Dustwallow marsh all quests you can do LVL 38+
---
10. STV LVL 38-39+
---
Anyone know an addon that shows party hp and mana in numeric form? I like the blizzard UI look, but I find it hard to view mana. I turned on my own health/mana bars as numeric but I can't figure out how to do that for party members.
---
I have created all my other characters and they are all bank alts.
---
Water is for the weak!
---
They said they're gonna lower the number of layers gradually until P2, not just all at once, so I'd expect queues to get increase over that time as well, so people will slowly transfer
---
Roll on a PvE realm? You're inventing a problem here
---
Not if you’re a raider you don’t.

Planning our which class I play as an alt, and I’d like to know: does Druid powershifting work in classic? If so, does Wolfshead helm work with Furor as well?
---
Just out of interest why do you do this? I'm new to playing on PvP servers and just last night I entered contested territory with enemy players for the first time. I was level 24 and the first couple of times I saw an enemy player they were level 21. I wondered whether I should attack, then realised it wouldn't really be sporting, and there was actually absolutely no reason to do so - I just interrupt their levelling and I get nothing for it (there is no honor system etc yet).
---
But then not half n hour later in quick succession I got 'KOS' twice by different players level 29 (so can't compete). 
---
Made me wonder if people are going to be like that, well maybe next time I should kill as well, even though it's completely unsporting and there is no purpose to it anyway. So what's your reason for doing it?
---
Ignorance is bliss. The narrow minded will always stay ignorant.
---
Lol mad
---
Also that build is great at 60, but not while leveling. Get wandspec and spirit tap first.
---
Pretty sure there's a master baiter npc in retail too.
---
You’re only saying it is because you believe everything you read on the internet.
---
Depends on the source, really. In most fantasy universes/games the only differences between drakes and dragons are the size and intelligence.
---
wtf is wrong with you
---
This was sent to me by phone, I don’t blame him for not wanting to take the extra steps to get a screenshot sent over.
---
Nice job insulting yourself.
---
&gt;Anything that believe in the Light
---
So when there's a Holy priest in your group you stop everything you're doing and RP to be attacking them as you don't actually attack them?
---
Interesting head canon though.
---
BC minus dungeon finder and flying mounts would be the dream classic+
---
U cant swing back when u Get stunned by charge
---
Namechange in 3..2..1..   
---
Seriously, I’m pretty sure a guild on Herod called “nonconsensual” got renamed.
---
Yep, haven't even seen cleave group mentioned.
---
Titan panel is the best! I’ve used it since vanilla!
---
I love your art style. You can literally make a comic book or an illustration book and it will be amazing.
---
LOL you are not out dpsing a mage in a dungeon
---
okay thanks
---
I love you both
---
thanks
---
I’m pretty sure I got it via twitch. Really nice addon!
---
Oof, what is this middle school? I assume you were born blind.
---
Is powershifting a way of saying macro’d instant shifts between forms? because if so, yes.
---
Had a hunter in SM cath i made 500-600dps on aoe he had 130dps so i dont know how they outdps anyone
---
I have no kids and no excuse other than im too lazy to even sit up in a computer chair.  Do what you gotta do
---
Ele tho 😏
---
I could have suger coated it that's true. If it makes you feel better I do it in a much kinder manner ingame.  
---
Now stating the facts like *- Did you know rogues have kick?* would have made some folks less emotional I guess.
---
It seems that the first paladins were priests that picked arms, but I think the most likely scenario is a mix of both
---
No he shouldnt. Its great for Rogue.
---
Nice bit of advertisement there
---
Aww we have similar names. I used to be "Healingdead" on my undead priest. Respect.
---
After like 2 mobs that are my lvl after 3-5 of green mobs
---
I will also be looking for this! This sounds so fun!
---
That Tauren is looking badass
---
Not a warlock and don't plan to be one. Will submit a bug report as soon as I log on.
---
Then stop DEing your items. Sell them to a vendor and buy twice the amount of mats to level up your profession. Once you get to the endgame enchants you can charge multiple-gold tips, and get work just from advertising in trade chat.
---
Tailoring is the same. Sure you can sink tons of gold into it, but people want tons of bags. In the end, it all depends on how much effort you are willing to put into advertising your profession.
---
If you want to make a lot of gold, but want little player interaction, then just take two gathering skills instead. Go farm any human mobs 2-3 levels lower than you, or animals if you take skinning. In some out-of-the-way place that is too inefficient for questing people to show up.

A lvl 5 bank alt can disenchant any lvl gear
---
Is the community on Bigglesworth noticeably different from the other servers, or is it  pretty much the same case on all of them?
---
I wiped the same group twice in RFK doing this.  Second time I was sure I was targetting him.
---
Only time I've gotten bad Yelp reviews for my healing ability.
---
It also happened to me when a lone warrior was running from a pack of Yeti.  Decided to save him and he saw me casting and ran my direction.. the last thing he saw before death was me healing myself.  Obviously had him targetted since I could see his health was low.  I somehow managed to detarget before casting.
---
Hello. Im leveling my druid and going through the feral trait like but am unsure which option would be best. I want to bear tank dungeons, and stealth cat in world pvp. I was thinking of putting 2 points in brutal impact for pvp but I can’t decide if the other 3 points would be better in thick hide or feral aggression? Can anyone provide any insight as to how those traits work out at cap? Thanks!
---
but i have a lvl 60 with full prebis lmao.
---
My two rogue guildies send me every water they pick up anyways... Thank you!!
---
Sounds like an 18+ kinda thing.
---
35-45, iirc.
---
Well, Lakeshire, Wetlands, and Duskwood take me to 32\~33. After that I go Hillsbrad, Arathi, Alterac, and Desolace  to about 36. At that point, I grind beasts until 40 (skinning pays for my mount). I usually don't go to STV until 37\~38, by that time, no one is really interested in PvP'ing me. They're all there for the same thing, skinning for mounts. We resume the war once we're out of that nightmare, lol
---
how do you know?
---
XD, it is a great game. A lot of famous people admit to playing and some infamous people like David Duke use WoW music in their videos. Surprised Blizzard did not content flag David Duke.
---
Cool to think of Ben Shapiro being a fan
---
Thanks! I’ll give it a try !
---
A marathon is also a race
---
Honestly the difference is mostly that you actively get to cast things. Rogues have a ton of downtime due to energy. 
---
Not saying any class has it worse than any other, but not being able to press buttons get to be a bit boring.
---
And then some prick sneaks up and steals your node while you're putting Yogi in a grave.
---
Sometimes I just redo an alt just to go through the Barren's shenanigans again...
---
the crossroads is far to bust making chuck Norris jokes
---
Just installed the "luna unit frames" addon and i think it looks really nice.  However one thing I hate about it is the cast bar being in the top left underneath your health and mana.  Anyone know if there is a way to get the vanilla cast bar back?
---
How does pvp work? Why can't I attack some horde players with purple names, and can attack some who has red names?
---
Not true
---
agi also gives crit so it's not that simple.
---
If you have to say that I highly doubt it Mr. Value
---
Yea I had a 12 hunter rerolled to a priest
---
The undead mount
---
Idk how much silk sells for on your server but it sells for 50-65s a stack you get like 3 stacks a run thats 1.5g right there not counting the actual money you get from drops. And when you vendor all the useless stuff and AH all the greens. Yea its really good money.
---
Is that the best you can do? War doesn't mean attacking indiscriminately.
---
What does it mean when it on an item says "increase heal and spell effects by *up" to* a certain number? Is it rng it is has its full effect, or how does it work?
---
no shit, im writing platitudes from the comfort of my chair anonymously on the internet, who knows how I will react in a stressful situation. But I can tell you how I'd act if able to act entirely rationally.
---
Isn't agi also crit?
---
Ran Uldaman together shortly after!
---
Or just make it so all classes can fill all roles.
---
Man. My experience was so different. I started as a tauren druid on a new server and found mulgore to be the worst starting area of any race.
---
* Everything is spread way out like crazy, and the distribution of mobs is basically random. Low drop rates and weird distribution made for a pretty frustrating time in the 8-10 level range
---
* Nearly every quest requires 2-4 quest items that you have to carry back to town. These quest items displace the junk items that are critical to making some starting funds, especially since 95% of the enemies in the zone are beasts that don't drop cash. This is compounded by the next 2 points -
---
* No cloth wearing tauren classes, meaning it's extremely unlikely to find a tailor to make bags out of your linen without running all the way to the crossroads
---
* Thunder bluff is the only capital city where you cannot buy an herb bag from the herbalism supplier! This was such a wtf moment for me. If you want to start out as an herbalist you have to find space in your already cramped pack.
---
I'd have fucked off to durotar WAY sooner if I wasn't dependent on being within reach of a druid trainer.
---
I, for one, would love to see some Classic WoW costumes in Overwatch this Halloween.
---
I am level 50 and I still see warriors with this set.
---
Paladin does well in pvp, ret or holy.
---
Ret can do well in pvp because you still have much of your strongest toolkits, stuff like cleanse, blessing of freedom etc.
---
Ret can prove to be pretty damn great when paired with another dps, which the paladin is also helping to enable with their supporting abilities, like a warrior or rogue
---
Once every like 5 minutes or so, when grouped, I will get a message (target too far away--or whatever that message says).  However, I'm not casting anything or tapping any keys.
---
Any idea what's happening?
---
I thought maybe it was an addon so I disabled them all and it still happens.
---
Here are the rankings https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1000#boss=672
---
I thought boars were best for leveling since they eat anything.
---
True, silk sells for a little over vendor on my server, so I guess that would be make a huge difference
---
your op suggests it is Irans fault for "trying to nuke Israel".
---
I feel like a lot of people do it because it's fun, and it creates content. People choose to play on a pvp server so giving them pvp, and giving them a reason to ask for help from allies, hop on alts and coordinate a response is fun.
---
Sounds like you prefer retail, go play retail.
---
Ahh okay yea like half of my money is silk probly
---
That's pretty impressive. If you dont mind me asking, what is your end goal for doing this? Genuinely curious as I've never multi boxed before and never really had an urge to do so .
---
Unless you're playing on a pvp server, players have to enable pvp mode under the right click options on their nameplate. You can only attack players flagged for pvp like thisand doing so or aiding friendly players tagged for pvp will also tag you for pvp.
---
I just wish blizzard would put in healing numbers over characters I heal just like damage numbers. I know #nochanges and all but I think this is reasonable
---
When you start leveling you realise just how important bags are. I'm constantly having to run back to a vendor. I'd rather get a big upgrade to my bags than a small upgrade to my gear.
---
Please go back to retail.
---
Emperor's New Groove Reference? Now this I can get behind.
---
Back to back world war champs baby
---
This kinda ruins the social aspect
---
I'd be a little worried about Shadow healing once you get into BRD, and Princess in Maraudon is rough for anyone. That being said, Shadow leveling is smooth sailing and your anti-gank potential is very high.
---
 SM Cathedral

Benediction and Kromcrush are pretty balanced. 50-50 or within a few percent. Best chance. I’m loving it. Eastern PvP
---
There wasn't any of this spell cleave stuff on private servers it kind of bums me out
---
Install bartender addon, it lets you set multiple bars to change with your stances
---
I use a scimitar pro mouse for some extra keys
---
Example 12345 etc those auto switch when you change stances
---
You can also set the other action bars to flip with stances
---
So when im in battle F is mocking blow.  I change to def, F becomes taunt.  
---
In berserker, C is pummel.  Def stance C becomes shield bash.
---
I prob should get a macro to use equip shield and bash when im in def stance... but I mainly pve right now.
---
My key bindings... still switching some around but they are kinda ok for me for now
---
Battle/berserker/def stance - front 3 thumb buttons on my scimitar 
---
Battle/demo/intimidating/challenging shout - buttons on rear of thumb section on scimitar
---
1 - charge in battle / intercept in berserk
---
2 - heroic strike
---
3 - overpower in battle / revenge in def
---
4 - sunder in battle and def / whirlwind in berserk - sunder is shift 4 in bersker
---
5 - execute in battle and berserk / disarm in def
---
q - rend in battle
---
e - mortal strike 
---
hamstring is on one of my thumb buttons on mouse
---
bow shoot is on one of thumb buttons
---
f - taunt in def / mocking blow in battle
---
ctrl shift \` - mount
---
x - berserker rage
---
If you want brutal impact that’s fine (though some think 1 additional second isn’t worth it) but I honestly still take it but the remaining 3 I put in feral instinct. 3 points for stealth increase which is awesome in pvp and pve for stealth runs and quests and the 9% increase in bear threat is much more valuable leveling when tanking dungeons than - measly 6% increase in armor.. plus the feral aggression option isn’t even usable for the cat form until your 30s when you unlock ferocious bite and the demo roar buff isn’t worth it IMO
---
Yeah could be that it was just because the GMs were slacking and I was wrong that people weren't banned for it.
---
But as I said on our server there was one guy who scammed multiple people and he never got banned for it.
---
people who play ally are cringe af
---
Worth it in the end. Also some really skilled players can level them good with like hamstring kiting mastery
---
Oof, you got me there. The helmet actually looked like a shitty human hairdo from that close up.
---
Such people need to be blacklisted
---
When i get a bigger bag, i go down to one of the starting zone and find someone to trade my old bag to
---
Benediction here, barrens chat is a solid mix of both Bernie, yang and trump supporters. Convos actually aren’t too toxic from what I’ve seen
---
Imagine thinking we give a fuck 😂
---
I'd argue "hero" unit was only a gameplay mechanic. I remember a footman captain traveling with arthas and a huntress traveling with maiev. IMO both way more important, than the first few paladins you just slaughter in the second UD mission minutes after seeing them. (not talking about uther obv.)
---
player characters are enemy soldiers actively taking part in the war effort

---
Demo shout, tab sunder, revenge when possible.
---
There you go, that’s tanking in classic.
---
Hmm I'll look into it and respond if I have a better answer
---
I feel yah, but gotten so your best to let go and enjoy your vacation.
---
**Horde:** Alliance are racist.
---
**Also Horde:** FUCK GNOMES!
---
Thanks for a reasonable reply, I guess I just the see the human, I see somebody questing and think all I'm going to do is interrupt what they are doing and piss them off. I'm all for those mass fights that break out (southshore etc) where people choose to be there creating the content, but random ganks with large level disparity just seems shitty to me.
---
Those "WTF" looks I get when I back stab people who back stabbed me 20 levels before feel just so satisfying
---
You are now Ozamataz, Guardian of The Pine
---
If flavor is important to you, there's a lot (though not all) packed into the first few levels of any class. Maybe try them to just 5 or 6? The first 4 levels happen in a blink and 5/6 are pretty quick too.  
---
I'm rolling Shaman, I like the flavor is really what it comes down to. Mages have always interested me but never seem to keep my interest.
---
Here's what I do: rebind A/D to strafe left/right. QE then frees up for skills. Bind autorun to Mouse 4, or rely on 2click running (both mouse buttons down moves you forward). Use right mouse click for character turning while running, that way you can jump, turn, cast an instant, turn back, and keep running.
---
Do I need to spell it out for you? 
---
**First of all**: You are *vastly* exaggerating how much griefing happens from Infernals. Even *if* you run into an Infernal in a lowbie quest zone, the chance that people would consider it griefing rather than awesome is incredibly low. People record it when an Infernal attacks a town. Why? Because they find it awesome. Some high level player steps in, kills the Infernal and he's the hero of the day.
---
**Second of all**: None of you seem to remember that the cooldown is *an entire hour*. The infernal can be killed in 1 minute. The AoE fire aura deals 30 damage at level 60. That's about 10% of a lvl 11 character's HP. It is simply not game breaking.
---
**Third of all**: You have to be able to grief people in this game. This is an MMORPG, in case you didn't know. It's quite literally one of the main reasons that this game feels alive and dynamic. Why do you think the majority of players are rolling on Pv**P** servers? Because they hate world PvP?
---
You need to be more powerful than someone else. The motivation for wanting to do that comes from that (*partly*). You might think it's ridiculous, but consider what happens when someone gets ganked in STV. That guy wants to become more powerful so he can defend himself or whatever. 
---
What else can happen? He can call for assistance. That's literally a reason to get to know other players in the game.
---
**Fourth of all**: Back to BfA.
---
Yeah but only certain holidays events, Brewfest for example didn't release until TBC.
---
My response is not just the first paragraph, if you read through the entire comment you may notice that I basically said everything you just said.
---
And war effort still doesn't mean attacking indiscriminately. Anyway I don't play on an RP server, so putting the silly RP reasons aside, the actual game reason?
---
Yeah, I have the axe and it happens all the time
---
WF doesnt stack with WF, but stormstrike can proc WF for a total of 4 white hits that have a chance to be crits
---
or i believe 6 hits total max because stormstrike is 2 hits that both can initiate WF
---
I think it’s called bislist on twitch
---
Make a post on your realm forum. 2g/kill, 15g max or something, would be pretty funny. Probably will just get you camped more though.
---
Absolutely

That makes 0 sense, it what way does it ruin the social aspect? You are still advertising your prof just instead of linking sought after patterns they can just directly see whether or not you have it
---
"Now what?"
---
Should be setting trigger to status, item count, less than *.
---
I don't ever go for brutal impact until after I've gotten to the level 30-40 point where I dont have a place to go so I go 4 furor in the other tree then take 1 in brutal impact.
---
The stun for brutal impact as a cat Pounce is fairly worthless in pvp unless you are with a group fighting another group and want to take a guy out for a couple seconds (until batrlegrounds when you are flag carrying to stun their defender while you grab the flag)..  You'd be better off using the backstab-like ability for the high damage in most cases.
---
It also isnt that useful as a bear in groups.  It might save you one time in your grouping career.  Or in pvp if you are bear tanking a rogue and need a quick advance on a heal.
---
I'd go 2 feral instinct and 3 thick hide and skip brutal impact until 40-60 and respec if you feel you actually need it.  That way you get 6% increased threat and 6% sneaking and 6% armor contribution bonus vs a 1 second stun you'll likely rarely utilize effectively.
---
Best grinding spot for 37 is questing in Arathi and STV.
---
Those are 2 different people?
---
Crazy thing is, when I had burning war axe back in Vanilla, I sold it for 300g and paid for my mount.

Holy shit yeah!
---
Now that is a whole different  kettle of fish.
---
Different spells have a different amount of spellpower added to them, generally depending on casting speed, with slower-casting spells gaining more if a bonus from spellpower than faster-casting spells.
---
Basically, a certain percent of spellpower is added to a spell/heal and that percent is different for every spell
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/formulas-spell-coefficients-classic-wow
---
Yes, you will be pretty fucked if you leave stormwind looking at those stats. And while the stats aren't 100% correct i would still expect a ton of alliance to reroll away from that server.
---
Can someone recommend any good add-ons for a PvE Rogue?
---
You are great and glad this phenomenal game transformed you.
---
They like to stay inside their own bubble
---
Everyone loves convenience at face value. The bad side effects are insidious enough that Blizzard devs don't even seem to realize them (hence that "you think you do, but you don't" response. His argument was that players would not like classic because they'd miss all the convenience. Turns out the inconvenience was a core aspect of the game that brought people together via adversity.)
---
Hopefully not by more than 1 mob
---
Blaumeux is representing the most even faction balance of any realms.
---
Because ... it’s fun?
---
The more often you can hit with your onehander, the more threat you generate. So yes.
---
Myself as a mage had 229. 
---
I believe our tanks were around 260-280 range.
---
If you add in pally aura as ally.. and/or UBRS buff. You'll be peachy .
---
 If your dps is strong you can kill him before submerge or at least be around 30% when he does.
---
No, it is because I hear it myself and draw my own conclusion. Also because I am very aware of the manipulation that industries, even the gaming one, pulls to make people addicted.
---
You are only saying it because it goes against your view of wow.
---
Yeah because everyone’s “casual leveling and chill, maybe some PvP” guild is gonna run MC. Can’t think for yourself can ya?

Our guild uzqwrejuheruighjfghjsdfg got reported.

What spec should I play my shaman for a pve/pvp class.
---
Oh I played... I didn’t get spammed back then like I do now
---
Then why does lol always show as bur then?
---
Nice to hear!  Keep working on it and growing. 
---
One day  you will make that priest alt and go heal in dungeons!
---
What a retarded assumption, thanks.
---
And I firmly believe you should be euthanized for your belief.  
---
ITS JUST MY BELIEFS BRO WHY AM I BEING OPPRESSED!!!
---
You see how this works?  Not all beliefs are good or correct.
---
Apparently they aren’t the best for damage, which all of the guides I looked at focused on, I think.
---
Not every spell receives 100% bonus from spell power. Spells have a spell power coefficient which determines what percent of the spell power they receive
---
I play on old blanchy, best server
---
Reminder that when ZG comes out, the bats in there also have 1.0 attack speed just like BT.
---
Different spells get different modifiers from your spell power, so if you have +50 spell power an instant cast spell would see less of a benefit than a 3-second cast spell, because otherwise you could just spam the instant-cast spell for a huge bonus
---
Generally the faster cast time and/or the shorter duration a spell has, the less benefit it gains from spell power.
---
Guys plz make up your minds and let me know lol
---

---
You know what if he paid to make the meme I honestly feel like You have to respect the effort
---
So if I'm understanding it correctly. Say I pull two mobs but I already target one of them. I can just hover over the other one and poly him without deselecting my current target?
---
I get this brief moment of anxiety when picking herbs where a mob will spawn within feet from me. I stare at the mob while watching the gather bar fill up, and I tell myself they have movement-based vision
---
3/10 times, it's true
---
Yeah, that’s like our closest point to SM which is why lots of higher levels are there.
---
Finally someone with sense.
---
Why are you here trying to shill your Youtube channel?
---
Yep. Rogue lvl 48, reroll to warrior because I hate taking hours to form a dungeon group. As warrior I can Just tank and find a group in 2 min. Also I've always played warrior since I started playing in wotlk so no biggie, Just time to lvl up again :)
---
Setup a macro to kick on mouseover without switching targets.
---
I gave a lowbie 3 10 slot bags instead of selling them. He's caught up to my level since and is now my healing buddy in dungeons :)
---
Truly a horrifying battlecry.
---
Yeah but not all skills as a warrior. Warriors really suffer for plate repair bills - but that is later not up until 40.
---
A 30/0/21 ele/resto Shaman can both pvp effectively and heal 5-mans effectively. They can heal in raids fine too, but you'll probably want to get your raid leader's permission, because you don't want them to call for a mana tide totem only to find that you don't have it.
---
Just this little thing to talk about what recipes the person has instead of just directly tells him, what you want. Its minor but little more of these minor changes and suddenly the game doesnt feel the same anymore. So even if it was a good feature, its just against the natural law of classic since it is some sort of "automatization"
---
This reminds me of the midget toss from Wolf of Wall Street.
---
I played the game through previously with 1 char, wanted to up the difficulty. At the moment my goal is to conquer the 5 man content with some crazy efficiency and speed. Winning 5v5 in pvp or finishing a dungeon for the first time  is also a great feeling that i simply don't get from playing 1 character.
---
You sir just described my current situation. I play wow on my laptop while she watches Netflix, eventually gets mad because I don't pay her enough attention, or won't do anything productive. When we binge watch Netflix together = okay. Women are complicated :D..like how is watching TV any better than playing a game? Actually I think gaming is the better solution to kill time because it stimulates the brain and you have to think about your actions in it. While watching TV requires no real input at all..

You know you could just open wiki up and look for yourself. Choosing beggars

Christ, it really is the worst - it made me genuinely sad to be among such shit company playing this game. The amount of blatant racism and antisemitism in barrens chat is shocking (I also play on Bigglesworth). It makes me wonder, were these people playing the game even back in vanilla, and are only now emboldened to troll, or are they mostly toxic teenagers playing for the first time? Either way, I can't help but feel that people are generally just more hateful now than they were back in 2004.
---
Lol, they literally just dropped for me too! "Patched Leather Shoulderpads".
---
What a coincidence. https://i.imgur.com/ppvUl1b.jpg
---
That's what I am thinking! That mainhand is too fast.
---
Prot warriors are less threat per second than fury warriors. Unless you need to have some extra mitigation even off tank warriors in raids should be at least mainly fury if not totally dps spec.
---
Yeah instant poison is the only other one I can think of. I did manage to get 3 10 slots and a 12 slot because those eventually pay for themselves. I think I'll be able to get away with minimal grinding

Hey OP, think I found the guy.

---
Oh yeah sure but a great place to get you the next 50g. Sitting on 50-60 depending on if I trained at 44-46 is nice.
---
How??? I have like 20silver at level 25
---
I feel like this was kind of a thing during retail vanilla where one of the few places to congregate was on the actual wow forums and each realm had their own forum. Nowadays it seems like you'd need a decent amount of people on a discord server or something
---
Arathi highlands, shimmering flats
---
Honestly (presumably with the help of layering) being right in the pack (25) and I've suffered no shortage of ore and chests and quest mobs. People seem well spread out now.
---
3g spent towards leveling and raiding sooner, thus generating more gold sooner will likely have a higher return on value then waiting for 10g later.
---
The wowhead comments are also based off different server populations. Back in the day the highest number of players online at once was between 3500 and 4k, with total number of unique chars never really breaking 30k in a month. We're at 50k a day on some servers. Using 2005/6 pricing data makes no sense, as this version of WoW is going to have an entirely different market just due to size.
---
Yeah, just thought it was hilarious how quickly he died. Every hit on the windfury and the stormstrike was a crit.
---
Plus, saying Windfury as many times as possible= fun
---
It was like that for me for level 18-23 or so, but afterward there was a switch over.  I was druid tanking everythomg while an under-leveled priest was healing (so a lot of the times I was tanking AND healing).
---
My guess is it was because Priests are a bit slower at leveling solo until they hit dungeons or higher level quests where groups exist.
---
That swap over was very noticeable now and I seem to have a good reputation for healing as a lot of people have friended me if they ever need one.  I've been healing dungeons ever since and only going tank for small quest groups.
---
I agree. I'm at 52 and at 300g myself, all 14 slot bags, a great feeling.
---
Kk thanks. I appreciate that!

Or to not honest be

Already saw a few 40+ lvls ganking low levels in duskwood and redridge... I mean the horde players did everything to make golemagg into an empty server.
---
Hunter agi from crit is pretty weak, so it takes a lot to overcome straight stat boosts from ap. 53 agi for 1% crit
---
Displaying that ret and prot paladins when played together are quite strong. There is a lot of negativity in the posts towards prot and ret, as well as some other specs, and I just want to show that they can actually be good.
---
Is armoury with it? Is it just Herod and his mail gear? I'm sure there's more but that's all that Atlas shows
---
that's amazing holy shit

I don't believe that's what's he saying.
---
Because there is infinite gold to be gotten in WoW, inflation will literally always happen until blizzard intervenes. Currently at any level 10G has more buying power in the marketplace then 20+gold will in a few months because people will have more money. Because they have more, they can buy more etc etc. Same in retail
---
I think you are finding info about the updated blue set. It started out as a lvl 58 set IIRC, and the good one was added later, but Finn everything we know from blizzard we're getting the good one right away.
---
Zandalar tribe eu
---
Odds says you will not be able to transfer anytime soon. At least TOO high pop realms
---
It's not a super computer and wow tokens are a thing
---
If your 25 just stop buying more skills EXCEPT for your main damaging spells to help you level. That saves a ton of gold. Sell cloth on AH is my next best tip
---
Are you too fragile to deal with handling that so you need blizzard to remove it?
---
Vanilla didn't have much in the way of structured endgame. Battleground PvP was about it. The rest was just stuff you found to do. Raiding, dungeons, professions, alts, rep grinds, whatever you wanted.

I camped Red Ridge for an hour or so last week on my rogue.  Was a blast.  I was level 17, so about the same if not lower than most of the alliance folk I was ganking.  They got me several times and overall it was a blast.  10/10 would gank again
---
Frank Ocean, Kid Cudi, Kanye West, thing of that nature. Been listening to endless a lot specifically
---
Keep in mind that layering is still in effect. Once phase 2 hits servers should appear much more populated
---
This guy is such a prick lmao 😂😂
---
It's not ninja looting to win a roll for an item you can use. If you were rolling need on a BoP item you can't even equip, that's a different story. Just keep repeating that you won the item fairly, some people are just sore losers.
---
Tabard can drop from any scarlet mob I think, just very low chance.
---
Why do you need it anyway? It's purely for looks, tabards have no stats.
---
Well if you really want to know calc what you gain from the crit chance. And how much you value Dodge? Prob not much compared to DPS but still worth noting.

you can do pretty much all of the endgame dungeons at 57. Just check loot and find a group

The daily grind while waiting for content isn't reallt what i count as the leveling experience in WOD. The arrival on draenor was cool, all the areas were beautifuly crafted, the music was extremely well made, there was a ton of lore everywhere, everything was on foot without flying mounts, and the layering wasn't always too extreme. And a lot of plot and subplots.
---
It was fast (but not too fast), varied, with a good mix of innovation and nostalgia-pandering, and a power growth well made. It sadly didn't had any replayability (playing another character from the same faction meant a lot fo quests in common :() but if you had one character, WOD was absolute perfect during the leveling.  If everyone falled in love with WOD during the first month/two months, it's entirely because of its leveling. 
---
I like Vanilla and Cata, but i don't think vanilla =&gt; cata is better than WOD, if not only for TBC leveling, which i always saw as a trainwreck.
---
Yea I think they were called patchwork leather shoulder pads
---
the name escapes me at the moment and I'm at work so I can't look it up but I'll definitely roll a toon on rattlegore
---
Peppa Pig
---
IIRC, there should be an option to enable/drag the cast bar.
---
I understand that, but that's not what the comment says that I replied to.
---
Most warlocks only use a single pet while leveling. And that single pet only has a single important spell that you need to buy every 8 levels or so. It's much cheaper than buying a mount.
---
/r/DeviateDelight
---
The problem is also those just doing it for the lulz because we gotta make Barrens chat weird and polarizing. Hopefully they realize that doing something ironically means they're still doing that thing and they knock it off.
---
Relationship is as great as ever, but I do make a big effort to make sure play time doesn’t overlap with IRL. 
---
HOWEVER... my free time/alone time is usually spent in my studio (garage) recording, writing, whatever... yeah, no. I’ve rationalized it as Classic giving me a ‘creative break’.
---
Jesus let them put in grp finder and transmog as well ? Go play retail if u want to be more viable as a druid
---
Some of the players he's facing definitely know what they're doing. I'd argue some of those warlocks are quite skilled. 
---
I would agree with you about skill in a lot of the 2v1s and some of the 1v1s. Nevertheless, when you go through these videos with a microscope, you can see just how flawless his decision-making is, and that's really what blew me away. A couple of the fights seemed scripted they were so on point.
---
I think he was making a point in his videos that skill&gt;gear, and not necessarily him&gt;everyone. He doesn't bother putting any enchants on most his gear. Skill v gear was a big thing in vanilla, because gear and scaling in vanilla was absolutely insane and put you leagues ahead of other players. No one was really out here in dog shit rank 8~ gear taking on AQ and Naxx geared opponents. Either way you chop it up, he certainly has skill.
---
Barely drops anything. Its silk there.
---
ZF farm will give it
---
Can't resu them under the rocks, right?
---
thats not true. Mostly true, but not entirely. 
---
Maraudon, ZF, ST and BRD all have pre level 60 BOP epics. 
---
Blade of Eternal Darkness, Sulthraze, Dragons Call, Embrace of the wind serpent
---
BRD has Ironfoe, Savage Glad, Circle of Flame.
---
Scholo, UBRS, DM and Strat Dead all have BOP epics, too and the epic patterns.
---
Mageweave is best farmed in Zul Farak at lv 44
---
never seen it on my ah
---
 He is level 36 . On the grind to 44 in cathedral we will get plenty of mageweave obviously not as much as ZF.
---
I will always roll shaman for this reason. Just so satisfying.  Only 8 bara till SS.
---
Is that name irish?
---
I never needed the $ in my experience
---
Are you sure that Barrens attracts loads of antisemites and racists, or is it possible they're just making edgy jokes that you find offensive?
---
haha that's messed up
---
Renew is instant but has a 15-second duration. That's why I said it's based on the cast time *and* the duration of the spell.
---
Is Herbalism absolutely useless in the current state for gold making? Granted, I'm level 21 and trying to auction off full stacks of peacebloom and mageroyal but full stacks are getting me like 1 or 2 silver...
---
I'm playing on Ashbringer, and tonight (sunday evening) I had a queue of 25 minutes. That's probably the most I've had since release!
---
For classic mage hunters dead zone will make it harder to manage especially if you have to spread them out and have some melee while others are ranged.
---
It works
---
Hey thats cool man.  I guess we live in two different worlds
---
Nah, they have to run from the grave in Kharanos :'(
---
Ya, way to be completely useless lol.
---
I think a lot of people who have never played know leeroy
---
Because they’re playing another faction.
---
You KOS so your faction can punch through the quests instead of the enemy. It’s one thing to compete for mobs with your own faction..but another thing entirely if they’re red.
---
RED = DEAD!
---
Unless they are higher level, more of them, better match-up, etc.
---
When sitting hunched in your chair to you have an air of superiority over those who play less than you?
---
Tbf I wasted a ton of money on prot skills i dont need
---
OSRS is not WoW. 
---
Bye Felicia.
---
As long as it isn't just rehashing the jokes from the first one, all for it
---
That makes no sense. If you have someone on your battle.net friends list you can communicate cross faction anyway. Sniping seems equally ridiculous.
---
XD what the fuck
---
Lol is true. Any other class is faster.
---
2 gold for 19 twink BIS cloaks seems like it could be an easy flip long term, I'll stick with this
---
1 random person calling another a ninja looter isn’t going to gain much traction, there has to be more to it.
---
&gt; so if you have +50 spell power an instant cast spell would see less of a benefit
---
Just sayin, someone who doesn't know anything about wow and reads this as the answer will probably not understand the rest of what you said.
---
I've mentioned several times, Vanilla ToS explicity stated you will encounter high level demons in low level zones and you should take steps to protect yourself with in-game solutions and not by contacting support staff. Do. Some. Research.
---
Yes that'd be good.
---
I prefer PVE servers but all my friends play on a PVP server, so I didn't have a choice if I wanted to play with friends. I usually try to avoid world pvp as much as I can. I'm only level 32 so we'll see how well that works. I've only been in STV a little and have been ganked a few times but so far as long as I wave and make it apparent I'm not going to attack them and just wanna focus on the grind, I'm left alone.
---
I'm on kirtonos as horde but it's so one sided I don't want to completely outnumber alliance. I wonder if I went to arcanite reaper the low pop server it would even out better. I bet there are more people at lower levels as well so it won't be like everyone is 60. Is arcanite reaper one of the newer servers?
---
are there ques on high pop servers or just full ones?  I think I'm gonna start playing.  just wondering if I should choose a medium pop or high.
---
In my experience there was a huge difference between TBC and Vanilla.  In vanilla there was no elitism whatsoever for pugs. That said, any raid that dropped epics was only done by guilds, and the idea of a pug attempting these was considered a joke. 
---
In vanilla I was in a middle tier guild that cleared mc and bwl. There was no talent enforcement whatsoever- you could be a non holy priest and heal and no one cared . 
---
I quit when TBC came out and sold my account for $400. I came back on a friends shadow priest some time later and tried to heal a pug raid. After I was summoned I was immediately kicked and had several angry comments chastising me for wasting their time . I did  not come back until now.
---
Agreed! Every bug report counts.
---
RightClickSelfCast addon works in classic as well.
---
it's saved me on *SO* many occasions.
---
Thanks I hate it :)
---
This doesn't seem like the whole story :)
---
They stand in a pentagram or something and do creepy shit if this is the goldshire kids
---
No acne cream, poor hygiene. stress of being raised in war in there area. Hell yea I’d look worse
---
I think your damage meter is broken or out of date lol
---
Nice red armor, seems fitting of classic
---
I knew I recognized the name Amavesta. I think we played together in BC.. Hells Elite?
---
Exactly what your not suppose to do
---
Yes because yes
---
It is now, people are not 60 yet, when they hit 60 they’ll want to level alchemy and other crafting professions for raids. So your peacebloom and mageroyals will become worth more. Not a lot though people tend to level with a gathering profession.
---
I barely use food / bandages between pulls and Im able to keep killing 2 NPCs at the time as a warrior. Currently at level of 48. Wanna know the secret ingredients? Good equipment, weapon and leveling in "green lvl zone". Simple. Its actually much easier, since you hit way more often than on pservers so I guess this is a easy mode for me, since Im used to level in tougher environment
---
You're asking in the subreddit where the majority of people will say "yes". What are you looking for in WoW Classic? More information would help to give more educated answers.
---
Really need to trim all those level ones. they are skewing everything
---
Why though? You aren't playing on OPs computer, why does it matter?
---
Hahaha the name of the Tauren is glorious!

Glad you’re enjoying it.

I assume the situation was one that *some* would consider bad fate rolling. Feral druid over rogue for HoJ, devout set piece for warlock over priest are situations I've come across where there's been accusations of trolling, ninjaing. Some specs have more of those issues. DPS Warrior rolling on leather items, priest rolling for spelldmg/spellhit gear are similar situations where a rogue, or a mage in second example, might be raging about your class being meant to do only one thing.
---
Better to spill the tea on item and what class/spec vs class/spec it was rolled on.
---
Had this happen once on the way from SW to Sentinel Hill. I lagged as I was landing at SH, next thing I know I’m falling to my death over Elwynn.
---
horde, Lanadelslay
---
If you think a bis weapon is better then gold towards your epic mount... 
---
That's weeks worth of farming fo something that you dont really need. bis isnt better then your epic. You can literally join a pug with greens and down mc...
---
Honestly
---
I would go a Frostbite Build till you unlock Ice Barrier, then you should be able to AoE Farm well.
---
Also MC and BWL, you'll still be using Frost because Fire is useless :P
---
the spell coefficient of renew is 20% but it ticks 5 times (a DoT, a HoT) and therefore has a much better coefficient than spells like prayer of healing at 28.6% that is frontloaded, despite each "tick" of prayer of healing being more efficient because there is only one.
---
I tried playing BFA on release and it was basically far right edge lordship everywhere. Probably why I don’t play retail.
---
Because Blizzard cherry-picked one or two things to have a consistent replacement. "lol" always shows as "bur" (for Horde) or "kek" (for Alliance) and, IIRC, "help" also always shows as a consistent word for each faction.
---
It's very hard to get useful information out of knowing if someone on the opposing faction said "lol" or "help", but it adds to the experience when you realize what the Horde ganker said to his victim or what the Alliance noob /yelled as he tried to escape.
---
EDIT: and not to be a neckbeard about linguistics, but even if all the words were consistent, it wouldn't be a functional language. It would be a relex of English, or essentially a cypher.
---
I went to gym 3 times a week before Classic. 
---
I didn’t go since launch. But now that I’m 60, I’ll get back to it starting tomorrow
---
Grinding mobs and selling drops (silk and greens), which is a bit stupid because quests and drops give you more than enough gold to get your mount by level 45 playing normally.
---
Netherweave was the cloth from TBC. Felcloth is what you use to make Mooncloth.
---
I fuckin love this game lol
---
If you want it you can go to retail and play there
---
hes talking to an alli
---
I think you're a salty hater.
---
Uh no. Rogues easily can take on 2 mobs. See various streamers or randies near you.
---
Warriors tend to mostly wear leather as well. Warriors rely mostly on their white hit damage.
---
Warriors are by far the worst in leveling.
---
The fact you left party and tagged him first. Fuck yeah dude. F those type.
---
Is there no craftable boe epics that are pre 60 or is that in later patches?

6 agility is definitely better than 14 attack power.
---
6 agility= 12 AP + crit chance + dodge chance + armor + can benefit from blessing of kings and similar buffs.
---
I have a small penis irl to. If I had to say that you must highly doubt that huh.
---
Its funny how people think a bis bow for a rogue is better then tossing that baby on the ah for epic mount money. 2 weeks worth of grinding gold or not. Its hilarious.
---
Same! It’s amazing, calculating xp/hour and much more.
---
I wanna live througj the other expansions
---
If this kind of stuff is the "spirit" of Classic, I don't like it. 
---
I like the RPG elements, I like using scrolls and potions, I like having a network of trustworthy craftsmen, I like the world pvp, I like the weird and unique items, I like making friends along the way, I like getting something really cool from questing, I like grouping up with others to complete a normally difficult quest. 
---
Spending most of your time in the same dungeon not doing anything else just... doesn't seem to be in the spirit of things. 
---
I was sold on the idea of not getting instance gratification in Classic, that every level and item upgrade would feel meaningful and worth it. This "gogogogogo" mentality is the exact opposite of what I signed up for. Ever since I got to doing SM it feels the community got less friendly and more "efficiency-scape"-ish.
---
Being 39 and still looking like ass cuz SM drops legit nothing for rogues lmao. It makes me a little sad.
---
Can you explain thus? Ive been trying to hamstring kite and figured it wasnt working because I suck.
---
I didn't come here to debate whether simulators are useful. I really don't care if you believe doing it by hand is the right way or not, or whether you feel the game is "too simple" for that kind of thing.
---
Go back to using your Pre-raid bis sheets that were created *using a simulator*.
---
I know how the game works. My point was that when someone says this you are going to confuse a new player.
---
"Different spells get different modifiers from your spell power, so if you have +50 spell power an instant cast spell would see less of a benefit than a 3-second cast spell"
---
had a hord mage (im ally) with who we split quest tigers in stv. all chill and them some more hord come. now he starts attaking me and the guys who came back him up. ok i cant quest there anymore. now some time later i see the same mage alone killing some mobs. but this time im not mister nice guy lets split the mobs. i bet he enjoyed those graveyard runs. felt good! felt luke justice!
---
Clueless lol sad you need a program to tell you 3+2=5 or 3+3=6 this is the level of simplicity of Vanilla gearing.
---
Awesome! I'm gonna do it!
---
Asmongold is an irrelevant dickhead.
---
Technically you can, they have a static attack speed. Bear is 2.5s. 
---
Manual crowd pummeller is farmed by raiding druids for the on use effect, which increases attack speed by 50% iirc.
---
You basically just double fear expecting the wotf.  It's not a big deal breaker, it's just another chess piece on the board.
---
.
---
There's a game called Riders of Icarus that does dungeons similarly but unfortunately they're much more linear.
---
tbh just start playing the game. you will meet other people in the world and through dungeons organically. They will invite you to their guild and before you know it youll be raiding with those guys that you ran SM with when you where lvl 30. Thats the magic of vanilla.
---
just my opinion and the way I go about it.
---
What are you playing on at the mo? What are the requirements?
---
Could be Cuzzo or Gank methinks
---
Horde was a mistake -the devs
---
It makes sense, you are actually skinning their best friend.
---
On private servers I would always record large trade transactions like this. I would get in the habit of doing it especially for something expensive like Lionheart helmet.
---
No they were not made with simulators how clueless are you?
---
Thanks for such a detailed response, this is what I am looking for! I love the idea of having similar abilities on the same keybind for stance changes.
---
I'll have to have a look at bartender, have a play around. If you have a spare few minutes would you link or PM a screenshot of your action bars just so I can get a feel for how it looks?
---
Again really appreciate the answer. Macros seems to be a big part of Warrior it's just I dont know what I am doing with them and the guides I've read have been pretty vague.
---
Oh man, arguing the real issues here.
---
I wouldn’t delete it even though it’s wrong. If anything, it helps because it further clarified that the setting just affects heals on self.
---
I see you have yet to master the art of trolling, /u/SJWhiteKnighttard, you're too straight forward.
---
You're fishing for a quick means to an end... The experience of classic is to actually grind and take time to accomplish things with your character. If you could buy everything and respec 20 times within a week or two of playing, then why would you keep playing afterwards with no bgs or pvp to be had? Gold limits the amount people can accomplish immediately and gives more to be desired. There's a reason to farm gold and to be conservative with what you have.
---
Likely Peril
---
I went to Hawaii a week after classic launched. I’m not ashamed to say I played wow while staring at the beach and getting a tan—screen was hard to see, though.
---
I use the tailoring mats that are grey to me to level first aid. No reason not to pick it up to use the spare linen in your bags.
---
Hi there, I played a Mage back in these times, and this was definitely a thing back in vanilla. I don't know where this idea that AoE farming is a new thing comes from, we were doing it back in EQ in groups, in FF11 in groups, and the same thing in vanilla WoW. You didn't have to be an incredibly super intelligent person to look at dungeons and go "Wow, I get decent exp here even without quests, and I don't get fucked with by the other faction while I do it!" and then optimize from there. AoE farming SM GY with 3 mage groups is honestly a point of nostalgia for me personally, and just because *you* didn't do something in Vanilla doesn't mean it wasn't done.
---
Sounds like MasturbateR
---
Or Al Boar
---
Yeah that’s the experience as every melee class if you’re fighting mobs close to or above your level.
---
It’s called a notebook, u can buy one in most stores, recommend a pen or pencil to it also :)
---
Easily confused often?
---
Same! I went this week as I’m a new student in Bristol.
---
Feels bad when I can’t red gud
---
Yes. But don't get me wrong, I for example didn't get my mount till lvl 43. But I want saving like mad.
---
Thing is, you spec while you level, maybe you make mistakes as you go, fine, respec for 1g.
---
At 60, when you know what role you want to fill, respec for 5g. Maybe even make some more mistakes before 60 and respec again. 
---
But at lvl 50, you'll be making enough good to making respec prices irrelevant.
---
Make money selling gold.
---
Also I hope they release more classicish content
---
Interesting. Must have been. I heard it quite a few times so I just assumed it was a thing people said but maybe it was just a weird inside joke with the guild I ran with in Vanilla
---
if they're opposite faction it's cool, all part of the rivarly
---
if they're same faction that is, in bird culture, what we call a "dick move"
---
Honesty take a break to recharge and come back feeling rejuvenated.
---
Don't swap, just keep your WW, it'll serve you to almost 50.
---
I did this yesterday but somehow just went straight through the windows and onto the boat.
---
This is a complete non issue.  The only person who would ever be concerned with this is someone that intends to bot.  So fuck off.
---
r/technicallythetruth
---
One idea I had for that was to use the current layering system to have a vanilla layer, TBC layer, wrath layer etc. So you could still play on the same realm as everyone else but choose your expansion.
---
I absolutely fucking love these.  Congrats - after years of lurking, you've earned my first ever "Follow" on Reddit.  Have to see the next ones.
---
Yea the're really only worth it if you have skinning. On actual classic, I would say 2/3 jaguars dropped nothing at all, and the third would be like one small tail for 3s. I did them for an hour and made just under 2.5g with no competition at all.
---
Thanks for the reply, how is the community feeling on the realm?
---
 I’m on Noggenfogger atm with my main and although it’s a funny server and I will keep my alts there, guilds like “noggers with attitude “ and “noggers in paris” atract a lot of “interesting” people.
---
i imagine they'd have been rawhide or something that could become hardened once stretched and shaped.
---
However, this is definitely not the case for everyone.
---
there is no fucking way you are playing normally and having people mass report you for nothing. i'm gonna wager you're the kind of person who thinks they're funny but they're just an obnoxious dickhead with a horrible sense of humor and that gets you in trouble
---
they mass report you when you mass piss them off, the istances of a truly innocent person being gangreported by someone and their guild is lower than the instances where someone tried to kill someone in real life over a wow issue
---
Its a technique that helps melee classes extremely. You hit and crit more often, meanwhile getting less damage. So it does. I mean what are you saying? ...Yea maybe you can indeed, as I said, I can only compare leveling hunter to private servers and classic is just easier so I guess it is possible. On the other hand, Im not trying to compare warriors to hunters and its obvious hunter will outperform warrior. It still doesnt change the fact that leveling warrior can be quite amusing and at decent speed if done correctly
---
Haha yeah it's pretty funny. Must have been a weird inside joke with the guild I ran with in Vanilla
---
...she ran away, and I wonder if she would stay-ay.   
---
Runaway, run-run-run-run, runaway.
---
I think I read it as “every pre 60 epic is boe”
---
While all dungs are possible with lv57 groups, I don't regret questing to 60 and only doing one LBRS run before 60. It's so different doing dung runs with full 60 parties compared to those meh 58-59 avg groups. It's not that you get any crazy new stuff at 60, but the chances are the 60 player didn't just ding and already has some gear as 60.
---
I'd recommend looking if you need upgs from some long quest chains, mostly in EPL. Check Battle of Darrowshire and that other one, Order must be restored or something. Work on those chains if the end rewards seem decent.
---
If you have to do dungs, then more BRD is good, and out of LBRS/strat/scholo/UBRS the easiest is probably LBRS. A lot of bosses, none of them feel that hard. No bullshit trash (=fear) either.
---
I think this was the case for all reactionary damage, like thorns or that one potion. And if the mob dies like that you wouldn't get loot either
---
I’m in the same boat
---
Lmao at the call outs "got one!!"
---
Chocolate is bad for dogs tho
---
The people of WoW Classic reddit will clear your name. 
---
What class are you? What was the item? What class was the salty loser in question? Where were you? 
---
Without this, your beloved classic WoW character will be forever known as a dirty, dishonest, Ninja Looter ignored by many.
---
Lmao sounds like you're the triggered one buddy. I dont think sitting on reddit is doing your mental health any good.
---
Fantastic
---
Deviate Delight
---
I want to have socialist babies with you.
---
Getting a ton of gold for an item that you dont really need 
---
That's what I'm saying and people ducking hate it.
---
People see bis now for rogue. You know nice stats but you wont use it or really notice a big dps increase. But everyone hates that I suggest selling it for epic mount money to save you weeks of work. When that epic bow isnt going to be some game changer the way an epic mount is. 
---
But no bis gear is more important to people then epic mounts. When you can join a raiding guild in greens with the same result. But im wrong
---
&gt;i was sure my internet was working just fine so it cant be my fault.
---
Yeah nothing is ever your fault
---
Try youtube. There is plenty of guides out there, showing which zones, mobs, items to farm/vendor/AH. 
---
Depending on your level, you WILL have to switch zones often. And even more since you’re on a pvp server. Most farming spots is already well occupied in peak-midpeak hours. 
---
I would recommend the following:
---
- swamp of Sorrows (Ive seen little to no pvp in this area). Go for jungle panthers and humanoid camps (that includes chests)
---
- STV (high on pvp! So you might have a rough time here). Go for cold eyed basilisk and jungle stalkers
---
- Badlands (mid-high pvp). The most lucrative farming spot imo. I can, if not ganked and not sharing mobs with other players, farm 7-10g/hour here. 
---
If you really want that mount at 40, you might wanna gold farm for a couple of levels. But you’ll get there by doing quest, run some dungeons, and dont waste gold on spells you not REALLY need to level.
---
Edit: I’m a level 40 priest. So my farming speed aint the best, but not the worst either. As a mage/warlock/hunter you’ll farm even more gold/hour than me.
---
Thanks, mate! ❤
---
I was near the "boss" when he spawned (pure luck, as he can spawn in different places), they just saw him on a distance and started running xD
---
I did the 'hunter pull' in UBRS last boss last night. Feign failed, and I died. Its so annoying feign death is buggier than it was in 2002 alpha.
---
Runkalot, Really?
---
False.
---
And there's a soft crit cap so it's even more complicated.
---
next to the official entrance, there is a broken pallisade you can slip through.
---
I posted a thread about this yesterday and got a very detailed reply that may be what you're looking for
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d495ea/shaman_switching_from_enhancement_to_elemental/f08tsu7
---
This prompted me to switch to ele myself and am finding it much better than enh in the 40's.
---
healer had to do more work because he was healing more people. my fave priest yells at me to get out the two hander for this reason. heavy tank damage but zero damage to anyone else is easier to heal, therefore holding aggro is top priority.
---
Wow.
---
No, damage is also depending on your gear, consumables and crit luck. 
---
He also got help by his raid members
---
No joke it was so much better. Was able to do it with two deaths. And then the guy who framed my charms gave me a discount because ally had the camps on farm and he had to tag mobs. Really lucky
---
Well I started somewhere around TBC, was super slow leveler, had no clue of what I’m doing and so on, until WotLK. I’ve felt super nostalgic in every single zone and dungeon so far. Biggest/only issue for myself is ironically the amount of people. I love zones being full, but for example today in Searing Gorge; kill X mobs for Y drop. There was like 8 of us and only 3 of those X mobs spawning and the drop rate was around 25% for myself. Don’t get me wrong tho, not complaining! I highly recommend coming over!
---
Go home to your shit subreddit.
---
It’s not really racists and anti-semites. It’s just people on the internet trolling/being edgy/attempting to be funny. 15+ years ago, this is how gaming was. People weren’t offended by every little thing. There was a thing such as being humorous, even if it was dark/twisted/offensive. At the end of the day, it was just a joke. 
---
Flash forward to today, and people get their panties in a wad over every little thing. That is why you see Barrens Chat, and assume “omg everyone here is a racist!”. SJW/cancel culture/PC culture created this mindset. It’s not because everyone online is a racist, it may just be because you are weak minded and can’t take a joke or see the humor in anything. 
---
And I already know what you are already thinking... “omg this guy is just another one of them filthy racists. Omg this guy probably is a T_D poster”. I’m right, aren’t I? Well guess what, I’m not a racist or any of that other PC Culture bullshit that your sheltered mind wants to jump to the conclusion that I am. 
---
Want a perfect example of this on a wide scale? Look at comedians. Comedians used to thrive, because they were actually hilarious. They made extremely offensive jokes about white people, black people, Hispanics, women, men, conservatives, progressives, straight people, gay people, you name it. Then PC culture came along (pushed by so called “progressives”) and began calling them all racists, homophobes, xenophobes, you name it. And this progressive mob mentality ran them all off. And look, comedians mostly suck now a days, and comedy as a whole is dying. Dave Chappelle comes along and does “Sticks &amp; Stones” where he makes fun of white people, black people, LGBTQ, and more. Guess what? The progressive mob is after him, attempting to crucify him as a racist homophobe bigot.
---
Mob mentality, cancel culture, PC culture, all of this bullshit pushed by progressives over the last 15 years is CANCER, and it needs to die.
---
Your friend doesn’t know what he’s talking about
---
Robes of the Lich
---
This is why I love the EVE devs stance on scamming. Because people should deal with it this way instead of just filing a report to a magic banhammer. Keeps shit interesting and gives you some more goals besides grinding.
---
mah man david duke uses wow music????? Every day i fall more in love with him, no hobro.
---
Speaking from experience?
---
I only hate rogues
---
Non Dwarf warrior.      
---
God I love stoneskin.
---
I farmed elementals that drops charms for whirlwind quest
---
I always make sure I have more than enough but the pirates in Tanaris dropped way more than I used =)
---
Planet Fitness thinks Judgement is a ranged offensive spell...lol...And my hunter rolls on healer loot because I leveled first aid to 125.
---
Oh ok so there's lots of variables. Gotcha. Sorry if I'm taking too much of your time but as a priest. How would that work for me ?
---
Thats right, logged on early AF (04.00) to grind it alone!
---
All quest give normal xp regardless of color until you are 6 levels above it. Then it goes like this
---
Quest level 10
---
Your level
---
5-15 = 100%
---
16 = 80%
---
17 = 60%
---
18 = 40%
---
19 = 20%
---
20+ = 10%
---
Don't tell mom
---
See I do the same, but I also have passive income on the side.
---
It can be both. Besides, if edge lords act anti-semitic, can't be upset when lumped into that category.
---
Going north, stay far to the right.  There's a path that goes through a broken down log fence.  Just watch out for level 25 horde logging camp wanderers along the way.  But, yes.  Totally fine at level 20 even.
---
You can probably figure out what the Barrens chat is like on Noggenfogger-EU
---
I appreciate your contribution. You got some negative reactions but this kind of stuff is a very valid way for players to consider how they're doing things. I wish people were more willing to help each other out and less afraid of / offended by criticism. Stuff like this can help someone change better than inflicting their mistake upon 20 hours of groups.
---
Playing because retail is hot garbage right now, I hope to see the inside of naxx eventually
---
This is really dumb and makes no sense. Yea real life breaks immersion from the game you are currently not playing, cause you aren't play it. Way different than something happens during a game while actually playing it.
---
Now that I think of it so should have made the tractor a Feral Druid.
---
Its up to the person. Id laugh off 2g but 15g id probably add him and try to fuck with him in my off time. Its not like im gonna dedicate my life to it. Its something fun to do when im bored
---
That's bannable.
---
But there are no mobs on mograin
---
Yes 100%
---
Even if you don’t end up making anything, selling the mats will net you some valuable currency, especially when it gets higher level
---
I submitted it to Warcraftmovies.com and someone re-uploaded it to youtube later on.  My friend just found it and sent it to me today.  Hope it helps out some of you new Druids as it did way back then!
---
Only to servers that have lower pop.
---
Kirtonos seems to be about 60/40 Horde.
---
Heroic Strike, Hemo, Slam are some non normalized attacks
---
Bruh u just did him like Wiley Coyote lol
---
I don't have the alpha-burst necessary. You have to get on them and be able to just get off one or two swings to kill them, and this is why 2H Arms looks so impressive. It's one of the few ways to quickly annihilate a mage, otherwise they will just keep kiting you. 
---
Prot doesn't have that Alpha. Things like Shield Slam and Silence from Shield Bash help, but a *good* mage will always win. Don't get me wrong, I've killed mages many times, but it's usually because they didn't understand what they were facing. The first time I silenced a Mage (as Warrior) they freaked out and stood there for a second.
---
Haha I was always indifferent.  Being on a monday/tuesday morning I always assumed it was for night shift workers/etc. to have an easy meal before bed once a month but later learned it was to allow people to have a cheat day without being at home to eat an entire pizza themselves.
---
My issue with them is the candy on the desk. Normally tootsie rolls but sometimes other candy.  "Regular" cardio people grab a handful on their way in and on their way out easentially undoing their workout lol.
---
You're not allowed to disagree with an OP, what kind of pleb are you? You're supposed to hold his hand and gently guide him to the promised land of truth - his truth. /s
---
I just rerolled a mage and I freaking love it.
---
The $$$ part isn’t required, but makes it much much easier!
---
Probably your single most useful spell in solo questing and dungeons. I totally get why you were struggling if you weren't using it
---
Which is how it should be.
---
Wonder why it worked for him. He got the same error code. Hope you get it fixed that has to be frustrating.
---
thats what happens when you get 20x truefaith vestments and robes of the void patterns a day.
---
Cloth donation
---
Yea you were a little too excited
---
That is correct. If you move your mouse off of the target and click poly once more, you will then poly your actual target.
---
A hunter should never use their melee weapon in dungeons, what are you talking about?
---
Or are you one of those hunters that doesn't bring any ammo?
---
I'd rather not. The creators want to cancel south park lol.
---
What do you mean?
---
Ok thanks. It seems like whoever wrote the Wowhead guide is off and messed up alot of the Bis gear as well
---
Go for it. It doesn’t matter if you can only put in a few hours per day, the feeling of progression at any level is satisfying.
---
For a noob I’d probably recommend a Hunter or Mage. They both output a lot of damage, they’re forgiving to play, and they’re just fun overall. 
---
I would also recommend Paladin, but that’s just me
---
That makes no sense, as this feature would only be applied to people who are RL friended with, not a regular wow friend invite.
---
So did the guy in the photo.
---
Makes sense. Thank you
---
Have you tried Mind Controlling them off ships?
---
Cloth? I donated some wool to an NPC and read I can donate Silk next at level 26, is that what you mean?
---
I agree! Ban them all from the game. Hunters with their filthy assault rifles of mass destruction make me sick.
---
The real question tho is 5g worth more now than 300g in phase 3?
---
Same here OP need to start lifting seriously again, promised myself this wont happen and ofc it did
---
Graveyards are sooooo far away tho. Can definitely consume the full hour or two of gameplay you get in a day. 
---
I do tell myself I need to KoS more and just not camp. Currently I don’t attack people unless they’re hostile first. Then I might camp them for a couple kills before leaving.
---
thank you!
---
Who won?

It's all in Mik's scrolling battle text, i just changed the font :)  [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mik-scrolling-battle-text](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mik-scrolling-battle-text)
---
skinning takes very fast to level up and you have droped ball on this to be honest, but dont worry, quick google search and you will knowwhat lvl mobs u can skin with your lvl, go to zone with that lvl mobs and you will be back at it in no time. if you plan to unlearn skinning later on, and dont want to waste much time on it then ditch it.
---
Right and you think Republic of Korea and Democratic People's Republic of Korea are the same country? I mean, they both have Korea in it, am I wrong?
---
I rerolled my first rogue at level 10. Rogues suck.
---
That's correct. I'm hoping that this was not an intentional change
---
..
---
you peaked.
---
The debuff of the wolf "Rabid" reduces your health regen by a ton % for like 10 minutes. 
---
Meanwhile the spider's DoT deals a truck ton damage and eating doesn't help at all..!!!
---
Technically correct.
---
That's how mobs which are 2 levels below you feel.
---
Does the Undercity Bank not have an app yet? I hate going to banks in-person.
---
&gt; just a racist opinion
---
How is this in any way racist?
---
If they're playing difference classes they're a pve multiboxer so not really surprising.
---
Think it’s the guild of a WoW Podcaster
---
The real question here
---
i cri erytime
---
This is also true with PvP encounters
---
I don't have the wand talents, but I do have spirit tap and that is amazing. I am playing with someone else though and sometimes he accidentally gets the killing blow even if we try to make sure I get it. 32 now and planning to spam RFK for corpsemaker for him. Hopefully we'll be able to dungeon spam :)
---
Stupidest argument I’ve seen all day, thx! 
---
“If you live in the real world you can’t be immersed in a fantasy world” is basically what you’re saying and it’s retarded
---
Yes, at level 60 the quest to donate runecloth will become infinitely repeatable and give you rep towards the faction the NPC represents. This is the only way to reach exalted with Ironforge, leveling quests alone won't give you enough rep.
---
Anyone’s addons not working? I can only get questie to work but all others won’t load
---
It’s common courtesy to roll. They chests aren’t really that good anyways. Serves them right. Those respawn timers are so long.
---
this isn't passive
---
But why did you have to wait for him to start fighting a mob first lmao
---
What is the purpose of your video? Who is your audience? Those are the first questions you should ask yourself before making a video. 
---
Built your video around it and usually some sort of breakdown is necessary for longer videos or an intro to make the viewer aware of what they're going to watch.
---
Atleast then it feels like you've put some editing awareness into it. I don't think people are going to watch more than an hour (!) long video of you rambling.
---
Also regarding 10:25, yes in fact, mages do only wear cloth. Hearing the doubt in that sentence felt strange as if you've never touched the game before? Keep in mind I skipped the first part as there was no intro to speak of.
---
Starting with The Deadmines being the first dungeon is also false as that would be Ragefire Chasm in Orgrimmar.
---
Cheers
---
Edit: also the thumbnail is very poor, no picture of the dungeon or why is the elf with the cleavage on there in the first place? Oh...
---
On the character screen click the add on button. If they are there make sure the box in the corner is check that says load out of date addons
---
I mean.. Prot palys are great dungeon tanks, and bear druids are great PvP tanks.
---
I think the key problem in classic was the inability for Druids to hit the defense cap, and Paladin's lack of any taunt. Whereas Warriors had every prot tanking tool.
---
They fixed these issues and a ton more in TBC. The thing with being 15 years old is that people have shit fucking memory. Vanilla had a ton of these problems, TBC fixed a lot of them. WotLK fixed even more, and DKs were great for evening out the lacking tank numbers.. But towards Cata they added Heirlooms, Refer a Friend 300% exp, and LFG.. Which all severely sped up the levelling process.
---
Feels like the opposite on Netherwind, which is nice.
---
Ironforge I believe
---
To get another race's mount, you must have Exalted reputation with that race. To gain reputation, you need to do quests given by members of that faction. You can also trade cloth to their quartermaster in the capitol city. All cloth turn-ins are limited, except for runecloth, which can be turned in as many times as you like.
---
We agreed to both need on it, I'm a hunter and the other guy was a druid.
---
[Party chat is in another window though](https://i.imgur.com/ZJeLag6.png)
---
The best part of WotLK was the pre-launch event. I loved fighting the zombie apocalypse.
---
Varies by sever. Generally it’s your last plus tip.
---
I think that would be Ironforge :)
---
Edit: a word
---
Eventually you will want first aid. Tailoring is almost essential for cloth wearers. Their epic class specific robes are the best chest pieces they can get until BWL (phase 3) or even later. First aid is absolutely worth the investment for any player, but as a healer you can skip it while leveling if you choose to. I skipped it until 40+ after I got my mount.
---
Looks like Deet from dark crystal
---
Oh great i will do that level as a ret paladin till 60 than re spec for holy and move ahead .
---
can i move items between my two characters if they are on the same account?
---
Um, sure, we can pretend that’s true, I guess.
---
It's funny how many people rolled mages. They are fun but trying to kill a healer is just pointless
---
Explain?
---
https://giphy.com/gifs/xT9IgHCTfp8CRshfQk
---
Roll a mage like the majority of everyone
---
Plenty of addons have this feature if you are seeking one
---
Ask yourself this. Who are these "masses" that are gonna report you? Like are there guilds or something commited to getting people muted for the lols?
---
i received a SCREEN (his monitor) shot (a picture - taken by any eletronic device that can record image) come on,  its not like the resolution is that bad
---
You're on Kurinnaxx aren't you 😜
---
I know exactly who you are. Your that dude that keeps posting about toxicity while being toxic
---
You asked for the vanilla experience, and you got it.
---
Thanks gonna buy it tomorrow
---
I got a priest to level 24 but afterwards decided I wanted to play paladin. Got that to level 18 so far. I don't regret it as i'll probably go back to the priest at some point.
---
Full demo is best I believe. I would choose one tree or the other depending on how you like to play. Soul link at 40 is really good.
---
That's a respectable opinion, my view is just that if it was bannable in vanilla then for #nochanges reasons I don't see why it should be allowed in classic.
---
Yeah, they pulled it in to stormwind  yesterday.
---
Yeah but 6/53 crit vs 2ap which is 1/7 a dps. So roughly .11% crit vs .14dps. Now crit will increase your total dps by more since it heavily scales with gear. I'd say if you are doing over 130dps without your pet the agi is better. If not I'd take the ap
---
About 7 days /played. Had 5 days off for work, got ahead of the pack by a large margin which made later questing easier. 
---
Also camped 5 and 10m SM farm along with ZF farm. 
---
You can level really fast if you try to play stupid efficiently and know where to go.
---
i RECEIVED the file as that
---
Gotcha.  I am 15 years behind most of you so I'm trying to learn one day at a time.  Thanks!

Started as a druid, got to lvl 12 and decided I just wasnt into bear butt. Leveled a prot pally to 24, love the class fantasy but got sick of not having a taunt or ranged pull option, and buffing every 5 minutes is awful. Played a hunter to 6, its fun but I hate the idea of having no group support. Now I'm doing 2 quests and swapping toons over and over. I have no idea what I'm going to main now, it sucks.
---
&gt;she is actually happy with WoW
---
So you haven't told her you failed two exams yet then have you?
---
I was actually surprised at how easy it was to get those quest done.
---
It's intentional so that you can't afk farm. The same goes for pets; if a pet does 100% of the damage, you get no loot or xp.
---
Guarantee I’m older than you.

&gt; Patch 1.5.0 (patch date:2005-06-07):
---
&gt; Highlord Bolvar Fordragon should no longer despawn when "The Great Masquerade" is activated.
---
FYI polymorph causes insane health regen. Could be that the mage is using poly as a psuedo heal to help you. If a mate wanted to kill you, they'd just kill you.
---
It's been so long I could be wrong, I'm sure every server was a bit different too. I remember seeing every once in a while a lfg MC PUG but they were seen as a long shot and a joke. 
---
To clarify you had actual pugs on your server that took down rag?
---
It's literally a lvl 40 axe you can have at lvl 30, +5 weapon skill won't help any sword/mace catch up to that
---
Take it easy man. Cut it out with those Earth shattering charges.
---
30-40 is the biggest drag in the leveling process. Zones get bigger, pvp becomes more active, levels are slower, and no mount
---
Someone's never played a Rogue before.
---
I had a gnome flagged for the name 'Nuckfut', it sounded very gnomish to me, not my fault everyone kept pronouncing it wrong.
---
Ranges by server and faction...and its to volitile right now to answer with any detail but the easiest way to check would be check the AH for arcanite bars and check the AH for the mats to buy the bars...there should be a difference and that would be about the right amount.
---
Blaumuex server has USA guild
---
The poster isn't insulting the Horde or anything lol.
---
Grow up some people suck and say dumb shit. Ignore it and stop trying to push this censorship narrative.
---
Yes, when you click on the rankings you can switch between damage and healing.
---
Here are the healing rankings:
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1000#boss=672&amp;metric=hps
---
You can also look up profiles of individual players. Heres for example one of ha holy called thalies
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/us/incendius/thalies
---
You can see in the table how he performed on each individual boss.
---
Those logs are only available if someone in your raid logs the fight and upload them.
---
You can log by yourself if you want. You have to install a tool for that on your pc and need an account on warcraftlogs.com there are YouTube guids out there that explains that stuff.
---
100% much more worth to use than sell, nice find!
---
and suddenly every bear in the entire wow-world flocks to Elwynn forest to charge at that level 6 dude practicing his skinning.
---
He’s gonna swap it for a 1% hit one before MC anyways he really should’ve sold it
---
I always trade my lock boxes to random rogues
---
It's always been that way, pre-30 often pre-40 dungeon loot is just whoever will use it because it's going to replaced so quickly, 30-40+ things become role rolled because you're likely to ding 60 with a lot of them still equipped.
---
They were going to get one, but there was a customer uproar. Something about #nochanges
---
Wand OP
---
I’m hoping to get this set, too! Just hit 30, gonna start trying to run SM GY tonight after work.
---
I did not play Holy pally until BC so I can't speak towards it's abilities in Vanilla. If you've played other mmos and know the general ins and outs of healing in those i think you'll  be just fine.
---
This is not a response by you. This is a response by your computer. So now I have over a hundred comments to you that have gone with no real response from you. When are you going to admit that you’re full of shit?
---
ok i watched only few sec and few things i can point out so later on it will be much easyer(thats how u spell  it? ) 
---
in options enable actiom bars, and bind some of the keys. like holding shift+1 till 5 holding alt+1 till 5. preferebly you want to avoid clicking spells with your mouse (like you did with arcane explosion in part i watched)
---
2nd thing is that you want to move more as mage and dont let the mobs hit you. i watched the very start and there after you casted blizzard few mobs runned at you.  you did the right thing using frost nova, but as you saw them comming, you should be able to frost nova and instantly streif away so they cant hit you,not let them get extra few hits in.  so its easyer for healer to heal group (less work for him, less mana used, less down time, faster instance run)  you are very squshie class and later on in game this can save you from wipe. 
---
thats 2 things i saw in 5 secs that i would like to point out. 
---
i hope you enjoy the game and im sure you will learn those things and many other about mage and wow. cheers
---
There’s no way it’s better than the one from LBRs it has hit rating on it
---
OK, what's your point?
---
Blessing of Kings doesn't change the raw value of attack power gained per point of strength. You just get more strength, therefore more ap.
---
I never said that Attack Power was a more valuable stat than strength. What are you even talking about? Have you even read any of my posts??
---
You sound like the type that isn't going to get invited to raid.
---
You’d be surprised what happens when the first person rolls greed. Also my experience varies from a lot of you I’d assume, I only play with friends and guildies from the past so we have some semblance of trust.
---
Perhaps physically
---
Get off your high horse pal.
---
Check the murloc camp (on the islands) in Dustwallow March. And also the human farms in Arathi Highlands. I don’t remember the levels of the npc’s in either of the locations but I know it is in between 30-40
---
LFG SM  Traditional Group
---
Why would you use anything else, right?
---
At least you got it to 35 so you can max out a profession and use the 4 day CD for some income.
---
If you do the leveling strat of killing any enemy on your path to a goal instead of running around them then 13 and some change should be easy to head out to the barrens. Doing that and getting the org FP/RFC quest and doing all 5 of RFC quest sets you up very nicely for barrens.
---
Ah didn't know it's repeatable only at 60. Never bothered with those.
---
Without hit you'll suffer a lot more then 2hand.
---
Also try killing both -2 level mobs and +2 level mobs. You'll likely notice the higher ones will be significantly easier with 2h. 
---
I'm not saying it is undoable. the current meta is established for some very good mechanical reasons. And that is that during leveling hit&gt;all.
---
Yeah the xp curve really flattens out once you hit 30.  Then starts getting worse around level 50.  I think my experience does a good job of highlighting this.
---
What scrolling combat text add-on is that?
---
It works for me. 
---
you have to do the flight first and then it saves the times for next time
---
Hunter having mind control would be pretty cool.
---
And then, when you stab them in the face for being a scammer, they should lose that character and everything it has. Forever.
---
Some int and spirit doesn’t hurt. You will be casting many spells while leveling.
---
He's probably just better at the game now, he didn't know how to play before. Nihilum had to learn so much from retail players of 2019 on how to play vanilla.
---
It’s fucking hilarious how desperate this post is when you think about it. He’s claiming the sole fucking reason he came back to vanilla is to grief lower level players. Let that sink in.
---
How sad and pathetic does your life have to be for this to affect you in such a tremendous way like everyone else here is claiming? If it’s an oversight and gets fixed then that’s great, but to make such an uproar over such a frivolous issue is mind-boggling to me.
---

The lvl50 class quest in Sunken Temple aren’t in phase 1.  If that is what you’re referring to
---
I'm actually a retribution paladin in a Guild already first in line for hand of rag. I'm actually extremely fun guy to play with so?
---
from how he plays you can see that this is his first time playing also for alliance deadmines are the first dungeon.
---
According to this thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/an0dxc/blizzard_has_dropped_the_ball_on_the_new_report/
---
The threshold is as few as five separate reports; so, I start to gather a black lotus, an enemy party who's farming badges in Silithus sees me, mass reports me, I get kicked because they wanted the lotus. Just a hypothetical, and ideally it would only be assholes who get punished by it, but based on the thread I previously linked, and this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c8v9n7/right_click_report_is_here_to_stay/   I decided to start a thread to ask if previous concerns echoed in those and other similar threads were warranted or not.
---
I would go for siphon life. Be sure to take imp. Corruption and fel concentration on the way. Take tge succubus, dot the mobs and start drain tanking or just wanding them
---
How do you switch layers? I’ve never understood the concept, but to add to my own ignorance, I’ve never done any research about it.
---
Would this work to keep combo points on a different mob? If so this would be great for kitties to heal others without losing cp.
---
Just in-case people aren't aware, there's no incentive in vanilla for you to only wear the best armour type. In cata they added a mainstat buff if you wore all plate as a paladin, etc but in vanilla you are always stronger in a mix of gear than you would be by wearing all plate, even as a tank.
---
Shaman healing pre-raid BiS contains 1 or 2 mail pieces, like 4 leather, and 6 or so cloth pieces. It's the same for everyone, warrs wearing leather and mail, etc.
---
I would like to repeat this for mages:
---
DON’T CHEAP OUT ON WATER FOR THE HEALER! 
---
Can’t count how many times I as a priest healer, asks for water, mage crafts 6 water. I’m like wtf? Its free ti craft and I’ll 100% ask for more later in the dungeon. Jesus. Craft 40 and help a mana-depend player out. Even if its more than the healer will need for 1-2 dungeon runs, they be handy for solo questing/farming. 
---
Groups:
---
As a priest healer, I miss the awareness of priests spirit tab. We regen plenty of many if we last hit mobs! Warriors execute, and other dps go ham on the last 1-3% of hp. Please let the healer wand down low targets. This way we dont waste to much mana, trying to last hit mobs with mind blast, smite, mind flay, etc.
---
People bought everything up for the fire protection potion I guess.
---
Now that people are starting to raid, in all honesty, can you tell me if endgame is challenging?
---
I use it on both retail and classic so it was very familiar looking lol
---
Just to update that, you'll only get one digit in the minutes place for cases where it's less than 10. So if i'ts noon, this will print out:  
---
    Donny notes the time, 12:0  
---
What we want is two digits on the minutes section. That can be accomplished with this:  
---
    /run local hour,minute=GetGameTime();local str=string.format("notes the time, %d:%02d.",hour,minute);SendChatMessage(str,"emote")  
---
Which would produce:  
---
    Donny notes the time, 12:00.  
---
I also stripped out any unnecessary spaces from that one so the flavor text can be a bit longer.
---
Yes, I’ve reported people’s names before they’ve been forced to make name changes.
---
Coming from the Barrens, on the right of the guards post along the road, there's a safe passage, I always used that before unlocking flight paths.
---
Enjoy the perm
---
Maybe this is the one time we accept a mobile phone Photo
---
Willingly exploiting this clearly overlooked layering has to give a response from blizz, I hope for you and the others that you can keep your accounts
---
What is?
---
I do need it. Raiding is what I play wow for. I dont need an epic mount. I need to be the best rogue i can be.
---
These will come in another phase I think
---
He's the idiot. The sword would be more useful tanking as it does more damage. More dmg, more threat.
---
That being said, neither is an amazing tanking sword because a lot of threat generation comes from abilities like taunt and sunder. Something with lower DPS but stamina on it makes you more survivable.
---
But honestly, none of this is anything you need to worry about around level 18-20. Use what you want. A good group should steamroll Deadmines pretty easily. You don't need to worry about minmaxing stats much until way later in the game.
---
This is why I never neglect first aid. Spider venom sacs provide a nice source of anti-venom reagents for when the bitey little bastards poison you.
---
Does this imply the warrior allowed the dps to get hurt?
---
im not saying anything about content, im pointing out few things.
---
Hell no
---
One point , if you don't play horde ,  Deadmines is the dungeon .( Since getting in to RFC is pretty much impossible)
---
You can sign up for training pretty much in any city or town. It's just not mandatory.
---
That was exactly what happened in Scarlet Monastary Graveyard.
---
I bought it on my server for 45g. Friend of mine paid 60g for his(we're both rogues)
---
I’m saying it because it’s crazy. People have been saying it for years and no one has proven it.
---
Yeah.. but buying a level 5 white isn't going to set you back on your mount grind
---
Depends what you mean by challenging.
---
Its easier than pservers, but on pservers there were still guilds that struggled clearing BWL, and there probably will be on classic too.
---
Yeah the guy who spent all day writing up a post to explain why they are made they can’t grief other players on an mmo is the hallmark of maturity.
---
You're correct, yes
---
I never had a problem getting that on Private Servers, but on Classic some Grindspots for Greys are way worse. I tried the Jaguars in Swamp of Sorrows and they dropped like 10% of what they dropped on Private Servers. If you ignore the AH its pretty tought to get 100G at 40.
---
Classic+ without a doubt.
---
Literally no point in this but just flexing for karma
---
Trainning dummies in the nearest high school
---
Classic details? 
---
Is tiny threat a stand alone or is it an add on for details?
---
I’d research myself but on phone not pc atm
---
So I have a level 10 Tauren Druid and 11 undead warlock. I was wondering which of thee I should continue or if I should go mags or something to have more fun?
---
The best of the best :)
---
Lol I had an hour to play before work and I decided to make an alt. Spent the whole time thinking of a name.
---
This. Should be added in p2 along with dire maul IIRC
---
No but buying buying swords for 1-5g will later on
---
Just another reason I like classic. Small things to higher level players like a boe green, buffs, bags, money is a gamechanger to lower level players. What can a high level retail player give a low level player other than gold (which they probably already have)
---
/golfclap is my favorite
---
You ask someone in a different layer to group you.
---
How is pointing out the truth a "high horse"? The Greed icon is literally 2 coins.
---
And the OP already cleared it up. You need to get off of *your* high horse and take a chill-pill.
---
Interesting. Ive never had fr gear as a dps before. I relied on pots and my healers to keep me alive to kill rag. I’d hit like a wet noodle as a rogue with fr gear.
---
Can you imagine corpse running with your group to the entrance and enter with broken gear :D
---
I will do this moving forward, I should have taken precaution
---
Yeah man! You have a [bright](https://puu.sh/EhAXe/67ce1ccfd8.jpg) future ahead of you.
---
It's entirely more likely you'll get ganked for that lotus mate. BlackLotusMafia
---
Dude, this is driving me nuts right now. People want you to be 45/46 to join uldaman and I’m like... the place was designed for low 40s
---
It depends on what you want to use however at the same time I believe he is upset as the sword benifits rouges more (they try to get two of them with the defias set)
---
Since it's a low level dungeon, warriors and pally's may still be utilizing maces and I believe cookies is the best at that lvl.
---
In the end a cool move would to be go for one or the other, going for both is a bit greedy
---
Lmao 10/10. Glad I got to see this
---
I have seen that, but only in a couple of low level dungeons.
---
I got aoe II definitive edition beta key that I haven't even touched because I'm too busy playing wow.
---
How do you know if they’re in a different later
---
Spirit definitely has some value, int not so much, and stam some. I would go with 3agi 2 str over that any day though.
---
Lol I guess I hit a nerve it's just a game you type take every thing too serious.
---
If he were to spend that money buying and selling properly it might be but yeah for the avg person prob not.
---
Your drawings had me thinking that there was a WoW anime out there I was not aware of!
---
Its art style is simply amazing and I would support your cause if you ever decided to create an anime in this style! (Would Blizzard allow fan made anime?). If Carbot can pull off a deal, than you most certainly can.
---
Will be following you!
---
Amazing.
---
LF HEALS SM THEN GTG
---
Same thing happened in Badlands on Whitemane. Allies and horde staring each other down from Kargath. They had more 60s and killed our FM though ):
---
That was what i thought. There would not be any real money in that transaction... I freaked out when i saw the guy reporting me so i deleted... Anyway, never was my intetion broke the game rules, just didnt want to lose my 30 gold
---
Just some bros hanging out in Azeroth.
---
Watch it go down from a distance
---
Non 2h tanking hurts the group way more than it helps especially on trash. Warriors shouldn't be trying to tank a dungeon they are under leveled for fo begin with. Shield tanking reduces rage gain by a fair amount and reduces the war dps to pitiful. Using a shield on hard hitting physical bosses is something they should do, but not really on trash.
---
It's better they learn how to properly 2h/dps tank than try to sword/board. Since they will just make their job much harder and if they make a mistake they are even more screwed. Losing aggro with a 2h you might rip it back but you can taunt just like shield, with shield if taunt resist that mob is theirs now. (Yes you can mocking blow/challenging shout, but these aren't applicable every taunt resist)
---
When I upgraded my bags I chased people around whispering 'hey %n you dropped this!', trade them a bag, and run away.
---
He feared, and then casted mind control
---
Looks like mind controlling a feared enemy breaks the mind control. Either you can't MC someone feared, or fear gives MC a chance to break. Or he somehow canceled MC. these are the only options 
---
MC broke and he ran himself into the water instead of you
---
First time playing wow got my shaman to 96g when I hit 40 and bought the training+mount for 90 seemed easy enough
---
Lol makes me think of all the times I see stuff like “LF lvl 30+ “ posted by a level 27.
---
Why? Horde access is arguably easier than ally access.
---
everything is better than reddit lmao
---
Whichs one are you having most fun with?
---
Druid has flexibility so you can be whatever your party needs, warlock while is rather linear, is very strong in dps and has a decent amount of control in pvp.
---
With that said druid is pretty difficult to learn how to play well.
---
I think i went with + int then the one for cast interrupt avoidance then +12% heals. That has been more then fine for any dungeon so far.
---
I’ve been leveling on 3 different servers.. I am completely amazed/disgusted it’s been like that on all 3 servers... wtf for sure.
---
Rolling for cloth over clothies ?
---
On Azuresong, I say "classic is so unfair" everytime I log on and people argue about it until I leave. It's great.
---
Oh my god, for a quest that I've just thought of as "ez exp lol", this hits hard, the look of despair on his face scares me
---
Eww gqqhrrrhu fr rz
---
This is gold! But... I have to admit that I don’t quite know what happened.
---
I wouldn't say I took anything too serious. The in-game rules are there to make the game fun and fair for everyone. Ignoring them would make things less fun.
---
Probably depends on the venue tbh
---
Nice thats good
---
I’m currently on this quest! Kuz was slaughtered last night by my hand, the rest soon to follow.
---
Are you the one that Xaryu 1v5’d?
---
Could've made some nice gold. I'll give away 8 and 6 slots but the silk ones sell for quite a bit and I need money.
---
Yeah but all those that I know of do so many other undesired things. As someone who doesn’t use much addons besides bag organizer and vendor price info, I just want a simple add on that sinply auto sells grays.
---
You only think that because you don't understand how hard it is to get your epic mount. And you don't need that because it doesn't really change anything. You would rather have the best in slot bow then selling it and saving yourself weeks worth of work. You can join a pug with a blue. And it wouldnt make a difference and you will replace that bow your first or 2nd raid maybe. Who knows. If that out wrights weeks of farming. Then hah ok as a rogue...
---
Oh shit I just vendored therm
---
who?
---
Should it be a 50 yard radius by chance?
---
Can you please tell me what addon t
---
Your using for the character bar? I like it it’s real time and shows what percent your at.
---
I see you like crazy people
---
&gt;I would also be okay with getting punished ie my 10k gold removed and temp banned
---
Lmao I'm sure Blizzard will strongly consider that.
---
Learn to quest lol? Complaining that an unintended part of the game isn't going great for you is pretty silly
---
must feel strong killing bunch of low lvls ...
---
I was a cleric by the name Ryen. I miss that game sometimes. I know there’s still private servers but it’s just not the same.
---
The horde cup was brimming so they had to empty it.
---
Of course :) It's Shadowed unit frames, I changed the settings to show the health as a %  [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/shadowed-unit-frames](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/shadowed-unit-frames)
---
Blizzard has never permabanned for anything besides botting, SELLING gold, or threats of violence / hate speech. I would bet everything I have ever owned they don't break that track record. Even the most egregious exploits have been met with either tamp bans or no ban at all. I exploited shamans in firelands for millions of gold, when I got caught I didnt even get a temp ban.
---
Also exploited maxxed out artifact power, only got 7 day ban, didnt even get my AP removed.
---
Agreed!  Also thanks again for your help!
---
I'm sorry for your loss
---
Dude, doing RFC as an alliance was a right of passage back in the day, and super fun.
---
The trick is, you go in naked with all your gear in your backpack, and then death hop. Get as far into Org as you can before players/guards shank you, then res as far away from your body as you can, in the direction of the dungeon entrance. Rinse, repeat. The GY isn't that far, and you might die like fifteen times, but it's part of the fun.
---
Then, when you get into RFC, throw your gear back on. Gear in your bag doesn't degrade when you die.
---
no.
---
Haters gonna hate :)
---
&gt; I am guessing your a woman? 
---
Yeah you're not worth talking to.
---
I will implement this as option in the next version!
---
Have fun getting your entire account banned
---
That, is GENIUS
---
I downloaded it, but I can find no way to create a window with one in the Details addon..
---
Pretty much the only reason I never roll on a pvp realm. I love pvp, i'd love to do it open world.
---
I hate to get ganked or stomped on by a guy 12+levels higher while im just out leveling.
---
Most sensible thing you've said all night
---
It's beautiful. He's so pretty in that dress!
---
&gt; any kind of greed or need rolls in the game. 
---
The buttons literally say "need" and "greed"...
---
Point being?
---
Then you would have to lay there, dead, waiting for someone to come kill him. 
---
That requires 1) the enemy stays, 2) the backup comes before you are released at the gy (2-5 min). 
---
General chat is def. not the way to go, for a thing like this :)
---
Better chance of people having details! at least...
---
It's a vanilla wow joke. Look him up
---
30-40 is pretty great so far. I’m 36 and still have plenty of quests. Shimmering flats, End of hillsbrad, Arathi highlands, STV, and Desolace. The part I dread is late 40s
---
Ewie a steam controller
---
&gt; I’m saying it because it’s crazy. 
---
What's "crazy" is subjective and not an argument. Sure you might think it's crazy. But just because you think something is crazy does not mean that it's not real. 
---
Proven it? How does one prove it? There is nothing to do than to listen yourself and make your own conclusion. For me it's quite clear. What are you looking for? That Blizzard would admit to this?
---
Wow can always claim that that is not what it's saying and that it's just sound - do you think they ever would admit to it? 
---
 I do think there is something going on here, and by really looking into what is being said, it is not crazy to think so, listen yourself. Many have reported about this.
---
I mean, I think the issue is it’s not “the truth” it’s your opinion.
---
You don’t think the need button should be for things you’re selling on the AH.
---
That’s true in some cases, but not all.  
---
So when you just barge in and start spouting your shit without any background information, you’re definitely on one hell of a high horse.
---
apparently it happens if you roll on any item that isn't bottom of the list first. So if you roll on the bottom one first every time it shouldn't happen at all. Also /reload reopens the window if it closes. You can direct that info to your guildie as well. :D
---
Learned this today.
---
GANG GANG
---
The barrens chat holds a special place in my heart.
---
Itemizing as a way to address flawed classes completely removes any gear theorycrafting from the game as the class gets slotted into a very narrow set of selections. I've had similar thoughts, but I'm leery of it because it starts handholding and railroading players. Unless we're talking about a complete rework of itemization in general, which is scarier in more ways than just hybrids.
---
Your biggest fear should be that they don't do Classic+ at all imo. There's some good points as to why it's more likely they'll push the game to WotLK. Cheaper, and a large segment of retail/ex retail players all talk about how WotLK (or TBC) was peak wow for them.
---
How is it griefing? It's hilarious whenever a big monster runs rampant on a town. You might as well complain about world boss kiting. Like, who is the victim here? The reaction is usually "holy shit, you guys have to come and see this!"
---
HOW AR YE?
---
just looked at all the parts.....amazing....really touches the feels. i played hord in classic and remember all of these. Im playing alliance now though for IRL friends, any chance you will do any alliance quests. perhaps hogger?
---
The high level ganker looks exactly like how I'd expect one to look.. Wearing goggles, no less.
---
I'm a mage specced into the kulak tree, so I'm a little concerned about my well being
---
Unfortunately that is how language, as a concept, works. There is no debatable second opinion. That is reality.
---
That cus they're racists and obnoxious.
---
Aye, and?
---
The community  has never strictly used it the way you’re thinking it should be used for.
---
All needing in BoE epics is common and the best way to make sure someone in the group doesn’t ninja it for themselves by hitting need when everyone else greeds.
---
If we don't shame it, it is no longer a kink. It's just.. a thing people do that's normal at that point.
---
Yeah just mail stuff from one character to the other

Look up blizzard's definition, you aren't even entitled to loot only you can equip, people can need roll on it for the purpose of vendor gold, unless they've updated their rules this hasn't changed. The majority of players understand that world drops are free game and always have been, it's extremely shitty to farm for a .0001% item and it happens to be somebody else's, they will never repay you for your 1/5 of the participation. The fair method is to sell it and split the gold 5 ways or to roll off to see who wins it. This is a dead horse on this reddit and it's a dead horse in the game, nobody will take you seriously.
---
"super unique" you are the definition of a dishonest liar unless you sincerely have been completely out of the scene for the years leading up to release, and if you were, you shouldn't be weighing in on this topic.
---
It’s disappointing we got the easiest version of vanilla with the best itemized stats . I am happy we have classic in the first place but it makes no sense why the devs got us  started on this patch in terms of under the hood stats and nerfs to difficulty . Just disappointing.
---
You should open it in an existing window.

amusing and very sad at the same time.
---
i know its a joke...
---
"sorry family i cant spend time with you right now because these random internet people need me"
---
I really see your point there. I intend to create add-ons that only do a specific thing rather then a bunch of random things.
---
I'd rather load many smaller add-ons.
---
That is all that matters indeed.
---
Questing for sure
---
well pussys will be pussys. like i dotn mind if someone higher lvl kills me. if they camp me its other thing. i add them on list and in endgame i will focus on them when ever i see em.  but to be honest i havent had that happen to me once. hence im only 38 but still all who fight me is basicly my lvl
---
Lmao you have to be joking
---
Is there going to be a high score page for classic, so we can look up player profiles?
---
wati.. jokes aside sounds like an awesome dude, respect!

How good is the exalted timbermaw trinket ( [Defender of the Timbermaw](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21326/defender-of-the-timbermaw) ) in pvp scenarios?
---
I plan to gather as many trinkets as possible for pvp but I haven't heard this one mentioned as very high priority. Wondering because I have a lot of deadwood feathers and I could either turn them in now for the free xp/faster friendly/honored rep or save them for the exalted grind later on. If its not that great of a trinket I'll probably not go for exalted and therefore would like to turn in my feathers now.
---
The hell is wrong with you?
---
Honestly depends on the item and level, but outside of them rolling on prebis caster DPS cloth I don't see any major guilds blacklisting them over it. 
---
There's only a handful of items that obviously benefit one class more than another, like the voodoo mask for priests and locks. Most of the gear the stats benefit a shaman as much as a mage.
---
It's literally +14 agility that is enormous wtf?
---
As a rogue this statement confuses me...
---
Im no authority on warriors but generally i've avoided Slam. 
---
I will say though that ive used it on longer boss fights if im capped on rage and im not tanking. 
---
The cast time is usually faster than your auto attack and with a full rage bar you can throw out some pretty solid damage pretty quickly. 
---
Again, not sure if thats its recommended use, but thats my experience with it. 
---
Before Whirlwind / Mortal strike i would avoid Heroic Strike and Rend and just drop sunders and executes. 
---
Demo and thunder clap if you 'really' want to trade rage for a small amount of mitigation.
---
No he is the face of reddit.

---
personally i would have loved to see the hybrid classes become viable with other specs.   that is the sole reason i found tbc to be better than vanilla back in the day.
---
Good for him, he won the staff fair and square, I know you want to attach some emotional quality to what happened and you think portraying what he did as a cold money grubbing reaction will do that, but it doesn't. You want the staff for selfish reasons, so does he, it's a world drop, everybody earned it and you aren't entitled to it because of your class, tale as old as time.
---
Let me just spam arcane explosion on a single target.
---
I'd delete this post bud. You are probably gonna get banned.
---
You come at me with attitude I am coming right back at you that's what's wrong with me I am sick of Internet wankers
---
Those three are from the Robot Chicken escort quest.
---
With a 5 man group, I believe the fastest is questing to 17/18 and then optimally spamming dungeons with a good comp.
---
Solo? Questing all the way + dungeon aoe farms at appropriate levels if you're the right class for it. Mages can aoe farm solo for good xp at a certain point when blizzard comes online.
---
&gt;I mean, I think the issue is it’s not “the truth” it’s your opinion.
---
The button is called "Greed" and it has the image of coins.
---
&gt;You don’t think the need button should be for things you’re selling on the AH.
---
Ask literally any person besides yourself what button you click for an item upgrade and what button you click if you're rolling to sell the item.
---
&gt;So when you just barge in and start spouting your shit without any background information, you’re definitely on one hell of a high horse.
---
I'm not the one getting upset over something simple and then making sexist remarks. And a "high horse" only applies when that person thinks they are better than others, which I never said or implied.
---
Go take a chill-pill.
---
Good to know, atleast you got something out of it then
---
"warn them he followed basic loot rules" Uh Oh.
---
Character Notes for retail works on classic too, lets you add positive, neutral or negative notes to people. You'll instantly see who has a note in chat next to their names.

This guy was always interesting. The only quillboar we ever really talk and reason with. In Cataclysm they actually freed him and he became the new leader of the Razormane, which really made no sense. Let's hope they do something more in Classic +

Took two weeks off work, exploited layering, exploited the XP bug when running 10 man SM.

Yup, look no further than the progressive magazines scoring Dave Chappelle a 0 on rotten tomatoes, then compare that to what viewers actually gave it.

PC culture will be the death of the Democratic party.  It's a big reason Hilary lost, too busy telling men they were sexist for not voting for her while she brought absolutely nothing to the table that you expect your government to actually do for you.

If they didn't want it to happen, they would have changed it during Vanilla's 2-year run.
---
Questing, but when running to a turn in or quest location kill mobs.
---
A few of them are though, maybe only from quests and they are also unique.
---
animals don't drop coin last i checked, they drop high value greys/whites?? The items you find on them are stuck in their hides or w.e else. It's the fun part of a vidya.

Your words not mine

Guy spent 30 minutes spamming chat when he should have done /who undercity priest 31-35
---
then macro'd:
---
"Yo my guy"

"just need 1 healer for SM GY farm"
---
"can instasummon you now - y/n?"
---
I build groups in five minutes with that shit. People always say yes when they realize they can start NOW
---
Great, great song  
---
A personal favorite
---
Ugh lame
---
on Asscandy I make them duel for it. I will be entertained.
---
How on earth can you manage 5 chars at the same time?
---
I tried once with 2, just out of curiosity, and found the positioning is very difficult.
---
Because they call out all the BS with memes, which are hilarious and awesome.
---
Yeah you're probably right. Was just a bit worried given the amount of speculation in those threads I linked, but probably not worth worrying about.
---
One of the reasons I quit a little after cata was that cross server crap they put into place, it made it so anyone could come onto your server and ninja and leave with no consequences. I didnt mind competing with people on my own server but when they made it every server it got stupid. A gigantic group of people from our server were all waiting on pound fist to spawn and we were all grouped up then a group from another server came in and ganked it out from under us. Not to mention dungeons and the crap people ninja'd in those then bailed back to their server.
---
Why though?
---
I thought this is classic wow? I dont remember people needing for shit they dont equip. Of course i want the cool flashy weapon for myself even for only 3 levels. Its a roleplaying game and you collect stuff for your character. You all make a Job out of it with future prices and demand and shit. Play some eve online then and give the cool stuff to people that Play wow the game and not the numbers.
---
When my weapon skill gets to lets say 80/80, is there anyway to increase it or is that just where it will be at?
---
From your description here it does nothing so what's the issue again?
---
This was a net negative that doesn't need to be in the game. Any comparable ability (FD) used by a class to grief is acknowledged as that. Wow Classic will be so likely effected by this change it doesn't matter except to ranting locks here.
---
Absolutely,
---
I have a shaman, 2 warriors, a paladin and like 3 warlocks lol.  (Different servers and races).  
---
Just remember friend, classic wow is a different beast.  There are a lot of people pushing through, trying to get MC on a farm ... it’s been like 3 weeks.  Play the game, enjoy it.  It’s a rare blessing to be able to become 15 years younger, and I get that every time I log in.  The levelling / questing is great ... I’m not looking forward to 60 and the constant spamming for groups with lockout timers.  I mean, it’ll be fine, but the journey is where it’s at.
---
Money is going to quickly depreciate though, not sure by that much
---
Tier set bonuses would be a good way to help hybrid classes
---
I have a 40 mage and a 15-20 warrior/rogue/hunter/pally and I'm playing the alts more and more. Mage is basically impossible to quest with now on a pvp server at night.  
---
Play whatever you feel like and enjoy the rested exp.
---
You're kidding right?
---
Also with a 4th dps mobs die much faster causing less duration of a fight reducing healer stress
---
Yea bro seems like you were being incredibly childish. You spend 75% of your time on classic wow in chat trolling?
---
1) Don't force it.  Let her play the Warlock alone at her own pace to see if she actually enjoys the game.
---
2) Play a class that supports vs. powers through.  Let her be at the forefront you have your other toon to take charge with.  If she's new she needs to be able to explore the game and move on her own.. not he told to move here go here kill this click this do this faster.
---
3) Show her some class breakdowns and maybe let her reroll with you.
---
4) If she doesn't enjoy it she doesn't enjoy it.  She can spend her time elsewhere she may not need to be "convinced" to play more WoW..
---
5) Don't bring up the fact that you outleveled her.  You would just be pushing the fact that she is bad at the game.  Make her some bags/gear.
---
Well my long term goal for classic is to collect each set. I plan to play classic for the rest of my life so I should have time.
---
Your weapon skill max will increase with 5 per level, and then there's some items which give additional weapon skill.
---
I have a guy called Mittromney that shitposts in the barens on my server, tis a weird place.
---
The MC broke and he ran his own character off the boat thinking he was still controlling OP.
---
Yeah just kill things, vendor and do some dungeons and don’t buy every single skill. If you actually *try* to have 100g by 40 it isn’t hard at all
---
Level up. +5 weapon skill per level.
---
&gt; just a shout-out to the GM of Bigglesworth who is prob the world's biggest fuckboi, with his delicate sensibilities
---
It appears so.
---
That's your opinion.
---
...what guides?
---
No really. Point me to a guide that says buy weapons constantly. Every guide I read says to NOT buy weapons because it's a waste of money, and to rely entirely on quest rewards even at lower levels.
---
The most I spent on a weapon was buying some leftover elemental charms to get Whirlwind axe, which has lasted me from 34-39 so far and looks to last well into my 40s. Cost me 5g total and was worth every penny. 
---
I only bought one weapon and that was for a few silver off a vendor because it was a MASSIVE upgrade and limited stock and lasted from 10-20. Since then I've used dungeon drops, excluding whirlwind axe, which will eventually be replaced in a similar fashion.
---
Doesn’t matter *to you*
---
Axe looks fucking awesome with a Tauren. You owe that dude a fair amount of dungeon runs as a tank.
---
Its deadmines, shits not hard. We cleared that in white items underleveled easily.
---
I'm gonna screenshot this, for you when you make a post about why no one likes discussing things with you.
---
Also, you need to be level 35 for artisan training.
---
I'd gladly pay a few extra gold to have it all done in the same trade window.

I think what he is trying to say is that its a marathon not a **sprint**.
---
This is super common and a part of classic. Cloth isnt just for clothies. 
---
As a clothy youll regularly have competition for rolls against priests, warlocks, mages, holy paladins, resto / ele shaman, and resto / balance druids.
---
This and Legend of Stalvan. Love em!

right. If Shadowward pain does 288. Does it add 10 to that and distribute over 18/24 seconds?

Bruh, EULA, everyone's feelings included.  Just because we invented condoms doesn't mean people use them.  Just like a mature language filter.
---
Whatever you say, snowflake..
---
Doubt it, I'm actually a much better player on controller in all honesty (as yikes as that might be, it works for me). It forced me to break a lot of bad &amp; lazy habits I was complacent with as a keyboard player. Been winning the vast majority of my pvp fights against people within \~4 levels of me.
---
Was just a blanket statement to cover every change that is different.  But I would be against paid transfers either way, especially this early.  You got your reputation on your server and you deal with it.  Theres certain people on my server already becoming notorious, don't want them to be able to bounce with all their ill gotten gains to have a fresh start on another server.  They will be ostracized for their actions and they need to deal with it or reroll.
---
I'm silenced for 7 days my dude
---
Ah ok
---
Honestly shes just not into it.
---
I know *exactly* what you mean by this. Lol
---
Because they don't want the final boss to be impossible. Blame the dungeon difficulty scaling.
---
Phew. Had me worried there for a bit. Noob rogue here.
---
Is the command still /inflight ? It says error type /help for me
---
I mean I last night 2h tanked all of brd except emp t, which I switched back and forth when he enraged. Its viable even at 60 for war tanking
---
Thanks man, none of my friends have played Hunter before, and me neither, so this is my first time leveling a Hunter and I'm loving it
---
Why are people so mad? need to be a little less like the BFA sub yikes. I didn’t post my twitch, or any cringe nonsense- just said server and location and y’all flaming out ur seats. Chill out neck beards
---
who are you to judge how someone spends their time? Endlessly raiding endgame doing the same run? Rather than running around pvping and chatting. Like everyone plays for different reasons. It's my release.
---
Guess ill screen people when making groups then.
---
We have sooooooo many warriors and a lot of rogues in our guild so we have been spamming UBRS for like 10 ish hrs a day with a rotating grp for breaks etc. We got 8 mainhands on Friday night and 3 more yesterday. Last night we had both MH and OH drop on the same kill. All - in all i believe we have completed 10 sets now and have 5-6 people with one or the other. This is all in 3 days farming.
---
To pug it with different people every time is where the RNG gets maddening but if you can get a good consistent grp of friends to do it with, its really not that bad compared to like Ironfoe spams etc.
---
Would be better to join their group and say you gotta finish up this quest, then never go to the dungeon.
---
Hahahaha fair effort then but youll find it more enjoyable with out the chats so enjoy this week
---
I wish man, this was back in the day. Pre burning crusade. I haven’t had the time to level past 20 since classic launched.
---
Streamers have been wiping constantly, both on raid trash and bosses and even in ubrs/strat etc. There's enough challenge to have some for at least a few months. The only people really bored by day are those that have farmed it for years on private servers, and even they are now racing to see what they can exploit/break the most.
---
20g a day is not so much gold...
---
Yeah this’ll get name changed real quick. We had Thralls Deep on Skeram and got flagged...
---
I don't want be an asshole, but more like someone babysit you all the way
---
Shaman always nukes warlocks. The only thing you can hope as warlock is to get deathcoil up and run or encounter a big noob that doesnt use any abilities.
---
Death coil is lvl 42+
---
Ye warlocks are ranged but thats the problem, shamans just dont give a fuck. 
---
At this lvl warlocks dont have Infinite mana that starts from 34/36+
---
You are a shaman, do you care about dots? No you dont. 
---
As i said 8lvls difference is hardmode.
---
Usually it starts to be a threat at 6lvl below or higher.
---
I know right?  
---
I haven’t even got to the dungeon scene yet but at the some time I see it.  There’s a weird meta.  I remember spending maybe 2 months getting to 60, and then gearing in dungeon stuff before doing MC and BWL ... it wasn’t coming anytime soon ... I had my nemesis head from Ony way before I could touch BWL.  Now there are high 50’s running MC wearing trash .... I’m not sure what changed.  Is it just knowing the strat?  I dunno
---
It's okay, he "already knows what you're thinking". That's the thing about arguing with a strawman: you can sit there and dissect it at your pleasure and, in a final hoorah proclaim you've, like, totally owned the libs. And this time, like definitely this time, the ***sheeple*** will wake up to some Truth Bombs™.
---
I was at 12 gold last night at LVL 25. I should be close to 100 by time I'm 40 I figure no?
---
Ahahaha. "Truth bombs." Amazing.
---
I'm well aware of the politics.
---
The fear worked, there was simply no where for the Tauren to run.
---
Where do i sign?
---
Wait what! Can anyone confirm this?
---
I don't think that would be an acceptable vacation destination for my fiancée.
---
I'm guessing you are referring to streamers of the likes of asmongold where people don't bother even looking up what they are supposed to do? Sure they had issues.. they still clearing the raids though despite that.
---
Had one drop for me in scholomance back in the day. The following week I found a myrmidons signet. Pretty sure I used up all my dice in that two week period.
---
Heroic strike doesn't give you an extra attack though. It's actually potentially worse to HS with a slow weapon because you lose more potential rage from the white hit you don't do.
---
Anyone who would want the warlock "punished" would probably be insufferable. Never before this thread have I seen anyone complain about loose infernals.
---
Seeing how they handled previous exploits already I doubt they're gonna be around long
---
Another difference in some settings is that dragons have front "arms", while drakes don't.
---
Exactly, chud.
---
The only candidate who will save us from the robot overlord's. Honestly he's the only person I think that understands the automation problem.
---
The community would be a lot less toxic if people stopped coming here talking about how they run into toxic people. 
---
Also, you being toxic right back doesnt make you any better. In fact, coming to reddit talk about how you delivered justice kinda makes me cringe.
---
About ever hour I get a new one.
---
This is exactly why I don’t play pvp servers. Just a few people minding their own business, and some rando messes up their day because he wants to feel like a badass.
---
But on a more real note. The game defaults you into having mature language filter ON. If someone switches that off, they are literally saying, "yes, you may subject me to bad language."
---
Barely anyone ganks while leveling, I got ganked less than 20 times leveling on a full server, i wouldn't worry about a problem that doesn't exist.
---

---
Had to give ya' a hug, you looked so sad. I'm a healer more than a hordie anyway.
---
That’s gotta be some bullshit. No way they patched MC on boats
---
Depends on your luck with drops a lot of greens is easy $
---
Thats why I rolled a warrior ;)
---
Dont fight cancer with cancer. You tagging the mob was correct. Good day
---
Was honestly worth the wait. I'd do it again too
---
Might take a little longer to set up a group, but thats always an option! 
---
Towards end game its not uncommon to be the group leader and announce that youd like to 'reserve' a specific item if it drops that run. Obviously you should tell the group while recruiting, before you head to the dungeon. 
---
I recall tanks and healers joining groups on the condition that they can reserve items as well. 
---
Not always of course, but it happened every now and again.
---
I got a Felstriker before I managed to get an Eye or Dal'rend.
---
Have you ever seen someone get upset about a big monster in town? I doubt it. It's fun, funny and shows off the dynamics of the game.
---
It's weird seeing people like you use the term "griefing" like this mechanic is designed to upset people or actually has done so.
---
Watch out for my cheats as i slowly level a warrior and priest via questing.
---
Technically yeah, but they'll agro everyone and everything in there. The only time you'll see horde in SW or IF is if they're raiding it for fun.
---
Sometimes she goes, sometimes she does.
---
Way she goes.
---
5-man druid tank is fine, healing 5-mans fine.
---
Offtanking raids fine, raid healer fine.
---
Strong in OWPvP, and Premades, mostly flag carrier or node protector.
---
I did a quest you pick up on the border between Duskwood and Deadwind Pass where you have to grind alligators. They have a pretty good drop rate on grey crocolisk tooth's. I made over a gold when I returned to town.
---
If that’s true I’ll be willing to do it agin then. I do miss the days long games though. I’ll just be happy as long as it’s not a 5-15 min race like it is now.
---
Maybe one where you've been together for 2 1/2 years, but only been physically together for about 9 months of that because the rest is spent long distance, and then the distance really starts to get to her so she asks if you can take a break because she really just has a lot going on and needs to sort some stuff out, and you know she has a lot going on in her life as well as mentally, so even though you know it's not a good idea, you agree to it anyways because you kind of dont have a choice anyways and you know that's probably what's best for her, so you completely cut all contact and play classic wow and shitpost on reddit to keep you distracted instead? 
---
Or, idk, something like that.
---
Mace is better for humans if they play fury because 5 skill are worth a lot. For arms axe is still better though because of the axe specialization talent.
---
Is your server a brand new one after release? I’m actually surprised there are servers where rag/ony are not killed yet.
---
He doesn’t deserve it, being an Alliance warlock is punishment enough
---
Yeah I hate groups like this had one last night where some guy ninjas a green. I just immediately leave after
---
1996 fam
---
The way of the road
---
Wait what? I hope you are bullshitting me.
---
Thats like half the fun of taking the boat, the smug-faced Dwarf priest picking his target and me trying to hide somewhere, but also hide somewhere where I can see people getting jumped off the boat.
---
My phone usage time drop 40% since classic came out. I used to be on it 3.5 hours a day, now I’m barely on it for 2 hours
---
The price will decrease as more people level their leatherworking... You'll have to judge hope long you're willing to wait for yourself
---
Just turn them off. Interface &gt; social &gt; bottom right
---
You're right, there's nothing fun about a giant monster rampaging through a town.
---
Haha yea that's insane.  Then you only had like 20% mana from the start while he was at full.  Oof.
---
Good job!
---
Should rename this "how not to be a bad mage"
---
Thanks a lot, mate! Yeah, a comic is a big time sink and at this moment I can't afford it. Full time job and all.
---
Teach me to click my cooldowns daddy
---
Right?? Druids are the anti-warrior and anti-rogue. 
---
Pounce, rake, shred, roots, insect swarm, moon fire, travel form, run, roots, insect swarm, moon fire, travel form, run...
---
The only reason to play alliance
---
Even if I knew, I wouldn't want to.  So many people just don't get what makes a game fun...
---
Those are worth a couple hundred gold hold onto them lol
---
Listen to yourself, though. You're seriously SO afraid of committing wrongthink, you don't even pause to check if the people being called racists and nazis are actually what they are being labeled.
---
Jus wait not that big of a deal
---
The bulk of paladins haven't hit max level yet AND we don't have BGs yet.
---
Give it time
---
His quest is bugged though
---
I made a priest for my main and love it, but also want to have an alt or two. 
---
I leveled a mage to 20 but finding groups with my warlock friend has been a pain because we're both DPS. So I'm thinking I want to make a druid or paladin so I can tank or heal in a pinch. Having a really tough time deciding, both classes seem so cool! 
---
Any thoughts on druids vs paladins for leveling and dungeon running on a pvp server?
---
Mac book pro you say
---
Forgot FF for the rogue:)
---
This would be epic and add a whole other level to world pvp
---
Yeah, all these arguments against it rely on this fictional crowd that somehow got upset about it. Who is going to log into an MMO and then be like "ugh, look at all this dynamic chaos going on!"
---
That’s a ban, sir.
---
Why do they care so much about the 0,00001% who get offender about everything?

It's both lol people say alot more racist shit when they are online. Whether there trying to be edgy or are actual racist hard to tell. If the only way you can be funny/edgy is racist jokes etc. Well you aren't that funny imo. Also now everyone is trying to out do the next guy so it's a downward spiral to more racist not funny instead of slightly racist funny things that you could probably say in public.
---
He’s using Leatrix plus
---
I guess I'll be the first one in 25 comments.... thank you for posting this! 
---
Getting this on the front page will get it fixed much quicker. 
---
/Fuck the guilds that abused this. Ban every member. Revert every AH purchase. Publicly hang their characters in Orgrimmar and Ironforge and keep their banned corpses up as a reminder.
---
&gt; Unfortunately that is how language, as a concept, works.
---
Based on this logic I can replace any word with another word and if used enough it becomes my language and not jibberish. It's extremely debatable.
---
Or go to work then come back and hop in the same AV you left before work.

WTS on Grobbulus:
---
Widowmaker - 1,000,000 gold on retail, preferably on Tichondrius (Alliance or Horde)
---
Viper - 100,000 g
---
WTS on Whitemane:
---
Kasumi - 200,000 g
---
Angela - 200,000
---
i have done this so many times, glad to see another rogue doing it, its so satisfying
---
Mostly groups of other warriors 30-32 struggle bussing kill these 34-37 mobs
---
Oh look, another exploit provided to you by Layering!
---
Is this the addon that alerted you your HP was low?
---
Good duel. This dude is chill af!
---
Honestly can't tell if this is ironic. It should be ironic, but you never know. Ganking lowbies is a million times more disgraceful than having fun with infernals.
---
Zoom back in time. "WHAT?! Someone else took Plz?! I guess I'm stuck with Pls but if I ever run into them in game..."
---
It's a subreddit dedicated to President Donald Trump, you should come check it out /r/The_Donald
---
Yes, it was :)
---
They did a really, really clever job of delivering the various plotlines of vanilla imo. My favourite is how Silithids and Ahn'qiraj are slowly introduced to the players, starting with a low level quest in the Barrens.
---
&gt; You are simply wrong; idiots using words in the ‘wrong’ way are literally redefining the word to mean something else.
---
Confusing the meanings of weeb and otaku is not language evolving. It's being uneducated and using incorrect language to portray what you're trying to say. If someone calls a dog a cat, that doesn't make them a linguistic innovator. It makes them wrong.
---
You're a better man than me
---
&gt;explained how to do it and shared it on a public site
---
that's the noble thing to do. this will get fixed today thanks to it being public knowledge.
---
Wouldn't it raise some red flags if one player put all that shit on the AH
---
a couple thousand you mean
---
&gt; macbook
---
yep, Macbook. Hard disk is super small. Retail takes like 60 something GB
---
Not saying they aren't (my main is a feral druid), it's just a mechanic where they differ in how they mitigate from warriors; and crushing blows are certainly a thing in classic.
---
Wait... That place is real? I thought it was just a circle jerk reference I wasn't getting. 
---
Holy shit
---
Most people won't be able to get whirlwind axe at all, it's not really reasonable to assume having 4 people on standby to do the quest for you. People will get ravager at 37 and stick with it.
---
Bliz has their own forums that they check. Posting on reddit is just to make it a bigger issue causing more people to do it.
---
I convinced a guy to jump off the zeppelin so I felt bad and made him a few bags lol
---
About the same but I'm horde
---
exploit early exploit often
---
Damn, really? How is he mentally unstable? Whether you like his policies or not, likening him to Trump is ridiculous.
---
If the commenters are right about you getting permanently banned, there is a path to salvation. Give the money you exploited away to others. Small chunks of gold to randoms. Your name will be a legend on your server, something of a Robinhood.
---
But it doesn't. U talked about a server u aren't even on, claiming I was just bitching. Now that it's out that it's 70/30, it's "well it still stands for my server".
---
Never attack someone who’s already in a fight or not at full HP.
---
I stay passive as long as I get attacked or see an ally of me getting almost killed. I wouldn’t interrupt 1v1 fights though unless the enemy is outleveling my ally.
---
I don't think anyone is debating that a bug in Blizzard's game is obviously Blizzard's fault but he's definitely going to get banned for it
---
Thanks man, to be honest I think i hit my [Feedback] spell at the right time, causing him to pretty much kill himself. Then the wand sealed the deal ;)
---
red = dead
---
It is possible to construct short, mostly-intelligible phrases or words by abusing the limited number of one-letter and two-letter words in the WoW languages. I believe the process for deciding which conword is used is algorithmic, meaning that the language parser funnels down a large variety of inputs to a tiny number of outputs and that the specific output is decided by some consistent method. 
---
If you take Orcish for example, it has these one-letter and two-letter words:
---
A, N, G, O, L
---
Ha, Ko, No, Mu, Ag, Ka, Gi, Il
---
You can tell the opposing faction anything that you can construct out of these building blocks by finding out which inputs result in the desired outputs. For instance, the Orcish input "d c d" results in Alliance seeing "l o l".
---
However, the input "I c I" also results in "l o l", because the parser crams a bunch of different inputs into one output instead of actually translating anything. So, you can take advantage of the system somewhat, but it's not reflective of a functional language. And you can't use this method in reverse (i.e. to translate something typed in English through the Orcish parser) because you have no way of knowing which four-letter word your opponent is intending for you to read. There's only a handful of words for each character length up to 12 characters.
---
No idea what happens to strings of 13 or longer. Possibly automatically split or truncated.
---
Lol damn. You know that’s not true about all of us right? 
---
You’re welcome for being the voices that brought classic to blizzard’s attention tho.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
Kick him
---
Silly and funny 😄
---
lol stick to pve servers. You dont need a reason to PvP. World pvp is tons of fun and without flying this is the best it will ever be. Youre either about it or your not. PvP any chance i get. I dont pvp for HKs or gear, its all for fun.
---
Best espionage class in the game. Rogues can only stealth themselves; Priests can stealth a whole party. Mind Soothe makes dungeons twice as fast, Mind Vision gives extensive information of the surrounding 2000 yards, and Mind Control trivializes dangerous pulls and allows for some serious shenanigans with buffs as well. A Priest properly utilizing their "non-combat" skills can make up for three players at once. I've two-manned dungeon bosses with just my Mage brother. I can do full boss clears of LBRS in under an hour by skipping half the packs. And Priest even has the best Undead CC in the game to boot.
---
That's not even taking into consideration the PvP hilarity of MCing people into Blackrock Mountain lava or off the Booty Bay boat.
---
Bump
---
Does the cost go down by 5g every week you keep your spec until it's back down to 1g?
---
&gt; From your description here it does nothing so what's the issue again?
---
It's an unnecessary change that affects class fantasy and immersion. As you can read from numerous comments this is an element which matters to the feel of the warlock class.
---
yep.
---
Okay awesome!  Is it frowned upon on that I may lose server rep or is it fairly accepted?
---
The silk group I joined was so happy to have me and more than willing to give up the silk.. but at the same time I don't want to come off as a dick in the future.
---
I don't even know what exists in SM but I get so many requests to heal for it. I'll probably try running it tonight just to see (wont be selling my service since I want to go).
---
You just hit the nail on the head with why I feel weird about all these mocking comments. The guy exploited, but instead of telling us he could have just kept exploiting. Now blizzard will be able to find out all the people who have done this.
---
Did he write blizzard about it and give them time to fix it?
---
Dude, Sweet!
---
Hopefully you can find a constructive hobby to get you through the next 5 years.
---
Not all electronic music is edm.
---
These undead just wanted to rejoin their living families and you're asked to to be an assassin for hire, ethically you should probably skip it anyway.
---
Yep. But usually items have more pure specific spell dmg on it. So pure 20 shadow dmg might be greater than 10 dmg and healing. IIRC your healing spells dont really count as healing, they count as shadow so shadow is your best stat mostly. 
---
If questing, youll want stam to survive an extra mob or two or a gank. Let your dots do the work before you die, but grab shadow spell power wherever you can within reason. I wouldent give up 10 stam for like 4 shadow spell power while questing if that makes sense.
---
Always room for one. I'm my guild's shadowpriest. If you know what you're doing, you can put out at least serviceable DPS with the best utility boosts of all hybrid specs.
---
I don't see why people are ganking and going out of the way to do world pvp since honor isnt in the game yet so I'm pretty passive unless I get attacked first and since I'm alliance on herod and horde have no honor or respect its always  3v1 fight even tho it does nothing but just ruin my gameplay. I would understand it even wouldnt mind it once honor is implemented but it's just stupid at this point.
---
That mage is so bad
---
Same boat so I’ll be keeping an eye on this thread. I got used to Pally tanking too around the same time as you and Warrior tanking is completely different. One addon I’ve really enjoyed so far is ThreatPlates, very useful for keeping an eye on mobs and knowing if you lose aggro on one. Shows your applied debuffs above the plates too which I love for keeping an eye on sunders.
---
Fair enough. I respect your opinion.
---
Better than the guy named Peterbeater on my RP service. This is at least clever.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community
---
It's not 100% accurate but it's probably pretty close, especially on larger servers.
---
Yea it was epic.
---
Only error I saw was fearing him since he has WOTF but maybe not even am error as it scared him IRL, made him react, and saved you another frost bolt.  So I take that back by the time I finished typing it lol.
---
Some basic and advanced Macros for the Rogue Class in World of Warcraft Classic.  These Rogue Macros all work in the Classic Client.  I hope they can make your gameplay experience smoother and make all your alliance killing easier!  Hope you enjoy!
---
I only went on him cause he started a mob i needed for a quest
---
Normally about the same.  If some high level ganks me running by while I'm minding my own business I definitely go on my own lowbie ganking spree for at least the next few hours anyone I see.  Pay it forward.
---
Yes always nice for an exploiter who took the exploit way too far to just admit guilt, describe how it was done and how often, and then start the ban process for him and his whole group.
---
Best city for a blacksmith imo. The forge/bank and AH are all on the first bluff - as opposed to org/uc where you have to walk 10mins every time.
---
&gt;but don’t just ban because you don’t agree with me
---
If you came into my discord and started disagree with shit with me, Id ban you to. You literally went out of your way just to share your opinion, and now youre upset that there was consequences?
---
Mages are pretty mediocre in dungeons unless you 1337 aoe pull. They need way too many drinking breaks unlike warlocks, hunters, rogues and dps warriors. Still great for the utility though. Well maybe I've just been encountering bad mages tbh.
---
Thank you! 
---
The sword, to me, makes me think of the messer first. Just without the crossguard. A German weapon that was made to get around sword laws at the time... and the helmet makes me think Scandinavia, kind of? But not 100%? But I can see where "samurai" can very, very easily come to mind. In the picture the orc does kinda seem more like an oni. 
---
I appreciate you digging that up!
---
Do not associate donglovers with trumpets, please.
---
That's so great to watch!  You could just see the little shit thinking to himself, "Oh, I'm gonna get that lowbie!  He thinks he's safe?  Watch this!"
---
If you move to early when MCing you lose the MC. He attempted to run you into the water immediatly and broke the mc as it hadnt "stuck"
---
Trying to flame? There was no flame anywhere on my side, my guy. 
---
I was trying to figure to the true intent behind my “ban” etc. 
---
Happy to post proof of my interaction if you want? I don’t really mind.
---
Lol I will murder the shit out of you if you're red. I do not care what level you are. Bring your friends, I'll kill them too. Horde have been ruthless on Sulfuras, I will pay it back any chance I get.
---
Yep.
---
You can use library lvl 34 dagger too. Damage is good like any other dagger
---
High'ish level named "Pandasekz" yet my level 2 Shaman got a forced rename for "Scrotem". 🙄
---
TSM
---
I was in Goldshire today, and it was fun. Weirdly enough not even in an erotic way. 
---
Just me, female priest  "chatting with a female paladin while we sat in the chairs  and started chatting with a warlock guy that was standing behind me (which of course was impure for us holy women) who I've first tried to cleanse with my holy spells.
---
It was cool until he started cheering for himself.
---
Nice strawman.
---
thanks! i'm debating on which healer to go with. druid or priest
---
Thanks for sharing. Upsetting that you exploited so much. But good to get the word out. I hope blizzard sees this asap and fixes it. As it is game breaking...
---
Weird how high schools in 1974 had gun clubs and people brought their guns to school all the time, and there were no shootings.  Wonder what changed?  Couldn't possibly be demographics, single mother households, SSRI drugs, nah lets just blame guns.  DERP.
---
Only attack when provoked. Otherwise I’ll let them quest. I’m only level 33, so until around 50 I don’t feel like starting shit
---
This is terrible. I hope Blizzard are able to revoke the exploited gear and at least some of the gold. Looking forward to phase 2 and the end of layering.
---
sensational
---
I've seen it. I'd say try to find a large active guild to run with. most people in my guild are 30-50 so are looking for am a lot. What server are you on?
---
Chappelle just dropped possibly the best standup special of the decade, there's still some damn good comedy out there.
---
Rip guild lmao
---
&gt; The cooldown is one hour multiplied by the number of warlocks in existence
---
Then how come there aren't one infernal pr. every warlock in existence in lowbie zones? That's right. That's because people don't do it all the time. 
---
Those are not valid arguments for changing the game. People want the classic experience. Being able to summon an Infernal in a lowbie zone is part of why people want to roll the class. That's why it should be there. It does not matter how annoying it is. And as you admit yourself, it's not even that annoying. That must clearly diminish the "annoyance" argument for changing it. The fact that it can be a nuisance (in theory by the way... nobody has expressed any real annoyance over Infernals) is not a valid argument for changing classic. The so-called "problems" with Infernals are strictly theoretical. Nobody actually had an issue with Infernals. Furthermore, lots of things are nuisances yet they are kept in the game. They aren't subject to change, however. 
---
The closest thing I can think of is people pulling high level mobs into major cities, yet Blizzard decided to keep this feature for nostalgic reasons. 
---
In the *best* case it doesn't even improve the game. It *only* makes the game more streamlined for players *at best*. That's exactly the main complaint about BfA.... That it's too streamlined.
---
How in the world is it not an argument to keep it for nostalgic reasons when the *entire game* is released because of nostalgia?
---
How is it not possible to understand that argument? One has to be either stupid or willfully ignorant not be able to see that.
---
Yea I would like clarification on this too. It doesn't look like the NPC that hosts the tournament is even in game, which means the tournament isn't.
---
Fuck me I guess for thinking that it would be there.
---
It works by catching 40 Tastyfish from pools that spawn in STV between 2-4pm server time. You can get other rare fish for side rewards that are basically +fishing skill.
---
I have the same problem. It usually says either 'out of range' or 'unknown unit'. No idea why it's happening.
---
The shield come in clutch and saved my life, LUCKY
---
Many people, myself included, want to play but aren’t in a position to schedule our lives around a queue for a video game
---
Fun. You just know that at least some players you kill will be absolutely seething and that makes it worth it
---
It is very easy indeed
---
This is how vanilla was. You chose a side and stayed on that side. If you want another side either delete all your toons or join a different server
---
If only you were horde on Krom, we would have loved to have you
---
Not THAT quickly. Repair bills are great moneysink when you're wearing raid-tier gear.
---
Has to be bullshit. No fucking way they would do this.
---
If you don't mess with me I won't mess with you. However if someone is attacking another horde member I'll jump in. Unless it's 1v5, in that case I'll run and hide.
---
This unless I’m real keen on questing then the peasant alliance can live.
---
Always attack on sight, preferably letting the mob they are attacking get the killing blow. Take that durability hit horde scum.
---
Yeah I was wondering the incentives without salty title too.
---
So basically going for the + fishing gear rewards.
---
Because it is a bad thing
---
Stormstrike is 1 extra attack in Classic.
---
I never said that he has no skill or that he wasnt extremly gifted at wow pvp. Same applies for drakedog - warlock and perplexity - rogue. The thing thats anoying is so many people here on reddit automaticaly assume that "this is the way it goes against class x or y" after seeing some vids of those people. Outside of highly optimized duel specs that are gimped in any other part of the game you have always a chance to win a fight in classic. Thats what makes it way more fun than later expansions were you often just /cry and wait if your counter class ganked you.
---
Exactly what happened.   He got excited but didn’t let the MC settle and yeeted himself into fatigued water
---
Is it possible you're using aoe or cleave abilities that hit the mobs the other players are fighting? That'll keep you in combat until the mob dies.
---
If you are not optimizing sweeping strikes, fury will undoubtedly be better for leveling. What 2 hander do you have? The two 1-handers you have are nice and will be better than WW axe, especially with sword spec.
---
u gotta drop engineering and relearn it. then the book selects ur spec
---
URIST, FETCH THE BOOK!
---
&gt; Any thoughts on druids vs paladins for leveling and dungeon running on a pvp server?
---
Druid leveling &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; paladin leveling by far, dungeon or otherwise.
---
Druids are also way stronger in OWPvP.
---
How do you tell if someone is in a different layer?
---
Some attacks do this like the warriors bloodrage ability.
---
*leave pls*
---
You say "needed". I've never gotten to the raids, so I'm asking for knowledge's sake. Were they literally unable to change who they're aggro'd onto without a taunt, or could someone over-dps and out-aggro the tank?
---
Theoretically, if a warrior (or other classes) could skirt their threat closely enough to the main tank, could they over-take aggro and gain the threat without a taunt?
---
I realize what happens in real gameplay and what could happen in theory can be completely different, but in theory?
---
When later on? You get very good weapons from dungeons starting at around 18. At 30 you should immediately get whirlind axe and really dont need to replace it before 40 (or you replace them with ravager/bonebiter)
---
Stupidahole
---
If you want to test your luck you can try farming the whelplings in wetlands, they drop decent ish vendor items, but if you get lucky and get a pet they can sell for quite a bit. I got 2 pets in 3 hours and decided to keep one. I would check AH though because they can be hard to sell for a decent price right now since everyone is leveling.
---
Can confirm that it’s not true.   Yeeted 7 allies this morning.  However after I did 3 in 1 ride my game froze and I d/ced and came back in a mountain in feralas soooo lmao
---
Is this a meme post bc omfg think about what you are writing right now. Do you have additional experience in the Navy Seals?
---
Well that is banworthy.
---
I first read this as enraged.
---
Dual spec wasn't added until wotlk.
---
Same on Rattlegore. Barrens chat is sometimes just a chat window for unironic MAGA assholes. I spent like 20 min last night going through it and ignoring people.
---
Why windowed mode?
---
I've already blocked the guy so I can't see the comment and link it. The conversation is over anyways.
---
Gross.
---
L33t speak only plz
---
It is the noble thing to do for sure. Blizzard just don't care and ban you regardless.
---
Casual racism isn't supposed to be as much fun now that marginalized groups have social power to fight back.
---
Working as intended.
---
I'm surprised Blizzard is letting it get like this. It's bad for business.
---
Because it can be fun. Fights breaking out over quest objectives, minor skirmishes turning into all out war as reinforcements from both sides move in, raids on towns, the sense of danger in the world, lots of stuff.
---
But yes I've always wished there was a halfway house between PvE and PvP that didn't allow a skull level enemy to attack a much lower player, at at least a game mechanic that discouraged, or gave the lower level a way to compete, or just something. How can a Level 40 vs a Level 20 ever be fun? (for either side frankly).
---
Edit: Let me know when you've read so I can delete this comment. Downvoters stifling discussion again.
---
I'm pretty stoked with the community still I had an unknown level human alliance warlock come up and help me kill things that were above my caliber in the shimmering flats.  Wherever you are dude/chick in Skeram realm ILY.
---
Omg I love wpvp
---
Either Blizzard already knew or they are terrible at watching over this portion of their game.  Surely they have analytics that would show these bosses being killed far more often than the other bosses in the instance.  I'm also glad this guy said something, but honestly I don't think anything needed to be said.  Blizzard dropped the ball on this one.
---
WoW can be Alt tabbed and it’s like nothing happened. I just google my problems, the game is 15 years old, why wait for someone to reply to a post when the info is readily available. Lol
---
LeT tHe ImMiGrAnTs In!
---
You haven't played on original vanilla huh? That's reasonable argument, but being on dead server sucks, trust me.
---
Nice - so many subtle time saving/quality of life changes to abilities here. I am a returning player but have never delved quite as deep into a class as this. Thanks for the vid
---
If it truly benefits both, I usually leave them alone.
---
Other times, I just don't want red on my screen !
---
Downvote it then coward
---
I had 96 gold when dinging 40 and did nothing special at all. Not buying unnecessary skills saves tons of money.
---
Plz don't start this kind of post here. The dnd Reddit is horrible for this reason.
---
I like the art though I guess
---
multiboxing is cheating.
---
But banning you for questioning is a bit stupid, but then again I don't have any reason to believe some stranger on the internet who claims this is why he got banned.
---
Not to say Drain Tanking isn't powerful, but if you get CSed or Kicked or any number of interrupts that lock you out of a school then you are pretty much chopped liver. 
---
So it isn't as cut and dry as you're making it out to be here.
---
lol having to listen to news outlets cry and whine all day is much worse
---
Spam shadowbolt as warlock? In raids, sure, but if you spam shadowbolt while leveling you aren't going to hit 60 lol
---
Wow good job. You got butthurt and then became a hypocrite. Nice.
---
Really? You really think people loading the AH up with certain items, multiple people with 1K gold mounts.. The guy said himself they can afford anything they want for months just off of what they've done so far...
---
Give it another week, 2 weeks.. It would become obvious. 
---
People STILL ask for layer hops after the fix a while ago.. Layering was a good idea for the first couple days, now it's ruining a game..
---
Don’t make such a dumb name.
---
There are a few quests in Desolace, Shimmering Flats (Thousand Needles), Dustwallow Marsh and Southshore.
---
No way that can be true
---
Also the fact that people will be looking at how to farm gold and will oversaturate the market with items that are/were worth a lot, which brings down the amount it is worth. That plus now a days everyone knows how to make more money than back then so gold itself is going to be a lot more common.
---
It's literally the developers fault for putting in layering in the first place. Everyone said it was going to be abused, and it has.
---
Why are you still commenting then lol. Nothing you say changes anything. Op is crying he was banned from a discord that is ran by someone he does not know.
---
There's a guild on my server called PVPness. I giggled way too much for my age.
---
No shit. It’s literally not possible unless you get help from people as a fresh 30.
---
If you don't like it downvote it I don't really care
---
You will be waiting a while if you want to sell this for decent money.
---
Check this screenshot out
---
[https://i.imgur.com/itwCAol.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/itwCAol.jpg)
---
The top one is def stance
---
2nd is berserk
---
3rd is battle stance
---
Notice how the binds for z/x/c/q/e etc swap on each one
---
This is a screenshot on how to configure bartender to do that:
---
[https://i.imgur.com/GPvXafp.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/GPvXafp.jpg)
---
The section w/ the shouts is a bartender bar set to 3x4 so it matches the layout on my thumb buttons
---
These are set to wacky keys like F10/etc.  The way you map the scimitar side buttons is kind of strange.  I set the top front button to F10 in the corsair program, then everytime I press that mouse button it is actually just pressing f10 in game.  Then I bind that button (f10 actually) to that bartender key.
---
I notice I need to clean some of this up, not sure why I have shield block on berserk bars
---
I have been clicking heal pots/stones so that part is a mess too.  Gotta find a good bind for those, maybe a macro.
---
The best macro I've used so far is making mortal strike:
---
/startattack
---
/cast  Mortal Strike(Rank 1)
---
I hit the MS key when I want to start swinging even if I dont have enough rage for an MS.  I need to do similar macros for sunder/revenge/etc for tanking I think.
---
It’s sad that they have layering to make our experience better on launch, and then so many abuse it. Really ruins the experience/economy.
---
Yeah in a PVP server this place is uninhabitable by the non-dominant faction
---
* Warrior.
---
* STVietnam.
---
Enough said.
---
Would have been funnier if you posted the Wand named Thunderwood
---
Lol “retail leveling bored me. So I got on classic and got carried through a dungeon by someone 40 levels higher than it. It was awesome”
---
Gotta /pat the pet.
---
Dungeon groups can only be made with people on your own server.
---
Battlegrounds, when they're introduced in phase 3, will be cross-realm, but you almost certainly won't be able to form premade groups with people on other realms.
---
Great addon!  I have yet to figure out how to get it to announce Overpower procs on my Warrior though.  Had to enable that part of the Blizzard UI, but in doing so it also enabled damage from enemies so I have that going off in two areas of my UI...
---
I only help non-undead. For some reason, I find undead players are always significantly more likely to be assholes.
---
Ok.. It's the developers fault.. It's the players fault for abusing it.. Everybody is at fault.
---
That is one prolific clam.
---
After completing the cast, it takes a bit for you to switch to the mind controlled target. Plenty of times I assumed that since I've completed the cast I can now control the enemy but nope. Because of that small delay I end up moving my character and cancelling the mind control. Maybe that's what happened to this guy too.
---
I almost never engage a grey-level Ally (exceptions include obvious things like the arena, or those lowbies trying to group gank lowbie Horde players), even though I'll attack them 99% of the time if they're within "fightable" range. There's no sport in attacking extreme lowbies just because.
---
Of course, I'm getting half a mind to hunt down this Steve-Zissou-looking bobble-head buffoon just to get him to stop flooding the subreddit with his Polaroid camera reel. Might bring Andronicas with me for a double dose of extreme evisceration.
---
Be a badass and run a warrior through his whirlwind quest
---
i would post on the wow forums but im banned there because the in game gm ban. I've seen worse names get away with no bans. A 15 day ban for that is a little ridiculous.
---
You get the Voidwalker at like 10ish. Its a quest from the class trainer.
---
Thia man fucks everyone he fucks a lot... oh wait he's playing classic i forgot.
---
Stop ruining the forest and gtfo back to Barrens. Horde slugs and not welcome here.
---
Ehh people wouldn't of noticed the cloth BP's he's talking about but the Devilsaur proliferation was clear as day. We were just told "NBD"
---
Oh, and Dustwallow Marsh too, there are some quests in Theramore.
---
Is this version of fishing buddy available through twitch client? The one I downloaded wouldnt work.
---
Yup runs fine on mine! No lag
---
I do this, and I find that 90% of the time I end up with a very solid group, and usually a lot faster then trying LFG.
---
It’s not uncommon for people to ask me how I form groups so fast, this is the secret.
---
I mean he stuns you for 8 sec, no need for scripts cause thats what the stun is for
---
exploit early, exploit often
---
Hit me up on Nochtox!
---
Like I said contact their customer support, it is listed on the website
---
He sounds like he's whining for attention. Who cares. This guy would complain no matter what.
---
Personally I would have preferred starting at an earlier patch and working through them but at the end of the day people wanted a more finished version of the game and 1.12 was literally the only version of the game that was available and that was on a backup of a backup of a backup.
---
We are lucky they managed to cobble this together and people should just enjoy the thing they have been begging for for years
---
You don't, you just cycle through people. Big guilds spam created hundreds of level 1 characters so they can invite their friends.
---
idk was just wondering
---
I could have sugar coated it that's true.
---
Better off running holy nova
---
I tend to leave people alone unless they initiate PvP or i see them killing someone from the same faction. I would probably be inclined to chin someone if they were waiting for the same spawn as me depending on the timer.
---
Cause I want to? Don't see any crying but it is all a but dramatic, that's true.
---
Yeahbif you're close enough
---
Just got myself a multiboxing tool and second &amp; third account. Nice heal/dps combo for my tank I'm leveling and at 60 I'll just sell everything on the dps for extra gold. 
---
What finally made me do it was that I was doing a kill quest with around 10 groups of 2-3 people camping the spawns, but nobody wanted to invite me. Completely retarded for a fucking kill quest. With this I can at least spam aoe on the dps. But I think if the community turns out to be same as in retail, nothing will keep me in WoW.
---
This should just straight up end with everyone doing it having their accounts deleted. Not even perma or suspension, just delete their accounts.
---
&gt;one time
---
&gt;"constantly"
---
I'm not telling you how play. But you will regret how you play when you see that you could have made bank on an item but now your vendoring it. Even though now your bummed out it was fun right? Live life with 0 regrets
---
And you may use it till 60. Not many axes that are better and obtainable.
---
I farm linen and do big bag hand-outs in Goldshire during weekend peak hours. Usually get a line from the trade cart past the blacksmith.
---
Just let your party know you are inexperienced in tanking before you start.
---
Nah 500.
---
I guess he shoulda just teleported to Darnassus ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
You’re reasonable, so I’ll just add:
---
Classic is silly.  Take for example things like Ambermill in Silverpine.  You have fields and fields of mages just walking back and forth for no reason.  
---
Classic should be an opportunity to address weird things like this.  Use modern tools to make patrols patrol, sentries sentry, etc.  I’m fine with animals milling about, but mages walking back and forth?  Silly.
---
Yes! I need to get some time together this week and put out adverts for a fishing event in WC next weekend.
---
You just find out once you join their group.  You'll either phase into the new layer or nothing happens and you try someone else.  If you have been on for a while and someone just logs in theres a good chance they're in a different layer (although if you're on low pop server you might not have layers or at least not many).  Also once you have now people are on different layers you can hop between them
---
You still dont know shit because private servers are not exact clones of vanilla. And your here arguing with me like I'm wrong. Do you have any idea how many guides that's are in YouTube that are flat out wrong because they were made on private servers? You dont.
---
Search for "The Song of Beren and Luthien" from Clamavi de Profundis on youtube.
---
You'll thank me after.
---
As per my earlier reply, neither me (hunter) nor the other guy (druid) were going to use it.
---
100% would like to see more so I’ll be contributing to your patreon. Ive sent these posts to a few of my buddies who play wow and just sent them your link as well. You deserve it; these are just fantastic. Keep up the amazing work!
---
He need some milk!
---
I'm still working out how you actually decided to name your toon "boofadeeznutz".
---
Love your style - post more at higher levels!
---
It makes me cry
---
Probably doesn't know anything but AoE'ing in dungeons since that's how most of them leveled up.  Wasting so much mana on Arcance Explosion.
---
I mained a warlock in vanilla and only did it once. Your post reads like you meant to reply to someone else or had a stroke, because I never said anything about it being my only source of fun.
---
Don’t you bring that disrespect into this house
---
Lol whiffing the nova and the fear...
---
I’ve got my main on Bigglesworth, and an alt on Stalagg, and Bigglesworth has definitely been worse in my Barrens chat experience.  At least it makes leveling interesting.
---
It's like you want her to light up Trees.
---
Ok
---
I follow him and watch him gank unsuspecting victims
---
So, I like to watch the world burn
---
I'm enjoying the game as it used to be and the community of Classic I don't have in retail.
---
I would like to get to 60 and raid and experience those raids as current tier
---
Beyo d that I would enjoy classic+ with content voted for or against in the runescape style
---
Shoutout to /r/therightcantmeme it's hilarious in it's sadness
---
Which server seems to be the most balanced pvp realm? I wanna roll alliance fresh on one. thinking blameaux!
---
I'd hate to have to listen to you talk about real world conspiracies or religions and all that bs with your complete lack of rational thinking. 
---
People even offer you a reward to try and prove your claims and you mock them. You are seriously either a child, or underdeveloped mentally. You won't get very far in the world with this mindset. You're gonna end up trapped in a weird reality bubble that you've made for yourself.
---
edit: just glanced over your post history.. which i should have done first. no point in continuing this conversation with your type. have a nice day, i hope you end up in a happy place.
---
I always order extra

Unfortunately your post has been removed by our AutoModerator because it was thought to belong in our weekly [Looking for Group/Guild/Players Monday](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3ALFG%2BMonday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) thread.

---
Here we go again with the need vs greed arguments...
---
The rational move for expensive boe drops is everybody needing. Lets say an item drops that's worth 5g on the auction house and one person in the party can and intends to use it.
---
Case A - Everybody rolls (need so that no one can ninja):
---
Every party member has a fair chance of earning 5g, either by selling the item or saving the money to buy it. The person who can use the item can possibly still sell it if it's not worth 5g for them. Benefit for the party: 5g, equal chances.
---
Case B - Only need if you will equip:
---
One person rolls because guaranteed equipping the item is still better than most likely losing the roll for selling it. They now have to equip it because selling would be a dick move at this point. Now here's the thing - If that person would value using the item higher than the 5g market price, they should have already bought it on the auction house unless they didn't know about it in which case they should buy it the next time they visit a major city. If that person values the item less than 5g they now screw the party out of potential mount money with the thought of either 'Yeah, I would like to sell this for 5g but I'd rather equip it than have it potentially go to the rogue.' in which case they are a selfish prick or 'Yeah, I wouldn't buy it for 5g but I'll take it if it's free' in which case they are an inconsiderate irrational monkey. Benefit for the party: Less than 5g for a selfish idiot.
---
TLDR: Everyone need yo.
---
Username checks out. Enjoy the ban, cry harder.
---
Hinterlands and arathi arent bad for us PvP players if you farm in the corners of each respective zone. Luckly Hi terlands has the lions which you can skin aswell and the murlocs and Arathi has the stormgarde mobs if you are a.) Brave or b.) A mage. Other option is the Ogres and the whitherbark troll camp. Hope this helps fellow players on PvP servers.
---
UPDATE: I have resolved the issue by uninstalling the Realtek High Definition Audio driver.  My sound devices defaulted to another driver which resolved the issue.
---
We did it with a druid 3 mages and a holy nova priest and pushed almost 80k/hr in zf.
---
this is cool and all but I feel its a huge waste of time without an honor system. I will fight for a questing spot and gathering nodes
---
Sorry I just thought this was classic wow subreddit. For classic wow things and vanilla.
---
Are we now posting things from other expansions? Can I start posting retail things here?
---
It's nicer to play *with* other players, like in WoW, than *against* other players like in Eve.
---
You bet! M|O|O|N is wonderful, even if typing his name is a bit tedious. :)
---
Look man I'm not gonna toss a vendor item for some worthless junk just for you
---
i dont understand. what i want is for her to raise the scourge and wipe humanity.
---
On this topic. I hope blizzard monitors the people who are already sitting at 2k+ gold with epic mount and hopefully tracks what they are doing making sure they aren't exploiting.
---
You just gotta accept that you're doing a charitable act for the sake of feeling good and what they do with it is their own business. There are people who will need on purple BOEs that they can't even use just to hopefully sell them off Months later in the AH to twinks.
---
People are assholes. /ignore and move on with your life.
---
Yeah I just did the same too. Hopefully they will add it soon!
---
2k gold+ 1k spent on mount already, You CAN be at that limit if you are unemployed and play a ton. But odds says the majority of sketchy people should be at or above that limit by now.
---
I would honestly just get rid of them now if the market is still good for you.  If it seems not worth your effort yet... then hold on to them.  As easy as they are to get though, and supply will only go up as playerbase goes up too, I wouldn't make any bets on what will happen to that price from here.
---
I want to move but it scares me when every single server is at medium or higher and then there is reaper at low.
---
Addiction and lack of oral hygiene.
---
I have the advantage of being my guild's Spriest, so I typically have a healer in my groups. But when you MC, all other mobs will aggro on and gangbang the MCed one, so you don't really need to be healing. You just let them kill it (or nearly kill it and dismiss right before it dies so you can get loot), and then the fight has one fewer mob—ideally the most annoying one. For instance, you can MC the Anvilrage paladin dwarves in BRD to have them die without their Divine Shield activating, or you can MC the ogres in LBRS with Berserk and they'll literally solo their own packs. If I MC the ogre right before Wyrmthalak, he'll tank and kill the boss by himself as my team easily deals with the adds. MC, again, trivializes a lot of dungeon pulls and even bosses. And as hinted, a lot of mobs have astoundingly good buffs (like huge fire resistance buffs from Blackrock Spire or spell damage buffs from Blackrock Depths) that you can put on your own party members if you're quick about it. Some people even use the Fire Res buff as a cheese strategy to speedrun Ragnaros, like APES. They send Priests into BRS in multiple groups, buff the whole party, and run back down to MC for a 70 FR literal firewall.
---
As for Soothe, that's correct. You Soothe every mob in a pack (they have larger aggro radii from the front than the back, so sometimes it's not possible if the whole pack is facing your "route", but you get used to how much you can squeeze past) and casually waltz past them. With Soothe active against a back-facing mob, you can walk within 2-3 yards of them without aggro. You basically need to walk *through* them to start the fight. There is, of course, the resist chance for both MC and Soothe, but if you're Shadow you get the 10% spell hit talent, which reduces your resist chance to the minimum 1%.
---
Just have everyone in your group follow closely after you when you start moving, and you can basically wet team your way through most of a dungeon if it has humanoids (which most do).
---
based retard
---
The graphics improvements brought from retail into classic
---
It’s one thing to post an exploit. That is a good thing. It’s another to use said exploit countless times to secure advantages before posting about it. This guy and his guild are dirty cheaters and should be banned accordingly.
---
Lmao, what? He only admits it because he thinks he only deserves a temp ban. He deserves a perma ban.
---
I forgot how to train my first aid past 225 today. Took me like 45 minutes when I was on another continent and had no arathi flight path. But then I got there and forgot I had to get the quest from org first. So I had to go back. Hearth was on CD. Had to fly back, Zep to org, get quest, go all the way back. Just for first aid rank up.
---
However, along the way I ganked another hunter and mage that were picking on a Druid in hillsbrad. Got a couple boes to sell. Took part in general chat and answered a couple questions while flying/running, and when I finally made it and leveled it up, I decided to trek all the way out to Badlands for the connecting FP and to check if Broken Tooth was there. Since I’m rarely in Eastern Kingdoms. And he was! Talk about luck at 4am
---
All of this shit happened and I had a great time and got a super rare AND top tier pet all because I had to rank up my first aid.
---
I love this game
---
So lemme get this straight, by switching layers you’re respawning a boss in the dungeon while *you’re* still in the dungeon?
---
details adon did that for me. disable it and try
---
On my guild, like 20% of the messages in chat are "someone pls invite for layering". Is fecking annoying
---
When someone tries to steal a node or cheat from you just open a trade window with them, it’s stops them from being able to finish.
---
 Boars of all levels I assume?
---
The only people at fault are the abusers.
---
A phase or two.
---
yup, alliance see kek
---
Auctionator do that but not in crafting window so I use Better vendor price aswell.
---
The other thing is the "meta-plot" around the Horde's expansion.
---
If you read the quest text carefully, you'll see a lot of outright nineteenth century colonialism in the story of the orcs in Durotar.
---
Then you have Magatha *Grimtotem* and her ambiguous position regarding the Forsaken.
---
There's a lot of depth once you start looking.
---
Yeah I keep that on but I’m just looking to get a heads up on if a mob might be about to jump target.
---
Oh that's fucked up. Ya I have a dwarf called dwarfgasm and an undead called bigscrotum lol
---
/pat
---
He ruined the game experience of others. That is not noble. He fully deserves a perma.
---
Should have leveled up instead of drawing this.
---
Noob
---
Changing layers to avoid being continuously ganked or refreshing mobs is hardly comparable to prebis bug abuse lol.
---
ding?
---
I have seen it a shitload, it's why they increased the cooldown and added a compounding feature.
---
Join world chat, you will see it a lot.
---
Also https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/quicklayer
---
It's likely this, they're trying to fix the issue and see who is abusing it. Then you fix and ban all at once.
---
No screenshots posted as proof of this "10k gold", no real proof of anything save for a post, and you somehow don't even think you're part of the problem.
---
More "wah wah, the fault is layering!" crap, but frankly, you could have NOT abused this glitch. I hope you get perma banned OP, you're a scumbag.  
---
EDIT: You people are so desperate to make layering the origin of any issue you have, that you actively exploit and then claim it's layering's fault. Moron.
---
You didnt, which is why I posted.
---
Spending 20 silver to level 5% faster is a great deal.  You get to the actual money making quicker.
---
Got a link?
---
US high schools\*
---
Yeah I went there but there were just the centaurs and some goblins spread throughout the zone is there another quest hub I dont know about?
---
They are 100 percent in game. The only fel cloth pattern not in game ( to the best of my knowledge) is the felcloth gloves which come from dire maul.
---
The felcloth patterns are world drops. There are fel cloth patterns and gear for sale on my AH (alliance Pagle )
---
Agree. 
---
I started as Paladin (lore, plate armor, etc.), leveling with a Warrior mate. We reached level 21 and I wasn't sure I was enjoying it. My mate had to take a break for week so I started a druid alt...
---
Now my Druid is 33 and I think Paladin will remain at 21 forever...
---
I have been farming devilsaur leather and am curious what to expect from its value fluctuations over the life of the game. should I be looking to dump it now while people are scrambling for pre bis or is it something that will hold value over time?
---
I realize this is speculative but i imagine it would play out similar to private servers.
---
Been there as well.
---
Almost failed out of college. Ultimately pulled myself together and got my degree. BUT lost my scholarships, took me 6 years to get it instead of 4, and cost me an extra $37,000 in student loans.
---
I’m haven’t paid off those loans yet. Can confirm—not worth it.
---
Still a great game though.
---
Layering should have been eliminated if the character is over 20 or 30, not sure why its still available for every level
---
I always communicate with fellow Allies being a Orc ...

---
Fake news
---
Yeah that's the wrong part (intentional layer hops) but not sure how to address it. Kind of the reason I dont like to complain about layers because I'm not sure what you can do when your server has 20k pop and most of em are level 30.
---
Liar.
---
Asked around. Happened on a large scale with pre bis on at least two big NA servers
---
It's a common misconception that illegal immigrant and terrorist are races/ethnicities. You seem to agree with that
---
If I have seen multiple people abusing it, asking constantly for hops, I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss a 40% amount of people doing it.
---
Streamers do it.. The game has easily around 200k viewers, these are a lot of the people who will do it and spread how to do it.
---
Like I said, after the changes it has been less frequent.. But it was really bad
---
Cuz it's fucking fun it's often a battle of wits find fun new ways to outsmart and kill someone
---
Unfortunately, even if Blizz will fix this, they'll probably do shit all to the people that abused this.  
---
Blizz really just majorly fucked up. They didn't do any testing regarding layers and the problems it would bring with it.
---
You'll never convince people who already have the opposite viewpoint, I've been downvoted before for trying to defend it.  100% agree though.
---
That is so nice - love this
---
They will force you to change your name for being a sexual reference.
---
My guild had to change Thralls Deep.
---
Fuck Blizzards lame ass naming policy.
---
I pick one or the other my psyche cant handle both lol
---
a chain of kindness
---
You knew the ToS, bro. Just because something doesn't offend you doesn't mean it won't piss off someone else, that's basic emotional intelligence. Accept that YOU fucked up, that it isn't anyone else's fault. Don't play stupid games and be surprised when you win stupid prizes.
---
The error code just means connection with server was lost, doesn't say anything about *why* the connection was lost.
---
Just put one in sorry I thought there was one.
---
Yeah blizz GMs give absolutely 0 fucks about your opinion and they will never read this.
---
Something other than cheap shot mages are just gonna blink out of it
---
So by your logic it takes weeks of farming to get 120g. 120g / 30g an hour or 4 hours. If someone is only playing 2 hours a week they probably arnt raiding much so preraid bis will go a long, long way.
---
Whenever I see those guys all I can think of is how they must want a shrubbery.
---
Lets assume someone is willing to pay 10 minutes of farming for 10 minutes of deviate-fish related silliness.
---
If that person is level 20, that's 2 silver. If that person is level 60, that's 5 gold.
---
Yep he is grinding in westfall right now
---
classic is smaller
---
Switch. We only want to have dedicated players on our 30/70 servers that wont back dowm just because the horde are more in a fight.
---
Welp time to move on
---
i was doing sm today and invited a guy. i was inside instance at the start. then out of nowhere this guy runs from INSIDE INSTANCE pulling all mobs and then in chat saying"shouldnt have acc your invite when i was still inside" so im pretty sure the OP  is correct and it DOSE WORK.
---
Who is clicking? You dont need a cadtsequence for your main skills. Save space elsewhere.
---
I finished my PhD last year and left the academic industry a few months ago. Timing couldn't have been better
---
Nah, if you're hopping for any reason you are abusing it.
---
Don't play pvp server if you can't handle being ganked. Refreshing mobs shouldn't be a thing in WoW.
---
Thanks, I’m going to save that as a macro. Lately I’ve been doing retaliate instead when I know I want to do a huge pull but it’s not as helpful if you have a big pull already and need to give the healer time to get you back up - can’t retaliate when you’re dead haha
---
Doc didn't warn me something like THIS would happen..
---
There's the much demand?
---
So, I know that the traditional FD+Trap macros aren't working right now from my experience. I did a bit of digging and found this one, looks like it might work. No promises and I'm not home to test it right now.

I have ~500g now as a level 57. With the extra 200g+ (gonna wait to sell it a bit) I will probably be looking at a total of 800g or so by 60, maybe more with my leatherworking. The rest I can grind out in a weekend. 
---
I also find it way more motivating to grind out the last 200g vs the last 400g :P
---
Okay duude
---
&gt;tegrity of the game.  
---
&gt;Every single person who thinks this post is a bad idea is like
---
Amen brother
---
XP waste I know
---
I'm liking my lock a little more now vs how much I was annoyed earlier on (though rebuffing and resummoning after dying is the worst of anything I have ever experienced before).  I am almost 54 though, but I'll probably make a priest alt (priest was my main for 14 yrs) since I miss it a lot.
---
"Gank this!"
---
50s for a stack of wool?! Mine is just vendor price
---
I was able to get my player frame working but the party frames have just disappeared
---
Same on Incendius
---
My friends and I are loving doing dungeons that are orange/red to us. It requires so much organization, CCing, kill rotation, etc.
---
99% of people crying they got banned and don't deserve it actually deserve it and can't provide proof of innocence
---
Upvote cause of pink pigtails
---
Guess I’ll go arms then.  Don’t see the point of showing something different then saying, “figure it out”.  Great fight, good luck out there...
---
"15 years ago no one cared about my racist/sexist/homophobic jokes!! Now I actually get called out for being an asshole and I need a safe space to be an edgelord!!"
---
That's what your whole rant sounded like. 
---
You want free speech? Deal with people thinking you're an asshole and telling you so.
---
Threat meters are used to actually gauge how far off people are from pulling aggro for a specific mob. 
---
Threat plates are still nice though.
---
Yea it's weird its the same as silk
---
yes there are. They monitor the in game chat and ban people. I even saw some announcement the other day some guy was made admin of the world chat.
---
One of the interesting parts of it is that each word is consistently translated into the same pseudo-word. They probably use some sort of hash function to do so.
---
Only because there are a lot of undead players, higher chances of there being asshole.
---
Ok what's with the explosion?
---
The bans will happen based on game logs, not reddit posts. If this post is accurate he will get banned regardless
---
For what it's worth, at your level, you shouldn't really need to grind, there should be quests available for you to level up with. Good zones for alliance around your level would be Duskwood, Wetlands, Redridge, and Ashenvale.
---
But it's so great, Blizzard has it 100% under control! Blizzard said that nobody is abusing layering so this cannot be true.
---
/s
---
Lol this. OP sounds like he's bored of the exploit and is exposing it because he's tired of abusing it 200 times a day. 
---
Good that its being exposed but the reasoning OP has for exposing it is ridiculous. Its not "im sorry for abusing this exploit for weeks". Its "I am bored of this exploit, Ive abused it to the full extent now pls remove it so i can have fun again".
---
Op is 49 for what it's worth
---
Anyone had an issue with the screen brightness resetting every time they log in? Slider is in the right place and if I move it up or down the screen catches up instantly, but it's like it doesn't check it when the game boots.
---
I hope you got bags by 40....
---
I wouldn't care if my server got merged with another one, why would I?  
---
I'd pick that over this any day of the week. Do you even understand what this means? Guilds with banks filled with recipes etc. Completely destroying the economy, permanently.   
---
People in BiS gear that they got in 3 days which will take you months to farm.
---
Chappelle's new specials are dog shit compared to his old ones.
---
Better than doing to work and someone reaping the reward.
---
Are you that daft?
---
I haven't seen him since and I'm still around here ;) And rightly so
---
I remember things like that happening back in the day. Even joined a few rag-tag raids for revenge, even though I'm horrible at PvP.
---
Reset instances bro. click in ur protrait and click "reset instances" when you are out of it (while they are killing it in other party)  you enter it and all mobs (in this case boss ) have respawned. you invite other blah blah blah. then other guy who sits at instance start and now is out of party runs out and reset instance. 
---
how you think all sm farms are made?
---
Save it for phase 3 battlegrounds and sell it to an enchantment shaman twink. You will single handedly be responsible for untold 1-shot kills of the enemy faction. Be sure to get at least 300g for it.

Retail levelling is boring tho, I despise it
---
Aoe healing kingggg
---
I want to get to 60 and play PvP, battlegrounds/arena. That means I can play for just a few hours now and then and still enjoy wow. I hope it doesn’t go beyond 60!
---
Us high schools where all the other kids have their pumped up kicks, running faster than my gun*
---
Illegal immigrant and terrorist are not races/ethnicities. Therefore, it is impossible to be racist against them. Use a different, more appropriate word.
---
Dude, it is 2019...
---
I have an opinion on Twitch, You disagree? Turn off my stream.
---
If I had the overrustle logs, I’d paste them in here. Lol
---
Other players basically paid for my game time on Eve. Totally legal.  Was very surprised to hear how it is in wow. But I fully understand why.
---
What is your nameplate add-on??
---
Yeah, I see people asking for a new layer in world regularly. But thats not even remotely close to every 2nd player. Remember there are ~2 million players.
---
Yup I know that feels, my micro-dude went from Immobile cuddle baby that I could have on me while playing to crawling whirlwind of destruction 3 weeks before classics launch.
---
would you rather he had not posted this and they continued forever?
---
Channels are player owned, world chat is just an unofficial channel called 'world', you can go make any channel you want.
---
The only official channels are general, trade and local defense.
---
It'll make a big difference in the beginning but it'll even out for every patch.
---
Of course MC and Onyxia is going to be easy now. Does anyone even remember the first patches? Before the class rework and itemization fixes? When innervate was a 31-pt resto skillpoint for druid? It's a shame that the early content is going to be a lot easier than we remembered it but it would be really difficult to keep old talents and itemization when everyone knows they will change in the future.
---
I know you guys! I played a dwarf priest named Murrdoch on Dmaw. Amavesta and I were actually in a leveling guild together called &lt;Crusade of the Gods&gt; for a while.
---
His position is understandable. Just because he’s a power gamer doesn’t mean he wants freedom in stupid ways. On the other hand he’s a power gamer and can’t ignore a faster route. Makes sense to me.
---
Not sure what is to understand here?
---
Why would you not want to get rid of homophobic and racist names? These words can be very hurtful to certain people.  
---
If you can't understand that, you must have the mind of a child
---
You catch them while they are fighting mobs or you back the hell off. Warlocks are insane at leveling pvp and it's best to avoid them. Below level 42 (death coil) you have a decent chance though of you don't get feared. 
---
Try your best to interrupt shadow spells, most warlocks won't be good at fake casting. Use gouge to interrupt when kick is on cooldown. Try to end the fight before dots wear you down. 
---
If they have succubus out open with sap on the wl and kill the succ to avoid certain death through cc. If they have void out you can still sap and kill pet as the shield is really strong but void is quite tanky and if you fail to kill him and restealth before sap runs out you will be in a world of pain.
---
Mario would be a dwarf, Luigi a human, peach a night elf, toad.... a gnome of course, wario an orc, bowser a Tauren and idk undead one of those bone koopas
---
i mean the "previous" exploit was fake, the ss was from a private server.  
---
Lets wait, the classic devs were quick to answer that.  If this is true, perma and gg.
---
This is very triggering. Ti see people cheat the system we have to put in so many fucking hours for. They better be perma banned. Fuck those cheaters
---
Lol this has been posted on every wow exploit thread for years and I still dont understand why, they punish blatant exploiters every time, just not literally the same day it's discovered so players are never happy
---
&gt; Everyone has mounts on their mind so it’ll be tough getting anyone to shell out a decent amount of coin this early.
---
There's a fair bit of movement in the market on my realm tbf. Sold a pair of devilsaur leggings for 200g today (the leathers costed 90g together)
---
You’re very right. It’s 2019 and if I want to voice my opinion against someone I don’t agree with, I should be able too. :)
---
i'm on azuresong too, and i love the chaos of barrens chat LMAO
---
Just killed her tonight with a raid of 36 people.
---
If anyone is wondering we looted warrior T2, warlock T2, Eskandar's necklace, the sinew and two (yes, two) Onyxia bags.
---
Ragnaros is next!
---
Yeah the meme "the right can't meme" started for a reason.
---
And then they stole the idea, of course 🤣
---
But to be fair, the left have the best meme material because of Trump. Such an easy target
---
Well with tauren you can /moo at people, get a +15 to herbalism, and a 2 sec aoe stun.
---
Compared to getting carried though a dungeon would you consider the later more awesome?
---
And that is such a toxic and regressive way of thinking. So Dave Chappelle should be required to stand up on stage and poke fun at white people 80% of his skit, but only 20% at other people simply because the color of their skin or sexual orientation, or whatever it may be? That is just ridiculous. How about we let comedians be witty and poke fun at everyone, we laugh about it, and go in with our day? Just like everyone did 15+ years ago? 
---
Instead, a bunch of primarily WHITE “progressives” came along, and decided that nearly everything is hate speech and needs to be silenced. And yes, I’m allowed to say that. I am bi-racial. If you tell me otherwise, you are a racist. (Sarcasm aside, I am bi-racial, and yes I realize how ridiculous what I said just sounds, but it proves my point).
---
Bigoted.
---
Let me introduce you to some little bois called Saronite Bombs
---
Man this is so simple yet so good hahhahahaha
---
Eventually he will.
---
Welp, the game is already broken if this is true. If blizzard doesn't fix and take away all gold and gear I will be quiting.
---
Power gamer. Alright.
---
My friend burst out laughing in discord last night and apparently he let an alli hunter tame Broken Tooth while cheering him on and as soon as he was tamed murdered it and then murdered the dwarf. God damn I just hope it didn’t immediately abandon him because they’re already at minimum happiness when you tame. But damn it’s a funny story
---
Remember when you log out in a city or inn you gain rested (100% XP bonus) over time so if you don’t play as much it builds up more.
---
I love the other alliance characters reaction 
---
BUR
---
Also lookingforgroup and guildrecruitment are official as well.
---
Nah. It's nice being able to get your mats back.
---
It was one of the best things I have ever logged into
---
That's why I move Sacrifice to CTRL-7.
---
I'm shocked you haven't realized this yet, but some people take shit *way* too seriously.
---
Right... that doesn’t change anything lol. There’s a wiki with all the zones and what level you quest in them. All this typing you’ve done and you could’ve had your answer and not only that you could have answers for the future as well.
---
&gt;Pretty broken OP already rich and already coming out **and if I have to kill balnazaar 200 times** every day for the next 2 weeks i may just quit, so do what you will with the info, hopefully it gets fixed soon.
---
lmao for real bro no one is forcing you abuse an exploit wtf is this mindset?
---
Everyone is either wrrior or mage.
---
Yes he did. Chappelle poked fun at white people, black people, “progressives”, conservatives, LGBTQ, etc. and guess what? He is being demonized for it and labeled a racist homophobe...
---
Quest in other zones, level up past the recommended quests levels (2-4 above) and come back for them. 
---
Or start an alt and wait for most people to get ahead. I also like to work on other professions so they won't be so bothersome to train when I get a higher level.
---
Are you and I playing the same game? Even with layers every single quest location is camped, almost 24/7. I literally woke up 2 hours earlier than normal today and still couldn't get a place to myself.
---
Standing in one spot spamming an attack macro is really the classic experience is it?
---
I don't understand
---
Your insta is fucking awesome dude, your style is so cool. 👌🏻👌🏻keep it up!!
---
Details Will do this, if you haven't unchecked the "check for item level" box in its settings
---
Use different hotkeys.
---
Starting “drama” how so? I posted my experience which I find to be somewhat immature and because of that I decided to post that here, for good reason. 
---
Also, how am I starting a witch-hunt? Lmfao, a lot of accusations here mate. You know what they say about people who assume things.
---
Gotta go fast and be #1? At what cost? Everything lmao
---
Man i've played so much im hearing NPC sounds when im not playing.
---
Best episode? Wasn’t aware there were any other episodes of South Park.
---
Dude, what are you even talking about? OP is saying by inviting people and layering, you can endlessly farm the last boss multiple times without doing the whole instance.
---
You are talking about something differently completely.
---
I loved it. Great story and I like the outcome:)
---
Nah man I played back in the day and all I can say is that if you enjoyed demon trolling you're probably a bit of a prick
---
Thank you I will!
---
Thats cool but i was referencing the item req since hes comparing items in a vacuum
---
Hi first time player here and need some help with everything lol. Leveled my mage to 15 so far and having fun but what spells should I be leveling? I’ve only done firebolt and frostbolt which are both level 2 but don’t know what’s good but I feel like frostbolt is better as it slows enemies down. 
---
Also is there a item guide somewhere? My banks full atm since I don’t know what to do with the items in there mostly green drops and didn’t want to sell since I figured they’re rare so I just stored it.
---
Had someone tell me in game leather working is a good profession for money which I selected but am yet to train it as I don’t know what to do...  some help would be great!! Thanks
---
On top of what everyone else is saying, I frequently see people in world chat using each other to cycle through layers. So you switch by inviting people to your group (they may or may not be in your layer), but in practice there’s usually 10-15 people asking for layer invites frequently in public chat to be able to hop between them. So it doesn’t necessarily require coordination with people that you know
---
My husband is a uh... Weirdo. He plans to have every class maxed on both Horde and Alliance. 
---
He can do it, the dude is a planner and he's half way with a mage and a hunter. His warrior he made to level with me as his main, now that I'm switching my main to catch up his warrior is just chilling out for a bit.
---
Blue pill
---
Because I join RPPVP servers because I like the extra little bit if immersion. I dont actually rp beyond the occasional /say interaction, but "gamergurlxd" makes my experience 2% less enjoyable. Reported.
---
You play by the rules of the game, anyone who doesn't do that is an imbecile expecting everyone else not to do it, especially when it's not inherently immoral.
---
China wants to know your location
---
&gt; Nice switch around to say I am the haughty one though I am guessing your a woman?
---
I believe they are mixing it up with a comment from another user, not this specific one they are replying too.
---
Easy to find people not worth playing with.
---
The cost goes down 1 tier every 30 days. 5g will go down to 1g etc
---
i mean, can we just wait before the witch hunt? last time the exploit was a fake ss from a private server shared by Alexsensual.
---
If this is true, ban them all, no mercy.
---
Yes, you are able to. Freedom of Speech allows you to do that.
---
But maybe might want to keep reading about your rights. Because Freedom of Speech also means you have to face the consequences of what you say. It doesnt mean you can say anything you want with no reaction.
---
I can't imagine.
---
This is the best answer.  Check the AH for the difference between the mats and the bars, then ask in Trade if anyone's selling arc xmutes and how much they're charging.  If the former is more than the latter, just buy the mats and sell a bar on AH.  If the latter is more, just offer xmute in Trade.
---
Id wager less than 0.01% (1 in 10,000) players cureently have a level 60 with an epic mount and 2k in reserves. Maybe even less. Literally probably a thousand players in the world tops have that.
---
Yeah let’s run out of the instance, past the respawns, waste the time of the other 3 party members (unless more than 2 want it, then set up a bracket system for dueling), get to the verge of death outside the dungeon, avoid opposing faction and other mobs, go back in, walk back past respawns to where the loot dropped and then continue progress. I like it
---
you do and you wanted to start shit too. Zero point in you posting if you dont know how to make the macro/script or where to find it.
---
Isn't it in Booty Bay?
---
SU SU SUDIO
---
We have already been told how to stop them. Theres a setting to turn invites off.
---
Omg, Murrdoch is totally familiar to me! How are you? :D
---
I’m sure the program running it all will get really angry.
---
Blizzdrones mad.
---
Most people 99% play the game the way it's meant to be played. It's just the majority is silent and the minority is loud.
---
Yup, lvl60 is max..
---
Can’t check out the stream, what level has he made it to lol
---
yeah, I'm sure it's cause they offer pizza and not because they have a "lunk-alarm" judgement free my ass. And it certainly can't be because you're not allowed to deadlift or that their free weights dont go above 50 lbs.
---
No they were nice and all he was probly just sad I got them instead of him. But 9 levels later I'm still wearing them and still the only shoulders I've come across lol
---
B-b-b...but... I thought they said layering won't affect gameplay! This is impossible! /s
---
Have a cry dude
---
Does this quest disappear if you turn in Catch Of The Day?
---
Sorry man it’s allowed
---
Hey guys, I'm somewhat new to WOW and i was just wondering what you guys usually do when you hit lv. 20, I've heard it turns into a totally different game and want to know if any specific course of action is traditionally taken.
---
It reads 1% to crit instead of X to Critical Rating. When did that change take effect because im pretty sure it was in Vanilla
---
Or this is an old screenshot.
---
esfand abused it
---
I knew Layering would destroy Classic and it sadly already has. It really kills all motivation to play when you know people are exploiting the crap out of it. My guild abused layering last week to farm Rep for MC and Elemental Fire. I know people have stockpiled 100+ BL by now, everything just feels pointless. I just login once a Week to clear MC and Ony and thats it.
---
Insults? 
---
I called you rude...
---
“And you can try and get personal all you want, throw insults, it just invalidates your opinions and make you seem like an asshole to be fair. :^)”
---
The irony. Not only do you contradict yourself here, but you’re also telling me to go away because I don’t share the same opinion as you. Hahahahaha
---
What server did you totally fuck up? Hope you get the perma ban with your guild.
---
Dont think lfg is official? Ive seen owner change before....might be getting it confused with a similar channel (lfg?)
---
Bacon is the inferior version of turkey bacon
---
PvP kill as much as you can, PvE kill as much you can, RPPvP kill as much you can (emotes included)
---
Having no cross servers is my reason. I like needing to hold a good reputation and getting recognized when someone sees your name is a great feeling.
---
Rogue is probably what you’re looking for. I’ve got a 37 warrior and a 24 rogue and the latter is a lot easier.
---
City guards kill infernals.
---
In case you are beeing honest I will answer your question: the problem you described is a complete non issue.its basically non existent and I know nobody who ever encountered something like this. If you are one of the niche cases where somebody maliciously does this and it would result in a penality it can get resolved.
---
If you are thinking about wheatear you should start playing or not delete this topic in your mind - it will not happen to you.
---
I still don't believe you tho.
---
That's one back that ain't getting washed.
---
Everyone in my guild is abusing layering, there's an addon for it which I've used myself and a lot of people seem to be using it also, and I see tonnes of "Invite to layer" in general chat.
---
And their is a massive difference between .05% .5% and 1% when you're talking about millions and thousands of players. Nothing you're saying is helping your points. You're just point out over and over how inaccurate these results actually are. A difference of a few 100% is huge. The difference between .05% and 1% is huge. You may be precise within your data set, but your data set is wildly inaccurate compared to reality.
---
I would swap to alchemy. It's the main money maker from what I've seen at 60 for the last week.
---
We won't miss you on pvp servers if you already want to quit because of that so.. Bye and pls stop crying.
---
&gt;you can layer hop instanced content
---
Holy shit lmao
---
That's like a fanfiction in the making.
---
I raided MC back in Vanilla. It was pretty easy even by next phase vanilla standards. MC was much easier than BWL even. It's hard for me to look back and see why we'd ever wipe on some of those fights, but we did!
---
Do it! Bear tanks are totally viable and dungeon groups especially are more than happy to take bear tanks. For raiding you might find it a little harder if the tank spots in your guild are already taken by warriors but cat dps is always an option in that case. (And you wouldnt really need to repec for it). Also if you prove yourself to be a good/reliable raid member and tank theyll likely let you sub in if a regular tank cant make it or quits.
---
Definitely a dude tho
---
Level 29 and 8 hours playtime?? :O
---
probably shouldn't play on a pvp server if this is how you react
---
Sounds like a PVE server is right for you.
---
If you want to be meta, don't pick paladin. Pick paladin if you love the class.
---
Rogue is really strong in PvP with their insane CC and stealth, arms is good in pvp and okay in PvE. Ret is okay in PvP and bad in PvE
---
Hey i wanna say something.I have been playing from launch day, we cleared WC  second day iirc and I dropped group and got from another layer and nothing happened.
---
Maybe is fake (show the 100K gold ss if this is true), maybe some dungeons?.
---
A guild mate tried this right now and is not working.
---
People were banned back in the day, but do Blizzards/GM's care about it nowdays?
---
Have you tried flashing a fresh bios?

i dont fight taurens unless provoked. anything else dies.

But in RuneScape this kind of situation can really only occur in a scam, items are easily bought on the grand exchange so there is never a “give another player resources in hopes they make something to give back” situation.

Exactly stuff like this! It makes you explore even more
---
If only blizzard knew how layering works, apparently they have no idea. People abuse it since day one and now a game breaking exploit surfaces that probably is too from the beginning. Now what? They gonna ban people? Can they even track them?
---
It’s not crazy different.  Usually gives you a decent power spike with some new abilities.  You also have access to some more dungeons at 20.  Nothing too drastic tbh.

Gotta embrace the murder bro. let the hate flow through you until you too are KOSing every member of the opposing faction as vengeance for their peer's ganking you.
---
And send blizzard swat to exterminate the rest of the gene pool associated with the individual
---
What's pissing me off is that I probably helped those dbags exploiting because I sent layer invites to ppl asking because I thought it was about spots being severely overfarmed. 
---
I hope they get their acc perma banned for this exploit. If you can't see how this calls for the hardest punishment possible I don't know. You guys are ruining the game not just for yourselves.
---
21 gold at 30 is actually very good, if you managed to get that much that early you’ll be in good shape at 40.
---
You want something slow but not too slow(I like 2.5) to max out your dps/rage return on parries.
---
It's legitimately amazing how many threads there are going on in Vanilla that I never noticed before. They set up Arthas, Deathwing, the old gods, Uldum, and so much more. I really wonder how far back these plot lines were written.
---
It could work as an add-on perhaps!
---
Its not like you have a right to live in game lol, assuming a GM targetted you specifically (they didn't, they haven't intereacted in game for many years) then you did something against ToS.
---
Why would a customer service rep do something that is loggable that could risk their job? Just to 'get you'? Think about it.
---
Lol, in before "No girls in WoW"
---
What's the point of getting pre-BiS if you're going to get permabanned for extreme abuse of exploits anyway?
---
That's your life now.  You should never leave there.
---
&gt; Hi first time player here and need some help with everything lol. Leveled my mage to 15 so far and having fun but what spells should I be leveling? I’ve only done firebolt and frostbolt which are both level 2 but don’t know what’s good but I feel like frostbolt is better as it slows enemies down. 
---
You should have access to your talent tree at level 10, press "N" ingame if you haven't seen it.
---
You'll have 3 trees to choose from, Fire, Frost and Arcane. I'd suggest choosing Fire or Frost, and investing points down that path, then using spells mostly from that school as you'll get good benefits from it.
---
You seem to be enjoying frost, so go for that.
---
&gt;Also is there a item guide somewhere? My banks full atm since I don’t know what to do with the items in there mostly green drops and didn’t want to sell since I figured they’re rare so I just stored it.
---
Generally you can sell most green items at a vendor and that's it. Early on the green items aren't too valuable because they're replaced so quickly.
---
If you're ever worried about whether an item is valuable, check out the Auction House and see what people are selling the item for.
---
&gt;Had someone tell me in game leather working is a good profession for money which I selected but am yet to train it as I don’t know what to do... some help would be great!! Thanks
---
Open your skills list, go to general, and "leatherworking" should be available there.
---
Any source on the ratio? I’m on Kromcrush and horde are dominant.
---
CS pound vanish CS pound kidney shot  
---
They're ez pickins as combat
---
As far as i know they are not in the game right now. They were implemented in a later patch
---
The real lesson here is you never engage a spriest 1v1.  They are pmuch the strongest 1v1ers outside of a 100-0 rogue stun lock
---
If I’m fishing, leave me alone!
---
lmao thats amazing im going to do that once i unlock prep hahahahha but wont his does knock me out of it invis
---
I've done this twice and each time was because the NPCs in a major city were missing.
---
That Kodo rammed down the storm wind gates
---
Saw StaySafe doing this on stream yesterday
---
Could be argued that a decision has been made to power game using what is an exploit, rather than power game within the intended game parameters. This leads to him limiting what could be a long term experience to, as he says, two weeks before he quits. Not against the post though. Appreciate the honesty and it ultimately raises awareness and most likely assists in ending the exploit, hopefully preventing long term damage if that is still possible.
---
Oi. Dawri. We don't take too kindly to yer types 'round here.
---
Thanks blizzard and everyone that defended layering.
---
Join us. It's awesome.
---
I grunted lightly out my nose, also, what is that nameplate addon?
---
Not really, level 20 just means you'll be looking for new questing areas. For Horde, that means Southern Barrens, Stonetalon, Ashenvale, and Hillsbrad. For Alliance, it means Duskwood, Wetlands, Ashenvale, and Redridge.
---
I tried such a baby “holder” once. It was awful. I felt my chest was being compressed and it was just not working. I am a person that generally don’t like to have someone sitting on me or anything like that. I feel so restricted that it gets on my nerves. Luckily my wife is not the same:)

---
It's all downhill from that point.
---
Classic rules say you have to stop playing that character and leave it there for 15 years.
---
Roll back? All they have to do is ban everyone that did this.
---
yep, we need full immersion
---
Maplestory 2 is free to play
---
Yeah, it's like saying Ocarina of Time can be beaten in ten minutes with three hearts and no sword because some 0% speedrunner did it, and therefore anyone who says you need to get the Master Sword to beat Ganondorf is wrong because the game is "dead easy" without it.
---
APES is a fantastic guild. They're also the WoW equivalent of speedrunners. Comparing the average player or guild to them is patently silly. Even if MC is mechanically simple, it's not like most players can simply blaze through it without max level or even gear simply because APES did it.
---
That was the first epic that dropped for me in Vanilla. Sold it for 350 gold back then.
---
he's grindin out that sulfuras he's always wearing first
---
I wouldn't even call him noble, a hero or maytr. They knew it was an exploit and continued to do it repeatedly for their own gain and their guilds gain. 
---
Don't even know why people do shit like this when they know it's going to result in some form of ban and all gold stripped and taken away. 
---
It's laughable that they think posting it is going to make their punishment less because it's not. They do honestly a perma ban.
---
First of all you can’t see their level if you’re that much lower. 
---
Secondly there is no 70. 
---
Sooo....
---
Thirdly it’s pvp.
---
If I didn't hate the idea of being surrounded by ELVES, I'd be rolling around as dwarves just because I know there'd be more sport around.
---
The players aren’t the reason layering is being abused....
---
The reason layering is being abused is due to layering.
---
Aaaaaand that's forever ingrained in my memory. Thanks, I think.
---
Blizzard have got their priorities all bizarro world; Layering is easily exploitable and destroying the economy?
---
I sleep
---
Infernals are killing lowbies?
---
**real shit**
---
Would've been such a lovely Molten Core release.
---
Sure, no one said it was impossible to get that, but people with that much money is worth some time in scrutiny to see if they came by it in a fair manner.  
---
We have a few epic mounts in my guild too, some are simply people pooling money as well. Nothing fishy there.
---
And honestly, that exploit was way more minor in terms of advantages gained compared to this one.
---
I haven't played as much as I wish i had so far. 
---
I'm level 16.67 at 16 Hours 12 Mins played. 
---
I'll be on for a bit tonight
---
Jesus Christ it’s already too late to fix this
---
Ya, cheater but confessed to it. Pretty decent of him, if he didn't post this you wouldn't know dumbass
---
You're playing a goddamn druid - you don't get to mock people butt-hurt about getting ganked when you are the most ungankable class.
---
Didn't go to a low pop. Rerolled on a high pop (not full) server. I've only hit ~300 players in queue on weekends.
---
Just by the number 150 is half way and so is your level, if you want to have your LW make you gear you’ll probably want to level it higher than that. I’d try to cap it at 225 as you approach 35, or get close
---
Blade furry is life, also yeah not really.
---
Is there a good website to find people to run dungeons with? It’s difficult for me in game
---
so there you go man. "NO LAYERING IN INSTANCES" old game mechanic and other stuff. thanks for linking it yourself but dont delete your own comments. man up to it. i fcked up about 10 group exp and i own it. be a man.
---
So you ruined the game for yourself and lots of others in your server and you’re complaining about it?
---
then you don't regret the walk
---
I'd be lvl 18 too if i was this good of an artist.
---
I literally abused CRZ for two years to farm rare transmog and get TLPD and Aeonaxx. Not shit was done. This was a long running exploit that finally got fixed in Legion, and as far as I know, nobody has been punished. 
---
And by abused, I mean use peer blocker to block the shard I was on, until I was on an uninhabited one. Every rare spawn up, everything easy to farm. I wouldn’t be surprised if something akin to that works with layers either.
---
Thanks guys, I'll be sure to try these out!
---
So just skip it, what's the problem?
---
Drop rates are low because you would just end up grinding mobs regardless, 1-60 is a grind, nothing more.
---
Have fun at 50+ when you run out of quests and end up grinding the same group of mobs for 10 hours to get a few levels.
---
You know as well as I do the majority wont be farming efficiently and its not good to expect. Someone who has a making gold mindset would equipe a item like this lol
---
&gt; Blizzard is monitoring people with high gold amounts apparently from what's being said.
---
how can you read this post and believe this lol
---
If you have a group full of idiots, then sure.
---
Not a stupid question! It does nothing for PVP, It makes enemies less likely to attack. I used it in case of a stray murloc ;)
---
Get the Twitch app and install your WoW addons via that, it’s so much easier and more comfortable.
---
"if you started to disagree with me I'd ban you" lol, that's toxic, all I'm saying. And you don't need to try to be toxic I think you do it naturally p well
---
Yeah it'd be cool to be an Enh Sham or Spriest and be able to do all content.
---
In response to someone saying "Do you really want to raid with "nhazy4tromp" or some other shit?"
---
You said: "I mean it doesnt really fuckin matter what their name is."
---
so yeah, pretty privileged to not care if you're playing with people celebrating nazism in their name
---
If I had to level my healer in healer spec I'd kill myself.
---
I get that. But looking at it from a a single server its still waaaaay more common on Classic. Even if you combined the biggest private servers, Nostalrius, Lights Hope etc etc, and compared the use of this strategy to just 1 Classic server, its still not even close.
---
&gt; I would also be okay with getting punished ie my 10k gold removed and temp banned, the game isnt going to be fun if I have so much gold I can host GDKP raids and buy every single item for months.
---
I mean, after finding the exploit you could have just... you know, reported it and then not farmed it.
---
This with the only exception being if I still have a lot to do in the area with limited time. I don’t mind when alli bring backup, world pvp is my favorite pastime. But I try not to shit where I eat, so to speak, when I only have a limited amount of time to play.
---
/join world
---
You'll usually find everything you need there.
---
Explain? i googled, its something about minecraft
---
200g sounds like a lot for an item you'll replace pretty quick at 60.
---
the fuck are you talking about? i think you commented on the wrong thing.
---
If you care this much your an idiot
---
trust me dont argue with these idiots ive tried and failed before.
---
Try join lfg chat and world chat. Do it by typing /join lfg in the chat
---
Highly accomplished.
---
I’ve played this game for 12 years and only now did I notice the colored banners to give a visual que to which quarter you are in.
---
How do you know OP's age and how is that relevant?
---
im going subletly because its fun lol
---
Finally? You got it three weeks into the game lol I played for two years and never got it. Hated farming
---
As someone who just camped Broken Tooth spawns for 4 hours this morning (I did get him thankfully) fuck this guy.

Doing all his caster homies a favor right there.

cool! we're on the same page.
---
Post got deleted, what did I miss, please?
---
As a warrior, the only time horde aren't kill-on-sight is when it's a warrior working on a class quest.
---
Yeah frost would be pretty OP if it somehow managed to provide incredible mob slowing/survivability and was still better at DPS than fire.
---
Don’t forget Fish Sticks
---
It's not hard to see all the videos that are give wrong infor.ation because of private servers. For example, reputation guides being wrong, paladin guides leveling rekoning while sitting. Theres tons of them. All of things were wrong with private servers.
---
Just switch to a credit Union. Much better customer service. If you are an alliance armed services veteran there are some great credit unions you and your family can join.
---
Snowflake alert, lmao

---
Fortunately the new Fire Emblem and Sims 4 DLC have mostly kept me off gf duty since launch. Well on track to hit 60 before she finishes them.
---
Take away guns and less people will die. Canada doesn’t have this same problem and I would argue that the culture and mindset is pretty similar to America.
---
Reroll you'd be surprised how fast alliance level due to actually having quests that aren't grind on this thing with a low drop rate.
---
I haven't even stated my opinion.
---
You have all the right to doubt me but my friend saw it with his two undead eyes, he sprinted to help me but my Ghostly Strike critted and by the time he was there the gnome flopped on the ground dead, we both cheered and were pumped the whole night, we tried it with a hunter....
---
but that didnt work out so well..
---
All in all I used: Cheap shot, Ghostly Strike, Kidney Shot, Kick, Vanish, Prep, Cheap, Ghostly, Sinister, Kidney, Thistle, Vanish, Cheap, Kidney, Sinister and Evas for the finnisher, my 1 combo point evas critted and he got super low, I then used Ghostly which critted and killed him. I told the story to my guild (Gravediggers) and it got super viral across the server (ZT).
---
My take on the whole thing is: 
---
#i was super frickin' lucky.
---
You have a lot of gold for your level. Just keep doing what you're doing and you'll be fine for getting your mount at 40.
---
Personally I try to not buy anything unless I have to (I have a bunch of spell upgrades sitting for spells that I rarely use). I also make a shit load of bags and sell them on the AH from the cloth that I get from mobs, they seem to always be in demand. I also sell BoE blues on the AH instead of disenchanting them, some net me around 50s. Once a day I also scan the AH for items that vendor for more than they're listed for - it's usually only a few copper for each item but hey, free money.
---
Yeah permanently banning people for finding faults in your game, that'll totally not encourage people to just exploit them and abuse them without letting anyone know.
---
Half the 60's I see in Ironforge on my server are on epic mounts, I don't know where you have been looking but epic mount only takes 1-2 days of farming.
---
I had half my pre-bis before I even hit 60.
---
Ah okey, cool thanks. GJ btw :D
---
There were two different exploits... One was the layering, one was the dungeon-raid. Both were probably used.
---
Didn't realize nhazy meant nazi but okay. In short, it doesn't fucking matter what their name is as you're not forced to play with them. Go ahead and report all the hate speech you can, it's great but holy fuck you're legitimately delusional if you think I'm privileged because I don't give a shit about some names on WoW.
---
Legend
---
you need to him there and start a new toon
---
it'll be nutty easy for blizzard to find these exploiters and handle it.  what they're doing can't be achieved except through exploitation.  if you're killing these bosses with minutes inbetween or whatever you're gonna get banned.
---
Last time there were layering exploits like this, it all turned out to be photoshopped and videos from private servers...
---
Try 20 times a session on a server with an uneven ratio. If you're behind on the leveling curve, it's gonna be a bad time on a lot of servers.
---
I had a similar story today as a lvl 35 warrior in desolace. Came back to my body to find my skeleton, 4 dead mobs, and the one that finished me off still patrolling. Victory or death!
---
Pretty much my experience.  I will ask /say "any groups with space for the quest? " 2-3 times,  and if they remain silent, I assume they are just hanging out there for rp reasons amd not questing, or are bots.  If my group is full, I always atleast say "full" or I invite.
---
Ask a guard where the bank/trainers/etc are. Most vendors that sell equipment can repair.
---
&gt; You should have access to your talent tree at level 10, press "N" ingame if you haven't seen it.
---
&gt; You'll have 3 trees to choose from, Fire, Frost and Arcane. I'd suggest choosing Fire or Frost, and investing points down that path, then using spells mostly from that school as you'll get good benefits from it.
---
&gt; You seem to be enjoying frost, so go for that.
---
I’ve got 6 talent points so I’ll invest it into frost thanks! 
---
&gt; Generally you can sell most green items at a vendor and that's it. Early on the green items aren't too valuable because they're replaced so quickly.
---
&gt; If you're ever worried about whether an item is valuable, check out the Auction House and see what people are selling the item for.
---
Will do thanks.
---
&gt; Open your skills list, go to general, and "leatherworking" should be available there.
---
Okay I found it. Seems like I need to go and get the skinning skill too. Thanks for the help man.
---
"just"
---
BiS has nothing to do with layering exploits so prob not. They play 10+ hours a day grinding dungeons and having done 2 raids to get his so far
---
 If they're going for BiS they probably ran dungeons hundreds of times and some of the drops sell for hundreds of gold
---
Edit. There are lots of streamers that have similar items/gold
---
Retail wow has overlapping server names for all regions. There is Tich EU and Tich US.
---
What else would the point be? I'm at a complete loss here.
---
The Brits don't use pounds.
---
Oh, I meant it more in the fashion of keeping a txt file of "people who i hate" rather than server-wide brigading.
---
Get in control.
---
I kill all rogues on sight
---
Anything else I usually just let go
---
what
---
Most likely if they are monitoring the situation/high gold amounts, they are probably working on a patch to fix the exploit and will ban once the patch is out.
---
Exactly..
---
How can they still increase their nameplate distance
---
My girlfriend brings me food, drinks, and scratches my back while I play because she appreciates her man and I give her that good dick.
---
I mean, it's not like you can message them to ask. *Oh wait...*
---
Nope, people will use it if it is there. Remove the fucking shit already.
---
Take engineering to mitigate some of the ranged and closer problems.
---
Blameaux is slightly in horde favor but close enough to even. That’s where I’m at!
---
Grats.
---
what item will make his useless ret ass usefull xD
---
What I mean is the flying in BC if i remember correct was only 60 speed while leveling and people seemed to still be making an effort to PVP and would be riding their epic ground mount while leveling anyway because it could be faster at times, but after that xpac is kind of went crazy and the zones even more were designed around flying and no one battled.
---
Druid has flexibility, priest has stronger healing. So for endgame raids, priest is more sought after.
---
Or just restart everyone that abused the layering and dungeon-raid exploits
---
But you’re getting personal and attacking people. 
---
I have not attacked you nor tried to be derogatory towards you or anyone else, not the kind of person I am really.
---
Post deleted. What was the exploit?
---
They've gotten changed multiple times now, I can't even keep up or remember them all, they're currently "Forced Entry". Lead by Xoxo-Herod
---
Well.... I’m sure you’ve already noticed the “store” button on the character select screen in the lower left 😄
---
And if you haven’t... surprise!
---
Paladan pvp is total ass without a few key things not available to every paladin. 
---
In order of importance imho
---
Seal of Command. 
---
Engineering for bomb stuns
---
Repatence
---
Tidal charm
---
Without these things its just a slow fight. AA them until they are dead or you are. Dont forget blessing of freedom. Helps a lot with being kited.
---
How did he get 100k? The post got removed.
---
How do show the healing amount you do to a target? I can’t seem to find the setting.
---
As a LW shimmering flats was heaven but I didnt even get 1 level after clearing the whole zone of quests. I was disappointed
---
I just set this up a few hours ago by using the quick setup on isboxer, half of it doesn't work properly and i haven't made a single configuration. No idea how this works properly (especially since my pc crashes when i change graphic settings).
---
Good luck to me, the WoW widow haha!

Really powerful gaming chair for sure

You are welcome :)

Hopefully he gets permanently banned.
---
Get to 60 with about 200g from leveling and you can now work towards the one item holding up towards Naxxramas without you ever worrying about the abysmal droprate of Robes of the Exalted.
---
That's exactly what I've been doing with my priest. So far it's been pretty smooth.
---
Most likely yes
---
35 with 84g. Just need 90g at 40 taking into the faction discount into consideration.
---
So dragons are dinosaurs with wings?
---
Basically, layering works in dungeons and raids, and whole guilds have abused it to get full prebis in a day and sell a fuckton of valuable recipes and other loot.
---
i think he is missing like 2 pieces, he plays all day.
---
If you alt f4 you will just continue the flight where you left off. I think if you wanted to recreate it you'd actually have to DC
---
I hope you get the help you need mate, I really do. Feel sorry for you. :/
---
Mage is bad and frost mage is God awful vs other casters... He really should have known better
---
Druids are easily ganked right now by certain classes.  No PVP trinket makes getting caught by rogues or warlocks a death sentence.  I only have an easy time getting away from mages, warriors, etc.
---
As in the Backstreet Boys? They're back again?!
---
Hmm, ok.  Maybe I have been too reliant on wands then.  Thanks for the response!
---
“And you can try and get personal all you want, throw insults, it just invalidates your opinions and make you seem like an asshole to be fair. :)”
---
Anyone know the name of the 3rd song? It was soo fitting lol!
---
Please give examples man lol these changes are insignificant compared to the experience of playing on the current patch. Playing legion and BfA did nothing to prepare a player for classic.
---
It’s almost like layering is bad like we all said
---
I leveled from 29-39 exclusively through mob grinding in arathi highlands (spiders and raptors) selling the white and grey drops made me about 75g by 40 I had moved to swamp of sorrows and was at 116 gold.
---
Questing is a scam dont do it. Just grind.
---
Edit: additional tip focus on green mobs so they are less likely to resist/dodge
---
Probly has power gaming socks too. OP imo.
---
Isn't just 1 guy and his friends either, countless people have been doing it since the Twitch Clips started popping up last week.
---
It's beyond repair. 
---
Reminds me of the instant respawn bug for Whiptail  in Cataclysm.
---
@Mods why would you remove this?
---
A macro has to be bound to a key, or clicked so it’s fine. 1 action. It’s saying that if you’re using a third party app like this to control the game (or multiple accounts simultaneously) it’s fine because for every click there is someone actually clicking it, if the software you’re using to control the game is  actually playing your character for you then it’s against the rules.
---
This is a battle for Azeroth, but one we actually care about and want to participate in.   Keep your morals, but never forget this is a war and you’re traversing the battlegrounds of it.
---
Barrens chat. Live Stream Reddit, with raiding.
---
I have been saying this for months, maybe now some people will wake up to themselves (doubt it)
---
Hell yea man do it.
---
Damn, you just answered my 13 year question whether Gamon is just a bug that nobody bothered to fix. Only saw him once in Classic.
---
Was this on ZandalarTribe EU? If yes that may be me xD
---
Blizzard has already commented on this. They found that these claims are "wildly inaccurate".
---
Regardless of how you feel about a pvp server, dropping on someone who is at low mana who is busy looting just after getting a kill is a dick move. It's only beaten out by hitting the mob they're fighting then killing them to get the tag.
---
Yeah, yeah, if you're red you're dead, doesn't make it not a dick move. It's just one people are okay with performing.
---
Note that you're level 42 and OP said endgame
---
Booty bay. Buy a book
---
The way I recall the old days is that while this is perfectly fine while leveling up... For a lvl 60 dungeon you want the tank to be prot and the healer to be heal spec.
---
Once you get decent gear then it doesn't matter, but as of now nobody has decent gear.
---
Then again... back in the days we were all freaking noobs.
---
if you got rid of layering those 2 hour queues would be 10 hours. no thanks. and at launch? those 7 hour queues would be well over 24 hours.
---
I’m on sulfuras, which seems to be fluctuating between medium-high on off hours to full with about an hour + queue on prime time.  
---
Not saying there isn’t tons of pvp - but never enough to prevent me from questing, especially if I’m not aggressive.
---
No, that was a different topic. This is a separate issue, one much much worse.
---
You won't ever "see" layering. 
---
The layer your are in, is that version of your server, assigned when you login. However, if you group up with someone in a differing layer, you are automatically transported to their layer.
---
Can we talk about whatever the fuck is going on with your hot bars?
---
Implying layering is any better rofl
---
See we could've responded better if we had that edited link at the beginning.

Thats definitely silly because you can right click an alliance portrait and "add bnet tag" and just talk to thst individual np from in-game
---
Haha, and used all 5 cooldowns at the same time 😂😂
---
Go tell your therapist. We don't care.
---
Cleaned out Brd fine at 58 with arms spec as tank. :p
---
Wtf does the navy seals have to do with WoW...what comparison are you even trying to make?
---
No, the real lesson here is don't burn your mana on Arcane Explosion in a 1v1 situation that doesn't involve a rogue having just used Vanish.
---
Cockiness shall be thy downfall every time.
---
It's says the linked post was removed, what is this exploit about?
---
That sounds fun! Any links to the specific build you’re talking about?
---
yes automation would be used to catch the minute apart repeated boss killing. people attempting to appeal their ban will be handled manually. thats how it works. you think blizz should have 100k support employees or something?
---
I didnt know the reddit post linking to the thread was removed.
---
One person made a post about it which is removed that most likely is a lie.
---
If you’re talking about the free transfer you only have one option.
---
It's absolutely insane that this is an actual exploit. Mods are deleting all posts about this, too. Good job guys.
---
Yes, but it is obviously not intended for layering to work in dungeons.
---
That isnt how you finish mankriks quest...
---
As if warriors didn't have it hard enough
---
rogue so no aoe
---
Please tell me you're only eating Hot Pockets while playing too.
---
Did it every strike anyone as strange that horde got 4 instances in their damn starting zone?
---
It already is. Layering is doing it job and stopping servers having a meltdown so you can actually play the game.
---
Report the xploits and they should get fixed, if not layering will be gone by phase 2 anyway
---
Layering is active in dungeons and raids. Entire guilds are using it to farm prebis quickly and make hundreds of thousands of gold.
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/instance-layering-exploit/299614/17
---
Nice try, the reddit post was removed by the mods, but it linked to this forum post.
---
Why are you so against this? we wont get this fixed if we keep acting like it isnt happening.
---
Ok that is pretty embarassing :P
---
I don't know, man. I started playing wow classic on release and it was the first time playing wow for me and I' ve become so addicted that I honestly think I have a problem. Is it going to be fun? Holy fck yes! But at what cost....
---
Haha, I level arms spec but tank dungeons (was mt heavily in cata and mop). I rearrange my abilities when I switch back and forth and get kinda lazy with it sometimes.
---
The problem is that if they turned it off, some zones would be unplayable in terms of how busy they would be. Servers are like 10x+ bigger than they were back in the Classic days, so Blizz has kinda cornered themselves with this layering problem - if they turn it off, the average players experience suffers. But if they keep it on, exploiters will use and abuse it to eventually break the economy which will *also* lead to the average players experience suffering :P
---
Cheating your way to the top is not immoral. And everyone not doing it is an „imbecile“.
---
Some people... smh
---
The game is already completely fucked and corrupted, dungeons abused, raids abused, leveling abused and Mat farming abused, Blizzard had 1 job and they completely failed (again) when is the next round of P servers?
---
Arathi and STV.
---
Ughhh
---
Is that what shows the spell hes casting with castbar as well? And the debuff timers?

You can almost hear him going to the forums to cry.

No it's level 5 I looked it up before posting my comment
---
Can you actually show a clip proving it?
---
hello blizzdrone ! bad bot, too predictable
---
that's right
---
My opinion: keep your mage as an alt experience when your friends are not on and level a different class on alliance. Dwarf priest or rogue??
---
What it in NW STV? May have been me. 
---
/spit
---
Layering is a lot better, and if you aren't going out of your way to abuse it's bugs (this obviously is a bug in layering), it doesn't affect you at all but gives you a very honest classic experience.
---
 Yes I'd much rather have layering than walking out of Orgrimmar and seeing people around me disappear.
---
Feed it ice cold milk :)
---
Now I sit my 5 year old down and he does my fishing for me. 👶
---
Hey guys, first time playing wow besides some private servers that i never took seriously and got past 20
---
I made a mage, lv 43 now, and i'm a love/hate relationship with it, i read and did watch a lot of videos, so after respeccing 2 times, i ended up with a aoe frost build, but...
---
85% of the time i get to a spawn, there's at least a couple people there, usually also mages. That sucks, but it's understandable.
---
However, when i get the stars to align and i get the spawn spot just for me, i do see i'm leveling at a good rate, but it just feels dull. Questing however feel like it's way too much work for little reward.
---
Am i questing in the wrong maps, is mage bad for questing alone, am i just impatient with questing? Where should i quest at 43 as a ally mage? Should i spend 10g to respec to a single target build?
---
I'm loving the game, loving the social aspect, and met great people while playing, but i want to feel that i am progressing while also playing in a way that i don't get bored
---
Thanks guys and sorry for the wall of text
---
I agree with zGnRz. It is a lot closer to game breaking than you think.  This isn't what classic was all about.  Before when you were being camped,  you called your guild and got the other faction out of that area by reversing the tables.  When there were no quest mobs, you either waited for then to respawn or you went on to a different quest.  The layer hopping is much worse than you would believe.  Watching entire groups kill all of the furbolgs in felwood only to disappear and show up again 20 minutes later and reclear all of the mobs.  It's making AOE farming so much more lucrative.  Really.../join world. You will see nothing but spams for layer requests. It's terrible.  I would rather suffer through a queue and overpopulated servers than continue to have the abuse that is taking place.

Whose talking about vendoring an epic BiS gun? Absolutely no one lol. He’s going to use that gun for easily the next few months. For a casual player, this might be the best weapon they ever own.
---
what unit frames are you using??
---
Just keep auto-attacking, it will all be okay in the end
---
Heed this man's words. You a dad now. Doing dad stuff. Not babysitting. I would do the same but mines 17 months and he like to watch but only for so long cause kids got to be kids plus he likes spamming my mechanical keyboard lol
---
Lol?? Damn dude, take a breath. Quote my "complaint" please, I'd love to hear your interpretation of what I said.
---
It does make sense. They explained that 1.12 was the oldest workable reference client they had available.
---
For them to work backwards and deconstruct the game back to its launch condition would have required years more work, possibly making the game insanely buggy and unstable (worse than it actually was at launch).
---
Your best bet is to do the zones over there until you get naturally close to ironforge, should not take long and will get you to around level 10 if i remember correctly then you can do anything with xp left in goldshire and start on westfall.
---
Blizz won't do shit.
---
I have a quest automation addon. I forgot about that and fucked over my group...
---
Ideally both. Anyone who clearly *intentionally* abused this should just get a permban

Layering is only in effect for so long because they didn't know how popular it would be and how long it would be popular for.
---
Luckily they decided to over do it because we already had hour long server queues and multiple full realms. Imagine waiting 4 hours to log in only to have 10000ms lag because you're in a zone with 1000 people.
---
People will complain about anything. Yes this exploit is bad and it should be fixed and those who used it banned and stripped of anything they gained from it but people really like to blow this shit away out of proportion
---
Delete this
---
Eh, they aren’t tbh - no one cares unless it’s something totally ludicrous 
---
I did report someone called Gnomehitler, though...
---
Why do you prefer BFA gearing over classic?
---
Why did you comment that im jealous he has more time than me when clearly this post is about him exploiting?
---
He isnt getting all these things because he is on the streamer server and has 100 viewers. He fucking cheated.
---
I think he means real as in a large amount.
---
its over
---
You’re on a different level cause of time, not exploits. You’re whining out of jealousy.
---
Time to wipe all the servers and relaunch the game!
---
It’s kungen, all he has to garner attention is whining and pining for the “good ol day”. Dude is played out and was incapable of adjusting to the game as it evolved through the years, trying to make excuse after excuse.
---
Dude was spamming arcane explosion, idk.  Real bad.
---
At work, cant watch . What exploit is it ?
---
Some people still seem to care enough to keep downvoting my original comment though 🙄
---
[He says a couple more things which make it 10x better imo. Here is a post literally f](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d3z2yh/when_you_realize_your_fetch_quest_was_to_supply/)[rom yesterday that has 1k+ upvotes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d3z2yh/when_you_realize_your_fetch_quest_was_to_supply/)

---
Leave me the fuck alone, i dont start fights unless they try something + if i dont get any honor its a waste of time.
---
Been playing with a random rogue i met for the past few days, he murders pretty much everything in sight. I normally just watch him delete people, only time i decide to help out was vs 2 hunters with 2 extremely aggro pets. I felt that 4v1 was a bit unfair.
---
Maybe not perma banned but definitely a long ban and any gold/items gained via exploit removed
---
Character is still there and you can finish him whenever. No need to rush! Why shove a filet mignon in a blender?
---
That would be so great but what about transfers n stuff?
---
Use curse forge, you will need to download the twitch client
---
Awesome, thanks for the response. Was looking for an addon that did that.
---
I didn’t and I never said he wasn’t cheating just seemed pretty pointless to post
---
Better than living with the people who drag you down though.
---
He had nothing for me. I believe this is bugged.
---
I'm good, too worried about the grind.
---
I just did.
---
That would be great but what about mailing to alts?
---
I’m saying you can replicate this if you want without layer very similarly. Is the efficiency a bit different, sure. But it’s not wildly different.
---
I would be 100% okay with that.
---
You beat me to it, layering is not a :)"server" each server has only limited players, layering does not add to this. Layering makes it so all 15k people, or whatever arent in the same place at the same time
---
Like others said you can join the looking for group chat, if you mean low level dungeons it's best to be in the zone the dungeon is in and ask around to get a group of questers going (assuming it's something like VC where people are actually questing and not a case like an alliance trying to do WC and looking in the barrens).
---
If it's for high level go to a major city and look in the general chat there for a group as well as the looking for group chat.
---
"which btw they have a 5 min internal cooldown on so it's not like they can just do this nonstop"
---
They do it non stop every 5 min. Rare spawn take hours to respawn so 5min isnt a big deal. Same thing about ressources heavy zones, it's faster to wait 5min to get all the nodes there than to move somewhere else.
---
And the worse is still the ruined world pvp. Can't even have faction vs faction big battle over quests ressources because everyone just switch layer when they are killed instead of fighting back.
---
No hate here.
---
It is my understanding that we get BFA and a 110 character boost after hitting level 60 - correct?
---
Is retail even worth playing these days though?  I tried re-rolling a character in retail to see the changes and it just felt super simplified and unfulfilling.  Does the rest of the game these days reflect that?
---
no it's not
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEzzVfMqZZVcfk0xo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEzzVfMqZZVcfk0xo)
---
I hate these people. Just enjoy the game for what it is. Everything changes and evolves over time that's not automatically a bad thing
---
I was very upset with this layering exploitting and the 10 man raid xp bug. I was expecting vanilla, not them. Only thing that calms my mind is the fact Classic is not a vanilla relaunch, but a retail wow expansion just made look like vanilla. Accepting that fact makes me less upset and able to play again. Still, I've lost around 80% of my motivation, but Blizzard truly delivered us the Blizzard quality they promised. Not Vanilla.
---
You will end up doing it very quickly
---
He thinks I’m you
---
Same, it took me 15 days to get to 60 he first time around and I'm sure as fuck not doing it that slow again.
---
? What? Some exploits are not able to be fixed easily and stay in the game but become bannable. Some exploits arise with new patches, etc, and this is one. 
---
It *is* blizzards program that is not functioning properly. It *is* the player who's abusing, but there's such a gray area in abuse and exploits and taking advantage, sometimes you do it just to keep up with the others doing it. Doesn't make it right, but I'm also not certain it makes it a perma-ban offense either.
---
Noni!?
---
When you are in a location picking up quests make sure they are of yellow color in your quest book, that will indicate that the amount of XP gained for finishing said quest is appropriate for your current level (orange and red color indicate that you are a bit of a low lvl for those quests, but nothing stops you from trying to complete them).  
---
Mage is good at solo leveling, afaik frost is the best for solo due to low mana cost on frostbolt/easy rotation/constant roots etc, just drink/eat after pulls and you should be fine.  
---
It is a 15 year old game, so if you find questing tedious - just keep that in mind.   
---
I wouldn't bother respecing just so you could try solo leveling. Not worth it, give it a shot first and see how you get on.   
---
Alliance form death squads of people 10+ levels higher than the zone to camp Horde quest zones. 
---
I have just as many memories of getting camped by higher levels as a Horde on Classic as I did in the entirety of my time playing alliance in Vanilla/BC (I have a pretty good memory for that type of thing). 
---
So what I'm saying is is that you all deserve it.
---
Is months quick to you?
---
Hey guys. My question is that what would happen if my Level 54 friend team up with my Level 17 character and have him helping on my questing/leveling through the lower level maps? Will there be a penalty on EXP for so?  
---
If yes, would it be better if we don't be on the same team? like I would just be by myself and open up on a mob with my damage spell and have him to kill it right after?   
---
I feel like this is the best way to do it if there is a penalty on grouping up with a higher level friend. Am I not see any downside here? Am I missing anything?
---
It’s not like the raids were really that hard in Vanilla. We were collectively fucking terrible and ignorant. We didn’t know how to play our classes nearly as well as now, had to discover how fights worked, etc.
---
Even if we were the very first patch, Rag would have still died in greens and blues with ease. We just know so much more.
---
The big issue with achievements is when you start getting to content that is dungeons or raids people start using them to be requirements to do said dungeons and raids as a pug.
---
Unless you really play on hardcore raiding i'd just pick which ever you like the lore/skills/look/playstyle of more and roll with it.
---
Nearly all the vanilla classes have quirks that can be annoying and looked at as a negative and it's best to view the leveling and dungeon experience while leveling as the game as well not just a rush to end game like in retail
---
Yeah, who? The 1-2 employees they have working on the game lol?
---
Somewhere between $0 and $0 is being spent on Classic.
---
Interesting that you didn't recommend SnD. I have read that you want to pretty much have it up at all times, and that the vast majority of your damage comes from it and your normal attacks!
---
I remember a vanilla guild called &lt;Nagas Belong in Slavepens&gt;.  They never had to change it AFAIK.  I'd consider that one pretty dang offensive.
---
Never complained at all. I said they automate reports. If you don't like that, that's your opinion.
---
It effects a ton of things. It changes the economy and player power drastically. Cheating like this has far reaching effects.
---
I'm a level 51 warrior tank in arms and I have literally never had a problem with shadow specc'd priests.
---
Hilarious. Jealousy does mess with your thinking. Clearly this guy just needs more time to play wow.
---
Get to boss, kill, swap leaders of group for new boss layer.. Rinse repeat....
---
KEKW
---
I didnt expect farming efficiently which is why i lowballed it at 30g/hr. If anything, someone who farms efficiently would be better off equipping it if you factor in the time saved not having to farm lbrs for a crossbow that every melee in your group is going to be rolling on.
---
When someone is nice i always tip. Even if i don't have a ton of money.
---
play mage
---
Very big brain
---
Queues do not equal or have anything to do with layering. By your theory, when they get rid of layering in phase 2 each server will be limited to 3000 people, which is not the case.
---
Is it weird that I like that?
---
I know that I would HATE 100% being scammed, but the possibility of it happening seems interesting.
---
You would have to take precautions. Like asking around for somebody who is known, or ask for proof (for example, giving someone a bunch of light leather and ask them to convert them into medium leather).
---
Probably wouldn't work in wow, as this game is faction oriented (everyone in your faction should be considered as your ally), and games like EVE or OSRS are free for all.
---
I'm not sure anyone can confirm that Blizzard is "completely unaware" of this. If anyone has over a few thousand gold I can almost guarantee they are aware of it. They were searching the running programs on WoW players computers to find the archaeology bot back when it came out and banned tens of thousands of people all at once. They didn't ban one or two at a time. I also don't know if they would be vocal about someone exploiting and making "100K" gold to the community. Sounds like a bad PR move.
---
lol dude, name on exploit where it wasnt blizzard program not functioning.
---
Thats the whole reason it is called exploiting. 
---
It starts off as a bug. thats fine, it happens once and you report it. It is when you use that bug hundreds of times and take advantage of it to get ahead. That is when it becomes an exploit.
---
&gt;sometimes you do it just to keep up with the others doing it. Doesn't make it right, but I'm also not certain it makes it a perma-ban offense either.
---
Yea ok, tell that to the limit and method players that got busted in Legion. When you knowingly abuse a bug, youre exploiting.
---
I rerolled at level 12 to the same exact character/class because I read misleading information about how much rep I would have gotten if I had started the night elf zone at level 1. Then I rerolled at level 22 when I got sick of averaging 1-2 kills per death run on Warrior. Back to level 33 on Druid. Dunno why I thought my vanilla main could be anything other than my since-vanilla retail main.
---
What the actual fuck
---
If they were to remove layering, which we have no idea of knowing how many layers there actually are, the game would be unplayable.
---
I've seen people mention 7 layers, and more - That means ONE server currently contains atleast 7 servers worth of people, and then you have then 7k queueing every day at prime time.
---
At prime time today, around 8 PM I had 7k queue on EU-Gehennas.
---

---
Oh my sweet summer child, this will never happen.
---
Why would you try to ask them on Reddit instead of just messaging the people you’re looking for ingame..
---
Sounds like a good time! Hopefully he brings friends. 
---
But also most people definitely move on after getting their asses kicked this hard.
---
People sure are strange.
---
Just talk to people.... The whole idea of classic is that we don't have these things like lfg etc that replace social interactions.
---
But does it have effects on the level you play the game? I know for how much I play (and the vast majority play) there is going to be no difference. This is for the 1%, not the 99%
---
When you say I made a lot money selling an item and don't give details ppl just take it as bragging and don't give a shit. You did the same thing in your 2nd post btw.
---
You really just did what you wanted at the level you wanted. But if you wanted to raid the latest content then you would need to farm yourself some food and flasks, or gold to buy them, help your guild out, learn the fights, and show up ready to go.
---
Running raids back then was insanely hard, being in them was actually pretty easy if you had half a brain. 
---
Of course if you're talking the insanely hardcore, best of the best? That's another story. You'd have a bunch of 60's and be playing 18 hours a day doing all sorts of shit to keep you guys the best.
---
You're witch hinting someone without any evidence. There are plenty of streamers who all have great gear with 1000+g it's not uncommon for people playing 10+ hours a day since launch. Why are you so bent on witch hubting exploiting layering anyways
---
Youtube, Instagram comments and Twitch chat are all worse than Reddit
---
I'm a girlfriend who isn't as engaged either. My boyfriend is like level 56 and has hundreds of gold and etc etc. I'm  level 25 with 6 gold... It's not that I don't like the game, he just has more free time than I do. I don't sit and play as much as he does and never will. 
---
I enjoy the fuck out of the game but I also take a more involved role in household tasks so that leaves less time for gaming. 
---
We enjoy talking about the game and our adventures. Sometimes he comes help me if the alliance is fucking with me too much. But otherwise we do our own things.
---
I wouldn't push her too much, might have an opposite effect.
---
Dude, just stop, youre commenting on so many of my comments it is becoming very awkward how youre more invested in this than I am, and Im the OP.
---
Please post source of them saying they banned literally anyone for this.
---
I looked through all there and saw no one, thank you though, it was worth a shot.
---
Odd. Might be server specific then. Idk havent reach a high nuff level to run more then a few.
---
how can horde compete
---
﻿
---
It’s really not that crazy. It’s 1.0 attack speed and 9 other normal tamable spawns have 1.2. Broken tooth is kind of a meme at this point.
---
Uh, yeah. Life isn't fair. A video game with predetermined rules, by definition, should be.
---
Bad argument.
---
druids rek face in wpvp
---
I'm on my third character.
---
Rerolled my lvl 20 lock to play on a less populated server
---
Rerolled a lvl 35 warlock because my friend and me were sick and tired of lacking healers and tanks so we'll do it ourselves.
---
Didnt think healers were in shorter supply then tanks.
---
Sounds like entirely too many fucks to give
---
 On September 12th, the People's Army fought at the frontlines. We fought to liberate the peon from the Alliance hegemony and liberate Astranaar!
---
You want CC and careful pulls? Try Heroics in Cataclysm. Thoes shits required cc and care
---
just because an exploit exist doesnt mean everyone is using it.  You are clearly jealous or mad or you wouldnt have wasted time making this thread to begin with
---
Yep. You join with someone else. If you "phase" you are in a new layer &amp; off you go. If you don't, you drop group &amp; get invited by someone else until you shift.
---
Mr. guard will nae have a next shift if he keeps yappin'
---
Dickheads in wow are dickheads in real life.

No your a towel!

---
this is my theory. the annoying people want to be on the "most popular" server. adults that dont care about that are aware of this, and are aware that those ppl think that rp servers are lame. its basically a filter. also i get to report shitty names and they actually get changed surprisingly fast.
---
This is absolutely just as absurd.  I have not abused layering and im level 56. I've got almost 300g as well. Nothing I have done has been an exploit or even remotely close to it.  I will not choose to lessen the quality of the game simply because other idiots choose to. Simply put... if you're intentionally using layering for any advantage what so ever... you're an idiot and you should feel bad.  You're taking the game and ruining it for everyone that wants to relive the game the way it's meant to be played.  You instant gratification clowns should quit now and go back to the game you destroyed.  Blizzard was at least partly right when they said "you think you do but you don't". The people that are abusing these mechanics are the people that thought they wanted the classic experience,  but were mistaken.
---
I didnt say following comments was confusing, you did...
---
I said it is weird how many comments you have in my thread, youre going around multiple comment chains and saying the same thing.
---
You literally stopped replying to me on one comment just to start up again on this one. Whats trhe point youre trying to make?
---
Dude it isn't fair! they can heal themselves! Blizz plz buff mages for the 37th time in a row, we NEED it
---
No its "you come to  my discord solely to argue with me, im gonna ban you".
---
The exploit wasn't fake, it was exaggerated.  It is ridiculously easy to farm if your server has even 4 or 5 layers which is easy on popular servers.  It's not an inventory full of arcane crystals in a day easy, but it magnifies your effectiveness by at least as many times as you have layers.
---
Photos like this will be in history programs 100 years from now when we have neural interfaces and full dive VR. Kids in 2119 will say "they played games like that???"
---
Its even worse in POE.  No auction house, only trade, and a strict hands-off policy
---
Because people are exploiting layering in dungeons. That's why everything is so cheap
---
Wow this is game breaking.. they have to stop this
---
That's the opposite of my problem though. The problem is that none of the consumables I used to use on pservers can even be used with standard class buffs. Like the only thing I can use right now seems to be Nightfin Soup D:  
---
    
---
Like what is even the point of having stuff like Elixir of the Sages if they can't be used when you have Prayer of Spirit and Arcane Brilliance. Wot. It seem super odd to me that as a healer I could use MORE relevant consumables (guardian/battle elixirs) in TBC than I can in Classic. I'm just super confused right now.
---
That friend was on the same layer.  If he had been on a different layer it would have worked.

---
Forreal I pray this happens to me I’d be excited to ruin someone for their foolishness. Send em a letter saying “lol gg buddy enjoy your ban”
---
Going to be really easy for Blizzard to ban people too they literally just look at their kill history and see a boss kill closer to each other like that. What kind of idiots think they can get away with this lol.
---
OP claims his whole guild was doing this. If what he claims is true then there should be a bunch of these patterns on the AH. He was claiming 100k gold.
---
Freak out?
---
You just said how it would effect your server, a full server and cant get full price on your BoEs, now imagine someone buying those BoEs for under full price, that wont effect you or your server at all right? Guilds with 100k worth of gold wont ruin the marker once they start buying all the herbs right?
---
"Remember to take all things in moderation (even World of Warcraft!)"
---
How do you know I haven't?
---
Holy shit. Can you do this in MC?
---
I pretty much just ignore people unless they attack me.  PvP serves no purpose currently, and isn't very "skill" based in classic.
---
Sold a pair of Devilsaur leggings for 200g today, so people do definitely have 200g to spare. Question is if they have it to spare for this
---
I like wpvp as a pally, especially when my Seal of Command procs, kinda feel like a shaman lol.
---
Yeah it's only certain servers it seems. Mine is fine too
---
Whats the best weaponset for a feral cat druid in pvp? Does it matter if you’re fighting solely in cat form?
---
Just party with him and you will be brought into the same layer..
---
Understandable. Such a beautiful name.
---
Go watch the blizzcon video. They literally explain to an audience of people who are not programmers how they did it. It's like 45 min, but they explain this.
---
It's actually hilarious how many of the "Just ignore it dood" guys turn into straight up alt-righters as soon as slightly challenged and you just know they were masquerading the whole time
---
Was more satirical that anything tbh.
---
It was also decided in 1999 (might be a few years off) that thrall will be the one to kill deathwing. It's in the unreleased point and click adventure game, lord of the clans. Which is awesome btw y'all should play it.
---
If I was jealous, wouldnt I name the streamer? Wouldnt I try to discredit the accomplishments he has done?
---
You dont even know who the fuck im talking about. Imagine commenting on a thread thats a waste of time, and staying on that thread lol
---
What class/level?
---
It's not bragging. It's business. I still need another 1000 gold to get the items I want. You want some advice to make gold pick up fishing and google 40 gold an hour fishing. Level and location doesn't matter until you need a certain zone. Frost will tell you the rest.
---
Exploiting is very much against the rules of the game though and it is immoral. I'd say the one doing something which guarantees a ban is imbecile.
---
All interrupts on F and R, master race.
---
And here I am 25+ runs in armory and I still don't have the axe
---
Just won a gut ripper from a greed roll with my group and was wondering when the best time to sell it would be? I'm guessing later on once people gave more gold and mounts but am worried it could even be cheaper by then too
---
I'mma chargin' my fireball!
---
Nahhhhh. 
---
People rushed to 60 because they were excited. Not because they wanted to abuse and exploit the game for gold.
---
I tried uninstalling/reinstalling to see if it fixed the problem. Logged back into my account after an hour queue, and the chat still looked liked this. 
---
I’m back in queue after researching how to fix this, and I found this: 
---
//World of Warcraft/WTF/Account/[accountname]/[servername]/[toonname]/chat-cache.txt (delete chat-cache.txt)
---
Can anyone test this for me to see if it’ll reset chat to default? I’m in queue and can’t.
---
Sounds like OP was already in the discord and we don't know how much he participated before that. Either way I doubt the streamer would have been interested and just wanted to get rid of differing opinions. To an extent, I think it's reasonable if you have like 5k+ followers you don't want it to start getting super "negative" but.. we just don't know enough here.
---
Oh well
---
You play what’s the most fun for you! I’m a bit of alt-oholic, and have been leveling a couple of mains (pally and hunter) side by side, while also playing a warrior with a friend when he’s free. I’m absolutely having a blast with all the characters. Originally, I was playing a mage and got to level 25 or so before I decided that a mage wasn’t fun enough for me to make that my main. Don’t get me wrong, I still enjoy mage, but just not as me main character.
---
The robe is by far better than the devilsaur set and the recipe is by far hrder to farm.
---
"this is why you shouldnt pvp on pvp servers"
---
Almost no group would take a 15 to VC. Further he's talking about an exploit where you could bring a raid into SM and still get legit xp.
---
Just play holy.  You all made a mistake if you thought ret dps was going to be good or fun.  Its terrible on both accounts in classic.
---
I started a pally knowing I'd be healing.
---
Well the game has been killed by layering , you had one fucking job blizztard.
---
Right, but with 100 possibilities in 1-100 you also have to hit 100 specifically. Not just all the same number
---
If all 3 people hit 60, that's a 1 in 1 million... 
---
But for all 3 people to hit specially 100, which is a big part of this post, it would be 1 in 100,000,000.
---
Frostbolt, Cone of Cold, Fireblast, Arcane Missiles, Scorch.
---
It's the same thing for the alliance onyxia attunement quest, but at least at level 60 a lot more people seem to know about it or at least understand it if you tell them "Wait for everyone to turn the quest in before you accept the escort"
---
The buff cap in Classic right now, as far as I am aware, is too low. So if you use too many consumes you'll literally lose your world buffs.
---
It is honestly seeming pretty bugged to me tbh.
---
I am seeing 1 rolls and I'm seeing 100 rolls almost every time there's a roll on anything, whether it be a need/greed or a manual /roll for a chest.
---
Obviously over the vast number of players you're bound to see this situation happen a fair amount simply due to the large volumes of rolls happening, but the fact that me, at a micro level, is seeing 1's and 100's consistently would make me think something's weighting in the extremities favour.
---
Um you have very clearly argued that whoever you are talking about definitely exploited while providing no evidence he did
---
Do you know what a witch hunt is?

and more bans. I say make it known and remove every single person using it.
---
It's literally the only mob in the game that you can tame with that high (low) of attack speed until ZG comes out. It is highly unique and very useful in many situations. I wouldn't underplay the importance of this mob.
---
ITT:  A bunch of people who thought classic wow pve was going to be more interesting than 1-2 button presses on basically every class.
---
This should be a 100% perma ban. I can understand some smaller exploits like gold/farming related stuff warranting  a suspension/slap on the wrist (exp potion one in BFA), but  for shit like thunderfury bindings/rag? Ban them back to the stone age.
---
Because Classic was truly the best iteration of WoW, and I am desperately hoping Blizzard takes note of JageX and branches off a new version of WoW from it that keeps the same design philosophies of Vanilla and never, EVER incorporates flying mounts again!
---
I have been a horse player for 15 years and, while I'm not bias in any particular way, I fail to understand how the hell one gets around in SW. It's literally a maze that has always baffled me! Orgrimmar is the simplest to get around. It's one big front bit and a little path linking the two other bits. Simple!

Lol, just take a second to read what i said. It will make sense once you think about it.
---
The movie was fine. Could have been so much more tho.
---
Guess you missed the PVP part of the clip.
---
No they definitely need a perm-ban.
---
yea usually people being 60 fast are the one playing the most and thus farming the most, so they will often has the epic mount quickly
---
The poster is not a native English speaker.

I can tell that that particular sentence structure is a direct translation from a Chinese dialect.

You've got it all wrong, we're peaceful ~~intruders~~ natives, that are fighting back against the oppressive ~~natives~~ intruders to *our* land.
---
I think MC/Ony are safe because it has a lockout. This works because it's a different 'instance' but in raids you always zone into your saved one
---
Showed it to someone irl, and they moved me off the tree. Never considered murder like I did in that moment.
---
Warlock. 
---
Warlock is neat because of the toolkit, ability to spec multiple ways, a strong ability to solo, still desirable in groups etc etc.

It does sound like you’re interested more in a warrior, so do that if it sounds fun, but tanking doesn’t really exist until early dungeons around 15-20, and even then it’s not much until mid game. While I can agree or understand your concerns about raiding, you’re talking something that you’re months upon months away from. And with that availability you’ll never be pushing endgame to where drops beyond just the  most recent raid  are beneficial
