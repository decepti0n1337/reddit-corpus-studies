Indeed!
---
Na here, and I couldn't agree more with this sentiment. Fuck watching someone else play. Even action packed games are boring as hell to watch.
---
I for one, will camp any streamers on my server whenever I get the chance. They agree to additional risk by streaming on a PvP server and I wanna make sure they get the extra PvP they're signing up for.

I’m not saying I’m banking a lot of my plans for Classic to take this into account, but I’m banking on this being a thing

Exactly my take on it! It's like broadcasting your social security number, then getting upset your identity got stolen.
---
It will be a while until another MMORPG can replicate this feeling, shit was lit
---
Your not wrong. Post cata is a shadow of WoW, and MoP changed the fundamentals of the very nature of the game. However I do realize that some people do enjoy those expansions a lot, so who am I to tell them they can't have that, when I myself am advocating for a servers for my favorite expansion?
---
I've stopped refreshing for Classic news and started refreshing for these posts.
---
Towellie might know tbh
---
Better PvP racials and more horde players are interested in PvP. Chinadale is 2:1 faction ratio.
---
Now this is a video I haven’t thought about in a long, long time
---
I think it has something to do with this.  https://imgur.com/SAeRvqh.jpg

---
I don't think streamers will be that much of a problem because levelling is way more tedious.
---

---
Example: fanboy sees the stream but isnt on the same realm, he has to level on another realm. If you compare this to retail where you can easily level a new toon it's a different story.
---
She'd only be interested if it was unopened. :)

Nice try buddy, everyone knows you had to chew coca plants to stay energized back then

They're both great classes for solo play. For group play mage is preferd in many situations.

Hunters can't use maces. Guess you are a moron.

---
Dead zone should be added to the cons list for hunters. Shit was infuriating for 13 year old me
---
Sorry, I have only played alliance, so I have no direct experience with shamans and they're kinda uncommon so basing it on what I see in the open world is limiting.
---
Above average. It's more about knowing what is the correct tool for the job, but it's not really hectic like some other pvp specs can be. And your mobility is ridiculous so if you make a mistake you can just leave, stealth, reset the fight and try again.
---
By the holy light! That abomination must be purged!

He believes that people ultimately quit WoW because they got bored, not because they disliked the direction of the game. I disagree.
---
Now this is an excellent point. I hadn't factored this in at all. People will be way less likely to role an alt on a new server.

I’m just saying an item like this a hunter would use it more.  Mother fucker you’re suggesting a boomkin should be able to get hand of rag.  You have literally no room to call anyone a moron on this forum.

Literal fuckin inbred
---
I hope it’s late August tbh, I need more time to prepare for release
---

---
The faction much more than the server is a gauge of personality type. Each server goes on to develop their own sense of unique community.
---
Different types of people definitely gravitate to specific races and classes.
---
Exact same for me, two weeks from the 15th.
---
If I'm wrong about the release date, I'll level a paladin.
---
At least clean the filth off brother and show the game some respect lmao
---
The PvP lovers here would have loved the [Mordred](https://youtu.be/xbiDfDnIDMM) server. Always on FFA PvP for the uninitiated..
---
but karazhan was doable, as was parts of TK and SCC for casuals. eventually the trickle down would get you into Black Temple and Mount Hyjal. 
---
and at the end you could even get some charity loot from the Shattered Sun Offensive, and dip a toe into the Sunwell.
---
Those are the same people that regretted rolling on one.

More like 12 hours with breaks in between, another 4 hours for bio, and 8 hours for sleep.

Aww another PvP griefer. Not surprised.

I’m thinking you could do the ENTIRE scene where Dwight starts the fire. And everyone is freaking out trying to cancel whatever they had planned that week.

I havent laughed at a reddit post that hard in a while
---
wrath had good PvE content, but it was the beginning of the end. a recycled raid (Naxx), the magnificent Ulduar, followed by the forgettable Tournament... ended on a high note with the Lich King.
---
the second year was empty, except for a throw-away raid.
---
Wrath suffered from gear inflation, some bad raids, and some stupid storylines. 
---
its the return of the jedi of warcraft -- a fitting end to the trilogy, everything after it was lesser.
---
It’s a candid depiction of the twelfth hour instilled with furious intent to stay ahead of the horde when the game drops. Come come I say brother and say rejoice for our self neglect and lack of personal hygiene is nigh and it cometh with hateful and bearish temperament. I say thee brother, dare not underestimate her power to take for she is always hungry for time, and she always insist on “one more hour before bed”

Could you show us which piece of vital discussion got pushed down the page because of this post?

Yeah, there was no portal there before hand

Still wear my tabard!
---
I about shit seeing that for the first time.
---
My basic plan is to only do group content when I am certain I have the time. Otherwise I'll be questing in the open world with my fellow mates who also have kids and wives now. We all understand about having to drop everything at a moment's notice so there'll be no drama if I suddenly need to race off and deal with matters of crucial importance, such as finding one of my daughter's lost shoes or pretending to be an emu for her.

Next up will be Discipline Priest fiery enchant melee posts.

My wife has that same computer case.  She bought it because it had a handle.  CM Scout, I believe.

In my dreams they make a server for every expansion and people can play whatever version they thought was best.

God, it must smell terible.

Still have my tabard. God those were the good old days.

That's how it works bub. Think about it this way. When Halo reach came out there wasn't a vocal minority of Halo 3 fans bitching and moaning about reaches new features because it was a new game, they had a choice to not purchase it. The inherent problem with MMOs people feel invested, they lose interest but invested too much time to just give up. So they buy more expansions even though they have no interest in the game anymore.
---
Ok
---
Agreed my Horde brother
---
I mean, it's hopping right back onto a train when you know exactly where the train is going
---
I tried to take on the pitlord commander. Didnt go so well.
---
Strength is a DPS increase. Higher dps= faster kill times. Lvling is divided into 3 parts, 
---
1. Combat time: strength and agility will increase your damage output. The more damage you do the faster you kill something, faster you gain exp.
---
2. Recovery time: this is the time it takes you to regain mana,hp, etc... Drinking, eating, bandages,potions, mitigation and spirit will help lower the time it takes for you to regain your hp/Mana. 
---
3. Traveling time: self explanatory. You can reduce your travel time with swiftness potions, talents, enchants and trinkets. 
---
Now with this said, paladins have a heal so your combat time is considerably lessened if you can keep you Mana up. Also since you have a heal, you don't really care about how much dmg you take in a fight, you can just heal it back up. In general you want to kill things as fast as possible and lower your recovery time as well. Any stat that increases your damage will lower your combat time so in this case strength and agi are both beneficial,though, until you get veangance in the ret tree I would just prio str over agi for the sake of consistency. 
---
You can't Regen hp while in combat, but, you can Regen Mana so long as you obey the 5 second rule. Your Regen doesn't kick in until 5 seconds after you cast a spell. If you have enough spirit you will find yourself rarely ever needing to drink between kills, that means you can heal yourself up to full between every fight so priority should go to stats instead of armor type. I prefer str/spirit gear because if reduces both combat time and recovery time. 
---
This was hastily written as I'm on break at work atm but I hope you get a little of what I'm trying to say here. Cheers!
---
It's going to depend on your individual Guild composition and performance, deciding what do you need in order to progress

Just cause you've reached a breaking point, doesn't mean you weren't bored. You just had to much time invested to quit.

*First Quest* ‘Now all of you go collect 30 pieces of debris’ kek
---
Err..as a R13 shaman I found it quite lacking as well.  
---
You have to move constantly, as the fight moves your totems needs to be there(30 yards isnt much), so you \_can't\_ stay in the back.  
---
What does he means by slowing the cast speed? what with my dagger?   
---
Grounding totem is an art form,  
---
I believe lesser healing wave was the best 1.5s heal out there, that was your go-to spell, you very rarely had the chance to stay put for 2.5 seconds(just to see it only hitting one guy)
---
You purge everything and try to shock healers(read: paladins who try to use holy light).  
---
and holy shit, paladins strong against enhancement shamans? Against purge spam and earth shocks you're nullified, you'd need peeling.

From this post https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bm7bx9/the_real_vanilla_experience_unsure_about_pvp/
---
I even googled it, still got it wrong feelsbadman
---
Thunderfury actually sounds like a really good IPA, kind of like Juice Haze.
---
all 3 are great in pvp. all 3 offer something of value to raids, but only 2-3 hunters are usually brought to the raid since their dps is low.
---
just focus on the playstyles and aesthetics of the class.
---
mage = mobility, frontloaded damage and cc
---
warlock = face tank, cc, dots, occasional burst, demon pet abilities
---
hunter = long ranged, big wind up shots, mainly you'll be draining mana in pvp.
---
Fuck, I remember this. We all started counting down for midnight. Then it hit and the server was shut down to update.
---
He also said that people may need to multitask during the final episode of GoT. Which suggests that beta might be out by the 19th, and the 24th may be a PvP event or something that he's planning.
---
Then they didn't try very well. Killing people fighting 1v1s is incredibly easy. Literally everytime I saw this it would stop pretty quickly because a small group would just run in and wipe the floor with them. You wanna dual do that outside of the BGs.
---
Maybe it's INFO
---
Which kind of begs the question, aren’t faction themed server names a bad idea? Hell, server numbers would be better.
---
Of course he knows. He was obviously one of the personalities that went to Irvine and is now under NDA.
---
I would prefer that there are servers that stop at TBC. Wrath got a bit too easy for my taste.
---
I'll always remember how I was forced to miss it because it was a shared computer and my sister decided she deserved extra time on the computer so *she* could see it open. I instead logged in an hour later to see a male draenei dancing by the bank in Stormwind.
---
Druids can't  get increased threat from them unless shifting to bear while the dynamite is in midair works, certainly couldn't get increased threat from sapper.
---
The problem is that would split the player too much
---
Wait were you talking cocaine or chocolate?
---
Engineering shield is ridiculous on large pulls.
---
Also Thunderfury comes in at some point for smaller packs.
---
Cocaine
---
I'll always rep Shaman, they have one of the most unique playstyles in the game, chain heal is super fun, you can turn into a freaking WOLF. And in pvp, elemental is one of the best burst classes in the game
---
That's so bizarre
---
Priests are better healers in pre raid bis due to renew, ones paladins gets good enough critt/healing they overtake priests. So in mc you might want a priestland a paladin healing whit a druid tossing in his hots
---
The last few seconds of alliance only paladins.
---
priest's toolkit is self contained.
---
shaman's toolkit is mostly about usage of their totems.
---
which playstyle do you prefer?
---
Well, I don't agree. I quit WoW near the start of Cata because it felt so different than the WoW I loved. I've been playing Vanilla and TBC servers ever since and not burned out. I'm currently playing a TBC server. Definitely not burned out.
---
It's got a couple of the colors from the set and the one emblem, It looks nothing like the set. Anyone who knows the set enough would see someone wearing that rob and say "wow, I can't believe you're actually wearing it." lol [https://imgur.com/a/KGAZqtY](https://imgur.com/a/KGAZqtY)
---
That’s the one, mines a MK2. It’s nice and easy to move around for LAN parties, but it’s hard to manage cables in. I had to use a dremel to clear the drive bay for my GPU...
---
Probably mostly joking.
---
possibly. i think having proper server names is better than numbers, but it wouldn't hurt to make them more neutral-sounding! i know some of them already are, like galakrond, kalecgos, icecrown, ect...
---
Happy birthday
---
lol fuck off. how do you explain the fact that lots of us have kept playing vanilla exclusively on pservers for the past decade then. I am subbed to retail too. I just prefer vanilla as my favourite game of all time so i’ve kept playing it. (with occasional BC or retail thrown in).
---
hunters are pretty hard to beat at least while leveling if they go BM.
---
other than that every class is capable of WPvP, the game is kind of rock paper scissors, best to pick your class based on what playstyle you prefer.
---
r/carebears
---
Retail Bad.

Yikes, a hilarious number of people took that personally. I wouldn't say it if I wasn't a little guilty of it myself, haha.
---
The next day. The heroes descended the stairs on the other side. They turned to admire the majesty of the portal on the other side. But while their backs were all turned they were immediately massacred by the dreaded fel reaver. RIP brave heroes of azeroth.
---
Welp, no choice but to roll horde now.
---
12:06... were you the guy with the pants?  I remember you!  (Chris here)
---
As soon as they opened the portal the world died.
---
It's just something that annoys me and I hadn't seen a similar discussion posted here yet.
---
Beta first week of June, Release last week of June. Ez.
---
They are both very casual friendly, just remember that hunter dead zone and pet management is very clunky in vanilla but is the best farming class. Mage is the best AoE farming class.
---
Ew
---
I don’t mind Warcraft themed names at all. I just think it adds another layer of avoiding faction imbalance if it isn’t faction themed.
---
Good luck retaining any raiders by making them pay gold for gear

Thats the one.  I know there are a few sites out there for best questing routes etc.  So ill use those in conjunction with the dungeon guide to make sure i get all of the quests.  It's been over a decade, and i remember some stuff but not all of it, lol.
---
in no way does a resto shaman have any notable damage.  
---
There arent that many totems that are viable in PvP:  
---
Windfury and grounding  
---
Earthbind, tremor(stoneclaw to destealth, very, very situational)  
---
Poison cleansing.  
---
Fire nova/magma totem if it's a large crowded fight or a 1v1 otherwise meh(usually just put a frost resistance totem so my warrior friend could get a lucky resist against a frost mage, seeing as they're the biggest threat to horde side warriors.  
---
So, 5 or 6 totems, 3 heals, 3 shocks(with shared cooldowns), spam purge and dispell blinds. Know this and you're off to a good start.
---
Hard to say. No BE and the average player would rather look human like over being a cow.
---
I was lucky to get 2.3 on my best friends potato dell laptop. But man would I go back to those days in a fucking heartbeat.
---
Cuz videos games are easier to brag about than life
---
I've played both factions. This is certainly propaganda. I've been abandoned by passing higher level ally's that could have easily helped me on both factions. The feeling of defending the honest lands of the Alliance from disgusting pillaging hlHorde filth is a similar one to seeking honor in glorious battle against the Alliance who challenge your way of life. The game fantasy is there for both factions.
---
yeah, for sure
---
I like the way you talk man, positivity and shit. Fuck yeah
---
[I disagree.](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bm0akw/please_help_me_get_excited_about_playing_horde/emstcpl/)
---
RP-PVP servers are legit!  I played on a PVP server from Vanilla to Cata.  Friend transferred to Emerald Dream and I scoffed at the fact that I transferred with him to an RP-PVP server.  It’s extremely different, in a sense that guilds from different factions actually hate each other, rather than you hating the opposite faction.    I will most likely do RP-PVP for Vanilla, but I need to do my research to see what is different about the rules of engagement in terms of the different territory types.
---
Do you know who you're talking to?
---
You are misguided. May the dark lady watch over you.
---
Again, it's your claim. I already know you're wrong so I'm not going to spend time verifying that. If you want us to believe you (because everyone obviously doesn't) then it's you who should provide proof. Or don't and we will continue living our lives knowing druid isn't a faster leveler than lock and be perfectly fine.
---
Damn, these Figures must have been expensive as fuck.
---
It's called gatekeeping and is toxic as fuck
---
I burned out in Vanilla so when TBC released I went to outlands killed one Hellfire Boar on my warrior and logged off. I came back a few weeks before WotLK and played on my friend's account who has a 70 druid. 
---
So I never got to experience TBC by itself. Only experienced some of it in WotLK. Can't wait.
---
Because it's a joke? Lighten up.

Any hunter counters rogues.

Is there anyone that can give me a brief overview of warrior stance dancing?

No i don't /s

Why not give him a perfect 5/7?

Not in my experience.

I think that is pure speculation.

Tigole aka Jeff Kaplan.
---
That only goes to show how the lore is centered around the Alliance. They have the heroes and the villains who are fallen heroes. Story = Alliance for the most part.
---
Not that, I knew a hunter named Bismark.
---
Nice troll post. Humans and elves are boring.
---
Gul'dan?
---
Thank you for that
---
The game is going to be around for the foreseeable future, why cast aside hopes of eventually clearing AQ/Naxx?
---
Younger players tend to play Alliance, but for the most part the mix is pretty close for all types.
---
Well, I would hope so. They are imaginary.
---
10/10 would smash and not call back
---
Blizzard said Classic will not be a progression server.....
---
.... but they also said they wouldn’t do a Classic server.
---
With the name Pete ! Must have gotten lucky.
---
Thanks for the response! Its not that i outright refuse to heal, like obviously ill throw out a heal here and there, and if a guild lets me raid with them and then requires me to go healer sometimes thats no biggie either, i just dont want to be forced onto healing for my entire classic career cuz "its the optimal thing to do" if you get what i mean? I just wanna have fun, even if it means going into a raiding guild thats not the most optimal thing ever. ^^
---
I had the most fun with wotlk story lines.
---
Ah so cool that you responded to me. I honestly never listened to a podcast until about 5 days ago, and started to get hype-y about classic and wanted something to listen to while at work. Found your channel right off the bat, and started listening to the last 4 episodes or so in reverse order, really really enjoyed the show, so started at the beginning. 
---
Anyway, big fan, keep up the awesome shows!
---
Portal keeping.
---
Thanks for responding! Why do i have to be raid leader? I'm sure theres guilds out there willing to invite less optimal specs, atleast thats my hopes. And yeah i guess ill be going engineering! If i go druid, ill probably go feral, judging from the responses ^^
---
Are shaman going to be horde only again (and same for paladins)?
---
Thank heaps for listening mate, glad you enjoy the show. Enjoy the run through the episodes :)
---
Brother!

They said you will always be able to play classic vanilla. That doesn't in any way mean you won't ever be able to play Classic TBC or other expansions. Weird way to twist what Blizzars said.
---
Humans have Popeye arms
---
Seriously, who the fuck cares. A Beta will start in the next few Weeks, the exact Details doesn't really matter - we will find out soon enough.
---
Yes
---
Looks awesome brother!! Cya in classic ! 💪🏼
---
It was an amazing time. I hope you can experience it in full one day.
---
Nice try buddy, everyone knows you had to chew Cocaine plants to stay energized back then
---
Podcasts are awesome I haven’t listened to the radio for atleast 4+ years
---
Mage.   My wife has like 30 mages.   
---
Cast frostbolt.
---
Seriously mage.
---
That would be making up what I think, which has nothing to do with the topic anyways. Also I didn't make a design, so there is no "my design" that may or may not be "flawless".
---
Again, I'am pretty sure it would be possible to have a progression system that is smoother and doesn't rely on increasing the level cap. Part of it would have to be horizontal obviously, so people can catch up easier if they start the game at a later time.
---
This is not something I came up with. This has been discussed to death back in the day and it is a reoccuring issue. Many players would prefer a flatter progression w/o new level caps. to keep old content more relevant. Is it more challenging to design? For sure, but certainly not unthinkable or doomed to fail.
---
Vanilla already had the basics of this and it was partly continued with TBC where you had multiple raids of the same tier, which was apparently an important design decision for them. On a general level it would have been easy to extend the existing structures, for example we already had resistance gear, faction specific buffs/gear (argent dawn) that only worked in certain contexts. We also already had reputation, attuments and long quest chains in general to provide open world progression for level 60ies (instead of a new level cap). All the things were already there in a basic form.
---
Everyone using consumables and world buffs
---
It wasnt just us 1v1 it was a group of people with the same mentality. There would be like 20 people hanging out setting up 1v1s because of the respect. If a rando came in and interfered it was viewed as disrespectful
---
If you want to be cool play on Horde
---
To be fair, the staging of the event was, in fact, fake. But it was based on a real event that happened, and they just weren't recording when it went down. So yeah, fake, but based on truth.
---
Ever heard of warmonger?
---
Lemme guess, you're a Blood Elf main?
---
Not needed in a BiS list.
---
He was a teenager, he wasn't like 8 years old. I'm not out here protesting and trying to get his account re-banned. I'm just saying I thought Blizzard had a more hardline botting stance. It turns out they don't and that makes me sad. Botting does affect other players whether you care about it or not.
---
So like the entire reason he posted this? The lists lack viable alternative gear.
---
Because a player who can only dedicate a small amount of time to the game won't be able to put in the prerequisite farming time required to competently clear AQ and *especially* Naxx. Unless everyone in your guild already has full T3 or equivalent, you should expect to spend somewhere between 300 and 1000 gold *per raid* on consumable Naxx buffs when progressing (depending on the inflation of your server; most likely it will be around 500-600). There's simply no feasible way to competently do Naxx without consumables unless, again, you're in a guild that's already BiS. And a casual player would never be in such a guild.
---
It's not a matter of boss or player mechanics. It's simply that the overhead is too much to overcome if you aren't ready to dedicate a substantial portion of time outside of raids. You could definitely be a raidlogger if you were already super super duper rich or completely decked in gear, but neither of those things will ever be the case for a casual. It's like asking why a casual player can't get High Warlord/Grand Marshall. It has nothing to do with skill; the gating lies behind time. Maybe, far down the line, you can clear AQ with a casual guild that very, very slowly acquired gear over the months and years. Naxx is another beast entirely.
---
Fantastic guide. Thank you

Should have farmed primals
---
It was my introduction to the lore of Warcraft. My friend got me into WoW mid-late vanilla and I didn't know or care a thing about the lore. I just wanted to explore and blow shit up with my engineering, and tame cool pets. I  skipped quest and NPC dialogue like crazy. Seeing my roommate run down those stairs into a big demon army, then turning around and seeing that huge star filled portal, I was like. Hm. Maybe I should start paying attention.
---
No it's not? Lol
---
It's crazy what we did for the game back then. Nowadays i cant imagine myself playing a game that lags. 30fps is the absolute bare minimum if i i have to tough through some lag. I had 4 fps in ZG and molten core.
---
Many a brave scion of the Horde and Alliance were felled by those nasties.
---
How do you know they won’t?
---

I loved farming primals on my mage...

**&lt;Informal&gt;** **NA - PvE - Progressive - off hours**  
---
Welcome to Informal, This is a brand new guild being made from the ground up. With some old school management I hope to turn this off hours guild into one of the very best on the server. Pushing content all while having a great time doing it.
---
I value maturity and honesty above all else when it comes to my members. I expect everyone to set an example for our server on how quality players should behave.
---
I have been playing warcraft since vanilla and have had years of experience both in raid leading and in managing guilds. 
---
I hope you all are willing to take this journey with me and produce one hell of a guild.

They care that people play BFA. Classic is a small side project for them
---
Could you only have one renew on a target like Druid hots?  I forget about that one
---
She should play Rogue so you can see what she's really made of and what true evil lurks inside her soul.
---
Human, but I can respect a good slutmogging every once in a while.
---
Yeah this dude is wrong. Even though everything else isn't too great if only the PVP was good I'd still be there playing. WoD initially pushed me to play vanilla during nost but legion was the final straw in terms of PVP. It was pretty busted. And now BFA is way worse.
---
Consider it filler gear.
---
Havent had a pair of pants drop for a good 5 to 10 levels. Bam Profession gear
---
But the benefit of crafting professions is the patterns off bosses
---
And little did we know, it was all going to go downhill from there...
---
I want to play a tank that isn't a warrior what are my options? Preferably a class that has multiple useful specs on vanilla, and something that doesn't require much crafting to prepare or reagents.
---
Downvote for PC on carpet.

I don't know why they would be. Druid heals are not very efficient. They have no real 1.5s heal, and their AOE heal, Tranquility is a very long cd with heavy mana cost, can be interrupted since it's channeled, can't crit and barely heals for more than Prayer of Healing which has no cooldown, can crit, isn't channeled and is decently efficient. Priest 8/8 T2 makes them a powerhouse, making greater heal into a better regrowth.
---
Perhaps.  That is certainly a boost, but 600%?  Even if this is true, flasks are going to be far less common in Classic due to far less Black Lotus, and world buffs are not going to be up 100% of the time due to them being back on their old timers.
---
Indeed. And the deadzone is extra awful in vanilla, the range is painful. They narrowed it in later expansions before ultimately but vanilla deadzone is pretty significant. Players should test Hunter on a private server to get a feel for that vanilla deadzone before committing to the class.
---
Feral is a top tier dps spec AQ patch and after.
---
That is if you can get a debuff spot dedicated to rip.
---
I don't think it's entirely fair though to tell people raids will be packed with druids. Any guild that plans to take raiding somewhat serious will have no bears, no ferals, and MAYBE 1 Boomkin and 1-2 Restos. 
---
Sadly, they simply don't offer very much outside of innervate and battle res. Why bring a Feral when you've got a Rogue? After MC Bear tanks simply don't work. Boomkin is just bad. Combined with HoTs not stacking (if 2 resto druids put a HoT on the same person it only refreshes the duration, they don't stack), it's just hard to justify spots.
---
It's not discouraging him either. In fact, the threat of banning is even less of a deterrent than before now. So if it doesn't matter to you, as you have stated yourself, then he should remain banned. Glad by your own logic you agree. :)
---
btw, trying to turn arguments around isn't your strong suit, don't try it again.

Thanks, looking forward to it.

Didn't say we did it all the time, LOL f*** off.
---
Im going Horde so I don't have to play with Slutmogging people like you. Maybe I can actually play with adults and not 16 year olds that want to look at in game soft porn lol
---
ping/fps? rotations and raid comps?
---
&gt; rogue special attacks triggers/grant a white hit as well, thereby resetting the timer.
---
Not entirely accurate. If you are a level 12 rogue, then cast sinister strike or backstab whenever you like, no less anywhere.
---
The issue is at higher levels, with procs like thrash blade, or sword specialization, or windfury totem. Any effect that says "chance on hit to get an additional attack" effectively puts your swing timer to 0, making you attack another time.
---
That said, if you wait till you just swing your sword, and you shouldn't attack for 2.5 seconds, you gain another attack just after you got one naturally, but if you're just spamming the button, you might get a proc 0.2 seconds before you would naturally swing, effectively wasting that proc.
---
To my knowledge all tanks need crating for gear, however if you want a variaty of specs you will want Druid, but you would be off tank more than likely in raids I believe.
---
The murdering hobby never stuck.
---
The trend of every raid video being set to loud mediocre music is not something that needs to be brought back
---
Well it's speculation of course.
---
Love the set up Chilled! Nice job man. :)
---
Dude a teenager is still pretty much a child. Yeah they're held to a higher standard than an 8 year old but they still haven't even begun to finish developing mentally.
---
I'm also trying to keep context in mind here.   
---
He describes the past as doing something wrong, with a regretful tone. He has very clearly matured since then and isn't likely to repeat it.
---
This kinda feels like the typical discussion you end up with when talking about justice systems with Americans. They seem to think eternal punishment is justice and that the optimal answer to what you arbitrarily deem bad is judgement with no recourse.   
---
Not assuming nationality, but that's what this feels like, and it's off-putting. Like, what's so wrong with a bit of empathy?
---
My problem is that if it just gives a little more stamina or spirit I don't really care and would be better of with a second gathering profession.
---
In theory it's supposed to mean those hard to get patterns are supposed to make you feel accomplished when you get them and craft them.
---
Back in the day we really did not acknowledge gear as leveling gear and other. Gear was just gear. Leveling was a part of the fun so we did not look at the gear as a means to hurry through that.
---
Healing Touch with talents is a 3.0 cast, Greater Heal is a 2.5 cast. HT costs more mana. It is natural to assume HT should heal for more.
---
Rejuvenation heals for less than renew, costs less mana than renew, and lasts less time.
---
keep that cope up fugly!

&gt;what are some specific examples of "new knowledge" that has led to this 600% dps increase?
---
Optimizing raid comps to, for example, rotate a single shaman around groups to refresh Windfury while running 15+ warriors.

Yea, it's in a pawn shop for a reason. I can hear the pawn shop owner now "It's a robe from the popular game World of Warcraft." Uhhh ya no, lol.

I think comparing a world-first vanilla kill to any pserver kill is probably a bad comparison.
---
1) Even the best guilds back then had low-skilled players on their roster (no server transfers so you were stuck with the talent pool on your realm, unlike pservers which have a large amount of highly skilled players generally on the same megarealm)
---
2) Progression kills mean wiping, so those first kills likely didn't have many consumables or flasks (flasks did not persist through death when BWL was current content) and likely no world buffs either, which makes a huge difference in dps.
---
3) Pserver players have had years and years to figure out the meta (when half your raid is fury warriors and you have a fury threat MT you can blow shit up...) and optimize speed runs, which wasn't really a thing in vanilla. Computer specs, addons, internet connections, etc. obviously contribute to this as well.
---
I think there are a lot of details that are wrong with private servers and I expect some people to be in for a shock, but I do not expect raiding to be significantly more difficult. If anything I suspect pserver raids are overtuned.
---
Paladins are not good for world PvP?
---
If Hunters are topping the meters in MC/BWL, you seriously should reconsider replacing your Warriors and Rogues.
---
Ah thats right
---
You really, really want to talk about the american prison system for some reason and it's just not here dude. They're completely separate things and what do you want me to even do on that front? I already vote against the punitive systems as much as I can. You should go to a reddit and have that discussion where its relevant instead of just trying to shoe horn it in here. It's also some weird passive aggressive tone. Something akin to "I'm not saying YOU are but I get that feeling and also those people suck but, heh don't worry, I'm not talking about YOU :) "
---
On to the actual relevant point, I will reiterate that I'm trying to get him re-banned. I am simply stating my dissatisfaction with him being un-banned. I don't even trust that he's that regretful since the only thing he said was one line and the only "regret" I could see was him calling himself a dumb teenager. But, I'm not even the one that cares about the emotional pull of his words. He botted, he got banned. That was the end of it until, for probably just monetary reasons, he was un-banned. If he never got banned for it I doubt he'd be torn up about the botting. He would probably still be doing it. In any case, this is just going in circles at this point and we're not going to convince each other that either is correct here.
---
I love you

Could you say, if you know?

How mages’ clearcasting was working in demo? Whether it’s 10% chance for spell hitting every enemy, or just all at once?

First off, I have personal experience raiding Vanilla Naxx. Now, in 2007, flask metas weren't as popular until D&amp;T full-flasked their raids to fight Four Horsemen, but the consensus rapidly changed after that, and they've become cemented with private servers.

---
My dream would be TBC without flying mounts or dungeon teleporting. Ret or feral/boomkin were actually viable and made boring classes more fun.
---
Yep, it’s scaling is insane.
---
Downranked flash heal is decently efficient, especially if it matches the damage taken by the raid. Typical damage patterns in MC for example are 500-1000, so you pick a spell that heals for 500 or so. Paladins do this to perfection with flash of light.
---
Druids have terrible AOE healing.  Tranquility is a very long cd with heavy mana cost, can be interrupted since it's channeled, can't crit and barely heals for more than Prayer of Healing which has no cooldown, can crit, isn't channeled and is decently efficient.  You can count casting rejuvenation on multiple players as AOE healing, but priests can do the same and it's just as effective.
---
Priest 8/8 T2 Greater Heal 1 is one of the most efficient tank heals in the game. The additional hot gained from the set bonus ticks while you cancel casts. This bonus turns Greater Heal into a much superior form of Regrowth.
---
There are multiple specs of healing druids, but none of  them are all that good. Having one in the raid to hot the tank and swiftmend in an emergency is the best use. They suck at raid healing since their efficient heal, HT4, is a 2 sec cast, and hots on raid members becomes overheal in most cases.
---
This does change somewhat in Naxxramas where there is a lot more tank and raid damage to heal. People are not instantly healed up like in MC with flash heals and flash of lights and chain heals. There can be time to land 2 second healing touches, or people will be taking constant damage sometimes so Rejuvenation can actually be effective. Still a priest would be better in almost all situations.
---
Don't get me started on shamans, they are just bad. Worse than druids because of how much mana they consume. If you look up top healing on legacyplayers, you'll find on the top realms, LB and ND, 0-2 shamans in the top 30 for all raid instances except MC which is like 5 of 30.
---
We are talking optimal and not viable of course. You can play either and have success.
---
I assume you're interested in healing meters in raiding. I think shamans are much better in 5 mans because their totems will make instances go faster and they can res a group on a wipe. When I decide to tank a 5 man, I will first look for competant shamans because the instance will go fastest, then priests because their heals will keep us from wiping, and then druids last because they can't spam rez out of combat.
---
Reasons to choose shaman for raiding:
---
* HoT's don't stack. The strongest healing power Druid gets his one Rejuv prioritized.
---
* Sometimes 8 shamans are desired in raid so every party is buffed by totems. Their mana totems across multiple people, plus other totems influences the raid in most cases more than innervate + battle rez.
---
* Shamans have only smart heal in the game. Chain heal will chain to those who need it most.
---
* Self-rez. Enough said.
---
* Totems offer interesting choices and utility.
---
You will want druids in your raid for faerie fire, battle rez, mark of the wild, innervates, etc., but I love me some shaman. Whether I am putting a raid together or a 5 man together, I will invite the shaman over the druid unless there is a huge skill/attitude difference. 2-3 druids are enough. After that many, I'd rather bring competent priests.
---
Now funny enough, feral tanks have the highest threat in the game. If you have an instance on farm and you aren't worried about your tank dying, a bear tank is a better choice. Bear tank can make a good off-tank choice since they can go Cat after the target is down and usually outdps a fury warrior in defense gear. Just something to think about.
---
That sounds like a *serious* medical issue, so I think the "thing you can do" is go to a doctor and stop asking reddit for advice on the matter.
---
You have some high-end items like Hide of the Wild, Devilsaur set and Onyxia Scale Cloak that can bring in some money but for most it's gonna be the Cured Rugged Hide cooldown that earns you money. Most crafting professions require some really rare recipes before being profitable.
---
This is how you get 2 diluted mashed up shitshows of games. I’d rather have the two games, *as they were*, and have two awesome games, not one shitty one.

The desk is worth more than that PC. It’s going to look ugly if I have that guy sitting on top of a Spanish revival. Plus it has cable management built into the desk.
---
Well I’m glad to see you’ve taken the rational and polite way to engage in this discussion. The argument is you had the most class, talent, and compositional balance (based on variety and meters in PvP and PvE). OF COURSE, there were huge, glaring problems that could and should be considered unbalanced.
---
e.g. “You had a lot of abilities at your disposal that could allow for outplaying worse players (unless they were a DK) and made it more interesting to play, even in random bg's.” Yet thing like Bloodlust in area were garbage.
---
Every expansion and every patch have issues. But even at 1.12, vanilla’s class design and ability sets were not as well thought out as they were in BC not wrath. Moreover, those expansions had clear moments (3.3.5a for example) where PvP was focused on and even things like prot were viable (if not actively sought after). 
---
Now, may I ask, what makes vanilla more balanced? Less class variety in competitive PvP and PvE? Less talent variety? Less ability management and more 2-4 ability rotations? Fewer situational oh-shit buttons?
---
*  Consumables, world buffs
---
*  Optimized talents, rotations and bis items
---
*  Optimized raid comps and strategies
---
*  Better fps and ping
---
* Better addons and more widespread use
---
*  Pservers use 1.12 data for talents and skills.
---
*   Many bosses were nerfed or fixed over the span of vanilla
---
*  Better average skill of players. WoW is a 15 year old game, many players are long time veterans.

You have to remember, stats bounce off each other, so the more bonuses you can stack the stronger they are and I am willing to bet most guilds didn't have more than 1-2 of these up at a time back during vanilla.
---
On launch the world buffs won't be up as much, and less people will have flasks unless they up the BL spawn. On certain fights like Razorgore, simply new strategies were made that cheese the fight way harder than during vanilla. Everyone knowing exactly what buffs/debuffs are the best across the board, more knowledge of the game, better itemization. Also yes, there is a reasonable chance that resistances and such that bosses have aren't known and were off on private servers.
---
Also you took the world first kills in vanilla vs the newest boss kills on the server, unless BWL was just released on the server the comparison is way off and also vanilla world first had no idea on the boss mechanics, your comparing apples to oranges at that point.
---
Fine you want to call me an elitist then sure.  They aren’t worthy.  Because I’m not fucking retarded like you are
---
Please OP listen to this guy. Book an appointment and seek professional help.
---
As healers, they are better than shamans. Looking at their utility, they aren't. Battle Res is only useful if someone makes a mistake (don't make the mistake). Innervate is typically used on self if you are healing and are any good at your job. Ferals can innervate priests, buff the raid, and provide thorns to tanks, making a resto druid fairly redundant.
---
Shamans bring significant dps and threat management tools but are pretty bad healers because of how inefficient they are.

All these replies make me even more confused. Some people say Shamans are shit healers, some people are saying to bring 7 Resto Druids to a raid. Other people say only 2-3 at MAX. From what I know, druids are supposed to Innervate the Priest. Why would a feral do it when you probably wouldn't even a feral to begin with lol? From the things I've read, Shamans with t1 and t2 have some of the best mana conservation.

This was a question about making items while leveling, as stated in the title and explained in the post text.

I'm excited to try and stick to a PvP server for this reason partially. I feel like I never "hated" Alliance or the people who played them largely because I never had to interact with them.

Heck, I might even roll Alliance despite only ever playing Horde. Thats how little I hate them, despite the fact that the only good race that they ever had was Draenei imo.

We've got a regular PvE server Vurtne up in here!
---
PC on a carpet floor. You’ll find a family living in there when you open it
---
haha. Whats confusing to me is I was originally on a pvp server but played alone. Turns out some random guys in my gym class that I wasn't friends with played wow. They convinced me to go to Elune (PVE). The only dungeon I ever did was Dire Maul. Otherwise I would just raid horde cities alone. I think I got to rank 8 but that was it. On the plus side, those guys became great friends. Still friends to this day doing non-gaming stuff.
---
A double agent I see 😏
---
Was wanting a difficulty challenge with my class choice.
---
Or vanish
---
Better than rupture?
---
So simple explanation, but I couldn't put my finger on it like that until you said it
---
Yeah I was thinking that, what did the belt shoot at him? A frostbolt?
---
Gotta have someone to kill.
---
fuck alliance tbh
---
imagine having nightelves in your raid lmao 😂
---
Sucks because it didn’t need to be that way. Wrath gate in and of itself was fine, but then they just kept going down that road of making sylvanas more and more one dimensional.
---
World bosses ded should be kiteable for a couple months imo
---
28g, this checks out.
---
Chiropractor helped me with very similar issues.
---
Rupture is awful in vanilla, only good for pvp vs warriors and other rogues.
---
Real talk, if anyone can link me someone selling the blood fang robe I'd love you forever. Please!
---
It was the golden age of Wow for sure.
---
Ugh why doesnt everyone care about the same things I care about!
---
that's definitely not the ONLY reason, but it's an often-overlooked reason
---
it's basic tolerance. when you take a break from something that whacks your brain's happy-place, then come back to it, your brain will find it more rewarding and get 'happier'
---
or maybe 'absence makes the heart grow fonder'
---
OB is OP.
---
Is Belching Beaver a better option than Pizza Port for beer now?
---
Yes same!
---
Found Florida man
---
Thanks. I have gone to a doctor about it. I think it’s due to keeping my hands on the keyboard and mouse in the same position for an extended amount of time. My days are most likely done playing for hours on end. FYI there was no diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome.
---
get out of here with that confederate flag fucking racist piece of shit
---
Thanks. I’ll look into those.
---
I'd be interested to see how many people are planning to play horde or ally, cause I'm planning horde and I'm not too worried about being on the losing side
---
A knock-off Herman Miller Aeron chair. Yes. Thanks
---
Ah yes, thanks for clarifying that, It's been 4-5 years since i was into the theory, and at 2 years since playing.
---
You might have a nerve entrapment at the elbow, shoulder or neck. Try a chiropractor, one that takes science seriously.
---
Any game where I keep my hands on the keyboard and mouse in the same position for an extended amount of time.
---
Yeah, i don't know usually I just put youtube videos up on my phone and listen to them as if they were podcasts. I also have SiriusXM, some of their channels are good.
---
For The Horde!
---
I live in a town named after a Confederate general. Personally not racist. But, regardless for the alli....I mean the south will rise again!
---
Pretty good. I might increase my potassium.
---
Thats practically ascension
---
One very skilled player in near BiS isn't really a strong argument though, especially when the work to pull that off is just so much more than letting a warrior do it.
---
It's the nature of Classic. Can it be done? Sure. Is it really viable and worth doing? Not really. Your average bear tank will never tank raids in classic. People need to understand that, it's all I'm saying.
---
I missed that by a couple of days! I miss wow, but I’ll never play it again.
---
I used to go to a chiropractor. I’ll start going again.
---
RS2 is the one i'm referring to, the one most people are nostalgic about. RS1 was never as popular as RS2.
---
They also both came out 2004 originally
---
So no PvP player has ever been deliberately condescending?
---
I play on PvP myself, but we have more than a fair share of dick wads.
---
"Classic" never existed, it's a new product. The combination of old content with a modern client.
---
When server community was a thing. Please for the love of god don't bring back phasing.
---
Hey man, I’m currently going through the same issue. I work at a computer all week, game, and I was climbing as well. Felt shooting and achy pain in my hands, arm, and shoulder. Went to my doctor about it and got an ultrasound which basically told me my nerves were heavily inflamed which is what it sounds like you have. The only way to fix it is to change your habits while reducing the inflammation with physical therapy or another treatment which your doctor will recommend. If you do not treat it it will lead to tendinitis and eventually carpal tunnel. I got a sitting standing desk at work and stopped gaming and climbing while I work on fixing it which they said will take about 4-6 weeks. Do it now and get better before classic my dude. Good luck!
---
So glad I stumbled upon this. Reading /u/towelliee have an absolute meltdown was a treat.
---
Same, I *want* to play.
---
The modern game is just less entertaining than a literal dumpster fire.
---
If your goal is to raid youll be expected to have 2 crafting professions
---
The South's riding mobility scooters around the walmart, only thing rising is blood pressure
---
And no one in Naxx gear, even aq
---
Confederate generals were traitors to our union and deserved execution, not a town named after them.
---
In their defense, most people hadn't been in Naxx during classic since it was released so close to BC.
---
I remember most people in my guild aimply decided to take a brake and prepare for the expansion
---
Ah, a razor Naga. I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
i'm pretty sure it's Nurfed UI and Titan panel. I used to play with the same setup in vanilla.
---
Plz don't kite us
---
TBF though it *might* work as a kind of mini poll with the % scaling accurately.  Doubt it though.
---
Pure cringe man.
---
Concerning this:
---
Will there be a WoW Classic Beta?
---
Yes. A beta stage was announced back at Blizzcon 2018 and [**recent datamined files**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6o-OgackLc) suggest the beta is coming very soon. 
---
I had not heard of the "a beta stage was announced back at Blizzcon 2018". Do you have a source/could you clarify? Thanks!
---
Take a look at this. It is an analysis of vanilla private server logs showing class distribution at different tiers of raiding. This is actual raiding, not what some person thinks is best.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bd5yui/analysis\_of\_private\_server\_40man\_raid\_composition/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bd5yui/analysis_of_private_server_40man_raid_composition/) 
---
If you are a healing druid and you are doing your job, you will usually use your own innervate. Druids are less efficient and have smaller mana pools to begin with, so you will need it. Priests being given innervates is a meme before memes. Sure it happened in actual vanilla but that's because priests weren't as knowledgeable as we are now. Priests have excellent sustain and do not require innervates.
---
Feral is great as an offtank and dps when not tanking. It has the highest threat generation with the right setup, and has more health and armor than a warrior. They are limited in other ways which often cause them to not be main tanks, however. The big reason to have a feral in your raid is that when you engage a fight with multiple targets, the druid can tank a target, then when his target dies, he can shift to cat form and do reasonable dps while still in tank gear, since dps and tank gear are not nearly as different as it is for warriors (except in niche situations). Meanwhile that druid, while dpsing after tanking can pop out and innervate a priest, toss a heal, decurse/poison, and get back to cat form and continue dpsing, or go bear and pick up a newly spawned mob. It's very flexible. Cat dps will never be great, but it will always be higher than a protection warrior trying to dps.
---
Shamans typically spam Chain Heal rank 1, especially with 3 piece T2. In earlier gear you'd use Healing Wave with the T1 bonus to get a chain effect, or gear like a standard healer and rely on healing wave cancel casting like a priest/druid. CH rank 1 is 260 mana, which is a hefty chunk to be chain casting, and typically you don't cancel it, because the chains will find people who need healing. 
---
In MC quality gear, you'd have around 500 healing, which makes CH 1 do approximately 309 hp/s at 3.13 heal per mana. Healing wave rank 4 can achieve 309 hp/s and only costs 147 mana for 5.26 heal per mana, but it's single target only, unless you have 8/8 T1, which turns it into a semi-chain heal that has fairly weak chains.
---
Compare to druids, and you have Healing Touch rank 4 (their main raid heal due to 2 sec cast), and with the same 500 healing, you get 366 hp/s and 5.98 heal per mana, so not only more healing power, it's more efficient as well.
---
Compare to priest. In early raiding such as MC, the situation I've been demonstrating, you typically use Heal ranks 2-4 as your tank heal, and sometimes raid heal also. With 500 healing, priests achieve 393 hp/s at 5.3 heal per mana. So priest gives more healing power than druid, but at efficiency of shamans. The difference is that priests can regenerate mana while casting due to meditation talent (druids also have this), so the efficiency being similar to shamans doesn't hurt priests as much.
---
Compare to paladin. Typical paladin healing uses rank 4 flash of light for most things. It's strong enough to use, and a good bit more efficient than higher ranks (max is 6). With the same 500 healing, you get 312 hp/s at 5.82 heal per mana. Importantly, this does NOT include blessing of light, which increases flash of light healing by 46 (up to 110 at 42% coefficient). Tossing this into the calculation for 546 healing brings it to 328 hp/s at 6.07 heal per mana.
---
Condensing this into a neat list makes the position of shaman quite clear.
---
Common heal power and efficiency by class - 500 healing (MC gear)
---
Shaman - CH 1 - 309 hp/s - 5.26 hp/m
---
Druid - HT 4 - 366 hp/s - 5.98 hp/m
---
Priest - H 2 - 393 hp/s - 5.3 hp/m
---
Paladin - FoL 4 - 328 hp/s - 6.07 hp/m
---
Shaman have the lowest healing output and lowest efficiency. Priests and druids have higher natural regen via talent bonuses, and paladins have mana restoration via crit. Shamans have mana tide totem, a long cooldown that gives a moderate amount of mana.
---
The ilvl creep in the same expansion is what really puts me off. Being denied to a mythic +4 when i literally have +10 gear equipped because heroics drop higher ilvl now is retarded.
---
&gt;  But, I'm not even the one that cares about the emotional pull of his words.
---
It's fine if you don't believe how regretful I am and this is why I said I was hesitant to post this, because I know some people would disagree with Blizzard's actions.
---
&gt; he paid SOME of the price then got what he wanted. 
---
I would say that I paid the full price. What am I going to do now? All my friends I made with that character are long gone, the guild name forgotten and my work was frozen in time. 
---
I paid a $15 sub to log in to check him out, and will never touch him again. I'm not sure if I stated enough but that character/account had immense sentimental value, memories created during my formative years. But I 100% agree with Blizzard banning me. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
---
Thank you for the advice. It only happens when I play games hardcore. It happened during BfA launch but went away once I quit playing daily.
---
Leveling leatherworking while leveling is not worthwhile, id only suggest doing it if you dont mind the time sink and enjoy professions while leveling. Really, only gathering professions are worth doing while leveling. Everything else is better to simply power level at 60. Cooking is also not worth it, first aid is for most classes.
---
I understand that this is suppose to be pure classic talk - but I'm just curious what a good 40 player group now all at 60 would do given we could add in monks and DKs at 60. 
---
Also, what if there was a group of just DKs and monks at 60?  
---
I'll go back to my corner and quiet down now.
---
&gt; threat of banning is even less of a deterrent than before now
---
And why is this? Because one person got their account back? 
---
You know that Blizzard, years after, suspended botters in waves with like 6 months, sometimes even only days, right? 
---
SUSPENDED, not banned. So their policy changed down the line but they kept their original policy with me. I know this because of the conversations I had with the accounts team.
---
Strict, but I agreed with them. 
---
&gt; btw, trying to turn arguments around isn't your strong suit, don't try it again.
---
You've got a tone, sir.
---
Exactly something I'm working with too! My girlfriend, who over three years I've gotten into gaming from caring absolutely nothing for it (she bought her own gaming PC just over a year ago) has also agreed to play with me seeing as she really wants to get into what I'm into. 
---
I think my gf would speak for most casual gamer gf/wives when she tells me hardcore/grind culture scares her off really quickly. My advice would be, find out what bits she likes about the game and just foster it as much as possible, even if it might burden you. If she wants to go exploring, complete quests with little reward or spend all her money on mead from the tavern, let her. even do it with her. In her case, at least, it's about gaming as a couple and having fun. 
---
That's not to say that it's going to constantly be a painful experience, I think once the positive relationship with the game is created, she'll actually get into it! Of course this all is based off my own experience, one case out of a million. But i'd like to think it carries across :)
---
They had like 40k+ concurrent players during a time many people were on dialup. RS1 was the WoW of its era
---
&gt; Except for the part where OP appears to still play retail
---
I don't play retail, if you read my post you'd see that I bought a $15 retail sub. I quit after WotLK, played a little Legion. 
---
&gt; and the items in his character's inventory could be worth millions of gold.
---
Like what? I took a screenshot of my inventory. I had 5g. Not like it matters, if you saw, I botted to lv. 42 on a separate realm and was banned then. What possibly could I bring to the current WoW economy to disrupt it, to make your point valid here?
---
If taunt or AoE taunt resist or are on cooldown, you can switch to battle stance to use mocking blow. You can also swap to berserker stance for berserker's rage to avoid fears.
---
Right on! Yeah I'm pumped just to have him out of jail.
---
Gee, and you burdened your UI with transparent panels? (I would too)
---
You won’t be able to reliably tank in raids because of defense being an issue. This was fixed in TBC with crit reduction in bear form talent.
---
The word toxic is toxic
---
It was a tough lesson but play stupid games, win stupid prizes. I definitely learned a lesson, even if it did take a few years haha. 
---
Yes, the time I spent talking about the account, talking to Blizzard etc. amounts to more than 42 levels on a hunter, I think.
---
you could try some of the exercises from this guys youtube channel [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1cbIkRS5-QfXfgKij2n11Q](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1cbIkRS5-QfXfgKij2n11Q)
---
I might do this to just out of curiosity, but I wouldn't ever sell anything. What's the point? I don't play retail and never want to, but I appreciate your tip!
---
The fights were insane here. I hope we see this again someday.
---
Take this guys comment with a massive grain of salt. It depends on your guild and its goals
---
All I need it Luna
---
I don't know why anyone puts faith in this shit. Anyone who isn't writing in blue doesn't know shit about when it's coming out compared to the rest of us.
---
Ok then why did you bother commenting?
---
Nothing i said is wrong. That is your claim. So you need to defend it :) thanks though.
---
You know it's alliance when not a single character in the screenshot has back problems
---
I'm not exactly sure how you've "turned the argument around" so I'll say it again. Since whether or not he gets his account back doesn't matter, then there's no reason to deny him. Why should the default be no? The price would be paid. It's such a minor thing. I agree with Blizzard. I've done plenty of stupid stuff as a youth, far worse than botting on WoW. I'm glad I've been forgiven and am not still punished. For something so small it seems inconsequential to say no he can't have this thing that only has sentimental value.
---
same dude!
---
&gt; 
---
&gt;     Do you think he's going to recidivate?
---
&gt; Honestly, I do. Not sure why you crammed words in my mouth. Botters tend to keep doing it.
---
&gt; He broke the rules, he paid SOME of the price then got what he wanted. 
---
I think there is some points of your arguments to consider and are valid to a certain degree but in my eyes they lose their value as soon as you say something like this. You don't know my life and you're judging my future actions.
---
You know they make movies about this concept right? Your radical stance, above what a video game company's actions deemed right or wrong, is sad.
---
Ehhhh....research this practice before going in. I've come to believe that it's mostly woo woo and many people feel that it causes harm. 
---
The suggestions here are sound so this should be on the bottom of the list, if on the list at all. /u/OGRiceness post about calisthenic exercises is especially sound since many issues like your are a branches off of a tree.
---
Get to an orthopedist.
---
Yeah, I really dislike all the alliance races, except for maybe dwarfs, but nothing can beat the horde races, they're all interesting and unique imo
---
&gt; Are you serious? Is this your idea of how things go?
---
Because you said that. Which is wrong and isn't how making claims work.
---
Make is ultimate casual. Cc, damage, kiting, low repair bills.
---
I had my 100% mount I was contempt with being near broke as a raider lol
---
Botting and then making up a sob story is also sad.
---
I saw a video about warlocks being pretty good in pvp with some gear, leveled it to 22, now Im leveling a priest just because the dwarf casting animation is cool.
---
Just play both, you will have time!
---
Roll, DKP, w/e when the frond drops gotta earn it.
---
You had to roll for it
---
One person gets the leaf.
---
THANKS A LOT GUYS

I'll tell you a secret, if you were banned 5/20 we were told to literally never overturn those bans. Any time warden banned for botting it was verified by the hacks team and yes, every time it was botting, they were BANNED. I know people use suspend and ban very loosely but I do not. My knowledge only goes up to the end of Cata but in that time frame if someone was botting they were banned. Their account was closed and would not re-open.
---
Because apparently Blizz invited some of the big name classic content creators to Irvine for some unknown thing, so it’s entirely possible they do know more and all this is a marketing move.
---
I can respect the minimalism. Luna is pretty great
---
the only real difference is between pve and pvp servers, on pvp servers you have way more competent players who tend to be more abrasive and annoying, on pve servers everyone is ridiculously incompetent and super milquetoast
---
Good job! ;)
---
Maybe if we all point our tin foil hats to the west, we will pick up the transmission from Blizzard directly as one mind.
---
pfUI by shagu is very nice, but if it's not ready by classic launch I will likely fix up and use AzeriteUI.
---
I heard the most elite guilds won’t even take you unless you divorce your wife and sell your dog
---
Thanks for your kind words.
---
Thank you :)
---
Synergy between both worlds!
---
Is that middle monitor old or something? Odd to see Asus monitor with such bad ghosting.
---
It’s just the photo. Pristine in person.
---
It is a trap my younger self fell into in 2005. My hunter spent all the money to get Dragonscale Leatherworking. I don't think I made and used a single leatherworking pattern for myself besides Quivers. Now I know how the game works so I'm just going Engineering
---
Thank you a lot for this. This is the type of comment I was wishing for! I might end up going Druid and when I question it, I'll definitely come back and re read this!
---
I would never consider joining a guild that doesn't allow characters into raids that have a gathering profession.
---
If you want a more consistently mature (key word consistent) you should consider rolling on an RP or RP-PvP server. I transferred to one during WoTLK (my last expansion) because the two friends I played with really wanted to, and they paid for my ticket lol. Wyrmrest Accord I believe it was.
---
I was expecting a bunch of weird sex stuff and just people chatting away in character everywhere, but it really wasn't like that if you weren't seeking it out. Overall everyone was much nicer and friendlier than the other servers I was on. 
---
I asked myself the same question you're asking now, and I think its more of a realm to realm thing as opposed to faction to faction. 
---
In vanilla, I think the only thing you could argue is hardcore min/maxxers will roll Alliance for raiding and Horde for world PvP. Beyond that, I think its all the same in terms of maturity and what not.
---
According to the most recent community survey with +20k respondents, there is three times more interest in RPPvP than there is for RPPvE.
---
The same survey shows the same breakdown for regular PvP vs PvE servers: x3 interst in PvP vs PvE.
---
How could Blizzard not look at this data?
---
If anything, if Blizzard is dead set on omitting one server type (bad idea) then it should be RPPvE!!! Not RPPvP!
---
But of course the obvious and only correct decision is to have at least one of each server type at launch! Anything else is absurd.
---
That's what the Auction House is for.
---
Fingers could be your keyboard needing too much force to press keys comfortably. Doesn't explain arm and hip tho
---
I just fixed a few errors, and it should all be correct now, so make sure you refresh for the right version of the data.
---
Doesn't seem like Josh to pin that to the top of his twitter if it's just an innocuous opinion that he has
---
It was good! 
---
I guess its mix of .. we didn't knew better ( not like the game is so much better nowadays) , also game was pretty new and good compared to everything else and last but not least we were so much younger.
---
That screenshot thou cannot even picture how it was 360 degree around the portal ingame, can only compare to one other such moment with lots of horde and alliance not fighting for a brief moments cause arranged by guild leaders and that was the opening of AQ gates! 
---
I was on pvp server Emeriss and there were massive fights but at some point we had to stop for a moment , the way i remember someone said in guild chat that it is arrange with alliance somehow to stop the fights for a while.
---
Because this sub is crawling with elitists that want to find any reason to stroke their cock and act superior.
---
Should out a 4th screen on top of the middle one
---
Only reason I'm considering Alliance is because I want to play Druid, and Taurens are probably one of my least favorite races. 
---
But Night Elf is the only race I like in vanilla WoW. I don't think I could roll Human because I find their animations to be stiff and they just look.. off. In an uncanny valley way.
---
Dwarves are cool, but similar to reasons why I don't like Tauren, I have a hard time playing stockier thicker races. 
---
Gnomes are short and their gear looks all squished.
---
I wish I could flick some switch in brain that would let me enjoy Taurens lol.
---
its true, i heard the whole thing
---
I hoping that technology will save us from that. Hopefully they’ll bump server pops up to around 5-7.5k so that servers don’t die out when people inevitably leave.
---
Thanks.
---
Maybe they’ll re-release a collector’s edition :)
---
Acting superior for PvP in the majority of MMOS is funny. Most are unbalanced messes that allow little to no representation of skill. And mmos like WoW will never be as good as something like Melee.  And while Melee isn’t super balanced it’s at least skillful and entertaining to watch.
---
BFA minimalistic UI is all I need
---
Savage
---
I think the hip pain is from sitting in the same position for too long
---
I haven't played on Dragonmaw since I got recruited by people I knew irl to play on Tichondrius in like, 2005.  I am likely rolling Tauren Warrior for classic though because they are huge and look great.
---
From what I'm seeing rip only uses 6% of AP. So I calculated a ferals rip with 850 would only do around 1100 damage. That seems pretty low dude.
---
I have a 32" 1440p display. Is it better to have a 27" display for WoW? What do you guys think?
---
Druids are solid but they are hybrids. They have to be played this way to maximize their use. To approach the play style as a pure healer isn’t “correct”,  if I may use that word. In a dungeon a Druid ought to be dpsing some fights, healing others, using rebirth and innervate to support the raid, etc. 
---
What if your top healer goes down on a big fight? Battle Rez. No other class can do that. Coming up to a big part of the raid boss (I.e., Huhuran at 30% Rage begin)? Innervate a priest. 
---
They are utility players and can fill multiple roles though not to top tier in any. A lot of fun to play if you aren’t worried about topping meters AND your guild decision makers understand the proper Druid role.
---
Classic is built on the modern client. You could try using the ConsolePort addon so you can use a controller, might work for levelling.
---
Paladins can tank dungeons, but it requires a bit more coordination, but its actually really awesome whenever they have spare points to get Consecration. They can't tank raids tho, but there amazing in 5 mans imo.
---
Druids are the only real option if you want to tank 5-mans and raids but not play Warrior. Despite what people say Druids can absolutely MT. Maybe Warrior is more optimal, but Druid tanks are perfectly viable.
---
You could also just accept the more common off-tank role. I think the only reagent they need are Ironwood Seeds for their in combat resurrection spell Rebirth.
---
It’s literally just vanilla
---
People forget to take into account that the highest pop private servers have 2-3x more people than Vanilla servers ever did, so the proportionally there isn't much more Black Lotus per person, if any more.
---
Raiding guilds on each server will do their best to coordinate head turn ins and what not to get as many people as possible their buffs. It's not going to be as big a deal as some people are saying it will be.
---
talent trees for mage is a subsection of weaknesses currently
---
priest race - troll is better for pvp and it's because of shadowguard which isn't mentioned 
---
&gt;Annoying shard mechanic (actually the reason people rather play a mage)
---
if this is what makes people pick mage they're weirdos 
---
&gt;Alliance only: Fear not as impactful as Undead can remove it with racial ability in PvP
---
one fear break every 2 minutes isn't that big of a deal, if anything tremor should be mentioned
---
&gt;Horde PvP: no clear winner
---
orc is very clearly the winner, nothing competes with hardiness at all for any class 
---
shaman - enhancement is shit tier for pvp and elemental is the highest burst in the game, if you're going to talk about shaman pvp at all and only talk about one of the specs you really picked the wrong one
---
you seem to use the word "contention" in place of "competition" multiple times
---
I got kind of bored so I didn't really read the rest of it. 
---
&gt;TL;DR:
---
A not so short guide touching all major aspects of Classic "Vanilla" WoW aimed at people that have never played Vanilla or at least never played on a private server in recent years. This is not an in depth class or leveling guide!
---
I think you did well for the stated goal. I'd give it a 4/5
---
Go to a Physical Trainer not a Chiropractor
---
The point about Windfury is a good one, and Warriors do seem very OP as they stand on PS, maybe because of this.  
---
The fact that average DPS across all bosses was 745 still seems too high to me.  I know from my own logs that I kept from TBC that fresh 70s in Kara were doing around 600 dps.  Its hard to fathom that a pre-naxx geared 60 could out DPS a raid ready 70, the ilvl difference is massive.
---
YOu need to balance your hips.
---
Lay flat on your back
---
Legs straight.
---
Lift your left knee up and bend it towards you. Use both of your arms to apply force to stretch it as close to your chest as you can.
---
Repeat the same process with your right. 
---
So this as often as 3-4 times a day.
---
Your hips are out of alignment and causing them to rotate one forward and one backwards. The goal is to get them popped back into position by stretching the Psoas.
---
here is a great website with info on other stretches you can do
---
https://yogainternational.com/article/view/how-to-stretch-and-strengthen-the-psoas
---
Nope, you should pay more attention.
---
as i suspected
---
the list isn't the best, but don't rag on it because of rare loot.
---
I think I can see MadSeasonShow.
---
Coffee cup for drinking, mason jar for peeing.

You’re a man of culture.
---
They're called a one hit wonder because they made a bunch of songs, but no one knows it was them until they look at the artist. There are so many times I'm like, "oh good song, I remember this one, but who the hell was it by?" and it was them.
---
Better than the loud shit music we have now, so I'll take it.
---
Pretty sure this was available from the Blizzcon store years back. They also made a priest Avatar Regalia version as well.
---
Possibly yes. Could also be the chair design, or the height of the chair compaired to the height of your desk.
---
Wow this is a huge Classic leak. Why doesn't this have its own thread?
---
Nix, my previous fix post. I just realized the spell calculator my friend developed did not include the 2 bounces on chain heal. This changes this dramatically, so refresh again. Sorry.
---
This means shamans have the highest output, decent efficiency but very high mana consumption.
---
That data is completely invalid for a conclusion like that. It's like saying it took three days to get from New York to Boston in 1800 and now it takes 40 minutes, so horses must have become 2000% faster.
---
Vanilla wow was just another game for you.
---
Hunters are great in wpvp. I personally think Druids are my personal favorite choice, especially if your a Tauren since you don't have to deal with Shamans. 
---
Like Rogues you can choose your engagements. They're impossible to pin down due to shapeshit breaking movement hindering CC, they have two HoTs, NS for burst healing if something goes wrong, Innervate if they're jumped while low on mana, and you can often just run away if it doesn't look favorable or you're not in the mood.
---
They're similar to Paladins in the way that they're very very hard to kill 1v1. Its very satisfying to pounce a Mage do some damage, escape his slows/roots with shapeshift, ignore his polymorph, charge him after he blinks... it just feels good man.
---
Druids are very underrated in general in vanilla, especially in PvP.
---
1.12 talents also help make private server players stronger.
---
....
---
Are you implying classic wow isn’t vanilla?

It's not like these people are going to use both programs from 2006 though, they also have been updating boots along side the anti-bot systems.
---
But hopefully everything will be good
---
This thread stinks of ignorance regarding ferals and tanking in general. Feral OT was viable, but not widely known or accepted in vanilla - primarily because of druids being the least played class (let alone those willing to try fight mainstream kmowledge to play an offspec) and the druid talent rework that made it possible came when the raiding meta was already established (after a year or so, everyone just follows the guides/knowledge on the internet and takes it as gospel instead of thinking for themselves).
---
Im not going to provide a wall of text trying to change your mind, as the knowledge is already out there and ive provided some links below. Most of it was already known and discussed in small communities/forums back in Vanilla, but some new knowledge like the Crowd Pummeler makes druids superior tanks in a lot of situations. This is primarily for feral OT, but the pummeler has made a pretty big difference for cat DPS too.

Im not saying everyone must have a feral (im not even going to play one this time around), or that they are the best in all or even most situations, but you should inform yourselves before spewing outdated information from 2005/6.
---
"Why can't fruit be compared?!"
---
I have no dismay towards ferals but this was about Resto shaman vs Resto druid
---
Sorry you're getting down-voted.  This is true.  From the moment I walked through that portal something felt wrong.
---
Ripped. Ogre. Loincloth.
---
Late vanilla was a restrained TBC.  Blizzard knew what they wanted to do but couldn't do it yet.
---
Every hunter will def eventually get it, it dropped like every week for my guild, I ended up getting it on my alt, that quest was tough
---
From what people have uncovered, the old BL spawn rate was 1 per hour.  The rate on PS is 1 every 6 minutes.  So while there may be 3x as many players on PS, there is 10x as much BL.  Still far more supply then there used to be.
---
We also don't know how all the various world buffs stacked with each other.  If the buffs are up at all, they will almost certainly not stack like they do on PS.
---
I can’t imagine not playing on a PvP server at this point in my wow life.
---
Have you tried a different keyboard and mouse setup? Razer has a really ergonomic feel to their items.
---
oh man its perfectly acceptable I have way worth memories of when I was younger
---
Its 100% possible to heal every 5-man dungeon in a DPS spec if you're using appropriate level healing gear. That said, some healers like to switch to Holy or Resto somewhere in their 50's so they can get used to using a full Resto/Holy kit. 
---
If you're not interested in raiding though, you don't ever have to respec.
---
Thx u/eterntyx3 I have the same  dilemma  ... asking myself this question for 6 month's
---
Ive never played on a PVE server, is it normal for everyone's nameplates to be blue? I was under the impression that enemies who are not flagged have yellow nameplates.
---
Im seeing tauren, trolls, and dwarves alike, all with blue nameplates.
---
That would be a fun concept for a private server. Everyone is flagged for FFA at all times, even in cities (though guards can defend in cities). Add in some player looting and you’ve got a recipe for a totally different, if not sometimes infuriating, experience.
---
Private server people refuse to bring meme specs. This is a difference.
---
I'm going one screen, 1440p, 145hz, slight curve 24-27inches.
---
This was the portal to the treadmill we all knew and hated for 10+ years.
---
Understand, but the title left it open enough that people turn it into feral memetown.
---
&gt;If i were to go druid, if i wanted to DPS say in raids. Should one go feral or Balance?
---
Feral is takes a lot of work to make viable imo, but it can be done. Balance Druids not so much. I'm sure somewhere someone is going to do it, but its not optimal. I wouldn't even call it viable.
---
If you wanted to tank as Feral, you'd have a much easier time, but most people don't want to tank at all lol. Its probably the most viable non-resto spec for Druids.
---
6/10 no poopsock or piss jug.
---
You got a lot to learn, son.
---
That's a sweet ass keyboard.
---
/Not liking tauren 
---
You are ill and us tauren naturally want to heal you but if you get too close it's lights out my dude.
---
Are you playing a server that shall not be named or retail? 
---
I ask because when I play retail for hours a day, my joints become inflamed because my APM is super high. I eventually have to stop playing because it hurts. 
---
On the other hand, I have been 2-boxing a private server  for the last few weekends to practice for classic, and the slow pace of the game isn’t bothering me one bit. 
---
If it’s just your joints, you can try fish oil, if it’s your tendons, give them 6 weeks of no activity or it may lead to severe tendinitis which could last upwards of a year or more.
---
Let me back in! LET ME BACK IN
---
I cringed a little bit, hehe. But ya, that feeling is long gone as I've been through it once, I can't restart that part of me again mainly cause I'm 34 now and ain't a hyped up kid drinking energy drinks literally 24/7 anymore. 
---
I just wanna play!
---
Horde scum. Die.
---
Honestly if they were going to have this event in a contested zone, they could have had someone posted in everlook and at Timbermaw Hold to warn if anyone was coming. On top of that they could have had a few pvp teams to act as security and respond to any attacking alliance
---
Hybrids demand more effort. It has always been the case. You are right that the average bear tank will not be good enough to raid. The bear tanks that are above average will be.
---
The new reich
---
Have you  considered not being part of shit guilds?
---
I'd always level Warrior second if you're willing to invest gold obtained from the first character. Warriors are slow levelers in large part because they have low mobility and have to eat/bandage so much, but also because they're super reliant on their gear. 
---
A Warrior is as good as his gear is basically. So if you're willing to spend gold to always keep him in relatively good gear, or better gear than a fresh character could get... the experience is much much smoother.
---
Yeah. If you think about it, any source of attack power is only worth it if it reduces number of attacks needed to kill an enemy by a significant amount. But 2 extra damage isn't enough to do that...
---
And higher int / more mana doesn't matter if you use a rotation that almost never runs out of mana. Use blessing of wisdom and only cast a few spells right at the start of a fight, then auto attack so you can regen mana (see 5 second rule)
---
and nobody looks the same.. The biggest memory for me is feeling a sense of dread seeing characters in like full pvp gear or wielding a thunderfury thinking holy shit they are so good we are doomed.
---
I tried looking what engineering items we get from doing that while leveling. Some green guns and ammo for them and the goggles. That pretty much seemed to be it...do you think it is worth it to go mining and engineering instead of mining and skinning?
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFkAAvDkj9k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFkAAvDkj9k) Let the hate flow through you.
---
Warriors don't care about defense cap anymore in pserver meta. They put on more threat oriented gear to make kill times faster.
---
It is 6% per combo point. Shedo just released a video about this about three hours ago.
---
Maybe 1 out of a million people have something to brag about 
---
Why do you sound so arrogant
---
Lol wut?
---
Impossible on current retail because server would just crash. Good times I remember this. Got a cool tabard out of it
---
I'm focusing on world PVP so it is for me. Dungeons and quest chains are where you upgrade your gear.
---
Soon.

---
400g who the fuck is running around with 400g in Classic? Holy shit, I was a main tank and barely ever got above 25-50g.
---
This will be awkward when all of your main healers and tank are geared out.....
---
I generally just use bartender in previous expacs. Something similar just to get my buttons in whatever order I want. I prefer to stack all my abilities at the bottom versus having side bars and all that jazz.
---
I feel you.
---
Nice unpopular opinion.
---
Could you explain why?
---
Because like 2 people on the entire server will be running around with that amount....and those two will also be in his guild in full T3.
---
You wouldnt see much raiding back in vanilla and tbc then.
---
Even to raid casually 3 nights a week i was expected to have 2 crafting professions
---
It was one of the major questions in guild 
---
Applications
---
You can downvote me and call it elitist as much as u want.
---
Facts are facts. 
---
Sorry if it maked u sad
---
I’ll need to see a YouTube guide on how to accomplish that
---
Nope :) but you are able to defend that claim with evidence and sources if you like.
---
I'm going through the same problem, but my mouse wrist starts hurting, I had that problem before, but wasnt that bad (could go 8+ hours without any problems), It started to get real bad when I changed my mouse, I think this one doesn't have a good shape for my hand, so yea, maybe try a new mouse to see if it gets better.
---
That said, I think our days of playing (that much) are kinda of over, we are doomed when classic comes, this is a problem that doesnt go away fast, sometimes you need like 2+ months for your nerves to regen 100%.
---
You are the one that actually got me to do it...
---
Sit a bit farther away?
---
Nope. There should never have been any Horde v Alliance after WC3 and I think they know it. It should have been certain races at mini wars with one another, like we see with the battlegrounds. Would have been more in line with the lore if you could only kill your race's mini-war opponent in the open world.
---
Cool I'll watch
---
I’ve played priest from vanilla through at least small portions of each expansion. I loved the class in the Vanilla days, and I struggle between rolling one again or doing something different. It’s a fun as hell class to play as a healer. But, if I were going for damage I would choose other things. Shadow priest isn’t bad for pvp at all, but I prefer other classes regardless just for the toolkits they have that spriest doesn’t.
---
I think you're right about them and i'm real curious to see how that plays out on Classic.  Various polls have told us that Warriors are the top class people plan to play, i'm sure in no small part because of their desirability both as a tank and top DPS.  
---
But if people get to 60 and every raid group has 10 Warriors rolling against each other for the same gear, I wonder how long until people get tired of not getting gear and reroll, or they just get outgeared by other classes that have less loot competition and can gear up quicker.
---
Another difference we know about between Vanilla and PS is loot tables being handled different.  I think it will be much harder for 15 Warriors to gear up anywhere near as quickly on Classic as they currently do on PS.
---
Personally, I'm going to be a care bear this time around. Instead of murdering every Gnome, Dwarf, Human, and Night elf on sight, I'll let dwarven female warriors live.
---
cause of course toweliee knows all things
---
I’ll probably be so focused on getting those first quests done in a mob of people. But I’ll admit that god damn original intro gets me every time.
---
I'm pretty sure it depends on what the proc rate on the .5 armor set is. I know on some private realms the 4 set is pretty broken. I have no idea what it was actually like in classic.
---
Still exists although I think it is a regional thing.  We have pallets of it year round.
---
How it works on a PvE server:
---
If neither of you are flagged, your names are blue
---
If both are you are flagged, your names are red
---
If your target is flagged but you are not, their name appears yellow
---
If you are flagged but your target is not, their name appears blue
---
I get you perfectly, and I think I've found the solution for myself when it comes to Tauren: 
---
1. It's comforting that practically every Horde race is ugly, not only Tauren. That's one of the reasons why they go together well. 
---
2. If you want a more human-like stature make a female - they are smaller than male, look better in armor and aren't bigger than their mounts.
---
3. Stick with it for some time. For the first week or so I wanted to delete my male Tauren, but eventually he grew on me. Not to mention if you're a druid you won't even be looking at him that much.
---
First steps to an amazing journey
---
Vanilla UI, no Gryffons, DPS meter.
---
Potentially Titan Panel but doubtful.
---
Anecdotes are anecdotes.
---
Raided in Vanilla and BC was never asked or required to have 2 crafting profs.
---
Make a female human ... go to golshire ... do some rp .. if ou know what I mean ...
---
Sell things on the auction house
---
If they remove the fucking flying and don't give Shaman and Paldin to the opposite faction then yes. If it's gonna be the same, then it must stay Vanilla forever.
---
I fear the server I pick has a popular streamer...
---
Unlikely.
---
Farm as much elemental earth as you can and HOLD it until AQ. You will be loaded when the time comes. In the short term, elemental fire will probably be good until the transmute for it is out
---
Just use that WoD poster
---
I always found that playing of PvP servers is what made WoW. Makes you feel like you are truly making a choice between Horde and Alliance. Especially gathering a group of people to storm a major city of the opposite faction or going to a PvP hot spot on that server. Plus a lot of players will now primarily play classic primarily for PvP. Drew many to love the game.m and created an entire subculture of WoW. Especially with the PvP videos and what not.
---
Neither, give me 5 Druids so we can Sprint around in cat form and claw face with the quickness.
---
Old school rain drops mouse pad.
---
my understanding is one of the people that went to irvine said something like "lets just say you'll need to multitask during the last episode of GoT". I'm 100% sure I'm getting the exact wording wrong but  ya
---
For a binary question such as this, it would be better just to ask in the post title. An answer you are going to get a lot is whichever one is played by the more competent player. Likely it would be very situational, both can cc, hunter with traps/pet and lock with void tank/banish. If it’s in a 5 man, whichever isn’t competing with me for gear if possible.
---
Google nerve flossing arm exercises. I had issues that were reduced by these pt exce
---
rsizes
---
They got banned for about a week I think? Maybe less. They reverted the bans because it was deemed too harsh by just about everyone despite being against the rules. They said continued use of it would result in bans.
---
a true classic set up is a 15" CRT monitor with stock microsoft mouse and keyboard
---
Every time I think about playing alliance I just imagine that I’d also have to be allied to gnomes with their fat little baby legs, and I just can’t handle that.
---
The standards for being invited to a nax group would be different between if you sign up with a pug, and if you are in a guild and have a good reputation and know people and have proven your dedication or skill or whatever.
---
I will probably shout out a few "WOOHOO!"s and "YEAH!"s and dance around in celebration, right after creating my first character. Then it's serious mode for the next several hours.
---
The notion that Blizzard would replace Classic vanilla servers with Classic TBC servers is absurd.  Can you think of another option?
---
I'm going to base mine off the UI I used during TBC.
---
[https://imgur.com/OvcsM8J](https://imgur.com/OvcsM8J)
---
Exercises, literally exercise. Walk, do jumping jacks, walk some more, stretch stretch stretch. Do upper body stuff, lift, lift anything. The more you prepare your body now, the less you will suffer when classic comes out.
---
No such thing as late to the party with retail. The party is eternal.
---
Don't play on a private server with her. Save it for classic
---
I don’t understand why people are defensive about this... and I didn’t twist what Blizzard said. Are people mad that this isn’t a progression server (which Blizzard said) or are people mad that I said Blizzard said they’d not do a Classic server (which they did years ago)? 
---
I’d say to stay hopeful. I am. I’d love one. I also wanted a Classic server when they said they wouldn’t do one. It’s weird to agree with the entire community and apparently get downvoted for it. That’s a new one for me.
---
Nothing, I feel absolutely no need to try to correct their opinion.
---
What about all your other spells? Do you just use the spell book and click them?
---
I did actually see quite a bit of raiding in both Vanilla and TBC, as a main tank that had Mining, but clearly I'm missing something. I can't even think of what the second required tradeskill would be to replace Mining, so I'm having a hard time debating against it. What would you suggest I use instead of Mining to go alongside Engineering that would help me in raiding as a Warrior, either for DPS or tanking? 
---
Also, wouldn't it be easier to just require that all players have at least two tradeskills over their lvl 60 characters, if you're just trying to make sure your guild has all of the crafting skills covered? Why do the crafting skills have to be on the character joining the raid?
---
Im sitting alot in front of a computer both at work and at home. In january this year I got serious pain in my back and neck. 
---
Went to see a naprapath and got help with massage, tips for better erogonomy and stretching excercises. Even after a couple of days it started to get better. Now its just a mattet of not falling back into old habits. 
---
Go and see a professional. From what i’ve experienced physical and psychological well being often goes hand in hand. 
---
Good luck
---
damn I forgot all about this on pvp servers I believe it was a clusterfuck, if I remember correctly people everywhere were getting ganked and what not xD
---
It was enjoyable! Music choice was spot on for the time period. Scrolling through the action bars cracked me up, that's actually impressive that you played like that! it's kind of cute lol
---
I would tell those super popular YouTubers who get angry that they keep getting killed in PvP because other people are watching their stream, I would tell them the same thing I tell that angry level 32 warrior in STV who keeps getting murdered. It's a PVP server, you play there you accept the risk. Doubly so for a streamer, you're putting yourself out in the public, what happens is your business.
---
Adventure seeker on an empty street.
---
Female human rogue. Get a red defias mask and a full leather skin tight set. Start a strip tease.  Remove articles of clothing very slowly starting with the gloves and belt. Keep the boots and mask on. You can make up to 1g an hour or more depending what kind of upscale people you serve.
---
If you want to make money while you level go with two gathering professions. There are engineering leveling guides and just set aside what you need for that and sell the rest
---
Choosing to hang on to the idea of a private server dying just because it doesn't feel populated, or because it hits an arbitrary number, like always happened in private servers, you're asking to be let down.
---
The assessment is somewhat fair. Many of the useful recipes don't come from the vendor. I can't recall which do or don't, but I'll still be doing it as a rogue. Also leveling with a druid, so hopefully a few upgrades a long the way. If not it'll still be fun to power level it at 60 for Devilsaur.
---
Find a leatherwork who can make it for you. Lots of people don't charge tips if you get them a skill up
---
The first time a big streamer leaves a server I will be sure to screenshot as the server goes offline and then gets deleted. Should be a good time.
---
Lol no. They're hidden and bound. They don't have to be shown in order for you to use them...
---
Love the connect as they are essentially the same race just different branches. Did trolls or NE come first. I think trolls but I always forget..
---
What could potentially do you need her is if these things are corrected, but there are other glitches or errors that cause hilarious unintended consequences. Granted this is something blizzard could actual plan, they could put these glitches in on purpose just for the surprise value, but we would never know if they did it on purpose or not, so I say go for it
---
probably, as long as you're a child or woman you shouldn't feel bad though
---
Absolutely. In no way shape or form did I say it had to replace. I even implied hope for a new server that does it simply because Blizzard said they’d not do a Classic server and then did.
---
Well ...  \*goes hiding in a corner to feel bad\*
---
I'm just messing dude, it's 2019, you can be a teary boy if you want to
---
Not really, raided in Vanilla with mining/blacksmithing.  Never heard of anyone being quizzed about professions, it was a simpler time.
---
Anyone can create a channel that's called whatever you want. A global channel is something that's built in to the client, not something created by the players.
---
What’s wrong with that? Vanilla is a timeless game you can play again and again and again... or at least I can :)
---
Oh yeah? Well, I have a shitty job I hate with a gf who probably cheats on me for free stuff and I STILL pwn low level noobs in STV!!!!
---
...yeah, MY life is awesome...

So fucking sad PfUI isnt gonna be making a comeback. Shit was absolutley gorgeous on pservs.

Gonna download a bunch and see what i can make look the most minimalist while at the same time still providing all the added extras needed to play at the top level
---
&gt; installs MoveAnything
---
And we're ready!
---
I mean, read the lore. Most of the faction population in the lore have no idea why they fight anymore. But they do. PvP servers keep that alive. Why? Because...
---
Anything you'd buy/hold until raiding starts beside reagents for fire pots?
---
Oh yeah!? Well, I stroke my cock WITHOUT feeling superior! Take THAT!
---
Annnnd we have a winner boys
---
[laughs in Shaman]
---
Highly disagree., PVE servers had  boss pvp raids aswell. And it was more glorious because it was happening  rarely.
---
Where did you get it :O
---
I was waiting in line at gamestop
---
Grab some posters for about 20 bucks. Maybe grab the azeroth map and frame it 50$ and get a horde/alliance flag another 40. Some led lighting 20$ and your set
---
I had this issue in my shoulders that gave me a splitting headache (shoulders to neck to head region) because of sitting. A neurologist helped identify which nerves were being pressured and told me what exercises to do (In my case three times a week on the rowing machine, as much as I can). Problem was gone after three months.
---
Not saying it's the same, but i highly recommend a doctor/neurologist and getting exercise to loosen the nerves.
---
What if I sell my wife?
---
lol no
---
Get a new job, dump the harlot and keep on pwning with a much better outlook on life.
---
Let’s see. Let’s assume 10% crit chance, 200% damage in case of the crit. Let’s also take into account avoidance. Let’s say the rogue is behind the enemy and only encounters a 5% dodge chance. The following takes into account the way I understand the hit tables work in that the negative outcomes have precedence, then crit, and the rest of the attacks is hit. It’s really too long to explain in detail here, check out the explanations in a WoW classic wiki.
---
So avoidance and glancing etc can crowd out hits entirely and crit if it’s high enough, but that isn’t really the case against same level mobs. So we can assume that 10% of attacks do double damage, 10% (for 1h) attacks do 0 damage. The rest does normal damage. 
---
5% miss, 5% dodge, 10% crit, 80% hit 
---
0.1 * 0 + 0.1 * 40 + 0.8 * 20 = 20
---
Now in the dual wield case we go with specced:
---
24% miss, 5% dodge, 10% crit, 61% hit 
---
(0.1 * 40 + 0.61 * 20) + (0.1 * 30 + 0.61 * 15) = 16.2 + 12.15= 28.35
---
Not specced:
---
16.2 + 0.1 *20 + 0.61 * 10 = 24.3 
---
So yeah it scales better with crit.
---
Let’s take it to an extreme: 45% dodge
---
50% avoidance, 10% crit, 40% hit for 1h: 12
---
74% avoidance, 10% crit, 16 % hit for DW: 7.2 + 5.4 = 12.6
---
So still better but the ratio shrinks with high avoidance. So 1h maintains damage better against high avoidance but doesn’t scale as well with crit. But even with high avoidance, DW might still be better. 
---
Anyway, I’m pretty tired and doing this all on my phone, let me know if you find a mistake in the math or assumptions. I think best would be a simulator to figure all this out in better detail.
---
Not really TBC&gt; vanilla
---
Same. I hope it comes out off the bat, id hate to have to heal w/o it.
---
Trolls. NE were dark trolls who were transformed by the eternal well.
---
my server bloodfin would have massive server wars, was so insane. people hiding in their cities, only rolling around with full buffs(buffs were literally required in SWG) and a full group of bros.
---
clone camping was my introduction to griefing others for fun.
---
Crap. That’s some legit advice. Now I have no excuses
---
Tauren look great in druid tier tho
---
Nah. Combined with skinning, it's probably the only profession that you can reasonably expect to gather all the materials you need to keep your crafting up to date without going out of your way to gather shit. Although I find engineering is fairly easy to keep up-to-date as well, as long as you know where to go questing to collect mining materials as you level.
---
Actually it was well known even at the time that bis naxx gear was as good a ilvl as pre raid naxx, and that due to the way stats like crit/hit were changed characters lost a lot of their stats going from 60 to level 70. It’s not surprising at all.
---
I disagree, the only one that's really essential is engineering, you can take mining to go with it for money
---
The goggles are actually pretty great forecasters, you won't be seeing spell power on head gear to level 60 otherwise. The greenlands of healing, or Shadow wrath etcetera are pre-raid Biz if you're an engineer
---
Dude, OP's comment was a joke. It's obvious he plays Horde.
---
Now with sharding in classic we won't see this, rip :(

---
thanks for the clarification
---
The author of ElvUI is already working on the Classic version.
---
Shhhh
---
&gt; Classic existed, now it doesn’t. 
---
If we are talking from an official sense, and not considering private servers, yes, but that was due to blizzard's choice, not really the community, people started wanting classic servers since around the end of TBC but there were much more people in favor of classic servers around wod and legion.
---
My point here is that most people want classic, not bfa, therefore in the sense of the community, i would say classic is very much alive.
---
either the leaf or the eye of divinity drops from major domos chest 100% of the time
---
Be interesting to see if Weak Auras is a thing come classic.
---
Yuup! Run a RetroPi on that right screen, the Mrs loves to play Gameboy, Famicom and MegaDrive. 
---
Quite like the screen as it has an HDMI input with speakers internally, so I can run the Raspberrypi with nothing but controller, power and HDMI.
---
Does Luna show incoming heals that you're casting on your target?
---
I sold my wife and divorced my dog and still never got invited to raids.
---
... ^^^wait ^^^a ^^^minute...
---
Yes. And other people’s, too
---
I can’t imagine playing without one at this point lol.
---
My mum had a similar issue. She's a cook in a kitchen so is using your arms all day.
---
She had to surgery to remove build-up of &lt;something I forget the name of&gt; around her nerves and veins and she is as good as new now. Perhaps it's something similar to that?
---
Find a market and corner it.
---
Hmmm, the incoming healing is the one thing I was looking for. I dont typically use a lot of unit frame addons, is it possible to obtain this ability while keeping the unit frames relatively unchanged?
---
Do you have a fresh disc invite?
---
I don’t think so.
---
Dang, well thanks for the info. I'll just have to get used to different unit frames.
---
Blacksmithing.
---
Ideally everyone should be engineering, unless you go tailor/enchanter combo
---
The 2nd crafting skill should be something that benefits your class or the raid Lw/Bs/Alch
---
And if you were a guild that cleared content when it was relavent then you either 
---
had guildies that didnt raid progress but just farmed mats for the guild, and in return got to go to raids after all the raiders in guild got everything they need.
---
Or you all had farming alts that you played on non raid days, the hours you would normally spend raiding, youre farming and preparing for next reset instead.
---
What the fuck did I just read
---
If you are ahead of the curve, go out farming. If you have herbing then head to places like winterspring for black lotus, or mining and do the runs where there is little competition for spawns. 
---
Use the time to bank all the herbs or ore you get, once players all hit 60, many will be power leveling professions like alchemy, engineering, enchanting.
---
I plan to take skinning and herbing, bankng all herbs and selling the leather (most of it vendored). Once I get to about 45-50, I’m taking enchanting and will run some low level instances for easy early de mats, as folk will need them to power level enchanting.
---
Wow you must have been really smart
---
Water Totem quest on my Shaman and Aquatic Form quest on my Druid. 
---
Long, convoluted, globe-trotting quests like these are a major part of class fantasy and something sorely missing from modern games. I can't wait to experience them again.
---
How does that feeling not still exist today?
---
It’s a 100% drop but you need to roll/dkp for it.
---
It’s a tough quest, get your guildies to help you if you can (to clear mobs), and keep the area clear as you fight the demons.
---
seems like BC was the best overall expansion; legendaries, arena etc. why isn't it as/not more hyped than classic? (I joined late WOTLK)
---
MD?
---
Ah, well if you don't play retail then there's no harm. I still don't agree with it, but whatever. Be better in the future.
---
Is that a Microsoft Intelli Explorer? Based af
---
Isekai.
---
No, I dare say I will as well. All the waiting and teasing is quite emotionally taxing, it will be such a relief and there will be so much emotion on logging in, crying is definitely a possibility.
---
To be fair...If I saw an actual dumpsterfire, I would probably check it out for a sec.

As a physiotherapist i Would advise you to Look for some Treatment There. Chiro's are good when you have some blocked joints but it wont help a long time. What you are looking for is a longtime solution which a good physiotherapist will Provide better then any chiro.
---
For example is it really unlikely that both hands got the same Problem at around the same time even though both are used in total different ways (mouse is totally another Thing than using a keyboard). So from a far distance and as someone already mention, i Guess you got a neckproblem and/or upper thoracic spine.
---
If you need more Info on this topic or how to find a good therapist just pm me
---
either 
---
A) youre lying
---
B) your guild never fully clear any tier when it was relevant
---
C) youre trying to pass your private server experience as 2004 to 2007 world of warcraft experience.
---
 I was super fucking casual back in TBC and even more so in vanilla and shit guilds like Fair to Northrend required 2 crafting professions and we were a 12hr raid week guild, nothing serious at all. One of our officers was a clicker.
---
And 2 crafting professions has always been mandatory for semi hardcore and above. Up til what Warlords? When they took all the crafting bonuses/restrictions away.
---
Coming from lots of experience in the private server scene, the excitement for burning Crusade is on par with or possibly greater than classic. And again that place was a strange culture where people burn themselves out hyping up one set of servers for classic, then After experiencing that, Benny Boyd that latch onto the next wave of servers which happened to be burning Crusade.
---
Quality is completely a matter of subjective experience.
---
That's enough internet for the day
---
"Legolazz turn off growl. DISMISS YOUR PET BEFORE JUMPING DOWN- fuuuuuu"
---
I would assume he's talking about the African-American accent, which most African-Americans have. "Black voice" is a pretty strange way to put it though.
---
Dwarven females have an open invitation to Orgimmar.
---
I've read a fair share of litrpg novels. I think I'd be stoked to be able to roam around Azeroth for real.
---
I level up to the mid 30s, then I go find kinelory and quae and start an awesome polyamorous relationship.
---
I’m in the same boat, but don’t think you can get away. You need to embrace the change and make it work for you.
---
I’m now 45, wife, 2 kids ages 7&amp;5, and a demanding job. Wife knows I loved wow, I stopped in 2012 when my oldest was born. 
---
My comprise is to find a guild before classic is released, that suits my playing expectations, casual but plans to raid. 
---
I’m buying a good gaming laptop with a big screen, so I can play on the sofa, once the kids are all in bed and I can at least pretend to be sociable with the wife. Prob 2-3hrs a night. 
---
The guild I’ve registered with look to raid from 8-11pm maybe 12am....which is perfect for me. 
---
Also, with a gaming laptop, I might be able to squeeze in an hour or so of play at work, and lunch....even if it’s just doing the AH and vendoring my rubbish, or leveling fishing 😂👍.
---
No changes mean no changes, leave TBC alone, just don't play it
---
What lore are you referring to? And where can I read it? I've been meaning to get into the lore in preparation for Classic
---
I never understood what the problem with this was. Can't you just let the pet die and feign death?

I remember when like 10 people were level 70 and five of them non-stop were doing dungeons. They were all in our servers top guild and one was our servers’ contest winner tabard guy. Crazy time period. Classic, bc and early wrath were unforgettable and unfortunately retail doesn’t have this scale anymore
---
I've had similar issues, but exercise fixed it for me 100%.  
---
I had it all: Back pain, wrist pain, twinges in my shoulders... Daily weight lifting, yoga, and stretching made all the pain stop.  
---
Now if I can just fix my eyes lol
---
I love both of them (and i actually dont drink much soda anymore), though i thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiink i'd take game fuel over baja blast.
---
Its really, really close though.
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Misdirection
---
I've never heard of this until now, and we cleared upto 9 boss's naxx, all BC, hc Lich King, only horde guild to get immortal on our server.
---
Admitidly though most of us where two professions anyway because of the bonus from them, and I do remember alot a of us dropped gathering in BC.
---
Well, that was my take from reading “Rise of the Horde” by Christie Golden - I think I’ll read it again, actually. Just seemed like the factions were lost without an enemy, so they mostly targeted each other out of a lack of anything better to do.
---
But... my memory has failed me many times before, so I should read this again...
---
Three ways to get the lore:
---
1.) Watch Nobbel87 Videos on youtube. 
---
2.) There's 25+ books on amazon, start with the war of the ancients trilogy.
---
3.) For a TL;DR there are three Warcraft chronicles books, which read like textbooks, but are super awesome and totally worth it!
---
https://i.redd.it/cr59hablt6v11.png
---
Not in my Classic WoW.
---
I raider pretty hardcore in vanilla and we just used dkp.
---
In the very first ever MC raid, we al had 50dkp....when an item dropped, we bid to our loot officer, what we thought it was worth.
---
Ie... one player who really wanted an item would bid high, folk looking for off spec gear would bid low.....then the person who bid the most got the item. 
---
It’d even its self out as high attendance players got the items they wanted first, and those who bid low, would eventually get it after more runs.
---
We cleared MC//ZG/BWL/AQ40 &amp; AQ20, and we’re into Naxx (only 4 bosses killed) when tBC was released.  Even into tBC, same system used.
---
There was never any drama with loot. Not once in  all the time.
---
What's so different. Not a wow player
---
Günther is just a first name in German. The term Movementgünther is interchangeable with Movementcripple.
---
Hope you get the idea.
---
Pretty sure there would be enough interest for at least a couple of servers.  How many private servers are out there with massively inflated server caps(that range from classic through every expansion)?  How many more people would be interest in a legitimate experience beyond that?
---
Please look into fascia treatment. I got thoracic facet syndrome from playing wow and having a uniquely physically demanding job. The main component for wow affecting it was me CONSTANTLY holding down right click for me to turn. I basically have tedonitus in my right shoulder blade and neck.  
---
I have gone through the rounds on trying to treat it. I am now down to doing yoga and getting fascia massage from a really good specialist. Going to write a 10 page report on it some day and post it to Reddit as there is absolutely no info about it on the Internet.  
---
Please do your research and listen to your body. I highly suggest yoga as a cheap treatment until you find other ways to fix your body. Seriously consider a standing desk which I have also done for my desk job.   
---
Please message me if you need any more tips or guidance
---
In TBC didnt you basically have to have at least 3 people at the dungeon to summon the rest of your party?  It basically just made every group have a warlock waiting at the entrance so you arent waiting an extra 10 mins for that one person who forgot something in their bank.  TBC was built around flying mounts so getting rid of them would mess a few things (not that many) up.  I am just glad you don't get flying until you hit max level so the leveling experience still has good pvp.
---
Killing brutallus or M'uru without bloodlust/pally buffs oh god the horror.  I guess if we go with the most nerfed versions it would be okay but I preferred the well tuned versions.
---
Mortal striking fury warriors mhn
---
I'm not sure where you're getting any of this.
---
How hard is it to kill this boss for Q to drop?
---
Dang I was hoping for the 26th that’s my bday :D
---
Depends on how classic does for them.  If it seems worth it from a money stand point they may do some/all of the other xpacs.  Original classic servers though are pretty much guaranteed to stay as they are though.  New servers either with fresh start or copies would seem likely if they decide to go the TBC route.
---
Spirit is insanely underrated for leveling, probably the best stat for it actually
---
You're just getting worked my man.
---
I was there on a PvE server (Perenolde) til TBC. I actually had a undead rogue and human warrior. Alliance had a lot more players so I ended up playing the warrior a good bit because it was easier to find groups. I’m going to roll an Orc Rogue this time on PvP server and hope for the best . I still May do an undead bc their aesthetic is so good for rogue :)
---
It will be once we've been in Classic for awhile. As soon as the last phase hits people will be wondering when we'll get BC Classic servers. 
---
Personally, BC was the highpoint in WoW for me. It felt like a true successor to Vanilla in most ways.
---
The Fel Reaver too
---
## BWWWAAAAAAAAAA
---
Exactly this. Similar situation here, two kids and a wife, I’m planning to put in less than 5hrs per week and if that’s not enough to enjoy the game I guess I’ll pick up something else to spend my alone time on.
---
That's basically exactly what I did!  Commented on another post, but I'll be playing looking at vanilla on a monitor that cost more than my whole rig back in the day.
---
I have one of those; and one flatscreen HD like OP’s. 
---
I like the older 4:3 screen better sometimes. Especially when you find a show in that aspect ratio.
---
Don't bring that SJW crap to vanilla.  It's giving a person who made a different choice a bit of friendly shit talk.  I rolled both, and I missed things from each when I played the other.
---
Devilsaurs
---
Nah grew out of that almost a decade ago in retail. Just like regular fantasy style races more is all
---
Yourself? I'm here if you need someone to talk to.
---
I'm 100% with you in terms of just wait for the Blue post.  Until we see that, nothing means anything.  However, to also presume that by this stage absolutely no-one outside of Blizz knows anything about the status of Classic outside of what we've been told in blue posts would be a bit of a stretch.  We're getting closer to release and gamers get excited and people talk.
---
And the worst speculation is the release date is the time backwards ... 9/15.  Enjoy the final week of summer with classic, lol.
---
You have the leds facing you?
---
Lmao calm down spaz
---
As of now the Classic Alpha client is on an 8.0 base, so I'd expect minimum system requirements to be similar.
---
true true. this is what I mostly meant; whether starting with classic ought to imply a BC relaunch in the future. seems like it might.
---
why would you waste time to open the door? seems like a casual move to me
---
The only time I got onto a new server was when Blades Edge (EU) came out and that was in... TBC I think? Everyone knew how to farm and wanted to sell things for high prices but no one had any money. If you want to make money fast I suggest you farm pure gold from the elite scarlet crusaders in WPL and EPL. Some classes can solo those guys even early on.
---
Thank you!!
---
Nah man, monster has been around for a very long time in the UK also. It's definitely not a bad thing you hadn't realised 'cus that shit is rancid.
---
If it's genuinely you then that wasn't me! My mum was the one to make the purchase haha.
---
Waiting until the release of AQ to sell something is not really equivalent to making money when ahead of the curve, that will take months if not a year
---
When Wrath came out I stayed up fro 3 days straight.  By the end of it I couldn't read the quest logs because the words would skitter around when I focus on them.  I got the feat of strength for server first Forsaken and Mage though.
---
Yea, the /4 LookingForGroup was a global channel built in to the game, not a custom channel made by players.
---
I dont mean to brag, but I have the BIGGEST unearned sense of accomplishment in the entire world
---
Not a bad idea. Everybody loves pork
---
Hi, /u/truantxoxo
---
Too many things to really list. Here’s a few.
---
Destruction of the “community” as far as now you can queue for random dungeons. It used to be that you had to seek out players and build a reputation among guilds and on the server for being a good tank, healer, or dps. Now you just click queue and you never know these random people nor care about them. No community at all. Same goes for pvp I guess (I never really got much into organized pvp).
---
Homogeneity of classes. Pretty straight forward. Classes used to be unique and different, then blizzard, responding to whining players, decided Druids should heal as well as priests and paladins as well as priests... and so on for all classes and specs. It ruined the uniqueness of playing a priest or a rogue.
---
Faction differences. Racials, shaman/paladin, stuff like that. Barely matters now.
---
No flying mounts meant better immersion. That’s ruined now days.
---
Better loot system which didn’t depend solely on a number (gear score), although later into vanilla people developed gear score type systems anyway... so I expect them to be in classic wow, unfortunately.
---
The lady and I work opposite shifts, mon-Friday I’ll get 6 hours to play a day, but absolutely no playing on the weekends, that’s our time together. Also fuck them kids!
---
So.... how was prison simulator ? Jesus Christ your mom is an edge lord
---
That’s totally fair! It just is something I wish I had done. There are much better ways of making money if you need it quick.
---
I actually don't think I ever played it, probably still in my bedroom at their house.
---
Man now I'm meltdowning. You kids get worse and worse with my zerg reply threads.
---
I dont get it...Warcraft is outside and you’re staying inside with your friend?
---
Both are just as good with different pros and cons. Dagger has more burst and has improved sprint, while swords have more sustain and doesn't have as many energy issues (backstab costs a lot). Daggers is definitely harder to play.
---
Is that game still going? I quit about a month or two after launch when you couldn't get anything done because of the hundreds of bots running rampant.
---
Nope. Didn't exist. People used /2 trade for that.
---
Addons they are using internally for development purposes
---

---
Do a bit of a search into ergonomics. Holding your wrist at the right angles can really help.
---
I found I used to get a lot of pain in my mousehand, so I changed my keybinds to never use the middle mouse button and it went away.
---
What does blacksmithing give you that you can't get at the Auction House?
---
It's not going to be permanent because that would defeat the purpose of having a server community. It makes sense during launch to ensure server stability though.
---
Yes it did exist... I literally linked a screenshot as proof. Plus I can remember it existing myself.
---
You have to figure out what's wrong before you can figure out how to fix it. See a doctor because that's not what should be happening.
---
Warrior only beats rogue if they don't have their CDs up or stun resists (orc). A good rogue will control the warrior and not let him have a chance to do any damage.
---
That's cool except overpower punish is beyond your control
---
Mage brings a ton of non-dps utility to groups, while doing good dps.  They conjure food and water, CC mobs with polymorph, put Detect Magic on bosses, one of only two classes that can remove curses, and most importantly they can teleport.  Also they bring the scorch debuff, don't remember what it does in vanilla because they've changed it a 100 times.  Mage can also AP/PoM Pyro (or Frostbolt if you don't want to pay for respecs) in pvp.  Once you get ToEP and ZHC you can literally one shot people in BG's or world pvp.
---
Warlock is going to get lots of raid invites because they can summon but that means you have to spend time farming soulshards.  Raids will want at least one hunter for Tranq Shot but as the other guy said their dps is bad in vanilla.
---
It's probably tennis elbow which you can get from sitting still in a gripping position on your mouse for extended periods of time. It can be treated with medicine but the likelyhood that it'll return is great if you don't change your life style.
---
Lifting weights will help but not until you're treated. Once you're well again try to minimize your time spent at the computer, there's no reason to sit at it when you're not actively playing the game for example.
---
See a doctor ASAP so you have time to get treated until the game comes out.
---
Depends entirely on class but in no particular order: herbalism, mining, solo mara farms as Hunter/Warlock, EPL bats, devilsaur leather, ogres in deadwind, AOE farming as a mage. There's loads more but it really depends on class, playstyle, game knowledge, etc.
---
You're wrong. Orc is extremely broken. UD may have more skill to it (passive vs on use) and be a lot cooler, but an additional 25% stun resist that is up all the time is better than fear immunity for 5 seconds every 2 minutes. Both are very strong, however.
---
Do you expect to be able to keep your progress from Classic after the \~2 years it will last?
---
Why show warcraft out the door when your friend arrives?
---
Naga is trash now. They redesigned it. The one from like 2010 was FAR better. Now you can't pick the mouse up without pushing one of the thumb buttons by accident because the required pressure is breathing. Which is freaking annoying.
---
Which class/spec is most akin to playing Ana from overwatch? Meaning long range heals, big burst potential, cool down dependent, fat buffs

For purely fun factor I don't think you can beat mind controlling someone in Blackrock Mountain and jumping into the lava.  If you play Alliance you can duel people outside of Ironforge and throw them off the cliff.
---
Yes and that's a player created channel in that screenshot. You had addons that managed it.

I like combining leveling and crafting at the same time, just to provide a break from non stop questing sometimes. Also later on it is great for easy silvers on the AH or as disenchanting fodder. And if you figure out the trends on the AH of your server you can maximize profit. (Most servers are more expensive during the week due to a lower amount of offers) and most people powerlevel professions in the weekend and post 20 items in 1 go. Just wait for them to sell and the price to go up again :)
---
And in BC you will make tons of money with drums, quivers and druid bis tanking gear :p
---
My eyelashes are longer than the average
---
Come at me
---
I play so much dota, that i cooked the same ui for it
---
I do aim to be, it was a tough lesson but one I’m glad I learned. 
---
See you in Azeroth!
---
Nobody will use 2 rogues unless they suck. Rogue fills a very specific niche spot that doesn't need 2 players.
---
Lol why do you assume he doesn't know?
---
Fury isn't very good in PvP. You need really good gear and even then, it's nowhere near the level of a 2h MS warrior.
---
Pretty sad....
---
Druids are excellent at offtanking if you don't mind not being the main tank. Druids have a ton of specs and playstyles.
---
It brings back so many good memories. I remember watching it with my best friend when we were 11~12. we didn‘t speak english that well (I‘m still bad after all those years) but we pretended to understand every single word. Damn gangster kids 😎
---
How is playing longer rushing?
---
All 3 are very strong in PvP.
---
Mages are always in high demand in dungeons and warlocks are extremely sought after on the alliance side for raiding.
---
The mic is there so you can scream at the tank to hold agro in hd?
---
I for one love ammo on hunters and would never give it up again. Classic is classic, and you don’t change classics
---
Mine in TBC was similar.
---
[UI @ M’uru](https://i.imgur.com/u5paJsd.jpg)

Yeah it would if we were talking private server numbers. But for retail numbers? Nah it wouldn't. Consider that a classic vanilla server is considered to have a healthy population if there are at least 2500 players total. Blizzard could put out a game as simple as Atari style pong and there would be at least 2500 people playing it at all times.
---
then you don't want classic. 
---
what's so hard to understand that classic is fucking classic? 
---
look for a pserver that suits you, maybe cataclysm idk.
---
can we finally let classic be classic? there are posts like this everyday...
---
10 hours a week is casual. I wouldnt even bother playing with less than 5 a week. You won't be able to raid. Youd maybe enjoy a bg once a week
---
Whats up with these setups, i got a laptop i got for 70 quid and i hope it will sufffice.
---
Maybe start with a summary or something. Have no idea who you are
---
Cant do this in classic
---
The game isnt out. How do you have guildmates?
---
Quality of life changes is what caused Vanilla to become what retail is now.
---
I've always been under the impression that 27" is the ideal monitor size for gaming but if you've already got a 32" may as well use that.
---
They dont play wow ? 
---
and they hit my door with a stick too
---
The others saying you should talk to a doctor are right, however doctors aren't gamers and sometimes we can help each other out with simple tips. I know our bodies are different and not everything applies to everyone, but maybe look into these things and see if they'll work out for you? I've made them so that I can literally sit in front of the PC for more than 10 hours without a single strain or ache.
---
**1.** Good chair. Not a gaming chair, not a wooden chair, but a good, *office* chair. Doesn't have to be expensive, but it needs to be comfortable enough such that as soon as you sit on it, you don't feel any discomfort at all. You're probably from the US so I'm not sure if this specific chair will be available there, but I used it for 11 years straight and only recently bought the same one again because it's the only chair out there that allows me to sit *healthily*. It's the [Nowy Styl Manager](http://www.nowystyl.com/products/office-armchairs/MANAGER/MANAGER-ts13-with-a-Tilt-mechanism). It cost me about $130. If you can't find the same one, maybe look for one that's similar in design and ergonomics. Also most chairs by default are angled at 90 degrees. The seat is parallel to the floor and the back is straight up. This is a huge no-no if you want to use it for more than 10 minutes. The Manager chair already has the back angled, but what I do is I get a big piece of a paper shopping bag, fold it as much as I can and jam it in between the tilt mechanism, so that way the chair remains permanently tilted upwards by a few degrees. This *immediately* relieves any stress from my lower back.
---
**2.** A desk with enough depth. Not width, not height, but depth. You *need* enough depth not only to place your monitor as far away from your eyes as possible, but also enough room to have the keyboard there and have at least your forearms fully supported by the desk up to the elbow. Mine only have my elbow sticking out which is perfect because the bone that sticks out doesn't really rub on the edge, it's simply supported.
---
**3.** Do some sort of physical movement while sitting. It sounds stupid; why not just stand up and go for a walk? Well, ain't nobody got time for that. What I do is often lift either one leg up or both (sitting like Aladdin on my chair if your body allows it). Try to slouch for a few minutes to stretch out some back muscles. Adjust your keyboard placement to change your hand position from time to time. Basic physical movements help to relieve built up muscle stress.
---
These are the methods I've developed over the past 10ish years and honestly they've really helped me sit comfortably and game away. They may not apply to everyone, but I figured it was worth sharing.
---
***TL:DR - Good chair, good desk, posture/movement.***
---
Please answer to my few questions:
---
1. Is DPS the most important stat for raid?
---
2. As DPS class do you feel better than healer or tank? ... are they just an addition to DPS? 
---
3. If let's say such Hunter does only 350 DPS is he a burden to raid? Will raid be better without Hunter? 
---
4. Or perhaps every class has its purpose and is needed but in different proportions to different tasks ... don't you think so ?
---
3 warriors smacking you and not one of em thought "if only we had a form of slow to maybe keep him in place"
---
They actually did this in retail? This upsets me and I haven't played the game since the end of WotLK =\
---
This guy is alliance 100%
---
u pay for the location also mate.
---
Have you never been on this subreddit?
---
Roccat Nyth &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Naga.
---
It's usually better than taking all of their hits and you don't stay inside of the warriors range and let him continuously hit you, you kite him with your crippling poison. A good rogue with cooldowns will beat a warrior almost every time.
---
Why are you swearing?
---
I always imagined the oposite
---
Tfw you did first quest and realized this green reward was about to replace t2
---
https://imgur.com/a/W8oRfmz is the UI I came up with for soloing/5 mans as a warrior after the classic announcement.  I always try to follow these criteria for UIs
---
&gt;everything should be as minimal/small as possible while still being readable
---
&gt;All crucial info should be in the centre of the screen, close to my character so i don't have to look away. HP/Rage, debuffs on me sit above my hp bar, swing timer and cooldowns appear below it. Anything that's important but not-crucial like buff icons go down above the abilities.
---
&gt;try not to deviate from the WoW UI massively, Perl Classic is my pick cause it's clean and looks similar to vanilla UI. I really hope there's something equivalent for classic.
---
It's not exactly the prettiest or slickest UI but it's all laid out in the most convenient way possible for me. It's all placeholders so some stuff is bit out of line.
---
because this subreddit does have the same posts everyday, since a long time.  
---
you can't read 3 posts without seeing it again, it's just sad to know they will fuck the game up because no one knows the game but wants retail in it.
---
In addition to what you wrote. BL spawn in AV on the most popular pserver. Flasks and other high end consumables are dirt cheap on private servers compared to retail vanilla in terms of time investment.
---
[Flees in Paladin]
---
Skeleton keys?
---
I am certain its illegal
---
That I dont want actually, either give the original owners the pets or leave it :)
---
This might go down but as someone who is not very familiar with the history of WoW can someone give me the context for this?
---
Because you shit on the game people have been waiting for over a decade. We don't want the game to be modified to fit your needs as a pvp player, we want it to be as close as Vanilla it could be.
---
A lot of enemies have cone effects, so they can flame breath the whole party if the pet makes the mob turn around.  
---
Also tanks usually depend on taking damage to hold threat, so if the pet start tanking, their threat goes down, reducing the potential DPS of the whole party
---
I was speaking in general, no assumptions were made.
---
Says the guy with a CE :P
---
Sharding never makes sense tbh.
---
As everyone said, ergonomics. Try different chairs, look for seat cushions which may be designed for hip issues, maybe a footrest, try different mice, maybe a wrist rest for both mouse and keyboard. If sitting too long hurts your hip, consider a height adjustable desk. So you can sit one hour, stand the next.
---
Also be aware of your positioning and tension. I find sometimes I exert way more force mouseclicking than needed and on extended sessions it can start to hurt. So I be aware and try to be relaxed. Also take my hands off peripherals occasionally when convenient and just stretch and flex.
---
I mean, realistically, this *is roleplaying*. You're playing the role of a stripper, pleasing others and getting money in return.
---
Then again, eRP is a dangerous hole to drop into. What happens in Goldshire stays in Goldshire.
---
nobody knows.
---
The green gate was the portal to ”The burning crusade” expansion. This is the last secounds before you could enter it
---
Thank you!
---
That's the dark portal to Outland right before Burning Crusade expansion went live.
---
&gt;Heck
---
Maybe you should play alliance tbh.
---
Yup. I'm sure some chiropractors in America have some amount of genuine medical training given how common they are but that is not guaranteed.
---
&gt; [Chiropractic is a form of alternative medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiropractic)
---
Go and see an actual doctor.
---
**Chiropractic**
---
Chiropractic is a form of alternative medicine mostly concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system, especially the spine. Some proponents, especially those in the field's early history, have claimed that such disorders affect general health via the nervous system, through vertebral subluxation, claims which are demonstrably false. The main chiropractic treatment technique involves manual therapy, especially spinal manipulation therapy (SMT), manipulations of other joints and soft tissues. Its foundation is at odds with mainstream medicine, and chiropractic is sustained by pseudoscientific ideas such as subluxation and "innate intelligence" that reject science.

Not really expecting to be able to raid :)
---
They stated at blizzcon that's it's included with a wow subscription.
---
What's he doing now?
---
Listening to the show while working as an emt/paramedic. 
---
Your show is truly golden - keep up the good work, Josh!
---
I love Hunter ammo. Mounts taking up space meant you had to make tough decisions. That mount was a part of you. You gave up a BAG SLOT for it! You didn't luck out on an alt, YOU got that thing! I understand that it's not overly convenient, but that's part of what made them special.
---
There wont be a one time fee and you will need to pay retail subscription in order to play classic.
---
They never knew? any hardcore guild would notice it that one of their members would disconnect every raid at the same spot, that's a pretty easy to spot pattern
---
That only applies again, just at 3-5 mobs you pull initially, but not the bulk of 20 mobs i was talking about 🧐
---
Priest with Power Infusion probably
---
The prequests for the bigger raids were not that easy for a long time. Shattered halls hc in time was really hard for some classes. Can't remember how many runs we did for guild members, who wouldn't be attuned otherwise. The whole raiding experience was depending on you having achieved the previous goals. Killing KaelThas after 3 months of trying, and then being able to go to MH/BT was one of the best moments of BC.
---
Imagine living in a shitpit with a bunch of rotting corpses walking around
---
Even by 2005 standards that's fucking bad.
---
The one stream I can watch is dota international, if the prize pool is 20+ mil... Its gonna be a good show
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
wait, does this mean you still don't have it in 2019?  Why are you 15-20 years behind the rest of the developed world?
---
The classic wow blizzard is going to release will contain lots of changes. They have said themselves that wow is a data based game, they are going to load up data for classic wow and run the data on modern wow server to create the classic experience. Stuff like buff/debuff limit will likely not be there anymore. 
---
Personally i wont mind stuff like keychain and mount tab, features that makes it easier to manage my characters without breaking any aspects of gameplay.
---
Soo whats ur twich link?
---
I know how it sounds but...
---
I remember this. I was at my friends house. Waiting to be able to log in and make a Blood Elf. We got in, he made a blood elf and ran around. then i had to run home and get online.
---
This mentality is why blood elves dominate the horde after they came out, so many want to be a pretty little princess running around. I'm glad the ugly hunchback horde is back.
---
Subscription.
---
Lol, I've never played a Blood Elf but okay. Only ever played Orcs and Trolls.
---
With ElvUI coming to classic I will probably go for the UI that I had through WOTLK and Cataclysm.
---
[https://youtu.be/8Yxd4xfKTMI](https://youtu.be/8Yxd4xfKTMI)
---
In this video I didn't have the PowerAura skin working yet it seems. The runebar addon was my own creation since there was nothing that offered the flexibility that I was looking for.
---
you honestly dont know what you are talking about
---
It's awesome to see new players trying the game, I hope you enjoy it.
---
As much as I love the fact they named a beer thunderfury, I've gotta say I'd be ordering a fall of troy without a doubt. Milkshake IPAs are probably my favorite recent beer trend.
---
Those people are mad.
---
I don't see how that changes anything that's been said already.
---
The only things I miss from archeage are things wow classic cannot provide and I would give a kidney for retail to have (ships and the housing/farming system. I spent a lot of time building my first ship and sailing it was a lot of fun, but the rest of the game was meh to me)
---
It's blue for unflagged, yellow when they flag themselves, and red for when both they and you are flagged.
---
None of the things you listed are annoyances worth solving at all, if anything they add to the RP flavor of the game. My mount needs to take a bag slot because it's a physical whistle that I use to call it. It's not as cool if I'm opening a mount page and just summoning my mount out of thin air.
---
I cleared naxx with my guild in vanilla with 500-2000 ping. Good old days lul...
---
don't worry, it will be different, but still fun.  I have played vanilla for years and years on private servers and I still don't have experienced all classes and I still discover new bits and pieces in the world.
---
Just so you know, Ion specifically talked about the debuff limit last Blizzcon and stated that the 16 slot debuff limit will be present in Classic.
---
"I want Classic but not really"
---
Removing ammo isn't a QoL, its a big deviation from the intended (back then) design. QoL is having the option to send multiple items at once via the mail. Ammo removal, gives you 16 more item slots, which is big. Same goes for mounts, shards  etc etc.

Druids can tank it all.

One of the benefits of playing since the very beginning! The only drawback is that apparently lots of people know somebody else IRL with that name, and many of them felt the need to whisper me to check whether or not I was that person.

---
Yeah, I've got folders full of screenshots, and the very next one in line after this one is "World Server Is Down".
---
Been playing at launch, then patch 1.2(i believe?) came.... Used to live with a room mate and when one of us was working, the other spammed space, so they can't get booted out of the game and lose the crafting points.
---
It had potential but trion didn't really help. Shame...
---
As long as Blixzards adopts the "if you can do anything about it ingame we wont get involved attitude" itll turn out just fine. Being a streamer puts a massive target on you, at all times. If they can manage even having thia target on them, then honestly fair enough
---
If you never played WoW before you'll have to buy the base game and then pay a monthly sub.
---
Alliance doesn't need STV to kill horde. We come to your city and just do it there. Kill em all!
---
Memes promoting casuals are by definition low tier on a neckbeard sub.
---
Lok'tar, friend.
---
What's cringey in this, this is awesome! True 2005 spirit. 
---
Tganks for uploading mate!
---
That wasn't my usual UI, but for some reason that I can't currently recall, I'd disabled most, if not all of my addons for the launch of TBC.
---
Also, I was a Paladin, so I only needed four buttons on keybinds anyway... ;)
---
Damn you just broke the economy.
---
Basically every raiding potion and flask resgent. Ele earth and fire comes to mind
---
How much is the sub?
---
15 bucks for a single month. You get a small discount for buying 3/6 months at a time. Think it's 14/month for a 3 month sub and 13/month for a 6 month sub.
---
Ez pz
---
Pretty cool to see how few had t3
---
King's honor, friend.
---
I totally understand where you're coming from. Just be prepared that while raiding, you're most likely going to be expected to heal, simply because everything else is fairly hard to be competetive with. Not undoable though, and if you find a more casual guild, I don't see why they wouldn't let you DPS. Be prepared to farm a LOT of Gnomeregan for the 50% AS Mace with 3 charges, though.
---
In PvP, Druid very much relies on outlasting your opponents. You're not particularly bursty, so you whittle down your enemies while keeping yourself topped up. It's a fun playstyle, but it's definitely not for everyone. Some popular specs to be on the lookout for are [29/11/11 Balance](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0t0xhMxsLxG0oZVV0o) and [0/30/21 Feral/Resto](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxxhscMdxVxckxo), the former being a great PvP spec with a lot of utility, the latter being ideal for solo play and being a super versatile raider. You can definitely swap around some points to your liking, especially if you want it to be more PvP focussed.
---
except this entire subreddit
---
Yeah they were essentially US based servers labelled oceanic to make it easier for the oceanic Timezone people to play together. Not actually physically located in Australia until like MoP? Maybe WoD? I don’t recall exactly...
---
Black rock and proudmoore were also pseudo oceanic servers, massive oceanic pops alongside NA.
---
Me and the lads do tonnes of strat live runs, whore our professions, grind valuable mobs.
---
I was there on Proudmoore. It was a madhouse.
---
Hey frost very nice video.  You finally started using new music haha
---
very hard, most guilds spend upwards of 15 years /played time just to kill the major
---
Cheers mate :)
---
imagine general chat on the first day of classic, tons of people will be asking questions like this
---
I will be streaming, but I am a PVE only player.
---
i did not expect opening the door once a month was casual
---
You are a PR nightmare. So easily baited into damaging your image constantly. Stop being so sensitive and egotistical.
---
Take some time to go back and look at how you took the effort to reply to dozens of individuals that you have never and will never meet. How defensive you got and how worked up you allowed yourself to be. Then you went to twitter to share the thread in hopes that you followers would come protect you. If that’s not a meltdown I’m not sure what is.
---
Ma man, you're the only good druid I know
---
(for the little I've seen, on mobile data D:)
---
There is no base game any more. To play WoW you need an account (free) and then pay the subscription.
---
(The only thing needed to be bought is the latest expansion, BfA currently.)
---
Did someone say, [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]? 
---
Delicious.
---
Sorry it took so long to get the second one out, but finally it is here! I'll try to get content out more frequently now that we're getting close to Classic :) Hope you like it!
---
Nope!
---
I raided a MC with 512 ram. If I dc'd, the game would ride to load back in unless I disabled all my add-ons.  
---
It was actually a radar in PvP because when a new player came into tender range I would get a 2-5 sec lag spike, so it acted as a radar.
---
This guy complains about gearscore, 100%.
---
I didn't really know many tanks that even had engineering in vanilla. It wasn't until much later that people recognized how good it really is. Most professions gave stone nothing for raiders.
---
Very clean, I like it. But as a healer I would put the Raid-frames elsewhere.
---
people can easily get them while doing the ungoro part though
---
Figured i post here because i don’t want to make a new post. I want to play Druid, warlock and probably shaman and warrior :)
---
My penultimate dream is having a rank 13 druid. I remember feeling my druid was either/or for a long time. Having feral gear made me go oom after 2heals, there was hardly any agi/str/int gear. I remember seeing that warlord set and thinking how op druid must be with it. I’m sure rank 13 is going to be hard to achieve, especially being an alt-o-holic.
---
However, working nights allows me to play during shifts and when i dont work i’m home during the day when my gf works, so i have time. 
---
However, june 29 is the set date for the birth of my second son... That’s good news of course, kinda ;-)
---
Race is tauren obviously for druid, however my lock is going to be either female orc or undead male i’m still undecided
---
Shaman will be male orc enhancement for 2handed memefury
---
And warrior undead because its name will be DeDodeRidder (Belgian flemish ppl will get this)
---
Not really a question, but i felt like sharing :-)
---
Didn't know that, thanks. Just assumed they would charge up front as usual.
---
Opening the door at all = casual.
---
&gt; My question would be: what are some specific examples of "new knowledge" that has led to this 600% dps increase?
---
Lol you wouldn't even need any new knowledge to apply this - just that everyone in the raid applies themselves and not just 0-2 people. Watch that fury warrior video from retail vanilla doing 1250 dps over 6 min despite being a clicker, not having all buffs and not knowing his rotation. If everoyne in the raid had played at his level the boss would have died faster than on pservers (because of intentionally higher armor).
---
The world first Nefarion kill had a Paladin with Thunderfury. Yes people were utterly clueless back then and it’s the sole reason why private server boss kills are so fast and optimized. If we’re talking about accuracy, it’s safe to say that private server bosses are highly overtuned. Their armor values are increased to stupid amounts to curb the melee dps. It’s very likely that you’ll see even bigger numbers in Classic. In fact I’m 100% you will but that’s just me.
---
star citizen might, if they ever get that shit together :D
---
I saved this video for myself, because I like the concept of the UI.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu8miPLbIn4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu8miPLbIn4)

But I would throw some Addons out, because I like it clean and minimalistic.
---
Like Decursive obviously. The two addons under the Radar.
---
He asked for other turbo nerds and adderall enthusiasts so I assume he is trying to rush to sixty.
---
People are really mad at you for some reason. It doesn't look like the set at all - it's too black.
---
Or you could use council. "shrug".
---
There might be a reason why its the only used system at all, but Idk
---
look at all those beautiful abilities
---
They're so hideous, they fit right in with the horde.
---
I mean I'm more concerned on why you're concerned. You seem more invested in me then most people on reddit I know. You like to use this psycho babble bullshit when in reality it's plain as day. And if you don't see it then you're either too young in the game, or too stupid. But yes keep breaking down my meltdowns everytime I post. That is definitely more healthy.
---
On the one hand, trying BfA first could make you appreciate Classic more for its better core systems. On the other, it might give you a permanent, haunting depression.
---
Looks nice for DDs. Minimalistic and clean.
---
You’ve been watching way too much tipsout. Everything that comes out of that guy’s mouth is false and bad for your mental health. 
---
There will be world buffs in Classic. And I can guarantee you that BL will be far cheaper in Classic than on Private servers.
---
Eh maybe it will be a different generation that runs things in classic
---
Back in 04 to whenever WoD came out 
---
It was mandatory to max.min your characters and that required 2 crafting professions
---
Exactly, it all comes together if you think about. If you need more bag space you make bigger bags. If you dont have that ability then you get a tailor to make you some or buy some off the AH. Which is a perfect example why leveling professions in classic is worth while.
---
&gt; There are many rumors that beta might be soon 
---
There are no rumors, there are only desperate people guessing. "Beta announcement ANY DAY now" has been chanted on this sub literally every day for the last month
---
Nope.
---
not gonna find a very receptive audience for this kinda sentiment here g
---
Could have something to do with the level of stupidity of your proposition.
---
Yep, I remember the time before summoning stones. My lock was very popular. ;)
---
Thank you.
---
Go to another doctor
---
This stuff is often fixable with simple exercises but your hip? See another doc and look into special seating gear, exercises and everything
---
&gt;Not massive design changes but small things.
---
By themselves, all the design changes were "small things".
---
_"Why are you upset? You just don't have to run to dungeons any more, its boring anyway!"_
---
_"OMG it's only professions, they were a boring grind anyway"_
---
_"Why shouldn't we have dailys, farming is a grind anyway, it's just a small change."_
---
Small changes have a tendency to pile up, and combine to an enormeous boatload of crap that smothers the game. So kindly take your trolling elsewhere.
---
Or just don’t believe it at all? Because it’s bullshit
---
they'd be vanilla era design Monks and DKs. aka Hybrid taxed into the ground for monks (mistwalkers only in raids), and DKs would have basically all the same issues paladins do, except they can't heal or buff, so no one will bring them.

But they'll make a pretty strong PvP class, they just won't have the longevity to dps for raid encounters due to their mana costs and lack of support. Also their shadow damage aura won't be allowed as it'll likely cause all sorts of pull issue and they won't be allowed to use any diseases due to the debuff limit, and their ghouls won't scale from their stats so their dps contribution will be pretty minor (also no glyphs so they'll need a dead body to raise their ghoul from).
---
They also probably wouldn't be able to tank, since they couldn't use shields AND were a mana based class.
---
Brewmaster would have the same problems as Feral. Takes too much damage all the time so the healers oom. And no gear to support it.
---
And Windwalker would be similar to an enhancement shaman except able to dual-wield, yet another mana based class (since they aren't gonna have a non-mana based healer), with good burst that just can't sustain well to be opimal.
---
Mistwalker will be a confusing mess of druid/priest/shaman tools that isn't anywhere near as good as any of it as one of those classes is, and will be largely forced into getting into pile spamming stop-casts to squeeze out as much efficiency as possible or occassionally using a weak version of chain-heal to raid heal (largely useless on horde side since shaman do everything they do better, but having a minor niche to fill on ally side).
---
Counterquestion: Do you people even try to use google or is your first impulse whenever you find a void in your brain to ask a question, regardless of how many times it was asked and answered before?
---
But then again what do I expect from people for whom the usage of a question mark in the context of a question apparently poses an insurmountable intellectual obstacle.
---
That's what I was thinking after reading, I'm so ready to grind, but will I be if my progress gets erased when classic is released? I'd rather just wait
---
I was not able to login for 2 hours straight so went off to sleep and went in the next morning. Man the ques the first werks....
---
I bet you are a big user of sarcasm
---
Christ I can hear it
---
Yea im a past and current player of ArcheAge i still enjoy it to this day.
---
&gt;my hip hurting from playing WoW
---
What the fuck are you doing while you play?!?
---
Hunter and another non cloth dps so I can have all the loot
---
Usually on mara runs people that come with you pay you for the run AND if their item drops.
---
Better it died now than it hanging on for a few months and then capping out during your first long gaming session after launch.
---
Remember that simply upping Watts does not necessarily guarantee quality.
---
Yes this is a real WWII battle station
---
I’ve only ever seen payment of item drops
---
Generally my go to is "wts tanking services"
---
My Biggest Takeaway:
---
* The Classic Team is removing the Focus frame.
---
* We can't use scripting to have a focus.
---
I'm wearing mine right now! :D
---
I hope they do too. Also hope that it's cringy and bad as well, just like the original advertisements. #nochanges
---
Gibts ne forum wo Deutsche spieler haben pläne für Classic?
---
This was too far down on the list
---
As someone who mained them both this is the key diff between the classes
---
A lock with good talents can chain pull and wipe out entire fields of enemies in far less time than a hunter can
---
So much so, that it makes up for the run speed difference a little bit
---
Warlocks can spend extra time grinding an area if they’re there for a quest, quickly rack up money and XP, then move on to the next. Running a bit slower but mopping up mobs like nothing
---
We don't know FOR SURE because Blizzard can do what they want, but they've said everything is based off 1.12. This means no shadow damage for lupos. I think the only special thing retained when tamed is attack speed, which won't affect raw DPS but will affect push back (so fast attack is generally agreed to be better for Pvp against casters).
---
We'll know more when beta happens.
---
Sounds like impaired bloodflow to the extremities.
---
1) Make sure your wrists don't bear the weight of your arms. Place your arms so that the lower arm is where the weight is. Make sure your chair is set you can comfortably rest your arms at a 90° angle when sitting upright
---
2) Make sure you are not squeezing the blood flow to your feet. put the weight on your buttocks, not the upper legs. If you sit completely upright with feet on the ground, you should feel no pressure on your upper legs at all
---
3) Make sure your chair allows for movement. Ideally, having a gaming chair or office chair that you can move in a rocking fashion. Do so, it will lessen cramps and make you mroe comfortable overall
---
4) Make sure to get up every 20 minutes at least. Go to the kitchen, grab a glass of water, come back. 
---
5) **Drink. Enough. Water.** I assume you are an adult male. Your daily requirement is 2 liters. Drink water or fruit-juice (orange, apple, etc.) mixed 1:1 with water. Avoud softdrinks and other sweetened beverages. Tea is a good idea too, the warmth helps relax your muscles and lessen the chance of cramps.
---
6) Air the room. regularly. An adult human requires about 10 cubic meters of air per hour. As Oxygen levels lower and CO2 levels rise, cramps and aches worsen. A typical dorm room or bedroom should be aired every 2.5 hours.
---
7) When you take a break, lie down or walk around. Sitting in a chair is not a natural pose for humans. Relax your system from it.
---
If I knew how to make the remind me thing Id make one to wish you Happy Birthday. But I dont know how make one so Happy Birthday in advance!

This guy stomached the whole of vanilla clicking. True mvp

It’s for the wow influenced rap songs he will record for his YouTube videos
---
Your bed is small.

God damm perfect, keep removing Trash
---
Unchanged: Animation system?
---
Everyone is giving you terrible advice. 
---
Make her roll a dwarf priest, give her a sock and a hot pocket, and tell her to strap in. Kel'Thuzad dies or your marriage does. Either way, you have the answers you need.
---
You cannot really use average when you have included gimmicks like razorgore.
---
We're getting patch 1.12, pet in duskwood won't do shadow damage (patched in 1.9).
---
For tameable pets you can have a look here: https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/
---
The problem is... Everyone will disagree on what these small changes are. Classic is NOT your best version of wow. It is and has to be the closest representation of vanilla so possible.
---
One of those little annoyances for you is another player's favorite aspects.
---
&gt; The world feels a lot more dangerous
---
It’s more exciting too I found. On PvE I just wasn’t ever afraid of excited running  through STV. In PvP, you get god damn adrenaline jolts running through that war zone!
---
&gt; Focus
---
Mod makers on private servers were able to achieve a focus. LunaFrames comes to mind from what people have told me.  
---
How do they achieve it in the original client, and could they again?
---
This is beautiful.
---
I honestly love TBC. In fact I would go as far as saying it is the best expansion. It brings such an epic feeling to the game and holds so many unforgettable moments. The gear just looked so bad-ass as well.
---
&gt;I'd have a robe to sit naked in for the launch
---
Thanks for that mental image.
---
I like the happy girl/boy on the right!
---
Good question. Most videos and guides on making gold are usually for when you have a mature economy. On a fresh realm, everyone will be poor and demand for raiding consumables will be low.
---
So don't expect high prices for anything on the AH. Don't expect gathering professions to be easy mode gold.
---
Not if you get the down timers down and camp then as they spawn.

---
It should definitely be a pretzel day gif. When Stanley is all giddy and excited.
---
yes
---
not for all games
---
ie in fps you dont wanna mess around much with sizes cuz it will take a while to adjust your accuracy
---
For me, the game is now 4 buttons+cooldowns. for Every. Single. Class.  
---
Talents may as well not exists.  
---
 The sense of power you get with an item is gone. It's just a small number change now and that's it. Made worse with the fact mobs scale to your item level.   
---
For example on level 111 it took me about 5 hits to kill a mob. It takes the same now at level 120 with ilvl380. 
---
Leveling is such an incredible chore that I can't force my self to level my warlock above 68. Some people say it's to learn your class but they can go fuck them selves. This was maybe true in Vanilla where every spec had like 30 abilities, but each expansion since Wrath took away a little from the game. Until now where you have one page of spells/abilities and half of them are passives.  
---
But good news is that babies can now play the game without issues.
---
I could fill a book list with this stuff.
---
MK here, can remember where I got mine from, will have to go over to my container and dig it out and have a look.
---
Not sure if sarcasm or not.
---
Stop.
---
How are you even gonna get the money to buy the engineering mats? Especially when you're DEing your greens?
---
I love it on PvP servers
---
Shimmering is always a great balance between warzone and quiet zone since there’s no obstacles and you can see when someone wants to fight
---
And worst case scenario, graveyard is right beside the place!
---
Has to be done. Right of passage on PvP servers
---
&gt;If you want a more consistently mature (key word consistent) you should consider rolling on an RP or RP-PvP server.
---
Don't take this the wrong way, but I experienced the world of LARP, Tabletop and Online RP in my youth (freaky girlfriends). No, they are not "more mature", not more so than any other group of people.
---
Where can I find these wall canvases? Please and thank you
---
Horde has more Trolls.
---
What's the keyboard? Please and thank you
---
I love you Frost
---
Shift+space is the perfect mount keybind.
---
Ohh yes =)
---
I am scandinavian, but I will play on the german servers, as I did in Vanilla. The community there is simply awesome, and no streamer-fan-kiddys to be found anywhere :P
---
Nice touch with the dog. I get it.
---
You only pay for the item.
---
Oh it was not at all passive aggressive, it was fully meant for you. Otherwise I wouldn't have said it.
---
As for wanting to talk about it. I did not invite to such a thing, I drew a parallel. That's it. You are reading way too much into that one.
---
Why the parallel?
---
&gt;I don't even trust that he's that regretful since
---
&gt;If he never got banned for it I doubt he'd be torn up about the botting. He would probably still be doing it.
---
That's the why.   
---
Once a baddie, always a baddie, apparently.    Might as well throw away the key, since people don't change, hm?
---
Best answer in thread
---
This. A PSU from a shitty manufacturer could destroy your whole system, you should NEVER skimp on the PSU, spend the money.
---
Hey! We both kept the hearthstone in the same spot....
---
....brother?
---
OH damage is garbage in vanilla. He’s right, it’s the first thing to sacrifice if you want other talents
---
Oh yeah you're right the hunter sells the items anyway
---
Really? Downvoting this guy? He is absolutely right there are so many people on here who are like ‘pVe SeRvEr BaD i Am RiGhT’
---
Roll priest and mind control them off a cliff
---
Yep. Ollo reckoning morpheus.
---
Its okay that your experience was different from mine. It is possible that one server had a different vibe. But it just my experience.
---
I commend your efforts, but your comparison doesn't work.
---
The first guy to play through Super Mario Bros. surely required more than the 2:31.983 minutes by the current record holder (warping, minus world ending).
---
Game knowledge, and the willingness (and nolifing) to perfect every miniscule aspect of the game, have abig impact.
---
That being said, only a small percentage of the playerbase will be pserver speederunners. For most, classic will play out exactly the way it played out in Vanilla, so I will enjoy my game without a worry :-)
---
correct

---
Just cannot imagine what happens Server-side when seeing so many changes in the client
---
It's not just one server, it's all the servers.
---
The people playing on RP realms are people. Regular, good 'ol fashioned _homo sapiens_. They consume food, drink water, breath air. They have regular brains between their ears.
---
enjoy world of inventory management then :)
---
I'm lost. Are you saying I do or someone else?
---
Again, it was my experience. You're welcome to continue disagreeing, but I already know you disagree.
---
I honestly love and hate watching these kind of videos. I love to watch them because it is super impressive, just the game sense and knowledge of how to play a class as such a high level. 
---
I hate to watch them though because I just can't emulate this at all!
---
I’m rolling Hunter and going Mining/Enchanting.  Will have more than enough to level Engineering to max once I’m 60.
---
Hunters farm so fast, the gold sink wouldn’t even be an issue. Will also supplement gold with Fishing.
---
God help OP if they’re rolling Warrior.
---
Classic beta next week?
---
Your sarcasm is much appreciated!
---
&gt;There are many rumors that beta might be soon
---
There are many rumors that the earth is flat and vaccines cause autism.
---
&gt;Trying to kill time playing other games 
---
You could learn how to program :-) https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview
---
&gt;I decided to change my 650W PSU to 850W
---
What kind of GFX card do you intend to use, a medium sized Jet-Turbine?
---
I'm not disagreeing with you, I am pointing out that pretending that some people are intellectually or morally superior to others based on their choice of computer game mode, is absurd.
---
Again, this was my anecdotal experience.
---
I don’t know if anyone who hides buttons they use though obviously some people must considering your explanation. 
---
How could I know you’re a “high level raider” and not some guy who just doesn’t use his spells properly?
---
&gt; Store button is removed
---
Thank the fucking gods
---
What guild is this hehe? Pvp? Ally? Casual?
---
Yes you could do it, but you can't level engineering until you have enough for your mount
---
I love how in Vanilla everyone could have simple rp-ish names just like Pete here, because the game was kinda fresh at this time
---
just so you know, he said he would "look into it", it is not set in stone. debuff slot limit is a strictly technical limitation. And it is not like blizzard actually balanced anything in vanilla around it, lets be real, pve class balance in vanilla is raw dogshit.
---
And so many tards quit WoW in that moment to not enjoy the best WoW expac ever.
---
You say MAYBE boomkin but no ferals ... at least ferals have some flexibility with tanking/dps/healing depending on the situation.  Boomkins are literally just worse DPS (personal + buffs) than bringing another mage/warlock and have mana issues to boot.
---
https://i.imgur.com/CjVQJFh.jpg
---
This is the basic layout that I use with my Luna. There's a couple of frames that you can't see here like my NECB and Decursive. Bars are hidden since I know all of my binds in my head.
---
That's the basic layout I'll be using in Classic, combined with whatever must-have addons from retail are like DR trackers and so on.
---
At what point do you swap to swords as a rogue for better dps?
---
Where was the info on what professions to choose for each class? Not mentioned here
---
He will. You can meanwhile enjoy retail.
---
That's actually legit more skillful and enjoyable than 95% of retail Vanilla videos ! Raiding cities by yourself is badass too :p 
---
What I find fun is how you scroll between your action bars to use spells, this was actually rare, I remember I only ever saw one other person do that on video, and it was a mage too, in WotLK ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmkNU7qRXkc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmkNU7qRXkc) ). Good times !
---
It does list recommended classes for each profession, and gives enough information for the player to make their own decisions.
---
Do you have anything for professions?  u/khosmology
---
Human warrior, I was 11 and I liked to hit things
---
Private severs use the original /Script and /run commands from 1.12 which would allow you to set a global variable to a player name.
---
The use TargetUnitByName to switch to the Focus. That functionality was removed in 2.01 and replaced with the Focus frame.
---
We're now stuck in a limbo where neither method will work.
---
Oh another brother! Awesome
---
All hail the lefties!
---
Well, for one, the first screenshot is of a pre nerf muru kill (known as the guild killer in TBC). I wouldn't have been in that raid if I "didn't know how to use my spells properly". 
---
&gt; I don’t know anyone who hides buttons they use
---
Lots. Why do you need your spells visible if you've got them bound anyway? Are you a clicker yourself? 🤔
---
What's the benefit in having screen clutter if you've memorized your spells/binds? It serves no purpose other than to take up more space on your screen... I fail to understand your logic. As long as you've got notifications for crucial buffs/spells they're not needed. Just because you're completely oblivious to the fact doesn't mean it's not common practice.
---
I’m developing a UI that aims to preserve the blizzard look/design but with a more modern touch and with some nice features added. 
---
Take a look if you’re interested, the UI have come a long way since the images on gitlab but I will update them later today! (:
---
https://gitlab.com/Ko0zi/zui
---
The problem is "good guild" isnt as common as it should be.  Loot council is very sensitive to corruption or even perceived corruption which will fragment the guild or at least cause discontent.  So while it is objectively the best and in certain high performing guilds is the best, the majority of guilds will still shy away from it towards some kind of modified point system.
---
Maybe its closed beta with wow influencers streaming xd
---
Yeah, but it's not intuitive
---
I want to play a priest. So priest is under tailoring for recommended classes. But is tailoring best for priest? What else is good for priest and not just good with tailoring
---
Jesus that is dangerous. Good friend, but you are your own worst enemy.
---
I’m not actually sure why you’re responding with such an elitist attitude. I merely asked a question and then responded honestly.
---
You can leave the buttons on the screen and they will act the same as a notification addon. You can also easily adjust the position and number of buttons to be minimal without “cluttering” up the screen. 
---
You do know of course what constitutes “clutter” and “not needed”- it’s all based on preference and subjective.
---
k
---
As long as they don't force me to play TBC, I won't play it. For now nobody knows if Classic WoW will ever update to TBC or WoTLK. Considering they are advertising Classic, I hope that it stays Vanilla forever, because this is my favorite version of the game and the one I want to play and willing to give them money for.
---
As soon as they update it to TBC, I'm out and will ask for a refund if possible.
---
The other scenario is they release separate TBC and WoTLK servers, which won't be good as it will segregate the population too much IMO, but it would be better than shoving TBC and WoTLK down the throats of people who aren't interested in those versions of the game, like me.
---
Why would you?
---
Up until 40 you'll be saving everything you can for a mount. 
---
If you disenchant everything you get that's even less money for said mount.
---
You won't be able to level your engineering while saving for said mount, because you won't have money for it.
---
Chances are you'll be into your 50s before getting a mount since you won't have enough gold.
---
Take enchanting and mining. Save mats as needed for levelling and sell the rest for cash. 
---
You'll still be wanting for cash because saving ore takes a shitload of bank space (meaning buying bags) so I suggest taking up fishing as well to supplement.
---
Don't join the channel then. What is this logic.
---
Stuck between choosing an RP and PvP realm. I dig RP, love immersion, but also want danger in contested zones. 
---
What should i pick? 
---
I might add I live in Oceanic region, so the likelihood of a PvP-RP realm is slim.
---
imagine enjoying social aspect of classic wow playing with these people rofl
---
That's how it should always be. Alliance are unique because only they have Paladin and Horde are unique because only they have Shaman. This is why I hate TBC and everything after that... the other reason being flying mounts... these are my two pet peeves with versions other than Vanilla.
---
The Grind
---
Soon as you get your hands on one i thought
---
Shadowburn only makes sense if something is gonna die before shadowbolt. If you had unlimited shards and you actually included it in your rotation you are gonna do much lower DPS.
---
I like no focus actually, makes playing healers a lot more fun and raises the skill ceiling of PvP a bit.
---
Lul PvE
---
Don't you have some off's to fuck?
---
I do know, I was asking somewhat tongue in cheek but clearly it came off wrong and he’s somewhat aggressive in his replies for no apparent reason.
---
Lmao the guy you're responding to.
---
'Nope. Not true. Won't believe it. Head in sand. Bye'
---
i know but they both ugly af though
---
You're not the only one.
---
if you want guaranteed population i suggest a pvp server you will be able to do some lite rp
---
don't know how well a roleplay server would do oceanic
---
This needs to be a trending post. I think it would be interesting to see what the sub is rolling. Bump!
---
If you can touch your nose with them im impressed
---
Kazzak in Stormwind again, yes please
---
Also, no Russians is a big bonus.
---
But having to learn German again (mine's atrocious) is gonna be painful.
---
2019 the year in which a company cant put a release date together for a game that came out in 2004
---
That massive fight at Blackrock Mountain, the essence of vanilla wow imo
---
If you're going mining/ench first then you aren't going engi "right off the bat"
---
Lol not having execute phase is not enough to even begin explaining the absurdly low dps.
---
I agree!
---
#nochanges
---
I enjoyed all expansions of wow except for MOP, it is a pretty pathetic thought that just because you enjoy vanilla, you are somehow better than everyone else isnt it :p Wow, you enjoy playing a game just because you need to go to the bank, find the key you need for a dungeon, put it in your backpack. Such deep gameplay mechanics and that must mean you have the greatest taste in mmorpg /s XDXD
---
Honestly while leveling you are going to be combat and you just use the best weapon you can find, so swords or basically anything else. Dagger maybe in your off-hand but never in your main hand (unless you haven't gotten a sword or mace or whatever in ages somehow).
---
I think around trash blade is when you kinda firmly lock in on swords, around this time you put points in the talent as well (since you don't go straight up combat, you put some talents in assassination). So that works out.
---
It's not significant difference when you consider salvation, might and kings. The fury dps records on patchwerk on unnamed pserver are all close together, with the top ones being alliance.
---
It should absolutely not be forced on you, separate servers all the way.
---
But I take issue with you complaining about splitting the playerbase. That's what retail players complain about when it comes to Classic. I thought we were better than that considering what we had to go through. Or is just once you get your server, too bad for everyone else?
---
A delightful clip to start the day. If u're really looking, u will find his stream.
---
3:30 was sick!
---
Any reason for Alliance to run SFK? At the appropriate level bracket, making the trip seems quite an ordeal.
---
Agreed
---
My dream is blizzard released the original game in it's original state
---
you are
---
Can't watch now because I'm working but please tell me you didn't tell people to side-shred?
---
finally finish the atiesh questline on a new char 🤷🏽‍♂️ will not happen as a father of 2 now
---
Taladril's pretty knowledgeable.
---
Well this is new..
---
PvP servers are a bloodbath, you don't opt in or out of fights. You can have your whole day ruined by a guild that wants to conquer an area you're in. On PvE servers you get little skirmishes of people that agree to PvP for fun. In PvP servers you start wars that can last hours that don't end until one faction just gives up and leaves the area.
---
haven't we had 1000 identical polls already?
---
While leveling, should you prioritize a fast off-hand that's lower DPS than a slow but higher dps off hand? How do you determine how much is worth the sacrifice (off-hand only).
---
It is one of the best 5 man dungeons there is.
---
But you could make a horde alt to do it.
---
go hit the gym
---
Like many people before already said: let HER play the game. Me for myself i get turned off of new games rly fast when someone is telling me all the time what I‘m doing wrong. Show her the basics, answer questions when she asks you but do not tell her what to do.
---
You are one lucky man and I hope you all the best for classic together with your wife (:
---
Warts and all you know? Seems like it's not made for you.
---
Hi, /u/mygodwhy
---
you also should say "seconds before the server went to Slowmode" 
---
EU-realms were nearly unplayable until one day later.
---
Why comment if you didn't see the clip?
---
I've never played in true Vanilla, but i've played some pservers and requirments for playing well your class, even on "high" level was pretty surface level, especially compared to Cata and further xpacs?  
---
If you did well on these xpacs, you shouldnt be afraid of Vanilla at all.
---
No Dire Maul since beginning means no mage lvl 55 water until the phase 2?
---
Lotta carebears in here it looks like. Pretending like PvE servers aren't for pussies.
---
Lmao yeah hunters are not going to be 3%
---
Priest PvP: Troll (hex)
---
Hex of Weakness is not that PvP influencial. Or did you mistake this for the Shaman spell from WoTLK, Hex?
---
Is it any less fun? I think not.
---
Nobody says hamstring kite is not working but can you do it for 16h a day for a week ?
---
Do you have any proof that they won't stack?
---
I used to play on ezi! Good times :)
---
Going for a rogue, pvp will be my main focus, while levling I'm thing about picking up eng and mining, then drop mining at 60 and get herb, fsrm all the needed mats and drop heerb for alchemy. Is this viable ? Eng is a must, what about second profession?
---
I think you are right.
---
no need for big, googlish data centers, if to much player in area: spawn new sharding-zone on an amazon-aws.
---
so the have a basic load and can load more capacity if needed.
---
All serious Priests should go tailoring for this reason:
---
&gt;Some pre-raid BiS items are BoP.
---
Specifically for Priests this is [Truefaith Vestements](https://itemization.info/item/14154) which will last you until at least BWL.
---
&gt;Best paired with Enchanting or any gathering profession.
---
A lot of people pair this with Enchanting:
---
&gt;Destroy magic items to gain dust and shards used to enchant your or other’s weapons and armor. Very expensive profession to level but does not depend on a gathering profession, so best combined with a gathering profession of tailoring.
---
It allows you to make money via bags, wands, and certain armor pieces while leveling and without having to compete for resource nodes.
---
With Enchanting you should be expecting to pick up the big high end enchantment recipes as a way to make money at 60, so you may want to coordinate this with your guild.
---
If that's not an option for you, then Herbalism is the other choice to take with Tailoring. Big money if you come across Black Lotus, and it will improve your DM:E farming.
---
Once you craft your Truefaith Vestements you can drop Tailoring for another profession. Most go with Engineering for the PvP advantages.
---
/roll

Break the duelist curse and get glad

Cause pve Server is easy mode.
---
I didn't write this guide. You'd have to ask Boatschl.

And chiro sounds like pokemon, can't trust your health to the hands of a pokemon.

General consensus is that if you need BOE, then you equip.

Unless it's a prominent item of value (16 slot bags, Flurry Axe, Edgemaster's etc.) then everyone is okay to roll, even if you can't equip that.
---
Most likely, yes.
---
The only true incentive for Alliance other than the drops is that you must go there for a part of the [Verigan's Fist](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6953/verigans-fist) quest, and Verigan's Fist is a very potent weapon and well worth your time.
---
Yeah, the mage has downs for not realizing it’s a dope twink item till after the roll
---
Oof 290ms thats one thing i wont miss about old classic lol.
---
Should be correct, yes.
---
Yes, it's an addon on its own that has been included into Luna (among other unit frame addons). The addon is called  Healcomm and works on the Blizzard unit frames.
---
Well, slight advantage here as I am a half-german :P
---
The bagspace a hunter uses for ammo, is the bagspace a warlock uses for shards, a paladin for alternate equipment, a mage for food to hand out to fellow players, a rogue for poisons, and so forth... it‘s part of the immersion and therefore part of the game. Quality of live features usually come at the expense of immersion in a game, fast-travel, lfg, mountsharing... good stuff for mobile games, bad stuff for real games!
---
If you're talking about Rogue, then I don't really think there's a set calculation for that kind of thing. It's something you'll have to play by ear. If the DPS boost is truly significant for that level, or if it has a nice proc then I would definitely consider it.
---
If you're talking about Warrior, I would strongly recommend not dual-wielding while leveling.
---
I'm thoroughly enjoying this new side of the sub.
---
Needs another question asking Horde or Alliance because that will change things.
---
Forum im Sinne von einer Website nicht, aber es gibt ein paar deutsche Classic discords z.B der von Defiler und Mowsen beides deutsche streamer wenn du die auf twitch findest finde ihren discord und das sind die einzigen "deutschen" foren die ich kenne
---
release date
---
Hammer time?
---
Ah yeah meant rogue. I remember reading off hand was mostly used to proc poisons so faster was better.
---
I like this guy
---
Meh.
---
Is there a consensus if Horde will be the better faction in Vanilla as well? If we look at for the top guilds for example or server populations, it seems that Horde is preferred. Was this same back in Vanilla?
---
came here to say this.
---
Thank you! I really appreciate that
---
&gt; so best combined with a gathering profession of tailoring.
---
That's a grammar error right? You mean "or" not of. Because tailoring has no gathering profession?
---
If you haven't already I'd suggest migrating the buffs/debuffs toward your center area. Eye movement is a break of concentration. Since you have everything else clustered you're creating a big gap between that crucial info!
---
Hope you are playing ur private server on 800x600 display, or you are just a hypocrite for "warts and all" :)
---
I'm expecting big things tomorrow. Videos from content creators who went to Blizzard HQ and a date.
---
Looks great!
---
Is this true????
---
Nice troll, B+ :o
---
Thank you so much! :D
---
How to pick a realm? I don't mean PvP/PvE, I mean say in the PvP subset you'll have 4-6 realms maybe on lauch, obviously all empty on launch day, you maybe want to avoid streamer realms but are you really gonna wait until they pick
---
That would be correct. Naturally though there does come a point where a huge DPS upgrade offsets the poison advantage.
---
Collect underpants, ???, profit
---
Lok'tar ogar, Chilled.
---
On my server BoE were free for all and whoever won it got it, even to sell.
---
Yeah probably a typo, meant or. I didn't write this guide (it says by Boatschl in the title), I just linked it here as a useful resource for people who are new to vanilla or haven't played in awhile since we get a lot of "what class should I play" type questions.
---
I was goblin mainer too, that my favorite race and i'll be missed of they. But I want original WoW Classic... maybe with "action camera" like option xD
---
Skill has nothing to do with it. Immersion is the purpose for a lot of people playing WoW and PvP is objectively a huge catalyst for that.
---
Hm, 2 have been shadowbanned it seems.
---
From way back when I was playing vanilla when I was 14 I wanted to have a dark iron dwarf character. After seeing the massive city of  BRD they just seemed so badass and I wished they were playable. I quit back in mid Cata and seeing them in bfa almost made me play retail again. Almost.
---
You know what I think I'd rather be corpse-camped for 2 hours in STVietnam than this shit !
---
Technically it's RP too :o
---
I remember my friend and I, getting up really early on the day of release, and went to buy the expansion before school started. It stayed in my backpack the whole day before I could play it, I was so excited.
---
TBC is the expansion I have the most fond memories of(splitted equal with vanilla). It takes me back to a much simpler time.
---
Got damn the nostalgia!
---
This is FrameXML... that is only UI elements
---
What spec did you use for arms?
---
&gt; General consensus is that if you need BOE, then you equip. 
---
That's not the general consensus at all.
---
Equipping a valuable twink item when you're expected to level and quickly outgrow it is silly. It's much more logical to sell the item and invest in something that will last you longer such as a mount or a pre-raid BIS item.
---
I would expect to see more hunters and druids on live servers. Alongside many warriors and rogues who wont make it to level 60.
---
This is my favourite set up so far. Just one monitor and a nice dark wood desk.
---
Just saw this. I'm getting too hyped. Something better happen this week.
---
With sharding, you'd only see 5 other people.
---
You have to learn swords though, at what point during leveling is the sensible point to learn it as i have to go to the undead city
---
Ugh this isnt true at all,  the game speed has changed, abilities changed everything has changed since vanilla.
---
You will instantly see if someone is good or not in vanilla because all your moves matter, in retail all classes can do everything, all can selfheal, mitigate damage, cc, even sprints.
---
Smells like virginity, smells good - I like it.
---
This isn't representative for all the classic players. This sub mostly consist of people that have played this game for a long time by now.
---
Just subscription. No need for BFA.
---
Horde. Warlock. Simple.
---
That can possible if you **only one** who plays in a server
---
But then everyone should be allowed to need imo
---
You could grind out rep to get enchanting formulas before anyone else. Farm crusader.
---
In the past, I stealth farmed Thorium in wintwrspring for arcane crystals, and would buy xmutes and sit on the arcanite bars.   I'd sell the ore off and use that to buy arcanite bars off the ah, as in a new economy, the price was fairly low.   Had a huge stockpile of them, once the demand grew and I could pretty much set my price 
---
Farm up fish, stonescale eels I think and nightfin.  
---
If you are a tank, and alchemist, you can sell tank services, and reserve the flask recepies.
---
Can't think of anything else ATM.
---
Thanks. Next you’ll tell me water is wet or the sky is blue.
---
This is amazing
---
Good edit !
---
AFAIK therr has been no official information on this yet. But they would be stupid if youd need BfA to play vanilla, a game with has about 10% of the content bfa has (quests, raids, dungeons, zones, items, mounts, flying, ...). 
---
My guess is that vanilla will be included in the current subacriptions. Like if you had wow once in your life, just subscribe and you can play. If you didnt have it, you maybe need to buy a digital vanilla key or so.
---
I love the smell of rotting corpses in the morning !
---
The only reason I don't like Undercity is because I get more lost there than in your mo... nah, I grew up, I'm better than that !!! :D
---
I hope he has permission to tease like this, otherwise blizz might not be so forthcoming with info next time.
---
I assume he has tho. Psyched!
---
Certainly, to go this fast on a populated server or launch you would need a mob tagger or be extremely lucky.
---
I'm leaning towards your reasoning. The items worth is high not because of its stats, but because of its high market value.
---
Now if a warrior or Rogue decided to roll need on it just to sell it, then that would be a different matter because clearly, they don't need intellect.
---
Imagine having gnomes in your raid ? A gnome tank !!!!!!
---
PTSD !
---
This
---
 **Thaurissan's Royal Scepter** is 1.10, phase 4.
---
Np!
---
Such a Shitshow
---
I give this one an 11/10.
---
It may be a small dream. But I’ve always wanted to play as a dwarf mage, idk why 👀
---
Paladin
---
thanks :)
---
Nice left half.
---
Water may make things wet. The sky is blue if there are no clouds and when the sun is up.
---
Anything more you wanted to know?
---
Yeah the fun factor should probably not be understated. Breaks the gameplay nicely sometimes into other stuff than killing 😁
---
All we know is Classic will require standard retail subscription. There has been no comment from any Blizzard representative regarding anything else.
---
Yes, all roll need on BoEs.
---
I don't know man...stacking agility for rogues and hunters and str for shamans seems so much better, and I'm never near 0 hp so I feel like stamina does nothing.
---
No profession is worth lvling as you lvl. You might get a small upgrade for a few levels but your time is better spent pushing 60. If you want to have those small upgrades occationally then why not? Point is your fine with quest rewards until 60.
---
It's still a good joke. Staged, or whatever.
---
Tyskerunge! :p
---
Oh, yikes that's a pretty local insult, thanks!
---
Full props for a great and optimised run - top shelf effort!
---
I believe mages are extremely strong until about level 20 and then they start to fall off.
---
You'll struggle to read text.
---
I'm pretty sure blizzard want the wow content creators to tease this. It creates hype for their product at no cost
---
&gt; If other people who dont need the items as much cant handle that, they are honestly just stupid morons, and provides more to the group if they just hit the road.
---
If your guild has to be corrupt in a video game, regarding arbitrary rewards that does not mean anything at all, then you're shit out of luck. You literally have the worst fucking leadership of all times.
---
I've raided since TBC, and we have always used council, and I can honestly only point out one person who was corrupt when handling loot. One guy over 10+ years. Normal people can actually act towards whats best for the group, believe it or not
---
The lack of a mouse pad is soooo triggering. Haha
---
Danke für Info. Hoffentlich wird es auch nur Deutsche servers sein so wie in live wow. Hab noch keine Infos gesehen das jemand darüber geschprochen hat.
---
Have a third faction that can pvp anyone including the faction itself. Obiously the main city would be Booty Bay.
---
The warrior in the group did not roll need because, presumably, he thought the clothies all intended to wear the item, so he was either being nice or he made a stupid move because he didn't realize that the item was worth a lot of gold.
---
He's not breaking the NDA by making vague posts like this.
---
I don't really care about money if a crafting profession gives a boost to leveling that you could feel. Leatherworking is so easy to keep up so I'm considering it, but looking at the recipes that you 100% get, they are a bit underwhelming.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g22KlFxBMEQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g22KlFxBMEQ)
---
No need for new retail. Just $15 a month, way better than NETFLIX.
---
Pls I can't take it anymore
---
No I’m pretty covered for super basic information.
---
The boots must stay on otherwise it’s very easy to slip.
---
Mine is to have all the mindless retail-fanboys shut their mouths and stop polluting the boards with their daily dose of crap on how to make Classic like Retail.
---
You people do realize that we want to get AWAY from retail, right?
---
I never made it to TBC. Sold my vanilla toon for like 200$. Regretted that short sighted decision but I reached my peak. Ready to go further than I was able to first time around. I want full BWL and ZG!
---
Green lvl 10ish wep to replace the grey. If you arnt stoked to get lvl 10 with that in your inventory, there is no hope.
---
Beta or Announcement on 15th May confirmed?
---
It is?  My friend won't play RP because he struggles with vocabulary and, as I understand it, feels he would struggle or even feel like his lack of knowledge would make him feel like an outcast in RP situations.  He also is intimidated by the daunting task of looking lore to follow allong with player driven plots, or the significance of the area he's RPing in and creating backstories for characters.
---
The thought that a server type with unique expectations and a player base expecting you to deliver or cater to those expectations would attract or dissuade others from joining, sounds right to me.  That's how inclusive groups and cliques work.
---
So, while I wouldn't argue RP servers are inherently more mature, some people have a disposition to believe so based on stigma which in turn makes perception into reality.
---
I cant even comprehend whats going on here. That and the lack of Monster Energy drinks.
---
Chiropractics isn’t medicine it’s not backed by any scientific principles, at best it’s an expensive massage at worse it would do a lot of damage.
---
Go see a physiotherapist not a snake oil salesmen.
---
No sugar tho??
---
Yes I agree, the user can place the buffs/debuffs at their own place of choice, or choose between two pre-determined spots, above or below player and target frame!
---
Had my beefy 25kg 19" flatscreen CRT back in the day none of this 15" stuff!
---
I'm optimistically hoping for both. Lol
---
Id argue if there is a twink he has the most right to need on it. I see needing on it to sell a step below that. And needing on it to use it for 5 levels and than stelling it to a merchant a step below that.
---
Good luck getting randoms on board with your moral system though. People are selfish and will need on it for gold anyway.
---
Link doesnt work..
---
I think the consensus view on these kind of situations changed during Vanilla WoW, simply because too many people either ninja'd or tricked their way into getting the item when people were new too naive. 
---
I remember a run I made in UBRS and Skullflame Shield dropped (https://www.wowhead.com/item=1168/skullflame-shield), and everyone rolled greed, to let the tanks have it, except for a Rogue that rolled need and of course won it.
---
It was a common situation that I think almost everyone that has played Vanilla WoW had experienced. To prevent similar situations from happening most people/groups that I have played with has the mindset that BoE = everyone that wants it can roll, it doesn't matter if they will use it or if they will sell it, since there will always be a scumbag that will try to ninja if he sees the opportunity.
---
You can play WoW without the latest expansion.
---
Source: I'm doing that right now.
---
You sir, made my day.
---
you can say that about any convenience feature. It's one of those things that hurts the other areas of the game if people have access to it. Just like how dungeon finder ruined having to find a group and travel to a dungeon. Sure, you can go ahead and find a group and travel a dungeon on retail, but since dungeon finder exists, you'll have pretty bad luck with that.
---
It's honestly because alli have shaman and horde have paladin now. 90% of my vanilla hate toward the alli stemmed from paladins and their bubbly cowardice.
---
Awesome. Does the map placement also have free choice?
---
nice video, would be awesome to have a x2 speed version of this too, so one can speed up the video via youtube to x4 and see the full route without skipping in ~19 mins.
---
Two gathering professions would be better for gear via gold.
---
Any of the stat items from level 20 onwards require a lot of shit you can’t make many of them will be quite expensive and in all honesty you are better off selling the leather once you hit level 30 or so.
---
Thunderfury ;_;
---
So many warlocks,now I can't feel special anymore. I was told there are barely any in Vanilla
---
Since nobody mentioned it yet. As soon as sword spec becomes available to you, swords become better than anything else. Until then it doesn’t matter, just get a slow mh and fast oh.
---
What was your in?
---
Yes, the user can move pretty much any frame to their own liking if they shift-click and drag them.   
---
I'm thinking about implementing some sort of "unlock" feature where the user can see "placeholder" frames and then move them however they want and at last "lock" them in to place.
---
Dude you saw an NDA between mrGM and Blizzard? What did it say? I can't believe you were there and got to read it!
---
Boe blue is all roll
---
What are you being these estimates off of? 
---
Private servers? The raw elitism coming from that cess-pool of min-maxers is astounding.
---
We cleared Naxx back in vanilla without spending anywhere close to 1k gold a night, or even 300. 
---
Key raid members did, and we pitched in to get what those people needed.
---
You all have to remember one thing.
---
Most people don't give a fuck about the zerg to 60.   
---
Most people don't give a fuck about clearing everything as soon as humanly possible.
---
So many people on this sub are just so fucking disillusioned I can barely comprehend it.
---
FLASK METAS? Chill the fuck out.
---
It's not like your statement had any more value, commenting on a poll that hadn't even reached 400 sample size, when it is likely that it will *at least* tripple within a reasonable time frame.
---
Same, man. I got a big ol' SSD and water cooled affair right now, and I'd drop it in a second to go back to my old wheezing Dell with its tiny CRT to play some Vanilla.
---
theres too much drama and too many poeple not following the proper etiquette of equipping an item. and the factor that there are some boe drops worth lots of gold i would state in die bginning of the dungeon if boe drops everyone rolls need. in the desrcibed case the winner changing his mind and not equipping is the asshole
---
The mage has the item, he is free to do what he wants and the priest is free to leave the group and block him if he wants. Each person is an individual with different morals and concept of right and wrong. 
---
If you feel like they ninja'd, block em and move on or continue on and finish the dungeon.
---
Yes, that's what I said. :)
---
Well, I might have been less than perfectly clear on the latest expansion thing. I'll correct it.
---
I remember still questing in blasted lands when this was going off such good times to remember. Was so fun playing at my friends house watching hit all the new content and seeing horde and alli ignore each other in favor of grinding the next quest in Outland.
---
That makes your friend less informed than the average player, not the population of RP servers smarter people.
---
&gt;That's how inclusive groups and cliques work.
---
No one was denying that RP server players are different from players on other game mode servers. **The argument was about whether or not they are more mature or intelligent.**
---
Since you admit yourself that your post does not concern the argument at hand in any way, may I inquire what the reasoning was behind writing it in the first place? Because right now, you are the posting-equivalent of a man walking into a conference about motor vehicles, shouting "DUCKS ARE BIRDS TOO YOU KNOW!"
---
Yes, that would be a problem. I haven't used a big screen tv, would that help in that matter? We have to get a real TV for movies and such anyway.  And the chat window can be made bigger of course.
---
Which part
---
I dunno about skill less. Just looking at the difference when I play in gold (average rank) in Overwatch  and GM, and comparing it to the average rank in CSGO (I think around low gold nova) and high ranks such as LE, the difference in skill in Overwatch is a far wider gap imo. It also took me a lot less time to reach a high rank in CS because aim can carry you incredibly far compared to OW where it cannot to the same extent.
---
I often hear that Overwatch requires little skill but having played a few competitive games to a high rank (OW, CS, League) I would argue that this is not the case. Although comparing to League is quite difficult because what is a high rank .. A majority of the playerbase is below plat yet people will still say that below diamond 2 is low rank so its not really comparable.
---
If you have to ask reddit this and don't either already know or know where to find the info, you won't be ahead of the curve.
---
It is though. Druids cap out on 4+ targets where Swipe lose its effectiveness. Engineering shield is just too strong.
---
I've always been of the mindset than any BoE item should be a FFA. It's the fairest thing to do as it stops opportunist ninjas and allows everyone a chance at all items. It's the only rule where someone can't forcibly change it on the fly in their favour; all other rules are subject to ninjas, "it's a bigger upgrade for me" or "you'll only use it for 5 levels" arguments. The only issue is people will never agree on a single rule.
---
That's the rule I'll be taking into Classic, and the Mage is under no obligation to give any group member "free gold" - which is what passing a BoE essentially is.
---

---
Someone made a video over killing me. That was great.
---
Scarab lord wouldn’t be so bad
---
Can you link me to that guide?
---
This day was awesome precisely because of what that image shows.
---
I miss the MMORPG. so much.
---
No. Alliance is preferred for raiding because the Blessings are better. That's how it was on vanilla.
---
I'd personally take private server data with a grain of salt.
---
I don't understand why this point is still argued. It's pretty simple, play what you like, but if others don't like what you're playing, then they aren't obligated to play with you and you will likely find less groups to play with. I don't get why there is more to it than that ? - it seems to be brought up constantly.
---
Whats the right height for a keyboard
---
vanilla wow was already a shit-music era.
---
90s is where it is,  bois!
---
Beta next week is pretty much 100% confirmed at this point. Towelliee said that he will put a timer on Monday, guess counting till Wednesday too
---
boe blue = all roll
---
A friend of me is using parsec to stream his pc to his tv. Maybe that could work for you too.
---
I was Alliance, and the minute the portal opened up on the vanilla side dozens of Hordies, that hadn’t yet paid for the expansion, all camped the steps leading up to the portal and killed all the Alliance players trying to get through. There was no flying back then of course, and you were auto-dismounted as you got near to the portal itself, so there was pretty much nothing that could be done. At the time it was the most annoyed I ever got with the game, however, looking, back on it I now find it hilarious. I mean it wasn’t anything that anyone would have thought about in beta. 
---
The ironic thing was that once you got through, a lot of the initial quests, where there were shared areas, Alliance and Horde were helping each other out. I’m sure there’s some kind of social commentary there.
---
We’ll see. This is the third poll I’ve seen in this subreddit alone which shows abnormally low hunter numbers due to the urban myth that hunters suck at some cliff point (generally said to be the very second AQ launches, which is just lmao).
---
What can I say, I find it entertaining seeing you obsessing over Asmongold and getting offended that people don’t like a video game the same as you. Your streams may be boring but your interactions on this website are fascinating especially considering the way you act when you’re a grown ass man.
---
Warlocks were consistently one of the least represented classes throughout the whole lifecycle of WoW, but always useful or top dps in raids and great in PvP. The sub members who tend to endgage in endgame are more likely to pick such class, but that doesn't represent the whole playerbase.
---
I’m probably playing warlock myself so a hunter, though i’m also playing a druid...
---
It's extremely naive that people think an NDA made by a corporation as large as ActiBlizz wouldn't cover vague posts/hints like this and what TipsOut has been doing. You can almost guarantee this is a breach, or he had permission - certainly *not* a loophole.
---
Interesting they didn't remove "Interact With Target" keybind. Maybe an accessibility issue.
---
Thank guys!
---
There are some in the fridge but I wasn't drinking any at this time :p
---
I've really wanted to tank as a warrior, but my love for priests since 2005 is too strong, so I'm pretty sure that's where I'm gonna end up
---
Agil and Str don't really increase your DPs all that much while leveling, you'll get more from good weapons and spirit
---
This is some weird US thing most people don't do.
---
What about gathering professions?
---
This fuckin guy lol
---
I was there. And then I was at the login screen. And then I was there. And then I was back at the login screen. And then I figured I could wait and stopped.
---
blow me u retards
---
First clip he's just standing there doing nothing as a garbage mage wastes Coc and frostnova. TOTAL OUTPLAY
---
For almost 24h i dont do anything, just pressing refresh and waiting for the confirmation...
---
We're on the same page. I just couldn't put my thoughts into words like you did, so thanks!
---
Well, now as game not game station which was bought out a few years later.
---
But the nice thing was that the charity stuff came WAY later than if you were just good enough to enter the respective raids.
---
My guild at the time voted to go into Black Temple after the T5 clear was required because they wanted better look and Kael was "too hard anyway".
---
Divorce inc. after she's corpse camping a low level for 3 hours and chain sapping people
---
Hunter. Aspect of the daze best.
---
Spoken like somebody that's never signed an NDA in his life.
---
I think that Hunter is quite unpopular among the more dedicated community, us tryhards if you will. But yeah, I reckon it'll be more popular among the casual crowd that has no idea whats good and whats not. As someone rolling a hunter come classic I do hope they're underrepresented. Easier raid spots and less competition for gear sounds good to me. Fingers crossed.
---
Yeah that's a good one
---
Lol damn it surnami.
---
I hope to level with friends at release, aiming for 12-14 hours in the first sitdown.
---
I plan to have pepmeals and drinks ready for atleast 3-4 days, aswell as a clean apartment and everything else I can think off, fixed ahead for time.
---
I still intent to keep on going to the gym however, gotta keep my metabolism going. :)
---
What? I don't care whether you are right or wrong. You commented on a poll with a very low sample size, which is expected to grow a lot if you just give it some time. Then you have the gall to accuse someone else of making a pointless comment. That's weird.
---
Just look at the numbers now. As sample size increase, they change. Low sample size = pointless.
---
uhm i'm EU and it's common knowledge that boe's are all roll.
---
for worthy items, that is. On not useful boe's it's best to talk in the group about it, but it's not a ninja looter or something if someone rolls on boe's.
---
It took me 3 and a half hours to get to lvl 7 with gnome mage... good job to you!
---
I now understand why Arthas did what he did.
---
Do you even have solid evidence that there even *is* an NDA?
---
So Alexensual was, as usual, throwing an obnoxious hysterical fit over nothing.
---
Implying he signed an NDA/got an embargo in the first place which I don't think he did (it would only apply to the people who went to the event and got briefed).
---
Far from reality but still nicely done.
---
There should be a way to use a tablet for a mirrored screen and just zoom in on stuff what you need reading
---
Yeah it is. If you don't need it as an upgrade, and you press "Need", it is ninjaing.
---
Just look at previous threads about this. "BoE = all Need" sure as fuck isn't some all-accepted standard. At most, you can say that there is no consensus.
---
If playing on the same server as a streamer is as big of a headache as people are claiming it is going to be, why not just wait a day or 2 for them to settle? Wait for them to get settled, and play on one of the extra realms that Blizzard is sure to open up.
---
2 Days of waiting. &gt; 30 days played time of perceived hell.
---
For every warrior main there will be hunter alt
---
^ this, why would you equip a lvl 19 twink item when you get a better green in 3 levels?
---
This is ninjaing if he doesn't give a re-roll. You can't roll to use, and then change your mind and sell it later. If he was gonna sell it, he should have rolled Greed, or asked the group about how they were gonna treat BoE drops so everyone was on the same page.
---
In Vanilla you can have a maximum of 3 pets though.
---
so, i played on vanilla pservers and it was that way, dunno about retail i haven't played that since TBC.
---
Talking about my experiences and it was like that everytime!
---
Im not waiting a second more than i have to :’(
---
Warlocks have a class quest there as well as paladins.
---
Okay, I have a gray level 2 sword. Now what?
---
No YT link ?
---
Pserver

Options for you:

1. Make sure your monitor isnt at an angle that is putting strain on your neck. Adjust the height of the monitor/chair so that it's at a natural position.
---
2. Get gel pads for your keyboard and mouse. If this is a pinched/constricted nerve it's most likely coming from the wrist and/or elbow. Try to protect the area that is in constant contact with your desk.
---
3. Try anti inflammatory like ibuprofen. Does it help?
---
4. Get a standing desk
---
5. Use a gamepad/xbox controller. Probably not optimal, but I'm sure you could figure out how to use like 8 spells at a time with a gamepad.
---
Is everyone here a streamer? I don’t get it.
---
Thanks alot for the post, now I've got to go to a physical rehabilitation clinic to walk again after sitting on the pot watching these videos.
---
Yes, the only way to play vanilla the last 5 years, so... guess that's a reasonable experience.
---
I'm really, really torn. On the one hand, I want to roll a warlock for my first character just like I did back then, but this time do it better. On the other hand, I want to roll a prot warrior because I always wanted to do classic tanking, and there is so much cool gear for warrior tanks, even without counting the unlikely thunderfury.
---
I think my best hope is finding a guild where I can primarily raid with my warlock but run a warrior for an alt run or something. I think my biggest fear is being too slow to get the warrior leveled up and geared after the warlock, and being late to get them into MC/Ony while everyone else is blasting through BWL or AQ even.
---
Dwarf shamans
---
Because everything Vanilla WoW on this reddit, regardless of what it is, is to be accepted and praised, no questions asked.  Mike Morhaime could of stitched that thing himself, by hand, and it could be the only one in existence. I would still say NO, that thing is horrific!
---
Of course weapons are essential. But in addition to decent weapons for shamans 7 str is already +1 more dps.
---
Alliance is the better faction for both organized PvE and organized PvP. They have paladins, so they are better, and nothing else changes that.
---
I would assume that they would release the names of the server list before hand so that people can plan on what realm they want to play on with their friends and stuff before launch, as well as for streamers to announce their choices. Personally as well, 4-6 realms of a given type seems insanely low, you're probably going to be looking at like 20-25 of each minimum and even that seems like a stretch, so it might not be as big of a deal as you'd think
---
Do you even have solid evidence that there *isn't* an NDA? 
---
Smdh... It's common knowledge/practice otherwise people would be leaking dates. Stop being so obtuse.
---
Yeee, and if this can be drawn out on PServers imagine when Live is here with all the interest it'll draw.
---
Funny thing was that if I remember correctly there was an option to choose Dwarf Mage in the beta.
---
Then again, Eve Online is all about pre-arranged fights nowadays. The genuine territorial conquests are long gone, since every region can offer everything to anyone. No need to fight, other than "content" for "streaming content creators".
---
ahhh  these  meme war  is  the best  this subreddit  got  since  the announcement on the blizzcon
---
Yeah, that's bullshit, correct me if I'm wrong, but shamans get crit from int, like most casters. If a shaman pulled that on you, you were scammed.
---
Any of those posters would do.
---
this meta war\^\^  keep up the  work  Bimms and provos!
---
Which class has the least amount of dependencies on pots/flasks? Is warlock or paladin worth it because of the free mounts?
---
sure looks that way.
---
link your clips, I wanna watch a master play
---
This oozes slavic.
---
No.
---
This is basically a list for all the addons people will make.
---
Already been posted
---
he is fine trust me
---
Are you using a power surge protector OP? If not, invest in one when you get your new PSU. They're cheap and very effective.
---
West Coast needs to realize there's more to beer than ipa's
---
Good video as always Bimss 👌😁
---
&gt;Please list some great and expansive content that differentiates it from the game 14 years ago
---
I don't need to because it isn't relevant to the point, you would realize that if you read the comment more carefully.
---
He is from England, so i don't think he participated in that Irvine summit. so i don't think he has any info first hand.
---
Also thats the same person that jebaited everyone into beta on download servers.
---
I’m not under any NDAs and nobody has told me anything 😇
---
It is worth to kill every mob in your path from a quest to another while leveling? I hear that the quests are never enough to keep you in the level range.
---
So this is about just as good as the dps meters on a patchwork spawn. Unrealistic and not to be taken seriously. Good luck tagging mobs with a rank 1 frostbolt on a new server.
---
I don't see how this narrows it down to May. I do think the 30th of something is significant. I'm just not yet convinced which month we're talking about here.
---
This is shockingly balanced so far
---
Tell everyone before you even get inside the plan is if a blue boe drops, everyone rolls need, just to save yourself potential drama once the run is going.  Some places take forever for group to get to so better to have that all clear before you get there and someone doesn't like it and leaves.
---
Fuck these streamer attention whores, seriously.
---
Hahaha ikr.. 😂
---
Such mediocre plays and yet people on here are mindblown 🤣
---
The skill floor on the other hand is much higher in classic
---
There will be addons for stuff like that. I recommend still using a keyboard tho, as controllers don't have enough buttons.
---
Listen, if you look at previous threads about this, you will probably see that there is no consensus. You don't need to believe me, you can go find these threads yourself and see how different people want to approach this.
---
Since there is no consensus, you can't assume that BoE = all need, since there is a loot system in the game already that is made to let people roll Need for stuff that is an upgrade. If you want to go with a "BoE = all need" rule set, you should specify that at the start of the run.
---
May 19th is the date you're looking for.
---
Healers are the least dependent on consumables.  No relevant flask (maybe titans on a couple of bosses in naxx while learning), and there are very few/if-any(?) consumables that boost +healing, only a few that boost +mana/5, and direct mana regen like demonic runes/mana pots are only used when needed (which doesn't happen much after gearing up).  Will have to use protection potions on everyone else for certain fights though.
---
Haha indeed, hemorrhoids incomming..
---
If the item is boe you roll for it no matter what. I made the horrible mistake of greed rolling on edgemasters handguards
---
Rogues can’t learn swords until level 10, so aim for buying a Feral Blade (24s7c) from one of several vendors (https://classicdb.ch/?item=4766#sold-by) then train swords from Woo Ping in Stormwind or Archibald in Undercity.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca
---
Might have to be more specific like what class will be your main, pvp, or raid class.
---
Besides that mrgm said he wasn't under and ndas. No. But proving a negative is virtually impossible, which is why in U.S. it's innocent until proven guilty. Because to prove that someone is innocent is very difficult. You don't have alibis for every second of your life etc
---
Need = Equip
---
Greed = Sell/Trade/Disenchant
---
The Mage is "free to do what he wants with it", in the same sense that everyone else is free to call him a gigantic arsehole, kick him from the group and tell everyone that he's a ninja.
---
Ya true, skinning is pretty much free coin as you lvl. No way I'd try to keep up with mining or herb until I had a mount, especially on a fresh server. I usually grab enchanting and ignore profs until 60 cuz you can farm things at 60 that sell for more than gathering mats. Tailoring pry also worth doing for the early mooncloth if nothing else.
---
Mail mats to alts... nominal gold fee
---
In what world will someone not be spawn camping them.
---
As vague and dumb as OPs post, this answer is equally as useless
---
I've never played on a fresh server and I just wondering what bloody way the market will be.
---
Is everything on the AH underpriced or overpriced. I would think people would have no money to buy BOE blues so selling then early is pointless?
---
Tbh I'm thrilled to be back to a game without vehicle combat.
---
I know there was minimal interaction with it from its introduction onward but it always felt terrible and not at all natural to how the game was programmed to be played. I have no idea what the thought process was behind its introduction.
---
Vanilla = ground mounts, BC = flying, in Wrath they were just like fuck it lets throw guns on these bad boys and see what happens. 
---
Sounds good on paper. Doesn't work.
---
Ah, fair point.
---
Love all these people in the comments saying "ya but unrealistic lolz" when you clearly put "on empty server" in the title.
---
That ambush ... wow
---
No one was denying that RP server players are different from players in other game mode servers, and those differences could never possibly include intelligence or maturity in any way for arbitrary reasons.
---
Hehe, gave me a good chuckle.  Speaking of maturity and intelligence; one day you'll understand how to talk to people when you're all grown up. Unfortunately, you're not mature enough for the conversation.
---
That's when you report them
---
Haha of course not :) i know it won't work in classic and this series is about raiding as cat dps and what things you need to consider when maximizing your dps
---
In the UK pretty much all coke is sugar free now :(
---
looks like you dont know what 100% is.
---
At this point we have rumors and nothing is 100% confirmed
---
It's because you're pointing out the obvious.
---
The burden of proof is on those who claim that there is an NDA. You can't prove that something doesn't exist.
---
This is the sort of pvp I like. Even they could say "there won't be BGs " and I would be even happier.
---
I see a razor naga, I like
---
Ferals are much more likely to be in the raid than a Boomkin because they can put up relatively competitive numbers. With powershifting Feral DPS isn't as far behind a pure DPS as you might think.
---
Bear Druids are great off tanks and in a couple of fights they may be the preferred tank. Resto is also a decent healer and no guild will turn down a skilled Resto Druid just because they are a Druid.
---
Regardless of spec though, guilds will always be on the lookout for Druids because people just don't play the class and they bring some nice utility.
---
And this is basically why I am ending up as a druid (probably).  Tank 5 mans and heal for raids.  I just have to pretend my heal spell is casting really slow for some reason.
---
Deluded. Whatever helps you sleep at night :)
---
I casually play in bed (laptop)
---
Hopefully this time around more people can actually be there and not get disconnected from the servers the whole time, I remember not being able to get near Silithus at all at that time :p.
---
My experience is that I get too much XP too fast, so I try to avoid killing mobs that aren't a part of a quest.
---
I want to get all quests for every dungeon, and it just sucks to do instances I am too high level for. IDK if that is representative, probably not.
---
A sunday?
---
Hm, but you have some sort of inside knowledge? Care to shed some light on where you get info, or maybe do even better, and say what happens on Wednesday?
---
In general yes. Even doing that, you'll be grinding at some points.
---
So many sapper charges
---
[Watch and weep.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
---
I believe you, i just acted the way i learned it. It's true that you hear alot of people arguing about it.
---
I heard that Blizzard said there won't be any RP-PvP realms at launch. Is this true?
---
Or they want enhancement gear
---
Honestly I just really liked this post - https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bmglpj/speculation_beta_will_be_announced_this_week/
---
Blizzard is a creature of habit. However they’re either not going to announce the date for the beta (it’ll just randomly come up) or they’ll do it either on the day or a day before or something! We’ll see. I don’t have any inside knowledge, even if I did. I would not be spilling it, I’ve got a bit more respect than that :)
---
It is 100% confirmed to be possible next week. :)
---
Just pray to god this guy and his guild aren't on your server or you're gonna have a bad time.
---
Don't assume that he won't be able to read text because of his age. He can get some binoculars
---
It was meant to be tinfoil hat poking at the implications of the vanilla being sugar free, but it seems your hands were tied
---
Block user? Yes.
---
Its EU vs American standards that is different, if you are eu talk with the group. In eu you should not need on things for gold over equip but that seems to be how American does it.
---
Then I guess he ruined it!
---
Alright, appreciate the response. I hope the guy is right!
---
Everybody and their mother is a "streamer" today, lmfao. Thinking they will make it. You won't, just stop it. Yikes.
---
Restoration Druids.
---
I saw that some people, when they get good gear, go 24-0-27 to heal. In my mind, a "normal" resto spec would be something like 5-0-46. In either spec, you probably go 5 points in Balance just because, but this spec has another 15 "worthless" points just to reach the 4 last points you take in that tree.
---
My question is just; is this a real spec? Are those 4 points that good, when you have a lot of spell crit?
---
I played a hunter in Vanilla. I didn't role a single alt until TBC. I absolutely loved the class. It has so much depth to it. I quit playing it the day they took away mana and only mained it again in 8.0-8.1. I plan to remake my Night Elf hunter, but as an alt this time.
---
I'm planning to main a Human paladin. I'm much more of a healer/support player now, so it fits with what I want to do. I rolled one on a pserver just to give it a try and I am absolutely dreading the leveling process. I know it will be well worth it.
---
Runetotem EU?
---
With sharding Classic will be pretty emtpy so this is not completely unrealistic.
---
MrGM wasn’t invited to Irvine and has been public about it. I think he just found a vanilla flavored coke and posted it.  
---
Everything posted on Twitter is not a subliminal message.
---
All these music videos and homages are just so damn cringy imo. Can't even make it through most of them.
---
Private servers have crazy populations and all the tops guilds and pvpers are on the same server. So I don't know if Classic will have battles as epic as these.
---
He was not invited to Irvine. He is just posted a vanilla flavored coke.
---
Druid all the way.
---
Loved this. I hit 58 on the day it released. The first expansion was the best I played.
---
Correct. You will bow to me when I'm right.
---
Kiddo, I know you are angry you lost the conversation so hard, but there is really no need to ridicule yourself further by lashing out at your superiors. Just stop posting, and your posts will be forgotten :-)
---
One day you will understand how to correlate data to determine causal relationships. But before you go into such daunting tasks, try basic logic first, you still seem to have work to do in that department.
---
Being able to name a lot of these items just by seeing the picture is why and I assume can’t wait for  classic. Items actually meant things back then. Nowadays you just get an upgrade from the RNG loot machine and you don’t even blink an eye.
---
Vanilla was so much better than everything that came after it.
---
Yes, that is unfortunately true. At this time, it looks like there will not be any of those.
---
Hope you guys get your server. Sucks to not get the type you want.
---
&gt;Did it just get confirmed????
---
That you fall hopelessly for the cheap clickbaits of online attention whores?
---
Yes, I think that was just adequately confirmed.
---
Thank you. I hotkeyed my action bars to F1 F2 etc. So I could switch between them quick. I still keyboard turned and all that. I will be setting things up differently this time around. Also wish I remembered how to climb to the top of iron forge.
---
announcement monday/tuesday, flagging for beta starts wednesday
---
You do realise that these guys know as much or as little as everyone else with access to google, and make a living of clickbaiting gullible idiots, right?
---
I hope so :)
---
Yea I agree. Did you see the keyboard turning? And I only had one combo.
---
Let her test some classes to lvl 10-20 and see what she likes.
---
this was the first step into WoWs decline
---
The Mage is fully within his rights to do with the item as he pleases.  
---
Everyone got a fair chance at the roll. Simple as that.
---
Fear ward is ally only as well right?
---
Actually you would always try to bring a hunter to UBRS  to kite General while you kill his adds. Especially when you were still equipped in blues and greens.
---
Not sure about all classes but as a hunter I think I kept my my T1 for at least a little bit as I didn't need sta increase and I liked the set bonuses.  Didn't last long though since by probably 62/63 I was in all new gear and began a whole new gearing process which I enjoyed.  T3 was the only set that you really kept the whole leveling process which is fine IMO.  Having raid gear also made hellfire much easier to level in compared to people with no gear who struggled on trash mobs.
---
&gt; postet
---
Provosorisk Norwegian confirmed
---
The title of the post literally says ‘empty server’.
---
Yeah. Twink items especially. Save it for later. Sell a few months in when The economy somewhat settles
---
&gt;That's not the general consensus at all.
---
You don't know that, unless you can show us a sizeable poll confirming that. Same as u/Karatag cannot prove that it is one. Either of you is basing his statement on opinion.
---
That being said, a lot of people will see it Karatags way, and ignore people who need for selling.
---
It's not a Tuesday...
---
release date starting 21st of july would be my dream, as I'm gonna have lots of time off for a few weeks then
---
Hehe. &lt;3
---
Blizzard invites content creators / influencers regularly. So you are wrong, they do in fact know stuff before us plebs.
---
&gt;hen that would be a different matter because clearly, they don't need intellect
---
You are cornering your own logic here.
---
If you are of the opinion that the worth of the item is in its market value (A) and that everyone needs gold (B), then from `A and B =&gt; C` with (C) being defined as "Everyone can need on BoE".
---
I hope they release it august, so I can be outisde this summer and do summer stuff!
---
One thing at a time. Summer is the best part of year, would be a shame if classic cancelled that out.
---
I mean when classic comes I would want to play every free minute..
---
Played all through bc and wotlk with 13-18 fps. I dont even know how
---
The Horde controlled the Portal on Sylvanas-EU.  No-one could pass.  For hours after the expansion dropped it was just us Paladins fighting the horde in Outland.  (Actually we all just quested after the melee at the portal :D)
---
September
---
🎵 **WHEN THE WINGED HUSSARS ARRIVED**
---
vanilla coca cola sounds nasty though
---
Guys, I understand the hype right now. But, come on! Just because some Classic Content Creator or Personality on Twitch tweets something or make a comment does not mean they are sending subliminal messages.  
---
Everyone just calm down and man your stations. Classic will come when it's ready!
---
Proof? None.
---
Premise rejected. Good bye.
---
for sylvanas!
---
Ret or dead, baby.
---
He is a boss late in MC, and you need to douse the runes before you fight him. Any reasonably well organized raid guild will be able to kill him for sure, no worries.
---
I fucking wish
---
Since people have adequately described what to do here, I'll just add another little thing:
---
***Always*** drop a few lines at the start of the run about these things. Clarify if someone is rolling for a different spec, what the BoE need/greed rules are, if anything is reserved etc. Saves you a load of BS down the line or potentially someone ragequitting the run halfway through.
---
I agree. Its practically impossible to die while doing ordinary quests.
---
VG VVS
---
Which won't happen because you're wrong. They're not launching a beta on a Sunday, Tips' Game of Thrones hint was just that the beta would be out before then and he and several others have all pretty heavily hinted that it's on Weds.
---
MrGM is given ULTIMATE BLIZZARD INFORMATION since he is a spy infiltrating blizzard .
---
Mage!
---
The most powerful gear that drops off KT in Naxx was 92 ilvl.  TBC heroic dungeons had 110 ilvl gear.
---
If you want to know anything about feral DPS look up Shedothecat on youtube. He is the best in the world by a lot.
---
I have never played hunter (in any version of WoW). Do I need to keep taming pets in order to learn new skills for my current pet? And how about levels of the same skill ?
---
I hope it's still gonna feel kinda crowded even with sharding
---
Are you trolling or are you really that stupid?
---
I'm hoping tukui.org makes elvui for classic. I use it for modern wow and would love to use it for classic as well. Otherwise I might go woth something similar.
---
Great setup
---
Oh by the Seven...can't a man make a joke or two these days, without some wannabe smartass coming along, proving that he can in fact be annoying af?
---
Oh really, Hunters can kite Drakkisath? Wow, Thanks, I didn't know that after helping a metric arseton of recruits through that dungeon during Vanilla. I mean, yes, I do know every single rat in there by name and have done the kiting strat, the fear strat, the bakckjump strat and the OT strat of the Drakkisath fight, but thanks so much for explaining to me how the world works.
---
there’s a ps that does this actually. don’t think i can say the name cause tos but yea. anyone can kill anyone and you can loot some of their stuff. if your reputation gets low enough u become an outlaw and the city is booty bay
---
All these people who you can tell have never played vanilla and get all their experience from private servers...
---
It really depends on how the meta ends up shaking out for classic. Will it truly be nobody playing except for the super hard core private server audience? Because if not, most people aren’t going to min max nearly so hard, it genuinely just was not needed to clear content and most guild leaders will just be happy to have a consistent 30 man core logging in every raid night.
---
It is very true. In a raid environment the game is much more simple.
---
I think ranks are going to go to people with a lot of spare time. I have a daughter and I'm pretty sure I will never be able to achieve R13 if I want to spend time with my family and holding down a job.
---
Wow really got you triggered
---
I mean in some respects he is correct in that players who have excelled previously in retail already have a good basis for Vanilla, it's just a case of putting the gamesense into practice. 
---
For the average player though, we won't attain this gear and for Warrior it is as much about their gear as it it about their skill. Can be as good as you like but if your a blue warrior vs a R14 rogue your getting chopped.
---
The word you are looking for is "annoyed", and if that is something you are proud of, then your life must really suck.
---
Beta announcement this week.
---
Beta running from late May - early June lasting somewhere between a beta weekend and two weeks.
---
Release date is July 16.
---
That’s what I’m thinking but I’m running on like 90% wishful thinking at this point.
---
Where did he mention streaming lol? He's just showing us his setup.
---
Vanilla had better population than PServers, and Classic undoubtedly will have higher population.  You're dense to think otherwise.
---
Private servers are about 5-10x the pop of an actual vanilla server, and almost every item is underpriced, to the point of people selling for below vendor price, especially for early level herbs/ore/skins.
---
Almost everyone on pservers raid so raid consumes are likely overpriced. But I dunno. I think things will be way more balanced in time. Early on it will be hard to sell anything due to people saving gold for mounts and other things.
---
Once DM launches, expect a massive influx of gold. The thing is a lot of this will be generated out of thin air so I'm not sure how this will affect the economy.
---
I will vendor everything early on, maybe DE greens to save for when prices spike.
---
Thank you Frost :)
---
I don't need a poll to prove logic. Claiming that you're the most important person in the group and should be the one to equip a valuable BoE that you'll replace in a few levels when anyone else in the group could sell it to purchase something like their mount, class skills, or anything more useful is just pure greed. I don't need a poll that asks if the majority of people would rather group with a fair people who distribute loot evenly vs. some entitled kid who thinks he should have everything just because he can equip it.
---
I do agree with you there! I love being outside too, and I got IRL stuff to finish up which would take about a month and a half before I can completely no life.
---
 However, even if I would want a later release my heart goes out to all of these people that thought they'd play it during their vacation. Be it a student or a working adult. I'm flexible atm but I know a lot of people aren't which is why I think a release that late would be really really sad.
---
NA players more civilized than EU? Interesting.
---
Majordomo Executus' treasure chest drops either one Petrified Leaf (Hunter quest) or one Eye of Divinity (Priest quest) when you defeat him. That means one person can start their quest each week.
---
Whatever dude
---
Night Elf if Ally, and Tauren if Horde. 
---
We haven’t decided yet.
---
I had an old pc tower and just connected it to a tv with hdmi. Works fine
---
Why see there so many paladins so far? Does everyone really want to raid heal?
---
Never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever attempt to save money on a PSU. I have no wisdom to share in this world, but never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever attempt to save money on a PSU.
---
it's not bad dude
---
I agree with this idea. I mean I see people saying ridiculous dates like September or August.... How are we supposed to have a classic summer when it comes out after summer that makes no sense.
---
Nice, you’ve helped me narrow down my choice. Druid is still on the table bc I like their mobility and tankiness.
---
Man those big fights.... I just hope Blizzard Server's will be able to handle it because BFA couldnt even handle fairly small sized battles
---
Ayy i see myself on the brm clip, fucking light of elune
---
All you listed was a “Modern client” but blizzard has literally never changed their engine
---
Except streamers are just saying 'hints' because it gets them views/money. MrGM didn't even go to Blizzard, and he said so. Don't believe everything these attention whores say. You are their product.
---
Not entirely true either. Boss mechanics are extraordinarily more complex in modern WoW, but in classic you have the twists of resource and threat management. Newly dinged 60 healers will oom themselves in 5 casts. Every DPS has their damage capped by the tank, especially challenging in situations with ads. There's a lot less mechanical demand, but a lot more situational decision-making.
---
Mainly private servers right now. It happens on both though.
---
He seems to not know the difference between "proof" and "evidence" as well.... :/
---
Like this? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWtpK1U7Fgw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWtpK1U7Fgw)
---
Where is this? I have 120 for it...
---
There’s been several clips posted this past week of content creators alluding to an event in Irvine and teasing some sort of announcement in the near future.  But honesty, I don’t care if you believe me because I’m here to talk about classic wow and have fun, not be a jerk to people on the internet.
---
they originally planned on it. dwarf mage was in beta and in the official hand book too i think but for obvious reasons it didn’t make the cut haha. mage already dumped on rogue and warrior, stoneform on a mage made them invincible in pvp. polymorph &gt; stoneform &gt; full bandage
---
At first glance I read:
---
&gt; I'm optimistically hoping for death. Lol
---
Its like taking a shower after years of wallowing in the mud.  Beautiful to watch all that dirt come off.
---
20th of August, mark my words.
---
I might try that. I have a Logitech USB game pad.
---
Has to be a troll right? I refuse to believe that anyone can be this stupid.
---
Not if you care about lore. If thought BFA had messy character development, at least it TRIED. BC just threw character after character from the lore under the bus as a raid boss.
---
 The morally ambiguous Illidan? Insane and cruel overlord now. The naive, yet vengeful Kael’thas? A 1-dimensional servant of the Legion. Lady Vashj, the only good-ish naga we’ve ever seen? Killed off with no fanfare. Kargath Bladefist, one of the Horde’s original founders? An insane fel orc now (to say nothing of what WoD did to him). 
---
It took Legion’s huge retcons to make Illidan’s story make even a bit of sense.
---
You are a lame and the sight of your name makes me cringe
---
I played it but I'd prefer it the ability system wasn't changed there. Interesting twist but not my cup of tea.
---
Eat shit? Yes.
---
Omg that was such a great day!  I was in that mob on my server too!
---

I can recommend the Corsair K63 lapboard, works great when I play Warframe.

The mouse I'm using is the Logitech g305, with 125hz poll rate set in the software.

With the poll rate set this way I've not had to change the battery since I bought it a year ago.

It's noy even summer yet pretty premature despair there bud

"On the same server"
---
Do you think there is any way around it?
---
Why would you infer the literal opposite meaning
---
... Are you serious?  You're right, I can't believe you're that stupid.
---
Make sure to check the launcher regularly too (where you switch between accounts and PTR etc). The BfA beta invitation email came like a month after I actually had access to it.
---
It's simple, I see Towelliee, I downvote :^)
---
Female dwarf reppin'
---
This is amazing news... It was going to happen anyway and it happened before anything was out. What if it happened on release?
---
yep it was fun at first but once u realize everyone at max runs the same build (literally) it isn’t fun anymore. everyone titans gripping 2 handers with quadrupole crusader enchants lol kinda a shit show
---
Cant wait for all the undead lowlives trying to disrupt alliance
---
Hey, I don't know Towelliee and I'm not defending him, but please reconsider being rude to people like that, especially on the Internet. It's really not nice to call someone out like that. Sometimes even one person being mean to you like that can ruin your day or even week.

that big fucking thing in the middle of the ocean was planned to be something

that unaccessible mountain area above Origimmar that people get banned from going into.

The 40 man raid hidden in Stratholme
---
UBRS being, what? 25 man raid? or 15?
---
There was tons of shit planned than all of a sudden it all got ceased and BC became the new primary development.

I’m pretty sure Europe has an uncomfortable history with concentration camps, digital or otherwise.

Is there an option for “i want to play so many things and it’s killing me to choose just one?” I need that option
---
What's wrong with it? He explicitly said he hasn't watched it, perhaps means to in the future, and just wants to ask something about the video.
---
Heard someone say he thought (thought, not knew) that it would launch on the same day as WoW did back so many years ago.  Supposed to be in August but i dnno. Just thought it might make sense in a way.
---
Nope, beta runs till late August, game comes out last week in August or early September. Blizz will want to be able to talk about Classic being recently released at Blizzcon.
---
No, no. You're using that phrase incorrectly.
---
That turned into Classic WoW. So you're essentially saying OP is right and we should have changes.
---
It's always some kind of a seesaw, some people see a certain item more worthy to equip, the others see money potential. You can arguments from both sides to prove your point.
---
Server economy is another factor to figure in and not all players are keeping track of that, just like twink bis item lists. Similarly there is nothing you could do if the guy who won an item potentially worth hundreds of gold equipped it just to vendor it 5 levels later. You did the /roll and you lost, just accept it and move on, what this guy is going to do with this item is not your concern.
---
I am not sure if you did understand from my original post that twink items belong to the "prominent item" list (Although it was not an explicit statement) and most likely will be needed by everyone for AH. 
---
But if you keep on needing on mediocre BOE's then you may get asked to equip them or stop behaving like a greedy kid.
---
What monitors are those?
---
The sheer variety in armour and weapons was great, Clown sets all around
---
That is true.
---
IDK alot of things that are important to being good in vanilla don't really apply to retail lol
---
If you believe the teasers then it seems like beta might start next week. Maybe even Wednesday like this post suggests.
---
Tips mentioned people having to multitask during the GoT finale (May 19th).
---
Soontember
---
Every guild will be running MC for alt gear/TF.  They will run Ony to get heads.  They will farm BWL for the dfts/rejuvs.  
---
It matters very little how fast you level, all content will be relevant
---
Precisely. Downvoted to oblivion anyway.
---
Grand! Thanks for the reply and guide. Feral4life
---
dont say things like that.
---
WoW originally released in November.
---
Thanks pal.
---
Ah yes the summer release during winter
---
Might have been a bit premature, up to 9.55% now.
---
Or February on Europe. :P
---
Thank u m8! Thats what u get when your're old school and only reading forums i guess ;)
---
I doubt it. Blizzard doesn't care about E3 and BlizzCon and GamesCom are too far away. They will just post a Bluepost with the Releasedate.
---
The more you spread this, the more ppl will join:) already 42 on "my" server
---
It is kind of surprising. I guess it makes some sense in that RP-PvP was added later in Vanilla, so not launching with them is at least consistent with the real experience. I started playing Vanilla around 1.8 when Lightninghoof was new.
---
I'll be rolling on a PvP server in that case as that is the more important aspect of the ruleset to me. It is sad though. I don't anticipate switching if they do add RP-PvP later on in Classic.
---
How is this handled?  Does the person being run through wait at the entrance?  Do they see the items that drop from that far away?
---
Not 100%, either a leaf or priest eye drops from the chest
---
There is a good chance we'll know it next week.
---
This is true, playing your class well is basic as fuck. The big difference between good players is always gonna be who can be bothered farming/crafting those spell reflect trinkets, random ass low lvl trinket that can stun or root, lifegiving gem from BWL, stuff like that. If you have those then you'll shit on anyone who doesnt have them, this isnt skill based. Vanilla pvp is an engineering/consumable/trinket fiesta. This is why I think arenas was a really good skill based system that rewarded gear based on how good you are at the game, not based on how much time you spend in the game. Sure there were some really strong comps but if you were a good player with a good comp (every class had a glad viable comp) then you would have access to the best pvp gear.
---
Why does it look like his camera is further away than max-distance?
---
I got the added advantage of being able to play at work. Weekends are probably a no-go though, i’m unsure how mental the rank 10+ grind is, i will have days that i won’t be able to play, but i’ll have weeks were i can play 4 10hr nights + some days where i’m awake and can play for 4-5hrs. 
---
Of course, this is all irrelevant if i break down and play 3classes at the same time because of my condition (altoholisme)
---
Still deciding between Human, Night Elf and Dwarf.
---
&gt;What's wrong with it? 
---
It was fairly clearly meant to be condescending.
---
It reads as: "Oh *another* Feral guide, I won't watch it, but I'll assume he's some idiot."
---
Either human or night elf depending on what healer I roll.
---
Stuff like that happened all the time. I never gave a fuck, because if you cared about minor shit you would really have no fun in Dungeons. 
---
I roll Need on Items I actually need for my current Character and Greed on the rest.
---
I prefer Pepsi. Coke is too carbonated. You take a drink and get a mouthful of fizz. Gross
---
What’s better for gold farming - hunter in Mara or Mage AoE in DM? I think hunter wins if solo tribute runs are functioning, but not sure otherwise? Are there any other gold farms that equal or beat those?
---
This is all wrong, you make money by vendoring the blues that you make. You can also disenchant those blues for enchanting materials (if they're more expensive).
---
So few spells to slot and hotkey. Must be nice.
---
*cries in shaman*
---
Enchanting is useless for Leveling. You will never have enough Materials to Enchant anything somewhat useful. Engi is the same, how the fuck are you going to get all the Mats to Level it? 
---
I will take Tailoring and Skinning I think. Maybe Mining instead of Skinning and then keep all the Mats and use it to Level Engineering at 60.
---
SUPPORT CLASS?  I'm rolling on your plate, leather and mail.
---
I think I’ll roll hunter simply because my priorities are different in my 30s and having a relatively chill leveling experience sounds pretty appealing.
---
have they ever defined 'summer' as late august, or anything similar. surely they know that's outrageous and wouldn't have said summer if they didn't mean it
---
And it was death by a thousand cuts.  Every little QoL thing they added seemed good and reasonable at the time, but their cumulative effect completely changed the game for the worse.
---
Hell yeah, why not.
---
Warlock curses are very high on the list imho.
---
Leave no greenskin alive!
---
The massive fight in the video will not be possible on Classic. both Legion and BFA have proven that.
---
Summer in AUSTRALIA tho
---
&gt;  that has no idea whats good and whats not
---
https://youtu.be/u0wciSPO9zg?t=360
---
You mean the third best DPS for MC at the time?  Yeah, what's good and not.  Also tranq shot, extremely important, and **very** good.
---
You still only need 2-3 per raid though.
---
I still remember how goddamn laggy it was there. Good times.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Wait a second, the classic oceanic servers won't be based in Aus?
---
Interesting facts about the realm:
---
* Memento Mori was founded here before migrating to Frostmane because the server was too popular and had long queues
---
* A lot of the WoW exploration videos were started on this realm by the Nogg-Aholic community (see Dopefish)
---
* The famous Razadin was the second Blood Elf paladin EU wide to ding 70 and also the first one on the server to ding 70 with the new races and the second fastest only was lvl 51.
---
* The famous Cableguy was ranked as one of the best druids on the server after only one season. He was one of the five players in the team WE RLY CARE (Enough to state we care in our name) that reached the final of Cyclone Turnament in midseason 3. Cableguy performed also good in PvE, which led to him beeing recruited by SK-Gamings World of Warcraft PvE team.
---

---
This. Except 16th.
---
I can tell most who voted paladins will get a surprise to see how much ret sucks
---
I’ll play it, but I won’t invest serious time in it. I don’t want to get attached to my character if he’ll be deleted in a month
---
If I would get a beta key I would just log on and try some things out. Find my favorite graphics settings etc. But I wouldn't really play the game.
---
See, just go with hunter as you're already trying to justify it as a choice
---
That looks so stupid. Pvp is for children
---
Mine silver ore, don't smelt it, sell it on AH for those too lazy to mine and because silver nodes are rare. Also, buy out anyone undercutting you, have fun with your gold pile!
---
What would a beast know of honour?
---
Rogues will out DPS warriors until bwl, even then rogues will beat warriors in DPS on certain bosses.
---
I think he replayed it to show the stun resist/out of range grenade hit.
---
I feels like the sub becomes less wholesome the closer the release date we come. I saw some people shitting on him cause he would move on to retail wow after some time. Do you need to quit your job, ditch your girlfriend, make a pact with Satan and delete every game you own except classic to become accepted by this sub?
---
What speakers are they?
---
Getting this one next week: APC Back-UPS BX 950VA
---
Jealous?
---
I don't understand what I'm looking at.
---
Large AoE packs don't really last long enough for that to really matter. The point of engineering is just to tag them all so you generate rage and so they don't destroy a healer.
---
The only situation where that could ever matter is on Garr. Warriors can solo tank the 8 adds better than a Druid can.
---
Fake truth?
---
On Deathwing, we used to have a guy named Headhunter. He literally controlled the AH from the beginning of vanilla to the end of BC. One guy. He capped out on gold on a ton of characters. It was both frustrating and awe-inspiring at the same time.
---
I'll be happy if it releases with enough time to enjoy Hallows End - I miss that holiday so much
---
I have bought superb quality PSU, be quiet! Straight Power 11 850W
---
If you use that emoji and you are male, it’s indicative on your taking other males up your asshole.
---
More like they want to keep it in to prevent people trolling by standing on questgivers, mailboxes, etc.
---
That would break my heart
---
So we're you here to be excited for classic wow or to just speculate on how classic wow will not be fun due to how another game plays?
---
Definitely mage as that was my main and I think I will dabble in priest and rogue on a PvP server
---
I will agree that Thunderfury puts Warriors on another level. But at the same time, if you're a Druid and you're trying to tank instead of a Warrior that has Thunderfury, then you're doing it wrong.
---
Druids are not better primary tanks than Warriors. They are better off-tanks.
---
 Getting this UPS next week: APC Back-UPS BX 950VA

https://www.wow-professions.com/guides/vanilla-engineering-leveling
---
I'm kinda torn between a mage and a druid right now. On the other hand, I want to play mage because it's my favourite class and main in retail content and I'm interested in pvp. On the other though, I'm also interested in picking up healing in pve, and mages obviously can't do that and feral pvp looks kinda fun. Any thoughts?
---
Youre meant to pour it over ice which dilutes it a little and also reduces the carbonation.
---
Seriously.....LOOK I FLIPPED MONITORS I AM SODAPOPPIN
---
They start to suck at raid dps after a certain point, this isn't debated by anyone who has played the game.
---
For me I started vanilla in the months leading up to TBC, I wanted a blood elf paladin so bad so I played a human paladin as “practice” and got to level 20 or so. Then rolling BE the area was completely packed with new characters and I couldn’t even quest for days
---
"STORM THE PORTAL!"
---
The Shatered hand server blade
---
Bottom line
---
Keep reading posts.....you missed some essential stuff
---
I understand that part.  But it sounds like the above posters we're talking about people paying to come along for specific gear and I'm wondering how that works.
---
It's kind of a moot point. If you have a main tank Warrior who is popping engineering consumables, then Druids shouldn't be competing with him in the first place. Druids are off-tanks, not main tanks. 
---
My point is that Druids definitely do not struggle to tank on 4-6 mob packs.
---
blizzard canceled gamescom, they wont partake
---
Most I'd do is 1-10, but I'm confident with those areas anyway. I might just wait it out.
---
So happy I was a part of that.
---
Yeah sure if you have a hunter following you the whole time. How much are you paying him
---
I get what your saying, but summer is till sep 21st. Plus the fact that they wont ever release classic close to the bfa patch. People thinking classic will release prior late august are beyond reasonably delusional.
---
See i just say what i heard some guy said and didn’t fact check anything as i tried to make clear in my initial comment.
---
Eww, HP server. Take it outside.
---
True. Although thats only with plastic bottles and cans. Glass-bottle coke is the best out of all imo
---
Early on Rogues are equal if not better than Fury Warriors. And you need Rogues for Depression room. The more you have the easier you'll get through that hellhole.
---
Warrior dps spirals out of control in late AQ/Naxx when they become way overgeared. Rogues do not scale as well so they start to fall behind but are still top tier dps.
---
It doesn't work, people can't come close enough to roll on items before lvl 60, so there's not much point.
---
The only thing I would take is a rogue or druid that wants the blackrock ring. But that's definitely not reliable income compared to semling the loot.
---
What is the most effective way to make gold as a holy priest without respeccing to shadow to farm? I plan on grabbing herbalism and alchemy while also leveling cooking/fishing. Are those going to be my best gold makers or should I plan on Holy Nova AOE grinding?
---
You sound just as shocked as me. We should kiss.
---
Why wouldn't they release them at the same time? Blizz just wants the sub count to be higher.
---
This should be downvoted to hell. Fuck this loser. Agree or disagree, we all know this dork would never say that without the anonymity of the internet.
---
Gotcha, so there's a max range.  Thanks for the info.
---
Hey there, im making tauren as my first race (no matter what class) im wondering that do i need see thunderbluff flightpath or is it allready known.
---
Im not saying classic wont be fun. Just huge battles like this is only possible on private servers. These kind of battles have never been possible on blizzards servers.
---
Unless I'm missing something, you can hit a lot more than 3-5 with a pre-casted sapper charge.
---
So wtf is wrong with the results.
---
Lmao. Like idk what youre trying to defend...
---
Hes fucking including clips of him just mashing shit geared players that arent even PvP specced. Look at the Arathi clip, dude has his frost reflector trinket on and the mage is fucking arcane specced. Like sick dude you shit on some dude with way less gear (because you stinkchaired and played 80% of the time for the first month of the server and got R14)
---
I don’t see how mid July vs late August is that much of a difference for a presentation in November nor do I see the beta running that long as it’s a game engine for an already released game so there’s not nearly as much to actually test.
---
I wonder how classic will tackle the potential devilsaur monopoly. I've heard people say that there was bans handed out in vanilla for engaged in this sort of activity. But it's majorly difficult to monitor.
---
If I have an Alt it'll likely be a Hunter (maybe Warlock though), but I don't think I'll have time for an alt.
---
Guys I’ve played with since Vanilla. We’ve been played other games for the last decade and a half and will be returning for classic.
---
I can’t imagine them alluding to having a ‘classic summer’ if they release it the last week of summer.
---
Not a single flightpath/master is unlocked upon creating a fresh character in Vanilla. So make sure you go talk to each Flight Master as soon as you're near an area that has one. Also just an FYI, the only flight master in Mulgore is, in fact, in Thunder Bluff.
---
Mind your step when you go on the elevators!
---
This is why I'll likely play a race/class I'm not that into.
---
Cause you potentially lose those that want to experience the bfa patch too. They'll release it in perfect timing with people getting bored from bfa again, which is about 2-3 months after it releases. That's when classic will launch. You dont have to believe me, you dont have to like it, just mark my words, cause everyone hoping for a july release is in for a huge disappointment.
---
Personally i dont even think aug, my bet is on between 3rd-21st sep.
---
July is just pure wishful thinking tho, wishes that wont come true.
---
Honestly I don't see why not. Those that want classic the most obviously give no shits about retail. And sure, retail players might want to try classic and even end up staying - but they can do it any time they want after 8.2. This potentially reduces a huge short term tourism spike and tapers it off smoother.
---
Hmm I could see it.  Maybe an announcement Wednesday and beta this upcoming  weekend...that would be amazing.
---
The big question I have is how long will the beta be.  I could see it just being a weekend, I could see it being a month.  There’s just no real precedent for a game like this from blizzard to go on.
---
Most of the time you will get better rewards from quests and dungeons than you can craft at the current level, and except for very specific items (azure pieces for mages comes to mind), what you can craft will only be a marginal upgrade for a few levels. 
---
Having a crafting profession for gear while levelling is almost entirely useless in my experience. You pick up the profession so you can get use out of it at end game, and level it along with your character because that is more fun than doing it all at 60. It's not going to really give you any benefit while levelling, just cost you time and money.
---
A week ago I was all decided not to play on undocumented servers and beta. This weekbI was weak and got on a server. The hype just doubled. So te, give me beta charlie zulu anything
---
I like this a lot, I'll use this! Are the portraits customizable too?
---
A customizable mini map would be great too. Square and everything removable (N, time, the zone ribbon).
---
Looking through screen shots:
---
 - hide bags and the mini bar
---
 - default World Map option but cleared (so no shadows)
---
Very clean but Blizz look/design. I like it.
---
Legit though, 8.0 BM Hunter was dope.
---
Because they are
---
n00b
---
People are putting WAY to much weight into 'a classic summer'. Summer simply is a timespan from a business pov, nothing else lol.
---
I also made a really [cringy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfwdTKzSVE) back in the day, totally vurtne knockoff. I'm ashamed to look at it nowadays.
---
There's a video on youtube of a warrior pulling 2k dps on Patchwerk
---
The top 3 classes I want to play are all at the bottom :(
---
Do you have any inside information or are you just an overly confident blowhard?
---
Why not
---
These weren't possible in vanilla. He's right. The server would crash and be down for hours sometimes.
---
But pve is for tough badasses am I right buddy?
---
My favorite race is undead but I like Alliance more. All friends are going ally so dwarf it is
---
Do you think that everybody dislikes healing?
---
Or instead of being a smartass you could share what you know :P Alternatively just ignore the post.
---
Granted I do data visualization for a profession, but the chart provided is a perfect example for why pie charts are largely useless. Human eye has tremendous difficulty deciphering the relative sizes of the slices.
---
Hamarosan™️
---
I don’t think I have ever had it from glass
---
Overly confident blowhard right here. Confidence gained through logical thinking and somewhat reasonable knowledge about how businesses operate. No offense tho, like i said, no1 has to believe.
---
It’s not about testing. It’s about building up hype. Streamers will be playing the shit out of their beta, people will be getting hyped. It’s months of advertising for their new game.
---
At 60 duo farming dire maul is very profitable
---
There is a dead zone, you know?
---
Yeah no.  You don’t tell your customers they’ll be enjoying something during a timeframe only to not release it in that timeframe.  If you’re a restaurant and you have a ‘nightly special’ you don’t only run that special 5 minutes before close because it’s still technically at night.  
---
Don’t get me wrong, the ‘classic summer’ comment is hardly ironclad but I just can’t see them saying that if we didn’t get it early-mid summer.
---
You can already play everything except BfA on retail with just a subscription. You no longer need to buy old expansion packs. So vanilla will almost certainly be included in that.
---
You should try. It's actually kinda insane, like how should that make a difference right? Idk either, magic probably. But it's a given that coke outta those 0.3L glass bottles taste way better than plasticbottle coke
---
Guessing its the same as the front stabbing crap?
---
I dont believe the 24-0-27 build is ‘based around’ crit even though it benefits from it. The build excels at using the most efficient Healing Touch rank and then spaming those heals. It does especially well with the bonus mana regen while casting talents and they even get a safety instant cast nuke.
---
For party/raid healing as a Druid you may want to do more of the rejuv/regro/SM build just to learn healing as the class and rejuv is nice for raidwide healing with incoming blanket damage, but it is expensive and you can end up over healing easily. As you said, when you get better gear and are comfortable using correct ranks of HT in raids and not getting sniped then you can go 24-0-27.
---
What does it even have to do with SJW? You are mixing a lot of concepts dude
---
If you're after the most good out of your boes etc you're going to have to wait at least a couple months for not only the hard-core players to start getting raw gold but also the main chunk of the levelling players to hit 60
---
Send it all to a bank alt for a while
---
Yeah, my sparring buddy used to back out of that to range me, it's not that large
---
Combat ress is nothing compared to Faerie Fire dmg boost and innervating the best healer.
---
The similar rule goes to shamans and paladins. The difference between having one or zero is huge. Classic is not a penis meter game. Numbers are important but unique buffs and utilities can greatly boost the raid dmg/healing as a whole. Not just your number in the ranking.
---
Rogue and *subpar dps* lmfaooooooo that's really not how it is, they have complete control over their threat and early game beat warriors because of their amazing talents, also have fun trying to gear 15 warriors and DE all that rogue tier gear.
---
Hunters are good early on and actually can beat mages in MC, they just don't scale up to stay relevant in at least 2 raid spots because of tranq shot and kiting.
---
I’d assume the rest of us aren’t looking at the IPA section of the menu
---
I was holy pal and constantly #1 on effective healing and total healing. I was even undergeared for the most part. Our guild went about half way through naxx, I out healed most bosses to that point.  So I wouldn't say priest is best, just a better raid healer, for top teir King dick heals on your main tank, roll a pally =)
---
The nostalgia. Can’t ... take it.
---
i've said it many times before, and i want u to all save this message. its being announced for august 27th with a ragnaros statue in the collectors edition
---
Careful, you’re poking at the horde circlejerk in this sub.
---
Monkeynews is a direct showcase of vanilla's skill factor.
---
It's more about intricacies and game knowledge than raw APM or coordination.
---
Being able to deadzone kite both warriors, druids and hunters effectively, learning to dance right on the 40yd range to get free charges, knowing the exact limitations of your class and when to equip what - there's also the small things like pulling a mob so it lines right up with meleeing you as you enter a hunter trap.
---
Putting a regular "good warrior" against someone who plays like MN will see them getting absolutely dumpstered, consumables or not.
---
Ya but if it’s not about testing they could just release the game and then make actual money off of it.  I get that the beta is probably more about hype than testing but an overly long beta for a game that could be released just doesn’t make sense to me.
---
Yea only one of the things i fear, not raids or the such, is other peoples greed for a few pieces of gold.
---
It will still be in summer timespan don't worry, they won't let people tell em they missed their deadline. It will be the end of that timespan tho, not mid and def not early. It would literally make absolutely not the least bit of sense to release it in somewhat close proximity to bfa patch. But lets go further. Blizzard often tried to compete with other mmo releases. Guess what releases late summer too? Yes, FF.
---
Yes, but you need to go back to meme-school though.
---
The "r/wow" text needs to be above his face and the butterfly should say something that can widely be interpretet as some form of a date.
---
I think I’m going to be giving Druid a try also.  As a casual, semi-solo player I think it will be fitting.  Plus the travel form and the wisp form from being a night elf is going to be nice for the long distances.
---
I've read that Aimed Shot and MultiShot dmg was normalized in 1.12 (?). Does that mean that I'll be getting the same dmg from 2.9 bow and 3.2-3.4 crossbow/gun with same ilvl? I want to use bows!
---
Hunters are necessary for enrage fights because of Tranquilizing shot. There is also at least one boss pull where using their pet is one of the best methods of aggoring (Geddon I believe)
---
Rogues also out dps warriors until later raids, and they are also necessary for some mechanics like BWL suppression room.
---
Also hunters are the best class for Nightfall (at least on alliance). Both rogues and hunters do good dps in early raids with fresh 60 gear. Mages and locks and warriors without crafted gear will not he at the top.
---
&gt; I don't need a poll to prove logic.
---
Your statements weren#t about something that is graspable by logic however. Your statements were about public opinion. There is no logic behind opinion, so the only way to prove who is right, is by examining the data. Since neither of you has any data, neither can be considered correct.
---
&gt; We all know what the result of that poll would be.
---
I have heard that sentence so often, it makes me laugh:  
---
_"We all know who will win the election"_  
---
_"I think we all agree who will win this"_

_"Everyone will see it that way"_
---
No you don't. Even if your predicition ends up being correct, your premise still isn't. You just happened to guess correctly. Because your premise is that you can make a prediction on an issue that can only be grasped statistically, without using statistical methodology.
---
That sounds like a good plan but maybe a little unnecessarily time-consuming - it might be better to just make some money with mining and then just buy the mats for leveling Alchemy.
---
Warlocks - debuffs, solid dps and dont compete with mages on tier gear
---
Druid - only need one for MotW. Not uncommon to see top guilds only bring 1-3
---
Paladins - need a few for each blessing, never run out of mana and best tank healers
---
Shaman - need a few for WF totems in each melee group, great raid healers
---
Rogues - can keep up with warriors on dps without worrying about threat. 
---
Hunters - only need a couple for tranq shots and genearl kiting needs
---
My kids are too young to play.  It kills me.  I'm excited for you guys; is the Mrs. Joining you or is it you and your 3 kids?
---
Well, you'll have to buy bars off the AH (can't even smelt the ore yourself) which will be costly in itself.
---
As for enchanting, you'll be pressured to d/e any greens you get to level it, but then you aren't vendoring them.
---
Perpetually broke.
---
The official blizzard woe forums have a classic section. There is a sticky that lists all of the confirmed things for classic. This question was answered in that sticky. You might find answers to other questions as well :)
---
I think it's a different path. Choice A Solo leveling - Grinding is a good idea going from point a to b. Choice B Instances - Instances and their quests, which makes up for the grinding
---
druids were the least played class in vanilla from what i remember.
---
Healing is very simple in vanilla - the main differences are threat management and downranking, but you'll understand that before hitting 60 if you do dungeons regularly.
---
Retail healing is a chaotic clusterfuck where even the tiniest downtime is spent DPSing as much as you can. It's much more stressful for the individual.
---
I still prefer healing in vanilla, but let's be realistic.
---
No need to install vírus and malware bfa on your computer
---
Maybe if the Alliance wanted peace, they wouldn't have set up a bunch of goddamned concentration camps.
---
&gt;of content creators alluding to an event in Irvine and teasing some sort of announcement in the near future
---
Reminds me of the Nostradamus-Fans "teasing" and "alluding" that "something" will happen in 1995...no, but in 2000...no but in 2020 for sure this time.
---
It's an old parlor trick and a cheap one:  
---
Make vague statements without any concrete data, always alluding something in the "very near future", without ever providing a concrete timeframe. If something happens, claim to have known it all along. If nothing happens: Rinse and Repeat, and trust in the brains of gullible idiots to forget that you did the same BS last week.
---
Works every time...on idiots.
---
&gt;not be a jerk to people on the internet.
---
Oh boohoo, cry a river somewhere about people being mean on the internet.
---
Nope gonna be me and the boys as the divorce was more PVP than PVE, lol.  
---
Back when we were playing the youngest wasn't old enough, but he is showing interest in joining us on our new well "old" adventures.
---
Yeah good idea. Best give up at anything where the odds are against you.
---
many people will not raid or only raid low level content which you can play ret in. also pally is super easy to play and has easility the most survivability for solo pvp
---
I too am extraordinarily humble.
---
late reply much? :V You missed the hate train.
---
Best thing about classic right here. All raids are relevant no matter the patch.
---
Well people getting bored of BFA will take 2 weeks, and 8.2 will likely release alongside the new FF14 expansion on July 2. So perfect timing really.
---
Its definitely a show of skill. It was a good play, not gonna take anything away from that. But the replay of it was whack
---
Swords work fine for pvp. You basically trade the burst damage from Ambush + Backstab for energy management.
---
If you're going deep into combat you might also want to consider maces.
---
Yep. Which is why my noob 13 year old self actually had tier pieces. No body to compete with druid gear.
---
most people who play paladin want to heal but when they play pvp dont want to get 1 shot by rogues.
---
I'm just trying out retail for 1-20 or so, but it seems like my mana is basically infinite and I can cast 100 spells before running out, elites of my level die in 10 seconds and barely scratch me, plus herbalism gives xp?
---
It's not gonna be like this in Classic right? I think maybe herbalism  but something feels very different.
---
Also, there's a lot of hints for quests (showing exactly what area to go, what quest items will drop from that creep over there etc). How did this work in Vanilla?
---
I think pretty much everyone realizes this is a video game, and when you claim people are "genuinely bothered", it's because you don't recognize tongue-in-cheek responses for what they are. I'm a hardcore Horde circlejerker, but I don't *actually* hate people who play Alliance. It's a touch of roleplaying, a touch of PvP fervor, and a touch of snarkiness.
---
Frankly, I'd much rather see a page and a half of "*FOR THE ALLIANCE!*" and "*LOK'TAR OGAR!*" comments than a single other gods-forsaken "look at my battle station" post. At least the former facilitates in-game hype instead of just taking pictures of your bedroom.
---
Yesolace to Desolace
---
They're great at pvp too with gear. Best survival mechanics
---
Or a surprise when they struggle to find groups when they don't heal lmao
---
Faction rivalry is great, just keep it compartmentalised to the game. The issue is when someone is trying to have an honest discussion on a forum or whatever, and people come in and disrupt the conversation with uncalled for faction rivalry. There is a time and a place, and in 90% of cases, that is in-game, not on social media.
---
Not every alliance is meant to leave all parties fully satisfied. Whatever it takes to beat down a bunch of steroid-hopping greenskins, bud.
---
June 4th.  Crystal clear. 100% confirmed by me. No fake.
---
To expound on Bantimmy's response, Blizzard auctioned off most (all?) of the old Classic servers when they upgraded their hardware in later expacs. Each server was sold in a commemorative display case with its name and the signatures of the dev team, as you can see in the pic.
---
So it was hotel irvine =)
---
The fact that you even *can* dps in retail as a healer is a good sign its a very different kind of 'stressful' than vanilla.
---
Dude we know all quest texts by heart /s
---
August 27th release. collectors edition including ragnaros statue. mark my words
---
Lead designer on Overwatch
---
I see many serious raiding guilds taking a Feral Druid or two on the roster
---
The arguments for this are extensive, some examples in this clip https://youtu.be/mNGo5SMeqgo
---
No but Im trying to gauge the competition for raid heal spots.
---
Huh, was not expecting a response like this...
---
I dunno, it’s fun speculation about a video games release date.  If it riles you up this much maybe just unsub for a while.
---
Downvote me all you want ;)
---
For people bringing up Luna, I believe the modern equivalent is [Shadowed Unit Frames](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/shadowed-unit-frames). Just in case it turns out to be much quicker/easier to Port BFA addons than 1.12 addons, if it will even possible to port 1.12 addons.
---
I mean the entire war started cuz Orcs came into Azeroth with the intent of invasion.
---
Is it just me or has it always been mainly horde people who are very children minded regarding this stuff.  I play alliance and I dont feel any ill will towards he horde at all, except undeads.
---
I don't really understand your point here.
---
To sum it up - you both get less downtime, and you've got a dps responsibility in that minimal downtime. The fact that retail's healer design is kind of questionable doesn't change how intense it is in comparison.
---
World of ~~War~~Peacecraft
---
classic is forever, do them all.
---
No one was denying that RP server players are different from players in other game mode servers, and those differences could never possibly include intelligence or maturity because I correlated the data to determine casual relationships using basic logic.
---
You're doing real good, champ.
---
Currently playing on a private Vanilla server and I had no clue until now that there was no focus in Vanilla.  I did some searching and did see some addons.  
---
As much as I like the idea of focus target and binds, whatever is most true to Vanilla is what I want for sure.  
---
With that said, what’s the next best alternative to the benefits of having a focus target set?  I wasn’t a big pvper when Vanilla was live.
---
I voted to wait for retail release
---
If I get a beta invite I might dink around on it,  but I'd rather just watch my favourite streamers go through it
---
KEK
---
So lock will be less on ally right?
---
Or the "after Naxx" posts.
---
PepeHands shamans and druid are such a heros!
---
Slowmo was a bit cringe, but how in the name of fuck was any of that a mediocre play
---
I think you need to buy BfA but I'm not sure
---
Never been
---
No, it's not gonna be like that. Mana and leveling is a joke on retail.
---
Not sure about the damage normalization but I do know that anything below 3.2 speed you won't be able to avoid clipping auto shots
---
I think the closest thing (if I remember) was one party member going to major city and hitting up trade chat. I could be wrong.
---
The entire war started cause *The Burning Legion* came to Azeroth using Orcs as their literally mind-controlled puppets. Hate the dealer, not the user. As soon as the Orcs managed to break free of Mannoroth's blood curse, they promptly allied with the Night Elves and Jaina's militia to try to save Nordrassil.
---
Gonna need the names of everyone who said warrior so I can bombard you with tells. "tank pls"
---
Rogues also have an interrupt.
---
No trying the Beta, not playing it h24 just trying it, is one of the most retarded things you can do in your life beside using sand paper as toilet paper.
---
Haha, just bants bro! No one actually thinks like this. It's just poking fun!
---
&gt; I play alliance and I dont feel any ill will towards he horde at all, except undeads.
---
Same, haha. I have played both Horde and Alliance over the years though, so that might be why. 
---
But yeah, undead... ew.
---
I don't know for definite, but pretty sure that isn't true. They aren't exactly abusing any mechanics.
---
I'm so sorry to hear that.
---
Other than the judgement effect, how does Seal of the Crusader compare to SoR and SoCo? 
---
It has such a weird tool tip. I’m thinking it might be handy to judge wis or light and then SoCr to get mana or health quicker, but that’s about all I can think of as a use.
---
Can you gear Enhance Shaman for PvP only with Agi+Sta mail (Hunter's items) until you'll get hands on PvP hybrid gear? Basically will Enhance work without Int or he'll be constantly oom?
---
Well said. Not a day goes by without some #changes proponent asking them to change the realm sizes for example. Let Classic be Classic, don't ask for them to change the game just because you don't happen to like it.
---
The exp from herbing and mining are likely not to stay as they weren’t added until after cata.
---
As far as questing there was nothing on the map that told you where to go. You had to read the quest text for a general location and explore or ask for help or look it up.
---
BoE = All Need, is just the safest bet. Not to mention that the gold from selling a BOE can be legitimately transformed into an upgrade for any class.
---
But even if you do all agree to give it to the person who actually needs it, you can always do that *after* the general roll if the group feels sympathetic. This just lessens the chance that they will get screwed over by a single dick.
---
Now multiply that by about 60 and your classic experience will be thoroughly ruined. And if I remember correctly Mn gets all the gear he wants from raids aswell so he is mega BiS after the first couple of weeks, so even less fun.
---
i dont think you get why people like the rivalries, its not for the sake of being an angsty edgelord, its actually what makes it fun.
---
Of course theres going to be people that take it too seriously but id argue thats a really small minority and even if you wanted you wouldnt be able to tell them apart since they would be saying the same things people doing it for fun are saying.
---
Rogues can completely negate their thread on the Boss by Vanish. Bosses have the ability to reduce the thread, vanish is so incredible powerful to do more DPS, especially in BWL. Can Warrior out dps? Maybe, but most of the time they are DEAD, if they CRIT. I have seen Warriors bite the dust so many times, even with Salvation on them.
---
Also even if they pull thread from the boss, there is a chance they can shortly survive with Evasion. This mechanic, became a whole Boss Encounter in TBC.
---
They can also use their whole Stun Rotation on the Adds of Sartura, making it so incredible easy. They have the most reliable interrupt in the whole game. I wiped more than once on ZG bosses, because not enough Rogues, or bad Rogues.
---
You also need them for BWL to disable traps.
---
You also missed the usefulness of Paladins and Druids by a mile.
---
Paladins have also Seals. They are so useful, when people don't have Mana anymore or for that extra Healing on the Melee group. Palas never go OOM, because of their Crit Mechanic and bring Auras. They are also the most efficient healer in the game.
---
Druids have innervate, thorns and HOTW. Instant heal, which no other healer has on the Alliance side, if your Tank is about to die, they can instantly save the whole Raid from wiping. Druids are also incredible and situational Tanks and are in my opinion, more useful as an off-Tank, than a Warrior tank, especially on the Alliance side.
---
Druid does more Damage as a Cat in Bear-Gear, than a fully equipped Prot-Warrior with a 2-Hand Weapon. If the raid is not on farm, every little bit of DPS counts.
---
I meant equally skilled players, arenas will match you against equally skilled players as best as possible. Random trinkets and consumables will absolutely make the difference in pvp when fighting someone of similar skill level.
---
Imagine being this much of a cum guzzling asshole
---
undead mage has always been my go to, however the first character I ever made in 2005 was a troll hunter. I intend on level capping an undead mage, troll hunter, and tauren druid a year into classic. Not sure what I will level first tho...
---
Storming a major city of the opposite faction is the same experience regardless of server, I would imagine, since it's enemy territory either way. I've only played PvP server.
---
Also, I'd almost go PvE this time around because I'd rather trade in toxic PvPers for wholesome PvEers. But I'm shooting for a happy medium by going RP-PvP.
---
I'm rolling a paladin because I'm an RP nerd, and Classic paladin RP is fun.
---
"not backed by any scientific principles" 
---
go look up "Manipulative Therapy: What Works"
---
There's your science supporting manipulation. 
---
The study talks about how many professions (including physiotherapists) perform manipulation. What it's good for, what it's not good for and the incredibly low risk (lower than dying from surgery or drugs) for something bad to happen. Also written by MDs so that's nice.
---
Exercises and Manual Therapy over lap between chiropractors and physiotherapists so if you like one you should in (unbiased and unemotional) theory like the other.
---
Chiropractors and Physiotherapists are nearly identical and comparing the best from one to the best from the other will be nearly impossible to distinguish.
---
There are bad apples in every profession though so perhaps that's where your bias comes from.
---
Also it's not chiropractics it's chiropractic.
---
Many urban areas don't have it, and many smaller cities. Though I do live about 15 minutes from the capital, we've been told that our internet will arrive "soon" for about 4 years now, 2022 was the end goal date, though recently it got pulled to 2020, so I am 1% optimistic
---
Most of the kids living around here know nothing about so much, because they've never had internet. It's ridiculous. We moved here because we were forced to move, our previous house's owner left the country and hadn't been paying bills for months, so the city made us move out. So due to the small amount of time we had to find a new place, we got this place in the middle of butt-fiddle nowhere. It claimed to have internet access, but we're dingies and didn't realize it meant satelite. But we do use cellular now, which is something, but we only get an average of 5mb/s with our verizon 4G LTE plan. And that is being split with the entire household, making it significantly less
---
When classic drops my brother and I are rolling a Warrior/Paladin duo for instant dungeon groups and some class fantasy satisfaction. I was wondering if anyone had any insight on the correct Paladin tree for this combo. I will not be banking on reckoning bombs to be a thing nor do I want to spam a sitting macro. Yeah my medals in the mail but I steer away from cheese. Seems my options are the deep Ret standard leveling, or deep holy. We intend to mass pull and clear consistently. Is there any value in going for consecration as fast as possible to contribute to this play style? Will I OOM almost every fight and undo my efficiency equation? I’ll be buffing the Warrior with might and myself with wisdom.
---
Wow, everything is evening out quite a bit, earlier iterations of quizzes like this had warriors up at 20% and hunters down around 5% now it's getting pretty even. Though Paladin is super high on this due to them being only on alliance. Only time will tell I have feeling hunters will creep up due to there ease of leveling
---
This isn't facebook.
---
stop sucking his d'ck lol, Mn is a really good warrior but these are just highlights of him beating on noobs, there is plenty of footage of him getting cucked by other warriors, druids and hunters. Anyone whos PvPd competitively on private servers knows that these clips don't show how it usually goes when hes going against other skilled players that also have bis gear.
---
that ice block at the beginning with the choir in the back made me die lmao this video is 2005 wow in a nutshell.
---
or lose 50 for some
---
That's basically christmas  =(
---
September is VERY close to the end of Q3. They will more than likely want to release the game during mid-Q3 so they can show investors that they have possibly millions of subs for Classic. They need to give players time to see streamers or their friends playing, then joining in themselves. That could take multiple months and will not reflect until mid Q4 for them, which will be a quarter late if they release in September.
---
July is a good time IMO. People out for summer, playing games, watching streamers, etc. they know that us old farts are coming back...they need to capture the attention of all the 12-20 year old kids.
---
Suprised orc ain't so far ahead

---
wooo boy are your arms tired from moving those goalposts so fast?
---
Its just that I can directly see the intentions of people picking undeads, to have a little egde in pvp, for better disrupting purposes. I almost never kill horde people, especially not when theyre occupied like killing mobs or so. But undeads i literally always kill, even if they are low level.
---
Comparing Physiotherapist to Chiropractors is like comparing acupuncturists to oncologists.
---
Got to know her while farming mats for RAID. Within a guild during AQ Progression. EU, pvp. Now: married. Two Kids.
---
Problem is you don’t speak on behalf of the general populace of Horde Circlejerkers. 
---
I can literally name people on this sub and in-game who’ve taken their circlejerk too far out of “tongue-in-cheek.” teasing.
---
Ignoring the fact that we've seen quite a lot polls like this in the past few weeks...
---
Classic means most of the time, that you don't respecc every other day. Wouldn't a more specific poll be much, much more useful? I think like this options:
---
Warrior dps
---
Warrior tank
---
Priest heal
---
Priest dps
---
Shaman heal
---
Shaman dps
---
Paladin heal
---
Paladin dps
---
Paladin tank
---
Druid heal
---
Druid dps
---
Druid tank
---
Mage
---
Warlock
---
Hunter
---
Rogue
---
Said it before but I'm pretty sure half this sub must fall to nigerian scammers on a weekly basis. This is what the fourth or so completely unsubstantiated "leak" now, and all of the previous ones have been completely false?
---
Sooner or later beta is actually going to start, and they'll all be like "ha, I told you so! I knew the 500th time was true".
---
what i'm saying is, is there a precedent to go off? how many blizzard games have been advertised as 'summer' then come out in august?
---
Won’t be July. Such wishful thinking.
---
Just keep practicing at doing it. It's not perfect but kiting can be very effective and you don't even need to do it that much to gain the advantage back if you're losing a fight.
---
The raw numbers might not be amazing, but vanilla Hunter in PvP is incredibly fun. You have answers to absolutely everything and everyone - you just have to make sure to use them at the right time. Oh, and who doesn't love one-shotting people from AV towers!
---
How to be wegwacc:
---
1. Ignore the parts where I explained the logic.
---
2. Claim that there's no logic.
---
Less competition for you. It's a good thing :)

YOU'RE GONNA BREAK GAME'S ECONOMY!!!
---
it isnt that tough and you can do all of it solo pretty easily, it just requires you to know what the demons does and then have some tries on them
---
I wonder if there's a certain psychology behind that.
---
Like, you would think if you tried to rally a pvp raid on a pvp server, there'd be more pvp-minded players who'd want to join.
---
But, pvp happens all the time on a pvp server. Players would have less incentive to join a pvp raid, because pvp can always be found (just moreso skirmishes, not raids).
---
the fel influences was unknown to literally everyone but medivh and khadgar at the time. The internment camps for the orcs were justified. You expect to be at peace with some roided out shreks that just invaded and killed your people? Lol
---
Oh I hear you. In classic WoW I ranked to 10 before I couldn't do the grind anymore due to constraints. Most the GMs on my servers were warriors that would fuck you with an arcanite reaper until they got their hands on the weapons lol
---
Man, this hill is kicking my ass!
---
I played undead rogue, so I do not remember going out of my way to learn swords. 
---
Assuming from your reaction you are going to be playing orc or troll (probably orc in that case), I'd say whenever you are level 10 or higher and in orgrimmar anyway, take the zeppelin and go learn swords. This way you can use swords while leveling, which helps with the weapon skill.
---
It's pretty common play for warriors to try juke mages CoC and Nova as it pretty much win them the fight if they succeed.
---
Intercepting the enemy team to slow them down and that way possible secure a cap is a pretty common and logical strategy. Double charge + grenade isn't really that hard to execute lol, but it's fine that he shows it. What ruins it is that he feel the need to replay it in slow motion, like we didn't catch it the first time.
---
If he's getting fucked by even better people, that just showcases my point, doesn't it?
---
Mn is a really skilled guy no doubt. However it annoys me slightly that a lot of these 1v1s are won purely on some timely white crits / ms crits. 
---
10:00 his 1v2 against two rogues. Almost every white hit was a crit. If you even remove a third of those crits he's losing without a single frag superhard.
---
First clip: Rogue eats a 1,100 crit which instantly puts him in execute range. 
---
First clip: Mage eats 1,400 crit. Without that crit mage can coldsnap.
---
FC clip: He's got recklessness aka 30 minute cd so it's kind of meh.
---
Arathi Highlands: Crits both with abilities and white hits. Mage sucked ass, probably wouldn't had mattered.
---
Durotar duel: It's legit, gets a timely crit at the end but you've got to crit sometimes.
---
Underwater: Same deal, everything crits in a perfect manner.
---
He's no doubt a great Warrior, but I don't understand why he picks up clips like above where it's obvious that the reason for the wins are RNG. If you've got 15%-20% crit you'll for sure crit every now and then but some of these are tripple-crits and the chances for that are absurd.
---
You would need a lot more info to predict that, and at the end of the day there's just no way to actually know. A few people I've seen are trying to be a die hard retadin, some will strictly pvp, and I'm betting a chunk will give up on their paladin before they even would start raiding. 
---
I've never strictly healed in vanilla before, so I'm excited to try it. Who knows, maybe a few months down the line you and I will be rolling on the same lawbringer helm;D
---
Announcement on Wednesday that beta starts on 5/19.
---
Blizzard knew by telling the streamers and making them "*promise*" not to tell that they wouldn't be able to help themselves. That, or they encouraged them to give clues and hints without being direct.
---
Josh "Mr Loaded Questions"* Corbo of Countdown to Classic made a post at 5:19 hinting at a limited beta. Tips, apparently, claims he'll be "multitasking during the GoT finale" on 5/19.
---
This post is probably hinting at an incoming blue post Wednesday to announce the activities for 5/19 (whether that's sign-up or open beta is to be determined)
---
^(*For the record, I basically live for Countdown to Classic!)
---
I would rather quell my thirst for classic a bit on the beta than on a pserver. Might also meet some nice people in beta who I can start playing with on release! Now the only problem is getting into the beta..
---
Paladin on 3rd place is the highest they'll ever get in their lives!
---
I kid, I kid. Sort of. 7.7% Shaman represent.

&gt; played the game

Wednesday is a long time from now, I'm running on fumes. I spend my days internally debating what race, what class to play. If I'm going to do professions on my way to 60, or at 60. 
---
I'm dying. Blizzard. Please. heelp/
---
Yuup
---
"100% confirmed" is a weird way to say "literally no information at all currently"
---
More likely actual opinion veiled as a joke.
---
A lot of people only play one faction so they have wrong opinions about things.
---
Just seeing your name now. Clearly Troll. Enjoy your life.
---
Many will probably be under the impression that they are not going to heal.
---
You could Just say that you didnt find anyone instead of replying with stupid comments.
---
can't remember the command, but there is a /command input you can do to get more max distance. I'm sure google will help, i'm just lazy.
---
I really want to know where Deathwing-US ended up...
---
The mouse is also from back then too. Super retro
---
 I way there’s that many paladins
---
Lol I'm glad you noticed
---
These polls aren't relevant at all.
---
We all know 60% of the playerbase will be Rogues and Warriors.
---
I feel like most people who trash on PvE servers think of PvE servers as "No-PvP servers," as if PvP doesn't happen. When in actuality, I'm sure some PvE servers have seen more epic, organized PvP battles than some PvP servers.
---
No bio breaks
---
Fuck you alliance scum
---
RemindMe! 7 days "/u/sawyermblack is wrong"
---
Thanks for the feedback! All those suggestions are easy to implement so I’ll fix it asap. 
---
Regarding the map, it’s scalable and remember its position so just scale it upp to the normal size and leave it there would almost be like default without the black boxes on the sides. The opacity can be adjusted too. 
---
I’ll write down a full list of all the features later today and update the gitlab page so it’s easier to know exactly whats in there!
---
What if im not ready then
---
True, but as you work with data then you probably also know that a poll like this has wayyy bigger problems than the type of chart used.
---
My buddy is rolling rogue, which class would compliment it the best? Goal is pvp and dungeon fun. 
---
I was thinking mage or lock with engi. Maybe even priest (although I'm not sure if I want to roll a healer, farming is always a pain if you don't have much time on your hands)
---
I could see it being 2-3 months. Maybe with stages like 1-19, 20-29, etc. to make players slow down and try out all of the available content, several classes, etc.
---
Honestly I think they'll base their beta duration more on advertising than testing purposes. Blizzard utilizes these periods as free advertising, driven primarily through Twitch streaming. It's really the perfect way to create hype and attract players just before the release. There's a decent number of people who will be less inclined to start after release due to feeling behind, so the beta period is really the perfect time to do the hype stuff.
---
Let's make it very clear that leveling as Sub is just **not** a good idea.
---
For PVP any Rogue spec is fine but they play different from each other so it just comes down to what is fun for you personally. My advice is to play with different specs until you find the one you like best and then work on optimizing it.
---
where's the item though?  was the item ever introduced into the game?
---
For me it comes naturally, after the 11:th time I get ganked by a UD Rogue while leveling I hate that rogue. But in a way I like it, PvP in an open environment has an ambience-element to it.
---
The hate or rivalry doesnt have to be forced.
---
Do you have every vanilla item memorized?
---
&gt;the main differences are threat management and downranking
---
And the 5 second rule, pot management etc.
---
And I disagree completely that healing used to be easy compared to retail - again, current wow has a 'press all the buttons' mentality, vanilla has a 'act safely and smartly' methodology. 
---
Healing in Vanilla involves constant dilemmas. It can mean deciding *not* to heal the tank until you get your next MP5 tick even though he/she's in trouble, because long term you won't survive otherwise. Or alternatively, recognising that a crushing would KO him so you decide to act, at the expense of the long term. 
---
Vanilla healing is dark psychological shit.
---
No scam. Buy 2 for get 2 free. Extra power download.
---
Well that's given that the Vanilla servers are run on the architecture that the modern servers run on aswell. Essentially shatterings servers into hundreds of 'smaller' servers that are much easier utilize.
---
However are we given information that the classic servers will  be ran on modern server architecture? I heard rumours about them perhaps utilizing sharding in the start to avoid a clogged level experience from 1-20 which I don't really think is that bad. Considering their effort to create the game as similar as possible to vanilla, like casting batches and smaller mechanics I'd like to think they won't have some sortof fix for this.
---
Vanilla Coke Zero = zero vanilla beta! June release date confirmed!
---
Really cool! Could you share that Troll/NE wallpaper?
---
The hunter rotation keeps you on your toes all the time, and you have to take it into consideration when moving around so you maximize your dmg. The mage rotation in mc and bwl is spam frostbolt because fire and arcane sucks in those raids, and then you get to be a decurse bot on some of the bosses. There isnt that much micro management on the pet. 
---
A con for the mages is that they have to spend time before every raid to make enough food and water for the whole raid, and it has to be right before the raid or you cant log out (because it will dissapear if youve been logged of for 15 min). 
---
A con for the hunters is that they wont get that many different weapons, which is the most fun part of getting new gear tbh. Hunters also dont do that much dmg after mc compared to mages and the other classes. Hunters wont get the tier gear from aq40 for some weeks because its more worth it to give the pieces to other classes.
---
A pro for the hunter is that they can continue to do dmg because they have feign death to reset their threat. Hunters also has the job of kiting the trash mobs especially in bwl. They also have the extra job of having to tranq multiple bosses and they get to have hourglass sand on chrommaggus for that exact reason (sometime the other dps doesnt get any as it isnt always worth it).

I wonder what percentage of the Warrior pickers are going to give up before level 40 and switch. I'm guessing 30% minimum.
---
I like this idea.
---
no, i was looking through the items in the wowhead 1.1.2 database when i saw some items that didnt specify their drop source.
---
Do you even know who Mr. GM? He isn't some nobody.
---
24% of the Alliance will be Paladins, PEW.
---
Well bfa for one released aug 14th and im pretty sure they referenced it as coming summer. It makes sense, what else would you refer to other than seasons? You could user quarters, but then again they mostly line up with seasons. It's just a general term to refer to a timespan where it may be released.
---
I've heard that the sentiment shifted more towards horde being better for raiding on private servers, but honestly who cares. Play what you want, good guilds are still going to clear everything.
---
The sugar free version tastes almost exactly like the original.
---
/r/meirl
---
The mounts aren't that big of a deal in my opinion.
---
Sure they will help, but the epic mounts will still cost a lot (cheaper than other classes most of the time, depending on your server market, but definitely not free). Another draw back is that the quests for the epic mount can not be done until phase 2, since they require Dire Maul. So depending on how long phase 1 lasts you might want to learn the riding skill (bulk of the cast) and get a mount anyway. Making your epic class mount either something that you skip or an additional gold sink.
---
If you are interested in either class, well yeah, this is a nice perk for sure. But I would not take it into consideration when you are deciding on a class. The benefit is gone as soon as other people buy their mounts.
---
I main-hand flowers
---
It's not actually available to players, the files are leftover from Vanilla Beta (the original one).
---
You never use arcane shot as a hunter. Unless the small chance that drakonids in bwl takes more dmg from arcane, but that still isnt needed.
---
It will dont worry :)
---
So why even post this kind of stuff in the first place? It would be like posting a video titled “feral Druid insane dps with dual wield thunderfurys”
---
How does that equate to blizz adding new items to classic?
---
There are tons of items and spell that you'll never have access to on live game, but can still view their info on database sites.
---
This is a B-level game for Blizzard, so don’t expect it to be a normal release like their others. They’ve only mentioned it like once in their earnings meetings over the past year.
---
I’m guessing they’ll give it a shorter beta, release date, etc.
---
Quick question from someone how of the loop but how is this different from Tips out leaking it? Even was crucified here for a supposed leak yet this is receiving positive reaction? Legitimate question I'm actual curious of the differences etc
---
Damn, I got mixed feelings about the (possibly) removal of focus.
---
I understand that it wasn't commonly used back in the day as it required scripts to do it. However it was in fact possible and today people are used to focus from retail and even vanilla pservers, so I personally wouldn't mind having it in classic as well.
---
Of all these posts about Shamans, they are the lowest represented class on this poll?
---
ah gotcha
---
dont worry, US has its share too
---
Warriors - Best Tank and only viable MT, great DPS
---
Rogue - Amazing DPS, neccessary for suppressio  room in BWL
---
Hunter - Decent DPS really good early, falls off later post BWL, still need 2 for enrage mechanics
---
Mage - Great DPS and CC, Scales harder later on
---
Warlocks - Banish is extremely useful, their DPS isnt the greatest until AQ40 and then they can really start to carry
---
Druid - Really good raid healers, handy buffs, Fairie Fire is an important boss debuff. Ferals can do decent DPS if done properly, and can also be Offtanks
---
Priest - The best raid healer, buffs are huge, Shadow priests can work once warlocks are stronger (AQ40+)
---
Paladin - Best single target healer in the game, by naxx will never run out of mana. Ret can do passable DPS, mostly AQ40 onwards, unless new theorycrafting changes them into feral level dps.
---
Shaman - I dont really know much about them, horde is big gay
---
Met my husband in TBC, he was my GM.
---
Hey my server! Can I have it back please so I can start playing?
---
Have to increase the level imo
---
Holy shit.
---
I haven’t played since 1.12, and when I did play it was on this server. What a trip!
---
My favorite part about this question is how many mother fucking times it has been asked
---
And they will be relevant for years. Not just for one patch, one expansion. They will be relevant forever. People just gotta hope their server doesn't slowly die over the years
---
I want to play classic very bad. I just don't know if I can do it again. Doing it once before was so much fun, I'm worried it wont be the same experience. And the grinding (loved it at the time) just seems impossible for this time in my life. :(
---
Do you think they stop being strong? Just curious to your opinion, I believe that's when they truly shine.
---
My advice is try 1-20 on a Pserver if you can. I have done it for 4 classes and it helped me decide my class. On th lock I ended up buying a wand because was sick of running out of Mana. It feel much more representative of what classic will be. 
---
In classic there will be no: xp from herbs, any kinds of quests directions just quest text (there are addons). If you approach it the same as retail after level 6, there is a regular risk of dying.
---
Do you? He's very upfront about his "leaks" [coming from people messaging him (this is the current ones)](https://twitter.com/MrGMYT/status/1125813122504302593) as well as from various datamining websites.
---
I got nothing against him as a person, but people are doing themselves a disservice if they take his word as gospel just because he has a (relatively small!) youtube/twitch following. He literally makes his living on your clicks.
---
I’m not much for collectibles but these server blades or whatever the fuck their called are awesome
---
Meh
---
matching gloves for the Imperial Plate set.
---
the models for the matching gloves are there in the game data, there are NPC's wearing them, they just never got implemented as a item for players for some reason. so the Imperial set is incomplete...
---
kind of a nitpicky thing I know
---
It's delicious.
---
You think they're done yet? Not a chance.
---
Well okay then
---
Why would anyone sell below vendor price? :o
---
It's like they're trying to beat us into submission.
---
I'm pretty sure he wouldn't just take anyone's word. Some of the content creators who went to visit Blizzard recently may have told him.
---
DM won't be available for awhile, so for the first couple of months when building your personal economy matters the most mage aoe in DM won't be possible. Once it does come out, I just don't know which is better. I would not put it past blizzard to nerf either of those gold farming strategies though, they became popular on private servers, but they weren't know during vanilla so there was never a need to nerf them.
---
I played on this server during BC, was in a guild called Hit List. I'd love to know what happened to them. They got pretty well known for taking requests to kill other players and dispatching people to find that player and kill them. We had some pretty epic bg premades too.
---
If it would clip, it would clip only with Aimed shot? Which is not THAT important, isn't it?
---
Can I get goblin engineerinng and switch to gnomidh later? Or do I need to create the gizmos and then drop eng and pick it up again ? I want best of the both worlds
---
Sent you a DM for discord if your interested. Early stages.
---
I wouldn't go prot with a warrior because he can't really help you aoe and you'll increase your down time. You could go holy and make it so that you guys never die even if you pull too many mobs, or you could go ret to increase kill speed while pulling 1-2 at a time. You'll still be able to heal and reduce the warrior down time significantly.
---
Same webcam as me, same mic... Same mic preamp... Same type of soundcard (I have the 18i8) 
---
Good choice of equipment.
---
The complexity of the 5SR is always really exaggerated.
---
There are times when you can be smart and get an extra tick in, or simply risk it for the biscuit, but it's not like a life-changing dilemma every tick. If you run an energy tick addon, you can easily grasp it while leveling.
---
But yes, I agree with "*current wow has a 'press all the buttons' mentality, vanilla has a 'act safely and smartly' methodology*" - that's why there's a clear difference in intensity.
---
Simple doesn't mean bad.
---
A couple of weeks? Not a single piece of gear he wants might not drop in that couple of weeks.
---
Pick PvP, and find like-minded players.
---
Yeah, I miss downranking a lot, I always felt that it was the pinnacle of healer interactivity. Now a days we have a ton of utility and cooldown rotations but if you just stick to your priorities and you’re geared enough, you’ll never run out early. There’s no mana based decision making anymore, and you only have one option for each scenario. 
---
I’ve also never played Alliance or done the Thorium Brotherhood questlines so Im excited to do blacksmithing.
---
Honestly, I'm torn because a part of me would love to have someone like him push world pvp for the entire server. I mean, this guy and his guild will bring WAR to the opposite faction. How exciting is that?
---
And I doubt these guys are ganking in a raid all the time, so the occasional raid vs raid action would be pretty cool.
---
We are also getting cross realm bgs, so hopefully, the larger pool will dilute their premades.
---
No plz
---
That's my one fear with the new client that relies on sharding to handle big populations. I remember a post saying the vanilla client could handle 100v100 fine while the legion client can't.
---
Hope that's not true.
---
Remember when he used to be on our side?
---
I didn't meet my SO in WoW, but I invited her to join me during Wotlk. I was the vice GM of a guild. She loved WoW but didn't get very far (got to level 72ish I think).  We are still together,  been almost 15 years now.
---
I dont like this idea, nor see it happening. Its more likely that they will make a TBC server etc instead. The way private servers got ahead with "old game with no new content possibility" was through speedrunning raids, which is what I expect to become meta in classic as well.
---
So I find this system flawed in about 100 ways, but, assuming you're using it and that the other flaws don't matter.  
---
If I play your game and give you 400g, I get put in the second slot. Then.... someone else gives you 400g also and so they get put in the 2nd slot so I'm now 3rd? Or they're now 3rd? Not good.
---
Second major flaw assuming I'm playing your game, I am fresh to your guild. I pay 400g. I get put ahead of the person sitting at 2nd who's been waiting for a drop forever and then I take it. Then I pay 400g again and I get put back where I was. For 800g, I can screw your long time guildmate, not once but twice. 
---
I would never play your game, its shit on so many fronts but its even shit when someones buys into it and plays by its rules.
---
That's not Dire Maul !
---
Will lotus be BoP early on?
---
Just came across your informative post and was wondering if you possibly could remember the other few dungeons besides Uldaman that Joana recommends to skip?
---
Why is everyone jaying july 16?
---
Just like yesterday, this shit should be bannable at this point it's been asked and rejected so much. The only conclusion is that folks that make these threads by now are trolls.
---
Engineering will be useless without mining. 
---
Im personally going skinning and mining out the gate.
---
Will send leather to bank alt that will be parked in orgrimar to sell on ah. 
---
Will hold ore in bank or the alt depending on space limitations.
---
Once 60, will prolly skin and mine may way up to having a good amount of gold. Im going warlock so will need a lot for my lvl60 class mount. 
---
Once i got all my main gold sink related stuff completed, will drop skinning for engineering and level that up for pvping and be done.
---
Lunge stretches are easy with lots of progressions and help with anterior pelvic tilt / back pain
---
I go to a university. Surely there are people around me who are also hyped about classic. How might I try to find these people?
---
Be quiet Europe you know what you did.
---
I heard it was May 14th
---
I'll go holy to be a good boy but the second I get tier 2.5 full set i'll find a part time guild to ret with or go full time pvp retardin.
---
Tips definitely wasnt "crucified" here for his leak... he may have been cruicified for his video tactics, but im pretty sure he won a fair part of the sub over with his paragraphs defending himself/ explaining his target viewerbase (hint, its not the majority of this sub) Everyone was happy for his leak, just not so much him.
---
Play but I'm going with the opposite faction on a class that isn't available so Paladin for me. Will level a bit to see Alliance content then post any bugs or issues I find with the game.
---
I'll be done with Beta after a few days.
---
Athene is Belgian but yeah that happened.
---
Fury warriors cannot mortal strike idiot
---
Over the last few months I've seen similar polls like this and I'm always surprised to see that rogues aren't nearly as high on the list as you'd think. 
---
Maybe because rogues were so popular back in Vanilla and most people that played rogue want to try something new? I know you can apply that to a lot of classes, but it seems to be most prominent among rogues. Idk, but it's always shocking to me that in these polls, rogues are usually middle of the pact or even lower.
---
It would be interesting to hear some thoughts from Vanilla rogues that aren't going rogue this time around.
---
As far as damage dealers go, Hunters are the least reliant on stats because pets gain no benefit from additional stats and hunters have the worst scaling from stats among the 5 dps classes in the game. If you're in a guild that's really trying, you'll likely be required to get them anyways.
---
This should be higher up
---
I'm just happy that I expect them to release it late August. That way I won't get disappointed :)
---
1. Yes
---
2. Yes
---
3. Absolutely yes 
---
4. This is not even a question, it’s a statement
---
lol get on your bike, lad. Overly sensitive snowflakes 😂😭
---
Maybe we should do a Race strawpoll too, that'd be interesting.
---
Cool insights, nice detail, thanks :)
---
I roll  a pala for the unparraled aoe farming as a healer, dungeon boosts, demi-god pvp status and hopefully later in the xpac full ret pvp with the AQ set, defending redridge.
---
Fuck Towelliee
---
There are hundreds of new subs each day.
---
&gt; that's why there's a clear difference in intensity.
---
Intensity, I agree with. Does that translate into an overall decrease in difficulty? Hard to say since it's been so long, but I would suggest probably not. 
---
&gt;There are times when you can be smart and get an extra tick in, or simply risk it for the biscuit, but it's not like a life-changing dilemma every tick.
---
Not every tick - but the point is, if you're too liberal with your heals at any stage of the fight (not just the critical moments) you'll run out of steam minutes before your peers. It was common for us in Vanilla and TBC to have bad healers hit oom while good healers were on half mana. That's a big, quantifiable skill differential, and a skill that's not going to translate from the press-all-the-buttons approach of retail.
---
Right, presumably, Blizzard does not plan on removing respec.
---
Combat is optimal for leveling but if you want to experiment a little as you level then here are the basics:
---
Always start with Imp. Sinister Strike. 5 Energy per SS makes a huge difference over time and SS is going to be your main damage dealing ability for a lot of the time you are leveling. You also really want to go down the Combat tree at least until you have 5/5 Precision, that extra 5% hit is too important to pass up. At this point you can start experimenting with other things.
---
If you wanted you could go 0/12/7 and have all of the cooldown reduction from Endurance and Elusiveness at level 28. Or you could go 11/10/0 and pick up Relentless Strikes at level 30 instead of Blade Flurry. Or whatever you want, the world (of Warcraft) is your oyster.
---
Unfortunately 3 of the 4 endgame hunter weapons are crossbows. Only bow is rhok'delar, and it's only 2.9. So you don't have much choice in the matter, you just have to use the alternate pve rotation when using a faster bow.
---
Is the one in the pic actually the Europe one or not? I figure they wouldn't ship the EU server to the US to be signed and then back for auctioning would they? 
---
Anyway I used to play on this server in vanilla. Shout out to my BGOH guild members.
---
Sounds like the opposite. 
---
From what he said, I gather that EU players only roll need for items you will equip and roll greed for items you will sell. NA players roll need on Boe items to prevent others from ninjaing the item and selling for gold.
---
Remember, Towel thinks we should be thanking content creators because without them, classic wouldn’t be popular
---
Maybe we should do a class + Race one, maybe that'll give us more detail. :)
---
You forgot mages.
---
Calm down party poopers. It's a video showing you the most efficient leveling route to level 10 in the gnome/dwarf starting area. On classic, just try to follow the same route and skip quests that take too long from being overcrowded.
---
Experienced speed levelers will make a route from 1-60 and know what can be skipped in case it's overcrowded. Once you get past everyone, you can just do what is being done in this video.
---
The guys doing these practice runs (I've done a few myself) will be the first to 60, so if you want to be one of the first to 60, you better start practicing (on the beta realm of course, we don't play private servers).
---
Why do you assume he wouldn't? Do you really think large content creators would risk violating their NDA to leak this to some youtuber (who was too small to even get invited)? 
---
A breach of NDA could lead to lawsuits, game bans, or being excluded from future events/betas. Why on earth would a more popular content creator risk so much just so a smaller youtuber can write some cryptic tweets?
---
It means, #manychanges! Prayers are heard
---
There was no leak. I get it, everyone is hyped and all that, but there’s no reason to make shit up, and there’s no reason to pretend to know something other people don’t.
---
I could argue as to whether anyone could have, or should have, known that Orcs were being puppeted. But I'd rather talk about Lordaeron again.
---
The Scourge was "unknown" to pretty much everyone in the Eastern Kingdoms, despite people having been warned about it. Then Arthas takes disproportionate measures to cull the city of Stratholme. Was his behavior in Stratholme justified "because you can't expect to be at peace with some crazy undead monsters that just invaded and killed your people"?
---
Afterward, the Scourge grew in number. Former citizens of Lordaeron turned against their family and friends, having been mind controlled by the Lich King in their undeath. Do you blame the Lordaeron citizens themselves for being infected by the Plague of Undeath?
---
If the answer to any of these things is "no", then why would you say it's alright for humanity generally, after hostilities have ceased against what they thought was an intrinsically dangerous invasion force (because mind you, I don't think it's a problem that they defended themselves in the Second War regardless of who was pulling the strings behind the Orc invasion force), to round up literal Orc infants and place them in literal death camps, training either as work slaves or as gladiators? There's a big difference between self-defense and war crimes.
---
I kinda feel the same. I think it had something to do with the fact that in the early years alliance was more popular, and horde had to compensate with more vocal representation of the faction. I play horde too, but I see WAY more ”lok’tar ogar” or ”for the horde” than ”for the alliance”.
---
lol
---
The best racial is Regeneration obv.
---
Rogues under Paladins? This is so flawed 😅
---
They're not even close to being the same game. You can do 1-20 on retail in a few short hours, in Classic it will take a good chunk of time. Pulling more than one regular mob often results in death depending on your class, there is downtime between pulls again depending on your class, and you will have only quest text (often time extremely vague quest text) to tell you where to go. Lot's of people will use quest addons if they're available at launch to speed up the process, but they aren't necessary.
---
Warrior is lower than expected, but healthy for the game.
---
Do other classes not have one in Vanilla? :o
---
This is a good thing
---
If you plan to respec every time you want to PvP, then sure, that's a different manner.
---
Everyone rolling Greed and everyone rolling Need is functionally the same.
---
Doing Need just cuts out any unnecessary shenanigans.
---
Was gonna play a hybrid druid, but after careful consideration I've decided on enhancement shaman. 
---
Shaman was my favorite class until WoD, and I just wanna go back to it. Even if I'm mostly disliked and hated for not being resto. Nightfall bitch, reporting for duty!
---
Because it helps people with the starting zone. Even if you can't do it as fast or won't be able to finish every single quest come classic release, it will give you a good idea of what order to do it in. Someone who doesn't know what to do could easily spend 4 times as long.
---
I was in a semi casual guild that cleared all of aq40 except for Cthun (which we got to about 6%) and all of naxx up to 4 horsemen, which is when we didn’t have enough geared warriors and tbc was announced so we stopped raiding
---
Not once did anyone ever question or care about which professions anyone had except for telling people to level up first aid.
---
Yea we get it, you only ever played private servers and want to seem like an OG, but guilds back then couldn’t care less as long as 40 warm bodies were ready for raid night on time
---
Oh shit are they going to get deleted?
---
No
---
Nah, I don't really care about the races. But it would be nice to know how many tanks and healers you can expect, approximately.
---
&gt;Stack Split Frame
---
Simplified elements.
---
**YES, YES, YES, WE DID IT, WE DID IT**
---
&gt; Perl Classic is my pick 
---
Do you realize that Classic will not have the addons we use right now in the 1.12 client right?
---
“When it’s ready?” What in Blizz’s recent past makes you believe it will actually be ready upon release?
---
I expected the Dwarfs to be like top 3, but they're at the bottom atm :0
---
That's when they start getting better. When you get your cold of cone and you can start AoEing down mobs, it becomes quite efficient.
---
get a load of this guy cam
---
How come classic isn't ready when my body is?
---
If flasking is an issue avoid magic dps or tanking. So physical damage or healer.
---
Uhh that is not at all the same. To make a good comparison you need to get rid of other factors that would affect the result, therefore other players.
---
&gt;\[...\] which is what I expect to become meta in classic as well.
---
I'd wager asking for F R E S H servers is gonna become meta instead. Anyone can do that, speedrunning is a tad more niché.
---
Well said
---
I'm sure the dedication plaque is a sticker or glued on.
---
Simple yet elegant. Nice one buddy.
---
As a Druid horde player I don’t have a choice.
---
He's talking about sharding and how BFA runs on many smaller servers instead of each continent being a single larger (ie more powerful) server.
---
We don't really know how well the Classic servers will perform yet.
---
I once lvled warrior on private using xbox controller. Was a bit tricky to setup, had to figure out some macros and bind them confy. Definitly doable and suprisingly effective fir questing/farming. Even better if you just casualy play on pve serv since the hardest thing was camera control, so i dont recommand doing any pvp that way.
---
Yes, of course.
---
This was me :)
---
Also 100% confirmed to be possibly coming out some time after today.
---
I don't see it being 2-3 months. The content doesn't need testing, they already know it works. This should cut down the test period significantly.
---
Well uh, you could actually provide proof that would not get your friend in trouble. And you could predict something else first that is closer by, like the date of announcing the release date. If you hit that right you’d get more credibility for this other one too.
---
29 aug
---
I remember my first experience seeing a die hard role player on this server. Anyone remember Copperfield?
---
"Why do anything ever, someone on the internet might not agree with it."
---
I would be ready within an hour. XD  
---
Seriously, if there was no release date release, just strait release, and let's say that day was today; right now; all I would need to do is go to the grocery store for half an hour and text my boss that I am taking PTO. My boss already knows that I have 5 days PTO planned as a reaction to the release of Classic WoW, and he is ok with it. He knows I am a nerd and what this means. (Last year it was GenCon)
---
Warlocks were definitely not top dps in raids. In fact they were more often than not in the bottom bracket in terms of dps.
---
I know but dont you need the battle chest or something similar?
---
if you dont stop these threads im going to give your colons a horizontal expansion
---
Well shit
---
I think there is merit in “what comes next”, but the release date hasn’t even been announced for the museum, #nochanges, servers. 
---
New content is certainly an option blizzard has, it’s also the most expensive.
---
While they could develop new content, they have a few other options, too. 
---
From least to most expensive:
---
Let this wave of classic servers run their course, let the project die due to only having fully progressed servers.
---
Restart the Vanilla servers in 2.5-3 year seasons. 
---
Create a set of BC Classic servers—prenerf content, 2.4.3 class mechanics and world. 
---
Develop modifications and additions to classic, roll those classic ‘2.0’ servers along side a seasonal classic server release.
---
At the end of the day, people on mmochamp, wow forums, and reddit are not ready to collectively think about what comes next, after all we don’t even know when “what comes now” starts. 
---
While I think perfecting the vanilla experience would be really cool, i don’t trust blizzard, and i recognize the huge disparity in what the fan base thinks should be amended and what is critical to the Vanilla vibe. 
---
As such, Id advocate for Vanilla seasons, or a Bc release. I probably wouldn’t play the second set of vanilla classic servers, unless that had changes. But I would certainly stay on for another crack at Bc (which without flying mounts is a better endgame than classic—and if you look at both as a single 4 year experience, it’s easilly on the list for best games ever). 
---
Further, developing new content on a classic version and a 8.X or 9.X version seems to me to be splitting development resources a whole lot more than the smaller crew needed to build classic wow once then maintain it. Also whether you play it or not, your $15 gets you access to in development retail and museum classic. Blizzard gets the same revenue, and now you want two actively developed games—that’s probably not going to fly.
---
Not all classes. Warrior has one(2 if stunnable/talented for stuns). Mage has one. Shaman has one. Paladin has one? (may be a stun?). I'm sure there are others, but its a valuable asset to bring as not every class has one, and there are less than there are in retail.
---
Oof you’re gonna be disappointed when it’s actually late September
---
Well sorry, I tend to check this reddit once a week or so, So i had no idea this was brought up that much.
---
Lots of people do it
---
We are ClassicWoW. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us.
---
What 1v1 tournament?
---
You won't be ahead of the curve I promise
---
I feel you, I'm anticipating Rogues and Hunters will jump significantly though and locks will be near the bottom again
---
What does "achieve a focus" mean ? Is it the mouse-hover to select target thing?
---
They're saying that because there was a couple screenshots at blizzcon of gnone characters.  One of their names was July, and they were like level 16 or something.  The other one's name was Osconty and there's something significant a user name Osconty did on July 16th, idk.
---
So just tinfoil hat stuff
---
I did
---
I really like the +throwing skill when playing a troll mage.
---
But if nobody ever gives honest criticism then this shit would run rampant.
---
But Im definitely going to need that rag statue anyway
---
Some people are in for a big surprise when classic launches and they realize there are plenty of warriors that play just as good as Monkeynews, if not better.
---
I'm afraid I can't let you do that. Classic releases this summer, you must live.
---
I will say though, I really hope there is no open Beta. Just give us the game. I won't take PTO for a beta, and a beta will feel gross. I mean it, gross. We know what the features are, and I am sure the bugs can be hotfixed at this point. What's gross is that we, as players, will play and level characters only for us to see a reset. #nobetaplz
---
I know they do. I thought you were trying to make an argument of fury over rogues in everything, including PvP.
---
June or I jump
---
Wasn't Athene, it was Gawel from Millenium
---
I think we need a poll that reaches outside of Reddit more hmm 🤔
---
Hi, /u/aydsz
---
Why would you care if it "runs rampant"? Literally just don't open the thread and click the downvote button, its that easy. You don't need to leave a comment when a lot of people enjoy this sort of content.
---
&gt; Blizzard knew by telling the streamers and making them "promise" not to tell that they wouldn't be able to help themselves. 
---
It really doesn't work that way. Unless you sign an NDA, you can talk (and making you promise is laughable). If you sign an NDA, you can't talk and can be held liable for damage caused.
---
Soloing DME lashers with holy nova is the staple of priest solo farming (roughly 20-30g/5 lockouts not counting any DM books or rares/epics) and it gets better with herbalism as there are two guaranteed dreamfoil spawns and a chance at a gromsblood spawn.
---
As the other commenter mentioned, 2 man DME jump runs are great (one ench/herb, and the 2nd person being a miner for the RTV’s at the end).
---
Herbing profitability will be dependent upon spawn rates in classic, but typically Felwood is a great spot to herb for money (gromsblood/plaguebloom/dreamfoil nodes in the zone).
---
The song is Navras from the matrix resolutions haha
---
Yeah clipping would only happen with aimed shot. Depending on latency and how good you are at timing your aimed shots you could easily clip .5 sec+ of the autoshot using a fast weapon. I never went back to private servers so it's been too long, I don't have exact numbers but i do know that autoshots were a large percentage of damage. If you're doing 10-15% fewer autoshots your damage will suffer. Maybe someone will chime in with more concrete statistics.
---
&gt; fair part of the sub over 
---
Hah, F to doubt bois.
---
Click the portal my dudes
---
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
---
I live to purge hord scum from the world
---
Axe Specialization is an insider tip for rolling Warlock
---
bfa wasn't advertised as summer
---
If shaman amount is doubled (or other classes amounts divided by 2) , it really shows how popular they will be on horde side.
---
I see a lot of people with the “long beta because it’s free advertising” argument but to be honest I just don’t see it.  Whether it’s beta or live people will be streaming it and they’d get the same free advertising.
---
Stepping into STV at lvl 30 is pointless. Almost every other quest is high yellow/orange. The nesingwary quests give extremely low exp anyway, so they're not worth to rush. I usually wait to 33 ideally to really get the ball rolling.
---
And you know what the funny thing is, that aside from TEFs, SWG servers operated under the same rules as WoW's PvE servers.
---
My Hunter's just as awesome as I remembered. :) Blizzard's customer service is pretty sweet too, it was really easy getting my account back.
---
Whats with the Capital A...? 🤔
---
Logitech Z623
---
Username checks out. Pack it up bois, they've got Classic all the way up to 2100!
---
Nearly video. Clear title. Don’t listen to the random haters, good job.
---
Sugar is bad, agreed. Reduction of consumer choice is also bad. As is replacing sugar with chemicals that may or may not be compatible with your body. If in doubt, drink water.
---
&gt;See how the people are all free, and the water just comes down from the  sky and it don't cost nothin'. With flowers, and rainbows...
---
Drama. D&amp;T. Indomitable. Stronghorn. Legendary
---
i remember disconnects and long login ques
---
Your "honest criticism" was essentially saying "you shouldnt have even made the video its not realistic."
---
*He said that in the title*
---
You know WoW in general isnt very realistic, Blizzard just shouldnt have made it. Just my honest criticism.
---
That was my first server. I played on Horde. Alliance was stacked Skyfang, Death and Taxes and other great guilds. PvP was an uphill battle!!!
---
Many streamers are fine.
---
But have you seen their chat?
---
Streamer servers will be full of people from their chat.
---
Don't think hes talking about that though.
---
Sorry it went that way.  PvP is good in games, not so much irl.
---
Have a great time!
---
Building up the enthusiasm and passion
---
Haha that would be okay :D On June 21st I'll have one of the best games to keep me busy while waiting!
---
Better if you turn sound on
---
With some mana talents and a few int enchants you should be ok, maybe not for extended fights tho
---
Their fanbois are pure cancer
---
First: this has been discussed very much in this sub during late 2018 and early 2019, hence the possible negative reaction to this post.
---
Yes, many people agree that something will happen after one or two cycles of vanilla servers but there are many options of what it is. I like the idea of new, but not "better" (meaning best loot is not from there) content (dungeons, raids) made with the mindset of vanilla. Problem is that I would have to trust current blizz to make that content.
---
Because I cant trust the current blizz I would rather see the possibility of TBC servers being thought (careful with splitting the playerbase!) or perhaps a very careful twist to the new vanilla realms for example in the form of switching up the loot drops so that we have to find the gear again (for example Ironfoe drops from scholo now). Idea to that twist would be to  try and get that vanilla feel of discovery again. Even if I like the ideas I mentioned, I would be very careful with em, never taking away the "true" classic servers that try to be very close to a 100% match.
---
Ofc the twists could also be progressive itemization or original talent trees or so on. My point is that stagnant things die. We might be able to hold a niche playerbase to a stagnant classic server but a flourishing one would be way better for the community ( many argue that community is the heart of classic)
---
Even if some people say that the argument of "what after a few years?" is beaten or dead, it just isnt so just because someone shouted #nochanges to it. Those who think something might happen just got bored of the new wall-of-no that appeared. (Although seeing the people who first laughed at wall-of-no use the same tactic is rather amusing in itself)
---
Yes some people like your idea, some people dont and blizz will surely think about it in the near future if not at this moment.
---
In cataclysm. She joined the guild I was in a bit after me.
---
We raided together as a guild after some weeks I was afk in orgrimmar while autorunning was on and I was running against a pole. She saw it, made a funny comment about me afk running against that pole and after that we started to talk more, voice chat in TeamSpeak and so on. 2 months later I visited her, I got laid and I moved to her later the same year. We stayed together for 6 years. I broke up with her but stayed at where I moved to. 550km away from my hometown. Since, my life went uphill. I always thought I was like not social at all. But those 6 years showed me different.
---
Bruh it’s part of the culture of the game. 
---
People who listen to metal music don’t slit babies throats and drink their warm blood till it overflows from their mouth—all while eying crosses to flip upside down, either.
---
From my understanding if you are playing on a server where a streamer is also playing, there will usually be a ton of people following him/her around. Most of the time it’s a general nuisance to have so many people around in an area where you may be trying to quest or do whatever.
---
I see you're a hunter main who already tamed it's pet
---
Or maybe they’re not as active as you and aren’t aware that this topic has been discussed a lot.  Please be kind to people, even over the internet.
---
at least 2 mains, that's not asking too much right
---
A high skill cap doesn't mean the class is hard to play. Rogues also have low skill floor, any idiot can mash Sinister Strike to 5 CP and Eviscerate, but they also have a high skill ceiling that generally comes from knowing how to use their abilities most effectively in different situations.
---
Skill cap is also not comparative; saying Rogues have a high skill cap doesn't mean they are harder to play than Druids, to use your 
---
 example.
---
I was talking about WoW in general, not just vanilla.
---
Why is it always horde with the overcompesanted hate? I love to gank and world pvp too, but I feel like Horde always the one spreading cringy posts. And I’m horde myself lol.
---
This might be a new sub, or someone who isn’t very active here.  Please be kind to people, even over the internet.
---
Orcs were the original warlocks and shamans so they fit pretty well there. 
---
I'd say warrior is probably mostly orcs and humans. 
---
Mage I'm not quite sure about, would be highelves or bloodelves but neither are playable. Maybe humans because of Jaina?
---
Rogue is definitely forsaken and maybe gnome.
---
Druid is nightelves.
---
Hunter I want to say Tauren.
---
Priest and paladin probably human.
---
I am looking to go priest but at the last second I may go shaman.  I really want to do the Benediction questline, though, so that'll probably heavily inform my decision.  I also want skeletal mounts.
---
I’d recommend playing the normal way?
---
I heard ele shamans were pretty fun to multibox in vanilla. A lot of burst and heals.
---
sweet jesus thank you for the hard laugh ^^
---
why stop at 15 mages? I think you'll need to multibox a full 40 man.
---
Ya, it still is TBH. Mythic raiding in retail is enjoyable in general. It's just a very different sort of game than what WoW was.
---
Nice catch. :)  
---
No, this was a few years ago back on Feenix.
---
I fucking hate PvP in MMO's. But I'll probably still roll on a PvP server. I like the risk, the threat, and the world building aspect PvP does. Getting into a evenly matched 1v1 while out leveling always felt so epic.
---
I'm just going to roll Undead this time. I can't imagine how much money I'll save on cool points.
---
It kind of really depends on how fast you want to make money, your class, your spec, etc
---
For instance, a prot/holy specced paladin can clear SM in a very short period of time. Just pull the whole instance and let the mobs kill themselves against you as you heal and place consecration.
---
Farming mats, as others have said, is good to get ahead of the curve and stay ahead of the curve, but you won't be seeing that money too early on. As others have said (again) its probably better to just farm straight up money and vendor any of the trash you end up finding along the way.
---
I dont want to blow my PC :(
---
It was so large that I couldn't even see the top of it on my potato of a computer at the time.
---
This was from a few years back on a server called Feenix. I redacted the names and associations for others' privacy.
---
Big streamers come with baggage, and if they bring a ton of (generally awful) fans to a server it can significantly change the server culture, and if they leave you suddenly lose a huge part of your server population.
---
Little streamers are great though, I hope classic has lots of them.
---
I think you'll have a happy present in a couple years.
---
I put wow aside after a month or two of BFA like a lot of people, but BM Hunter in Mythic + was the closest the game has had to a support class for a very long time and I was loving it.
---
Heater! Got it from my mother in law as a gift
---
I was having this same thought myself. I've been a horde guy for life and wanted to try rolling alliance this time around because I don't harbour any hate for the faction.
---
BUT, I'm rolling horde, and I;ve been testing some stuff out on a private server and alliance druids get so hard countered by shaman that I don't even want to have to deal with them in a pvp setting.
---
gorgeous
---
I didn't say anything bad about the OP.
---
Pretty sure there was always a portal there, but it did nothing
---
It was a gift, so not sure :/
---
I'm just amazed that this is like most efficient way to level and you still need over an hour and you are still in Dun Morogh
---
It's going to be a long ass journey to 60.
---
Having to not eat or drink less is way more beneficial than killing a mob a tiny bit faster.
---
I think we will be actual star citizens by the time it does :P (that joke has probebly been made before)
---
I'm glad to see it's relatively split.
---
To be fair, I loved blood elves because of their lore and history from WC3. I never cared that they were the "pretty" horde race. But I know I'm an outlier in that regard.
---
I knew it!
---
I contributed my vote just to keep the strawpolls going and piss people off.
---
They couldn't possibly have known the exact release date back then.
---
Best one yet
---
Oh man.. this brings me back.
---
I thought it was just the arch without the portal.
---
No. this is classic, not whatever freakshow you dream it to be.
---
If the beta 'leaks' are to be believed, the level cap is starting at 30 which makes me think it could be a multiple phase thing over a course of a couple months.
---
Not for me. I don't want to burn out for release.
---
Must not spend much time in a data center.....HP is quite well used and popular by a lot of our customers.
---
I wish I could play a female model in an RPG but I just can't. I really use my character as an avatar for myself and I'm just so fucking manly and testosterone filled that I have to be a male model.
---
The only normalization that happened was the ability scaling from weapon speed in 1.9(?). This means that abilities don’t get bonus damage from slower weapon speed *on top* of already getting higher damage because of the higher average damage of slower weapons. The bonus damage part was removed, that way items like Barman Shanker aren’t bis through MC/BWL, and you don’t end up with 6k aimed shots. 
---
Hunters still want slow weapons because they’re easier to stutterstep kite with and to clip less in your Aimed Shot rotation. 
---
TL;DR Slow weapons were made less OP in 1.9 but they’re still kings, especially for hunters.
---
Sure but your response comes off as sort of hostile and aggressive.  I’m sorry if I misinterpreted it.
---
 Not my significant other but the one of ny mate.
---
I picked a new guild to raid in since our old guild disbanded. Nornaly we only logged for raids and weekly +10. Some dude wanted to join us with our weekly 10 and he and his mate were also dutch. So me, my mate and a other mate + this dude with his friend joined discord and we did the run. The mate of that guildie was a girl and the guildie was her bf. They had some issues and broke up soon after. She liked my mate on discord and they spoke for a bit. After a while decided to meet up irl.
---
Fun part is I always tried to push my mate to try out tinder or dating sites or whatever because it took him way to long to meet someone. He always said "Why can't I just meet someone in WoW". Now 6 months forworth they are still happy together.
---
how are any of the things you listed bad? all i see is a list of pvp events that make the server more active and fun to be on
---
Soo did it have any info on it or its just a piece of scrap metal with a pretty plaque on it?
---
Afraid not :(
---
I think the idea is that that was their target, and they haven't announced it in case they couldn't hit it.  But since it seems to be coming soon with all of these other hints, maybe they got it done in time for july 16th anyway
---
"Hm, so few health bars..."
---
"...oh. Warrior."
---
Cannabalism
---
Please learn how to read man. Vanilla will always be available to play, Blizzard promised this.
---
Never streamed, so not sure how to solve that i'm afraid
---
The real wisdom right here.
---
Ah yeah maybe
---
It's crazy, I've seen 3 surveys and they all have been wildly different.
---
Yea, I would say hunter is either tauren or troll for sure.
---
And for mage, definitely Gnome as well as high elves/blood elves (do high elves still exist even, or didn't they all become blood elves with the loss of the sun well?)
---
Good idea
---
This kind of granularity gets confused by the viability of off hybrid specs along with the fact that all the dps/hybrids can respec healer when they can't find a raid spot.
---
that is the biggest lie ever told
---
Your mana is used on stormstrike, situational shocks and earthbind totems. for pvp you will be fine as long as you bring water for inbetween encounters
---
I was High Warlord Troll Warrior, Rabius, guild leader of "Twisted" PvP guild on Shattered Hand EU for a good while. Good times. We had the best WSG team, unbeatable.
---
If only I could remember the names I would repeat them here.
---
&gt;Soo did it have any info on it or its just a piece of scrap metal with a pretty plaque on it?
---
The server comes with no hard drives.
---
I was considering going with a 5 box just for the challenge. I'd play on a PVE server, eventually transitioning all characters to one/two accounts to avoid having to spend infinite time leveling.
---
|Role|Alliance|Horde|
---
|:-|:-|:-|
---
|Tank|Warrior (Human)|Warrior (Orc)|
---
|Healer|Paladin (Human)|Shaman (Orc)|
---
|DPS|Mage (Human)|Mage (Troll)|
---
|DPS|Warlock (Human)|Hunter (Troll)|
---
I'd dual box level my Gnome Rogue/Night elf Druid or Undead Rogue/Tauren Druid depending on which faction's guild I slot into and is more sociable/fun. Supposedly, my friends are playing alliance.
---
Obviously, the function of this setup is to solo dungeons outside of regular grinding/leveling with some serious time spent trying to get the BiS for each of these at 60. Once that happens, I'll transfer the characters to probably two accounts with my primaries on one, and the secondaries on the second which I'll sub if I want to later. 
---
Some people get ancy when they hear about WoW multiboxing and say it's unsociable etc, but I'm honestly cool with slotting friends/guildies in any of the spots to save time. It's definitely a fun challenge to play it all simultaneously. When we have a release date, I'll get ISboxer again within the month to program my key strokes etc and figure out how to play **without** the addon so I'm not hindered by a delay in addon programming.
---
How would 15 mages be? I'm guessing you'd have trouble getting them all to 60 if they were strictly raid groups?
---
I started playing wow in 2004 with my boyfriend, now we're married with two kids. Our youngest is too little to play but I'm so excited to play with my 9 year old, it's going to be a lot of fun (and I can make her farm herbs since she loves that shit).
---
If your university has some kind of gaming club, that could be a good place to start.
---
&gt;What exactly are they leeching?
---
Cause making 10 minute "explain videos" about a popular reddit post that everybody can read for themselves is entertainment?
---
I think there are a few high elves around.  Pretty sure there is one or two in Boralus in retail.
---
wtf spoilers?
---
[This is why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev-cy000SaM)
---
&gt;shes always wanting to do some lame bullshit.
---
Tell her no then?
---
Everything is basically handed to them. They will have gold, boosts etc. If streamer plays as a warrior he will have a pocket healer on him during bg  at all time.
---
Some of them have gear handed to them during raids over normal raiders, especially mounts and rare items.
---
I wouldn't like to have anything like that happen on my server.
---
You didn't, it was hostile
---
It's Shattered Hand EU.
---
First there was a split from the main WoW sub, and now we’ll need a low-sodium version of this sub.
---
Yes but you need to have big bags. It is worth missing out on a significant amount of new spells around level 10-30 to buy bags on auction house
---
Maybe...if it’s capped at 30 I’d be more inclined to believe it’s because they really just want to make sure the early game sharding works as intended and to leave us wanting more for the actual release.
---
Yeah, people are thinking sharding = 4-7 people per shard, when it'll likely be 40-70
---
In one of the demos, there was a character named July. I don't recall where the 16th came from... I think the character was level 16
---
Mobs also do less damage to you when they die faster. How was much hp gain does spirit really give? Not much.
---
Read the rest of the comments in the thread?
---
I did not know that, but that is good news.
---
I could definitely be remembering incorrectly.
---
I hope I don't get beta invite because otherwise it will be impossible for me to focus on my exams :p
---
Why is only the L and I lower case while the others are ambiguous?
---
Oh I remember that.. I logged out smushed against the portal.. Hell of a fight to get there. Good times
---
Chest = Runed Bloodstained Hauberk?
---
Ya'll really out here thinking they expect Classic WoW to be some sort of revival or some shit?
---
We love classic, but it's still niche, and it's numbers will drop dramatically after a couple months. The only reason Classic WoW is a thing is because they realized there are enough people to make it worthwhile due to private server popularity. This is not gonna be a cultural revival of WoW or some shit like people say.
---
And the best part for Blizz? Once it's up, they will probably just have a skeleton crew monitoring to make sure the servers up. Never having to add brand new stuff and getting money for an old game must feel like a cheatcode to them.
---
Way to much priest, not enough rogue. No way that's going to be the actual population.
---
Seriously, a hunter that knew wtf they were doing was so great to have.
---
Everything but healer lol. Although I don't have much tanking experience so we'll see.
---
This would be awesome but not likely.
---
Well, we have a Discord chat where we can decide where to go - hopefully realm names will be revealed at LEAST a few hours before launch. If not, we can still coordinate on Discord and choose whichever realm we want
---
Sure, this argument is valid.
---
How is it best? Do you enjoy other people’s disappointment?
---
Alot of the old guides were written early on in the game cycle so they're not all that accurate.
---
Eh, tbh... not much hype for beta. If you've had any experience with p\*\*\*\*\*e servers, you've probably tried it all anyway. A beta for 15 year old content is vastly different from a beta for an entirely new game.
---
Most people will be just fine with watching streamers playing.
---
Meh, no dog bad edit,
---
On a serious note, I laughed so hard and I think I might catch Lyme disease around release date aswel.
---
Oh your life must suck if you feel the need to be overly hostile on the internet about classic wow.
---
Universal rule = BoE, everyone rolls need.
---
Go Deep Ret and only ever use Rank 1 Seal of Command.
---
- Great duo damage
---
- Near infinite mana using rank 1 SoC so no downtime.
---
I appreciate your insight
---
My dilemma is that I want to roll alliance mage, but all my friends and fiance want to play horde. Can't decide if I still want to roll mage or go orc lock
---
You’re not going to be killing it that much faster where you’ll noticeably take less damage. Plus you should be chain pulling mobs if you’re going for efficiency and while you’re doing that spirit is the only thing that’s going to be giving you hp/mana in combat.
---
I am pretty sure you know your capital’s FP by default (TB for Taurens, Org for Orcs/Trolls, etc). Even if you don’t, there’s a handful of quests in Mulgore that will need you to go near or in TB ti do, so grabbing it in your way wouldn’t take long.
---
Cool thank you
---
Ember guild! 🤟😎
---
/Najf
---
Truthfully? I do kind of enjoy that sort of thing. Because it'll bring out all those type of "sob stories" and them begging why they "deserve" to be in beta and how it's so unfair that they've supported Vanilla/Classic longer than some people in beta.
---
Bonus points if they have a friend who isn't even playing any Blizzard games gets into the beta.
---
They weren't very good early on. We're jumping right into 1.12 so it won't be as underplayer this time around
---
IIRC You can switch specs but you forget all of your recipes and need to relearn them if you try to switch back and the gadgets specifically require you to know the proper specialization to use them.
---
Honestly, you won't be seeing as much world pvp here as u will in real classic servers. Keep in mind in this video, all the communities are combined on 1 server, not multiple. There is more room, space, time, and people to go out and explore in packs to world pvp. I'm not saying some battle like this will never happen, but don't get your hopes up too high.
---
It is known.
---
I find the rivalry silly. One of the great draws of Vanilla was/will be that each factions offers a completely unique experience, and I am looking forward to rolling characters on Horde *and* Alliance. I mean, sure, I'll probably focus on one faction because of time constraints, but I like 'em both.
---
I was planning on rolling a Dorf Rogue as main, but lately I am pondering Orc Rogue, simply because I already mained Alliance fifteen years ago.
---
Well okay I get that, but I guess people say stuff like that from the deep disappointment, not because they feel entitled or otherwise.
---
a lot of the high end items are overpriced on pservers due to the competition (stuff like black lotus, devilsaur, etc)
---
twink item or not.
---
BOE = Everyone rolls Need.
---
That sounds awesome!
---
We dont need another poll since we already have one for this.  
---
Sage
---
We've come full circle.
---
I played a shadow priest but am thinking about playing something uncommon like warlock but looking at the results, warlock will be pretty common 🙄
---
I have no idea when the date is being announced. Just what the date is
---
Need? Equip it. Selling it falls under greed. AH spec does not have priority over other players' specs they used to contribute to the dungeon.
---
If he decides the AH it, he'll go on my ignore list. If other people are okay with it they'll group with him, but he won't be getting any invites from me.
---
I would love one of these but i have absolutely no idea how to display a server blade hahaha
---
Come swing by and we'll make a LAN party!
---
Just level with Herb and Skinning
---
+1 for creativity
---
&gt;This is why
---
Okay I get it now.  F streamers.
---
That was hilarious, many thanks!
---
How about multibox 14 accounts and you can pay for my sub with the 15th
---
This. Back in Wrath I lost a healy shield in heroics for my main spec healadin to shaman and ret offspecs they didn't even run the dungeon with. I thought it was a dick move, but a lot of players think it's perfectly fair. Clarifying the rules at the start really alleviates a lot of this.
---
Not gonna lie, old-school WSG was *terrible*.  Just no fun at all, dragged on forever, encouraged flag-camping, totally dominated by a handful of aggressively twinked out no-lifers.  I'm basically going to never do it.
---
Heck, with my gaming schedule being aggressively curtailed because of, you know, being in my mid-30s instead of my early 20s, I don't know that I'm going to be able to PvP at ALL.  Gone are the days of being able to spend two and a half hours in AV...
---
It's surprisingly big and heavy - it weighs like 7-8kg! Not easy to put on a wall, that's for sure.
---
Being that this Beta is strictly testing old content I dont think it will have the same hype to it. 
---
I would love to get in but will be just fine with watching from the outside.
---
exactly you bellend
---
you talk about fury warriors in the post
---
and you say they use mortal strike
---
you made it sound like fury use MS
---
I'm surprised that rogue is so low
---
Why's your sword upside down?
---
Dogshit post. OP gets enjoyment out of other people feeling disappointed, for seemingly no other reason than being an asshole.
---
That being said, its a beta for Classic WoW. I don't think people are going to be as butthurt as you think. Nobody wants to actually burn out that hard on a beta of a game that we have already played and loved.
---
Handies in real life to other players.
---
Literally untraceable by blizz.
---
Also they will fuck up the server balance completely. Imagine playing on Asmongold's server, a streamer with about 8k subscribers and 800k followers and regular viewers of 10k? 20k?, looking at a server cap from anywhere around - let's assume - 2500 to 5000.
---
Complete waste of time to play on there as a normal player - or any player at all.
---
Hey, your dickblade is upside down!
---
Human paladin, because of the paladin hero class in Warcraft III.  I had also played a half-elf paladin in Everquest, so was really on the paladin bandwagon.
---
I am 100% sure your math is correct
---
Will be 12th of August
---
finally a monkeynews video gets some traction in this sub.
---
Was it banned?
---
Don't ask me lol, it's usually only a couple copper. I guess people just don't check vendor price.
---
Is there an option for last week I said shaman, now i think mage, actually maybe rogue, well shaman is still lookin good?
---
Basically don't vote
---
I haven't played Horde for a long time, but Orc was probably my choice after Blood elves.  
---
I'd play Troll too, but I hate the fact they don't have shoes. xD
---
You wont get into the beta if it's closed unless you have connections. Plain and simple. It will be for press, youtubers/twitch streamers, friends and family. Blizzard's "Beta Tests" aren't really tests anymore, they're more like press releases. The exclusivity to streamers build's hype and boosts sales.
---
You left your /s behind
---
Roger that. But 166 top end dmg is still super very respectable and on par with crossbows and guns, right? I'm thinking of that epic bow from hunter's quest. I think it's the same as rank 14 pvp gun and xbow, so if I want to use a bow and have sick Aimed shots, than it's my only choice?
---
he got the answer that fits
---
if you are ahead of the curve ie a top100 quickest leveler then it should be manageable to farm some devils
---
Basically, I've given up on the idea of raiding or PvP.  Pre-scheduled guild-run dungeons and RP for me!
---
Multi boxers deserve to be ganked and corpse camped for eternity.
---
I'd watch that
---
myep the basic ones being gathering and open world mob farming for vendor loot
---
Download the extension called video speed controller. You can go down to 0.1 speed and up to 16x speed.
---
never had any consistent success with that
---
That's not true. I got into the Overwatch Closed Beta without a Friend or Family invite early on. This is when people were begging to the max to get in too.
---
I imagine Beta will probably be capped at Level 30 or something and be zone locked, so there likely wont be that many people. Yes streamers will get in, but random people will too.
---
DPS seems less demanding to me, if you're a Tank or a Healer, too much depends on you. xD
---
LOL, I had mine mining or picking herbs also back then. Although back then the 2 oldest were teen and pre-teen and a toddler.  Logging into Classic will be like its very own time machine in a sense, both in and out of game.
---
Oh edit .. Happy Mothers Day!!!! :)
---
Message boards aren't new. You generally browse, search and read rules first.
---
They're arguably the best PvP class, have easy leveling, have pretty good dps as the raid tiers progress.  They aren't a secret this time around.
---
Like I told the other guy. Message boards aren't new. A quick scan, search, etc is all you need to see them. We have some that are less than 24 hours old still.
---
There's no excuse.
---
Couple more pictures:

myeah if you need to ask this stuff then you likely arent good enough anyway
---
So, this is an alleged BETA teaser right? Or is it a RELEASE teaser.
---
I'm out of the loop.
---
Don’t really know him. What’s his target base?
---
I feel like stonescale eel is a safe bet, as alchemists are gonna be after it for flasks as they start getting situated
---
I don't believe for one second that we'll have more healers than melee DPS.
---
Not to my knowledge. I think it got compromised though because I had a 60 Tauren Druid that they said got transferred off the account and it had been so long they wouldn't be able to track him down.
---
Edgy
---
It's going to be delicious.
---
It's not?
---
One of many reasons why I love this game. People get so creative.
---
last 2 raids warlocks are top tier dps.....
---
Only played TBC for a summer, someone convince me not to play paladin
---
&gt;Release date is July 16.
---
I would be INSANELY
---
INSANELY 
---
surprised if it wasn't a July 16th release
---
Lmao anyone whose an osrs fan will remember winter 2017 as the mobile meme. The company promised a mobile release of the game in winter 2017, we got it fall 2018.
---
Or you could just not get all twisted up over something that really doesn’t matter.  There’s a downvote button for a reason.  You don’t have to throw a childish tantrum.
---
I played on Shattered Hand EU in "KaoS Contingency". It disbanded not long after BC release
---
I never said I wasn't an asshole. Truthfully, I do sort of laugh reading the QQ for any game when people proclaim why they should be in beta or early access.
---
It's like a bingo card.
---
"My friend doesn't even care and got in" 
---
"X streamer is a sellout and is going to quit the game after two weeks, while I plan to poopsock this game until my Mom forces me to get a job."
---
Everything is Hunter gear.
---
You're the real MVP
---
That is generally correct, but dps differences between weapons varies wildly while leveling. Don't fall into a trap of taking a vastly inferior weapon just because it's fast. Same for main hand. Weapon speed doesn't matter, it's base damage you want to look for. People say slow simply because slow weapons generally have higher base damage when compared to same level items, but when leveling it's entirely possibly you come across a weapon that's both faster and does more base damage than your current weapon. Use it.
---
Dude same. From what I know I'm the only one from my guild who doesn't have a family and stuff now (I was also the second youngest) so it's not surprising, but still.
---
Thank you! 💙
---
Gold
---
I never understood how they could justify coding it that way when the player is actually equipping boots with visuals on all other races. How does that work? Emperor's clothes thing?
---
LMAO “you bellend” made me laugh

Casuals don't pick Warlocks and this subreddit is not filled with casuals.
---
We cook your meals. We haul your trash. We connect your calls. We drive your ambulances. We guard you while you sleep. Do not f\*ck with us.
---
This is really really great to see. Shows they are really paying attention to details instead of just throwing the old data on a server and allowing it to be accessed by the new client. I saw several things I wouldn't have thought to remove. Very cool.
---
Hi, /u/blue2610
---
Your ignore list is only so big. I can only imagine all there toxic viewers spamming chat with stupid Twitch memes.
---
LOK'TAR!!!
---
Tauren Shaman/Orc Warlock. Will go Tauren Shaman/Elf Paladin when TBC comes out. Will take them to Wrath.
---
Honestly I can’t type anything that explains it better than this video. A good video that’s actually relevant and doesn’t do the same thing as everyone else. “TOP 10 SUPER SECRET GRINDING SPOTS THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT”
---
Troll or UD mage. Still have to decide. I like berserking a lot but UD just look cooler xD. Have to decide. I know UD is really good for PVP but I think I wont do any PVP. Don´t have time unfortunately.
---
I actually met my ex boyfriend (still friends to this day) over WoW in TBC. We continuously crossed paths in battlegrounds and he'd destroy me on his warlock. So much so that I made a toon on his server just to talk shit to him. Somehow that actually lead to me joining his Vent server and it just took off from there. We were together for a year until he stopped playing the game. It was a great way to keep a long distance thing alive. And as I said, we're still friends and still play games together to this day.
---
WoW. Why?
---
IMO, these polls are flawed.
---
You should have to pick faction first, then the class, or make Shaman/Paladin one pick as they are faction split "special" classes.
---
Otherwise, the % appear much lower than they actually are within a faction.
---
I will never get tired of watching this and the laughing guy being captioned.
---
Yikes
---
They also appear more popular because the info is skewed to make paladin/shaman appear lower % then they actually are within their faction.
---
hey dont copy me
---
I haven't seen this meme format used in like 5 years. Well done
---
Why did you break up
---
It doesn't account for faction specific classes paladin/shaman so these percentages are off by quite a bit.
---
Would be nice if the community got to play the beta rather than being forced through these content creators to get a peek at the game we love. Can't wait to laugh at the more vocally disappointend members of our community though, won't that be fun 😕
---
You're getting downvoted for being overly aggressive to a joke and throwing shade on the better faction for no reason.
---
When the hordes of casual players start playing this will look very different. Hunter will top the list. Probably rogue next. Mage after that, then warrior. Warlock will be right there.
---
This person has a humorous misunderstanding of the greek alphabet.
---
In vanilla no.
---
From the top of my mind, BFD, Gnomeregan and Uldaman are the three he recommends skipping entirely. Although I usually stop following the guide around these levels and go my own route so I'm not too sure what's his stance on Maraudon and Sunken Temple. You could find that on his website.
---
they paint their toenails with stats
---
Complete noob to classic.. can’t decide whether to play rogue, warrior or Druid. I want to be able to do pve (which I already know pretty well in the current game, but am probably a complete shitter in classic) and I want to be able to learn pvp. I only really like to play dps so I’m mostly leaning towards rogues at the minute. Can someone give me a brief rundown on the pros/cons of each please, need to make a final decision. Also the best races for alliance/horde for rogue, as I’m undecided on which faction to play too 🤪
---
Downvoted for playing on the server, epic.
---
You must live a sad life.
---
"Wtf rank 5 scrubs get into beta? Casual game."
---
&gt;No bigger tragedy
---
Half Life 3
---
That is so cool, your character looks like it's from another game.
---
Scilla server by chance? My GM's whole family played
---
how are any of the things you listed bad? all i see is a list of pvp events that make the server more active and fun to be on? 
---
you're clearly clueless because there is 0 reason to form 40man ganks in epl/wpl
---
Is there an add-on that'll tell you vendor price with the items tooltip?
---
You do realize that the private server community is not going to be all the people playing classic wow. Maybe if you play on the server with all private server players it will be like that. 
---
Also even if many people roll warriors and rogues how many of them will actually make it to max level
---
They have to rework Twilight Highlands from the ground up with low resolution textures and low polygon models in order to fit Vanilla's style, which is too much work and will never be done.
---
How do you know TBC and Wrath will come out?
---
I feel you, unfortunately the numbers arent going to add up. Since WoW classic doesnt have its own section for beta and is lumped together under "Warcraft", lots of retail players or people who aren't specifically into Classic will get into.
---
Doesn't mean the salt won't be funny to read tho.
---
I died laughing when ‘elevation’ came on.  This is just so, so perfect.
---
"Don't punish me, Big Daddy!" xD
---
Wotf aint bad in PvE tho.
---
Imagine spending $15 every month just to block mailboxes and questgivers.
---
When it comes to energy ticks replenishing (every two seconds?).. does this mean it's best to wait until a tick of energy is just about to replenish before opening on a mob or player so that immediately after your first ambush (or something) you get a tick of replenishment?
---
Does this ever mean you "waste" energy by timing the use of an ability wrong?
---
If no, what is the purpose of an energy tracking add-on when you can simply look at your energy thats by default on your character portrait?
---
That was never funny if you spoke German.
---
I was the guild master and raid leader of Memento Mori for several years (took over after Balambar). Good times! :-)
---
Played with a bunch of SH players on Frostmane
---
I wish I did meet my SO in WoW,cause we would have a lot in common.
---
So where do you go at 30
---
And Blizzard won't allow.
---
I disagree, in every game I've ever seen, it's definitely entitled along with disappointment.
---
I remember they said they'll consider TBC if classic does well enough, I have no source, only a vague memory tho.
---
Probably not. If a Casual is to play Classic AND get 60 they will get that on a Hunter. Hunter is the class where you put your friend that has never played before on it or else getting to max is unlikely. (source: everyone I know, including me, that was introduced through someone else got told to play Hunter)
---
However I don't think there will be many come BWL. But first couple of raid weeks will probably have way too many Hunters. Though if you're good it's not like it'll be am issue!
---
Lol, this is similar to my "primary alt" concept
---
Example, you go into scholo and wanna pull a full room with a druid tank, you gonna switch out of bear while you pull together 20 mobs? 🧐 you will have a bad time
---
&gt; https://www.wow-professions.com/guides/vanilla-engineering-leveling
---
Thank you
---
They’re the least gear dependant class for PvP. Can perform well as a fresh 60 in full greens if you have a good understanding of vanilla wow mechanics. That includes GCD, macros, utilizing your entire kit in a pvp scenario, etc.
---
That's my main issue too... Undead look cooler but orc is better for a warlock, and female orc doesn't even look that bad, it's just.. I don't really like playing females.
---
Found the priest main
---
To be fair, we ARE in a video game section of reddit talking about...a video game.
---
I just hope its open and they do one test for the starting zones, I really need to fully grasp how they will handle those zones so I can plan my strats
---
Hentai haven died so I need this game 
---
/s
---
ahh hsheet team blackout A ^^ greetings from Imbalanced :P
---
I don’t see it being this even lol. I expect 25% rogues, 25% mages, 25% warriors, and the last 25 is everyone else
---
A UPS will not make using a poor quality PSU any safer. What model PSU did you get?
---
thotbot was a thing back then
---
Depends how available is the beta. If they make it public, don't wipe after it and it smoothly transitions to official launch, like all those online games with OBTs, then I'd play it. If there will be a down time between beta and release, as well as wipes, I will wait for official release.  
---
I don't want to waste my time and having to start over a month later or so... even though I voted for the beta option, I explained under what condition I'd play the beta over official release.
---
 On the fence between druid and priest.  I want to play horde for the first time and I also want to heal. But I only like Tauren from the  available horde races and Tauren can't be priests, such are better healers,  so druid is the next best thing I guess.
---
Got a link for that Wallpaper in the middle?
---
Agreed. Hype is too real. About to blow.
---
It just makes sense. It's the only option that isn't dumb.
---
Wait...Pallys have nearly 11% of the vote?!? Guess there's alot of Pallys looking forward to PvP and/or healing in raids?
---
Not me but my best friend. 
---
He met his girlfriend during burning crusade. They were the top two priests on our server. Him horde, her alliance. Became friendly competitive then they decided to meet.
---
Why or? Beta drops AND release date announced! Thank me later
---
Haha thank mate ! Appreciate you checking the post / video. Gotta laugh at the "A" :)
---
I would play if I got an invite. Probably mess around with the first 20 levels or so and make some alts.
---
Rolling resto dudu feeling good now
---
I fail to see how multi boxing is fun? You’re not even really playing the game at that point.
---
It’s still unrealistic. Why even post it? Anyone can do this on an empty server
---
So Aggression &gt; DW specialization? 
---
Then how come the leveling guides typically invests 5/5 in DW Specializtion and 1/3 Aggression?
---
He must have thought it was the destroyer of worlds
---
This guy fucks.
---
On retail I was a belf dk, and I’m going undead mage now
---
I don't know how he can provide proof without causing trouble to his friend. If this is true, I'm a little bummed out, because 27th August is literally the end of summer. I was thinking early-mid July as the worst case and best case mid June.
---
who cares about ecelebs
---
Damn I’m rolling a troll hunter, hopefully he comes anywhere close to yours. Inspo!
---
One of my best memories in WoW was when i was leveling my DK at the beginning of Wrath, and this orc DK was apparently following the exact same quest path that I was taking, because I swear to God, we must have ganked the other while questing from Outland to Northrend dozens of times.  It went on for weeks.
---
yw mate ;) just logged in today to see our server is ded :( meh
---
Your body still wants the sugar it thinks it’s getting from sugar free drinks, leading people to consuming more sugar from food. Im fact people who drink sugar free soda tend to consume more calories from sugar than those that drink regular soda.
---
This is incorrect, there is no base game to buy anymore. Just having a sub gets you everything up to and including Legion.
---
Definitely human.
---
please no dont do this to me i dont know if i can take it if youre wrong
---
He knows people who were tho, I am sure. As a respectable member of the community and a creator, someone may have told him a thing or two. Someone he trusts. OR, hes just trolling us all, running off the hype that Tips created. Either way, lol
---
orc is better how?
---
people on this subreddit don't understand what skill is you're wasting your time trying to explain it to them
---
they think stuff like weaving autos is difficult with macros
---
I feel bad for the guys spending a lot of time practicing only to find themselves stuck in the queue when Classic launches until it’s impossible to get ahead of the crowd. Won’t be all of them, but definitely some.
---
Yes.  
---
Technically yes.  
---
You got it right.
---
Same same. Apparently in the q1 Financial hearing they announced that classic will be released in q3, not in q2 as I had hoped for aswell. :(
---
meh .. bad edit why does it have sound. Immersion ruined.
---
Imagine WANTING to be a bad guy. Alliance players are the protagonists. Horde players are mobs.
---
I agree that the Forsaken are the most disgusting playable race in video game history, but there will be low life Alliance players too that will disturb the Horde.
---
/s is for people that are too dumb to detect sarcasm
---
Is amazing how when you do some research and don’t just buy random cheap stuff you can end up with same things. 
---
An evolution of sorts.
---
So many mages he fights are allergic to casting rank 1 Frostbolt.
---
Been there, done that. It has noticeable long-term negative effects on your physical and mental health.
---
reporting
---
Met my best friend in classic and he was a random guy helping my holy priest out grinding the last level to 60. 
---
our friendships last till today, i was the best man at his wedding although we live about 350km away from each other still.
---
It‘s an absolutely wired story how we actually got where we are now 🧐
---
Alliance.
---
&gt;until TBC
---
What the fuck is with this insistence that Blizzard is going to simply reiterate the entire expansion cycle? It's Classic, not Classic+all the other expacs.
---
Anyway, I played a male Undead Priest as my first WoW character, and I was a Belf Paladin main in BC, so... Undead is my answer. Going back to the memories.
---
As alliance I usually finish Duskwood at 32. I like to do some grinding while questing so the zones more easily mesh together quest-wise.
---
&gt;Wotf aint bad in PvE tho
---
I mean, when the whole group wipes because everyone got AoE feared but you popped your WoTF right away and technically you were the last one to die, the blame automatically cannot be put on you. So yeah, Undeads rule!
---
Maybe our taste buds are different? It tastes the same only not as sweet.
---
Stooooooooooooooooop.
---
I live in hope, even during WOD we used to get some pretty large and drawn out Ashran battles (LUL Ashran) without the server taking a hit or it crashing. I also remember tagging along with a 40 man raid who were doing the For The Horde achievement and we caused absolute carnage in SW without anything crashing.
---
Idk if I want to play Ele/Resto Shaman or Deep Feral Druid. Both very fun. Played them both on private servers. Will probably have characters for both.
---
I enjoy streaming, meeting new people, having fun etc. I obviously am not in it to “make it” just to have some fun. 
---
Sounds like you are projecting.
---
whats coming out june 21st?
---
just play the game and be smart with your money instead of becoming obsessed with lategame
---
every 1-60 i've done i had about 800g when i hit 60, it's really not hard to manage your money and use the ah effectively
---
They will likely target very specific areas for testing. Like the starting zones (1-10), takes little to no time to level that much. Another may be 30-33 in Desolace. I doubt they would just say "go" and let us level all the way to 60 only to make people do it again in a month or two. That would kill hype, not build it. I suspect smaller chunks, a lot like what we got for Blizzcon Preview thingy. I just hope the beta is open so we can maximize the testing in a shorter time frame.
---
The accusation that something "riles someone up" is just a weak defense of people incapable of bringing up an actual counterpoint.
---
Just to illustrate how ridiculous this is: "Haha, you argued against me, that means you are so mad, haha, I win" &lt;-- you right now, essentially.
---
The drive to illustrate that something is dumb, is born out of consideration or amusement, not anger.
---
But don't think too hard about it...just tell me how angry I am, I understand that lying to yourself makes your kind feel better ;-)
---
Hol'up.
---
 Did I miss something about Tip's multitasking comment or is it just part of the meme?
---
I felt like a hostage. I was not allowed to go out alone with friends, while she said I need to find a friend. Kind of psycho-ish. She went out with friends etc.
---
After 3 years I knew I wanna brake up but had no real money for my own place. So I stayed 3 more years until I was financially stable enough.
---
The bigger question is HOW to avoid these streamers. Imaging getting to level 26 after a long grind and finding out Asmongold is taking over the server.
---
go back to twitch
---
Actually, you want to use slow weapons because you end up not clipping your autoshots while using Aimed Shot and Multishot on CD.
---
Debuff limit is already confirmed to be 16. Keychain exists in vanilla. I'm not sure what you mean by "run the data on modern wow servers".
---
Yep, especially in PvP it’s helpful to have that free energy tick
---
Technically youre playing the game several times over
---
Hahaha this is fucking brilliant mate, good job :D
---
Then play casually :) 
---
Nobody is forcing to grind dungeons intensively through the acquisition of gear and gold or even raid for that matter. Set yourself lower objectives. How about getting the Tier 0.5 set for the class you’ll play? The set pieces were scattered in different dungeons and it’s doable for the entirety of vanilla.
---
You're quite right. This is the fallacy of "sugar free" sweetener-laden food and drink. Sugar is bad but replacing it with man made chemicals is never the answer.
---
Except for the stuff I want changed
---
Wont multibox hardcore. Thinking of w
---
2-3 acxounts just to get a slight edge
---
Yeah... People saying othewise have no idea how a guild controlling PvP/colluding/extreme no-life'ing on a server is bad for the other faction.
---
Your starting faction capital city flight master is always known so you don't need to go to go to him.
---
The faction imbalance will completely 100% ruin pvp. Asmongold will be untouchable. I feel bad for them though. I would hate to have the game ruined for me like that.
---
Found the alliance scum! 
---
;P
---
If vanilla doesn't crater and they've considered BC in the past, Wrath is a given
---
lol only 86% upvoted. why are people so salty
---
Can you link the armory? would be cool to see it
---
I'm debating on if I want to stream my journey. I have no face cam so I'm not sure if that detracts from people enjoying a stream or not.
---
Sadly no, we all started on Arathor and then the boys migrated to other servers from there as they wanted to do more PVP than PVE.  They did keep alt's on Arathor for a long time so that we could get together.
---
In Vanilla there are two from the top of my head, the MC teleporter guy and Haleh who makes the Ony attunement necklace. I think there are some in Everlook, northern EPL and Dire Maul as well but I'm not sure. I know for certain though that there are no blood elves at all in vanilla and that some of the highelves become bloodelves during TBC, so maybe some of the highelves in vanilla are actually bloodelves, just with a highelf placeholder model.
---
Yea that one is dead, I play else where atm, but It was nice the record the video from a GM rank.
---
Trolls are my favorite ever since Troll Berserkers in Warcraft 3 
---
Gives us Dual Wield Throwing Spears Blizzard!!! 
---
Oh and Warpaint
---
Well in Retail first of all you don't fight natural engagements. Mobs respawn so fast and you're constantly phasing. Having area control means nothing. You have no reason to attack someone really.
---
Warmode sucks imo. Before on PvP servers you weren't sure if you'd get attacked. Tension was there. Now the people that have that mode on either just do it for the rewards and don't care if you kill them, or people run in gank squads to farm honor. 
---
Either way you can see what their motive is and dying means basically nothing with fast respawns and mob respawns. You never really care if you die. I found PvP in BFA mildly annoying at worst.

How to be you: **Confuse logic with public opinion.**
---
A: Logic: "All numbers that can be divided by 6 can also be divided by 3"
---
B: Opinion: "Most people think that Apples taste better than Oranges".
---
Do you see the difference?  
---
**I don't need any data to prove or disprove A.**  
---
I can formulate a mathematical/logical proof for it.
---
To prove B, I need to ask a statistically significant number of people and sum up the answers in favor of Apples against those in favor of Oranges.  
---
**I need data to prove or disprove B.**
---
I agree, I don't know where the insistence is coming from. On the other hand, they're going to have to do something to maintain a profitable player base. Maybe they will create specific content for vanila? They're going to lose a lot of new players already when they realize how hard it actually is, and when all the dedicated players are completely BIS, what's next?
---
I stand corrected. I just know he used mob tagging to do some sort of record.
---
all the control freaks coming out of the woodwork for classic lmao
---
Tbh i do see them releasing tbc and wotlk at some point because of the popularity but I sincerly think it was be seperate from classic. Everyone will need to reroll if and when they come out. 
---
As for me, orc orc orc. Orc shaman, orc warrior. Orc everything. Me THAT kind of orc.

Rogue pve endgame high dps, fun to play, fun item progression, moderately hard to level
---
Rogue pvp you will not regret the ability to pick your fights, escape, stealth, literally do whatever you want  
---
Warrior pve endgame top tier dps, feels like a chore to run a good rotation, still pretty fun though, very hard to level  
---
Warrior pvp -  get kited a LOT, usually relys on healers, can be frustrating, gear dependent, but when you have the right gear you can really make some people mad  
---
Druid pve - resto healer is pretty much the option, mid to high tier level  
---
Druid pvp - defensive style play, lots of running/kiting, high skill cap, well rounded, play maker, overall super effective and fun in pvp  
---
I kinda wrote this because I'm torn between the same 3 classes + priest. Pretty sure i'm going rogue though
---
The meme is "If" hints fall apart. (I don't think they will)   
---
Tips' comment is still suggestive of something big IMO, although I read somewhere that he deleted it and may have made some comment about it being overblown, I didn't bother fact checking or looking into the details because there's so many hints piling up, and even if he did, there's a good chance he's just protecting himself.
---
is there someway i can access my character screen/account/items without having an active subscription? i want to screenshot the characters/items i had in vanilla so i can have some sort of hard proof i actually played during that time when applying to guilds
---
The stun resist is miles better than anti-fear. Only really the warlock can reliably fear and they are quite rare, especially on Alliance side. Every class can stun though and some can do it very regularly.
---
On phone not at home. I’ll post link when I get back.

So many warriors?!? Damn I thought I was the only masochist here
---
See in classic there is assumed to be a feature called “respec” that you can receive from class trainers of your particular class. Basically it refunds you all of your talent points when you use it, and it costs an increasing amount of gold every time you use it. Good luck :))
---
Oh yeah that's true actually.

I was in a guild called TBOH on dragonmaw and it was run by a husband and wife, and their two kids were in the guild. It was a bit weird but wholesome. Also we defended astranaar...kinda cool.
---
Alright, thanks. I wasn't sure.
---
 This stupid job is getting in the way of refreshing /r/classicwow. Thought I might have missed something.
---
Should I subscribe now in case the beta is only available to active subscribers?
---
ay wtf why does it sound like my name
---
Druid/Rogue ftw
---
I'm just excited to have actual legions to a faction again.
---
It’s more that I just think it’s kind of pathetic in the context that this is a subreddit to be argumentative and mean.  Why argue at all, this isn’t some important political issue with serious consequences?  It’s just classic wow, let’s just have fun with it.
---
You may have to link it to battle.net but you should be able to login to see your characters. You won't be able to login to anything above level 20 without active subscription though.
---
Also note: you will have to find the realm you played on since it's been inactive since vanilla, your realms won't display any characters until you go to those specific realms character lists
---
Get my addons and macros set up
---
Level your professions. You wont be rich on week 2, but over the early raiding period, crafted gear can be quite good.
---
I also feel like homogenizing the factions with Belfs/Nightborne/Voidelf/Pally/Shaman aswell makes it not feel like two very distinct factions. Not to mention both factions have the same flashy mounts so I see no difference in the characters of both factions. Also same expansion friendly hub so you can kiss each other when you're in a city.
---
I can't tell the difference of the races(everyone is belf or velf) nor can I see what faction people are on their super sonic dragons. To me the factions are basically one and the same at this point.

Says the guy who was just criticizing people’s grammar on the internet...
---
Go to YouTube and look up Afk shaman healing in pvp. Lol
---
Yeah they wouldn't let certain players who got into the beta have an advantage during launch.
---
No, I did :)
---
They suck at 60 compared to others til they're geared but they're not bottom bracket after that
---
&gt; An upcoming UI for Vanilla World of Warcraft. Built for the 1.12 client. 
---
Don't you know that the API will be from the 7 or 8 client not 1.12 ?
---
I would expect having major rework to transition to the new client.
---
That is true, and I look down on everyone, regardless of faction, who preys on lowlevel defenseless people. Whenever I see alliance players do that, I write that down in my book.
---
Do you remember, the 21st night of September?
---
The way I treat p servers is I will occasionally hop on for like an hour, grind a level or so, and stop. Helps quench the thirst a bit. Definitely not enough to make me feel attached to my character, which is what I'm trying to avoid until classic.
---
That is 3 years ago, the break up.
---
My current mouse costs more than my monitor did back then.
---
&gt; and to clip less in your Aimed Shot rotation.
---
I know, I said that already. Not the only reason slower weapons are better.
---
Nah they wouldn't be that stupid...
---
I can't imagine that blizzard will let us keep our beta characters. While it's true that other games have let us do that, I don't think blizzard would really go for that. Who knows, I could be wrong though.
---
I so second this. I played almost all DPS in Vanilla and started tanking at the beginning of BC. So I've told myself I will play a priest healer this time around and actually switch up the game play a bit.  If this game is *anything* the way it was in Vanilla... there will be a **LARGE** scarcity of healers.
---
I have a hard time believing that a large majority are actually going to want to be healers. Truth is it is never as appealing to the player as DPS is.
---
Now someone do an edit with that laughing guy speaking... Spanish? :D

This is barely a concern in PvP where you don't have even close to 100% uptime.
---
Very nice. Sounds like you have the same idea as modUI, except yours looks cooler.
---
I would 100% play Classic on a Model M instead of my current keyboard.
---
YAAAAAAAAASQUEEEEN
---
Nah. Both sides are the same. Healthy mix of both personalities.
---
Yes there is no rule to their post consistency. But its upsetting, to say the least, that they would make a blue post roughly once a week for a while and then just stop with no warning or clue as to why.
---

---
The great apocalypse will happen if we don't get a release soon, I think ;-)
---
Even if it came with hard drives, the only info on them would be the OS.
---
I'm down for "content, not progress!"
---
But I'd also maybe be down with just a complete reset every three years lol...
---
Warrior feels like a god when you have a healer friend and is still good without. Rogue is a very skillful class, especially if you can vanish incoming damage again. You won’t have cloak of shadows so dots will be your worst enemy and you’ll be very weak while your cds are down. Hunters are extremely annoying too. I don’t have experience with druids but they’re great flag carriers and good 1v1 with a lot of demand in pve
---
PVE DPS in classic is super easy.  If you know current pretty well you're more likely to be bored than challenged.
---
Op is new, so to him i will give my opinion, which is no. Fresh servers launches preserved the Pservers for over 10 years.
---
For the rest of the posts that are pro-changes....the cycle will repeat and we will end up with BFA.
---
Trusting the mob rule, which is filled with the "i should also get medal even if i lose", to vote for changes that are to be implemented by different team that drove us to want classic in the first place.
---
And as a bottom line, there is Activision. I just love your enthusiasm and trust.
---
And the game wont die, it wont have millions of players after few years, but fresh servers will keep it alive. Maybe sometimes it's not the game that should change, but you.
---
Haters will say it's fake.
---
Because it's Tips and he committed the cardinal sin of not playing the game 15 years ago.
---
**Store button is removed**
---
It's no sooner than the start of Q3 which is July 1.
---
u dont just pick an exact day like a year out and get it perfect, a month sure. 
---
if they release on july 16th it most likely means they went out of their way to specifically release it on the 16th.  unlikely they would rush it out, which means they delay it.
---
how annoyed would ppl be if blizz delay classic for the sake of it
---
So you speak german? You must be Hitler then

So I watched last night and nothing suggests ferals would be at the top of the meter if using rip. Ferocious bite seems to be better pretty early on anyways.
---
No, I did it :)
---
No, I did this :)
---
I think you should give her a summary of each class and don't give any suggestions. Just tell her she made a great choice and let her enter the world. Give her time to read quests but don't force her to. You should be a secondary character in her story.
---
Go mining/skinning for leveling and vendor the skins, then pick up engi at 60
---
And then you end up with a watery drink. Coke sucks.
---
Hmmm I know you want a physical book but dude gamefaqs.com has tons of guides, print them out for a physicalish copy maybe? I had dial up as a kid and printing out gamefaqs guides is the ultimate nastialgia for me. Also I’m sure amazon has a selection of WoW guides.
---
Unclutch your pearls.
---
i broke the dam
---
I've seen tons of alliance folks in the main sub dead seriously attacking horde players for some of the lore stuff the players didn't obviously have any role in. So yeah, the hate goes both ways
---
This thread is exactly why they will never give a release date. Once they do they are pressured into releasing that date.
---
I would prefer a polished game that doesn't require a load of bug fix hot fixes in the first week
---
Downfall parodies...ah, that brings me back.
---
10 years ago WoW was a different game...
---
Make your own!
---
A number of us have put together lever arch folders for the classes we will be playing so we know what levels to return. what drops from bosses, quests with rewards we want with instructions, Item progression lists etc
---
What are those side monitors? Can you have wow on middle screen &amp; open up tabs and browse the net on the left or rightside acreen, multitasking?
---
That escalated quickly.
---

---
I would upvote but you have an alliance symbol for some reason on your monitor. Loktar ogar
---
Me too
---
what the fuck is wrong with you lmfao
---
Both mage and rogue are solid picks. Might have an easier time if you go with mage. As for druid, you might wanna do a solid cgunk of research on the class before committing

If they need it make them equip it easy
---
Has anyone compiled a list of things players entering classic are going to need to know? For example little things such as "You need to buy spells, and they'll have ranks". I can remember a lot of stuff but I'm sure I'm forgetting some. And for players who never played vanilla it would be a handy little list.
---
Oof yeah sounds like she was extremely controlling and contradicting! Glad you are doing better now and get to enjoy classic in peace !
---
If you didnt squeeze every ounce of loot out of him ill be dissappointed
---
If you're leveling a rogue with a friend, what class do you want your friend to be?
---
I thought this was going to be a picture of the Sun ;)

[https://imgur.com/wTNNVAa](https://imgur.com/wTNNVAa)
---
Yep. In the past, Blizz has selected beta players partially based on hardware, too. They want a certain number of people on old machines, macs, rare video cards, etc.
---
So that person who plays retail on a 7-year old MacBook has a better chance at beta than someone with a modern gaming rig or someone with unknown hardware.

I've always mained a druid. Not until now have I found out why I'm so drawn to them. Majestic *and* cute. damn right

This is the first one that is wide spread enough for me to know about it, I do not frequent this sub, just heard about it through the grapevine. Does that mean anything? No! I am just saying this one is more substantial in size than the others
---
I’d rather have the upper edge in stv, planning to stay 1-2 months at around lvl 30ish for a gank fest. Eng from beginning is a must for me
---
Did you turn it on, is there any data at all on the hard drive?
---
We did the same, rolling Alliance because our little guy who was 9 at the time wanted to be a gnome rogue &lt;.&lt;  We took our time and played together, joined a guild and had a blast. The kid lost interest...we rerolled Horde and never looked back hahahaha  good times :)
---
I know, that's why I play Vanilla and don't want to touch Retail.

Elvui is confirmed to be in the works for classic:  [https://willitclassic.com/view/XljRN8QtvZHRT0IcvEyo](https://willitclassic.com/view/XljRN8QtvZHRT0IcvEyo).
---
The shitposting on this sub is on a whole other level.
---
As far as beta goes, you can just ask a streamer to check lag switch face stab or /sit for warriors. Maybe ask someone to farm 12 hours of elite mobs in the 30-40 bracket and open the junk boxes for data collection to see if it still matches the data I have from actual classic.  Private servers have junk box loot ratio's way messed up. (Too many rogue diaries, not enough blue daggers.)
---
Been signed up to every Blizzard beta since like 2001, never gotten into a single one so I'm not holding my breath for this on either.

Fake. Purchase classic characters?!?! Lol what?? That doesn’t make any sense.
---
So can someone tell me if I'm right or wrong regarding Tauren hunters. Since they're melee range is 7 yards, does that that make their dead zone at 7 to 10 yards instead of 5 to 8 yards? Also if this is the case do they get an extra 2 yards of range?
---
July 27th or 28th.  I don't start my summer holidays until then.
---

---
why are you so butthurt about it?
---
That’s the guy who touched my ass!
---
Rogues are one of your biggest threats, and if you resist one stun, you're already miles ahead of the warlock that didn't resist it.
---
Care bear alert
---
Actually thinking about rolling horde this time around myself.
---
My first ever character was Alliance, some friends pressured me to switch to Horde to play with them, then after some back and forth I settled for Alliance only and I usually keep to myself and don't attack others just because I can, but when they do I defend myself as best as I could.  
---
For this reason I don't know what class to roll as I want to be able to defend myself and also be useful in dungeons.
---
I believe this is the correct answer.
---
I don't think anyone cares about Blizzard's motivations. It won't make it any less revolutionary. They already made it clear a few years ago that they did not want to do this. Nobody really cares. We just want to play Vanilla.
---
Just subbed
---
Where is this cross realm BGs info?
---
All I’m going to say is I have 22 June- 7 July off work so I hope it’s in that window.
---
Are you really equating "most people don't like to be stolen from" to a subjective opinion on the taste of fruit? This might be some of the dumbest shit I've seen someone try to argue online.
---
Thanks for your useless comment
---
then why didn't it answer your question?
---
I don't know if I would consider it "control freak". Having a structured guild environment is beneficial even for chaotic PUG guilds.
---
They definitely do
---
a meme to surpass metal gear
---
Rhok will still get the job done, but you’re much, much better off with Ashjre’Thul. That requires the xbow dropping from chromaggus and winning it over the other hunters, both of which are pretty hard. 
---
Rhok will last you a long time. I used it until I got the KT xbow on a recent pserver, since the only Ashjre’Thul that dropped in my guild went to someone else.
---
Hi Calx.  This is Goosnargh.  I still have an occasional pang of guilt over you getting banned.  I probably could have been a lot more discreet about it while I played your char.  
---
I found this thread while looking to see if anyone from Spinebreaker was planning to play Classic.  Do you know anything about that?  Would be a lot of fun to play with some familiar faces.
---
The less stuff having to be communicated back and forth between server/user decreases packet size and may lower "lag" lots of these changes are purely ui related and wont change anything as far as lag is concerned because they are all local.
---
So they would sit on a finished game while fans are pulling their hair out just so the game can release on WoW's anniversary?
---
From what I know about MrGM, he has always been my go-to for actual information. He often does reports on data mining and has pretty concrete information. Now I see him teasing something on twitter. HMMMMMM

If you're among the 100 million or so people who speak German, you can easily just mute.

If you're among the remaining 7.54 billion people, the sound makes it better.

Someone following a speed leveling guide for the first time will take almost 4 times as long. People winging it will be even longer.
---
24-0-27 is more about mana efficiency than healing power. The theory behind the build is that once you have enough high level gear, it is less important to have +heals than better mana regen.
---
As for what counts as “normal” the maximum amount of points you will ever need in the resto tree is 34 as this will give you every single useful healing skill (with only one point in nature’s focus which you could bump to 38 if you really wanted to).
---
Improved tranquility and subtlety aren’t needed as Druid’s basically can’t steal aggro other than at the beginning of an encounter (when you should know better than to steal aggro).
---
With 38 points in resto you can still get 13 in feral for the feline swiftness and bear charge. With 34 in resto you can then pick up auto root.
---
The vast majority of players should not use 24-0-27. I personally recommend 4-13-34 for maximum healing efficiency and great PvP flexibility if you’re going to be raiding as this gives you some good skills and the ability to be a wicked pocket healer.

It won't be.

Keys for beta tests for WoW (at least since launch) were always sent out randomly even to people that are no longer subscribed. That's how I ended up testing Legion for example.

They actually aren't. Most warriors will be in for a surprise when they realize they get fucked on every time they step into the world.
---
Extended melee range, deadzone and max range. The range at which *targeted spells*/autoattacks can hit you is also extended.

---
Hoffentlich. Aber lassen wir uns Überraschen ^^
---
Thanks homie
---
Since we can't create custom Units like we could in Vanilla I don't see a workaround.
---
People asking about who is in trouble etc. MrGM is fine. Where he got his info.... That person may not be fine if it's accurate. Just saying. Someone's in deep shit if something goes down lol.
---
Troll or undead

&gt; KT xbow
---
Pretty sure I'm not gonna do Naxxramas, i've read that it's too time consuming and MC quest is less so (?). So I guess Rhok or Ashjre'thul are some of my best options. Thanks for the reply :)
---
same here. But if there is no way to get focus frames then im ok with it, as everyone has to struggle.
---
Would be kinda meh if theres a workaround only a hand  full of people know off and abuse.
---
Holy fuck, that was awesome.
---
How do you make someone equip it?
---
Hitler loves Classic WoW.  Got it.  Betcha he plays on a PvP server as a human paladin and only raids Horde capitals.
---
Alliance obviously. All horde races look like butts sans belves

I would roll and sell it on the AH.
---
You guys are crazy if you think think items aren’t worth the gold.  The item isn’t a Need item unless it’s BOP.
---
Think of it this way:  the item is worth 100g.  Whoever wins can just pay 100g to buy one, had it not dropped.  Why should this person be entitled to a twink item?  They’re probably going to level that character to 60.

I think there isn’t a problem with that. He did technically did need it but decided to sell it instead. There isn’t a difference between him selling it out equipping it, you still didn’t win it. 
---
If I were in his shoes, I would have offered it to the priest at a discount
---
Here's what I've never liked about the default player frames: the bars are too thin. If you made (maybe just an option) both the health and resource bar twice as fat that'd be great. I'd probably use this then.
---
Say, the top of the health bar is flush with the top of the portrait frame - and the lower end stays were it is, or goes to the middle of the portrait frame. Then the resource bar continues from the there while being thicker (probably 2x, or ending where it meets the top of the ToT frame) than what it is. (Going by the pictures)

Is reality better or worse than I predicted?  :P

clap
---
Seconding this!
---
I'm a negatives and positives guy
---
or maybe theres just nothing big enough to warrant a blue post. "oh hey guys were making the ui look more like vanilla" doesnt exactly need to be stated in a blue post
---
That was amazing. Great work!
---
A classic meme for classic WoW, take my upvote.
---
Even if it's not a beta, we know something significant has to be next just due to the fact there hasn't been more than 7 days without an update (usually no more than 6). But as per your meme, yeah I'll be a little bit sad if it's another "spell batching" type post.
---
Hunters - pull Baron Geddon into Garr room with Pet. Not essential but fun :)
---
Yeah but it's a cheap compromise. #nochanges tho
---
Probably any of the lucrative spots that people compete for, Tyrs Hand, Azshara satyrs/elves, lotuses, devilsaurs, Twilight cultists.
---
What's next is speedruns and rerolls. That's how private servers have worked for years. And it takes a *long fucking time* to get an entire raid into BiS T3 gear.
---
If they simply reiterate their entire development cycle, then whatever. Maybe they do it, maybe they don't. But people treating it as an inevitability is silly. This is a good business move on their part because, beyond implementation and original upgrading of the game coding, they won't need any content or balance teams. They'll have minimal overhead with support, and they can get a residual revenue stream while working on new content.
---
Releasing each iterative step of their old expacs would require the same years-long amount of data-diving and scrounging that it took for them to make an authentic Classic, alongside all of the upgrading that it took to put Classic on the BfA framework, and then they'd need to make entirely new servers to duplicate characters onto (lest they piss off the Classic players). Does that mean they'll never do it? I dunno. But it took them a *decade* of insistent, incessant pleas from the playerbase, alongside extremely popular Vanilla private servers, to dedicate the time they've given to Classic. And TBC/Wrath servers are much less popular than the variety of Vanilla servers. There isn't a fraction of the overwhelming public will, the overhead would cost even more than in Vanilla, and they have few financial incentives to do such a thing. I wouldn't hold my breath if I were someone who wants to see TBC servers.
---
One escort quest at northwatch has you escorting what I am 90 percent certain is a blood elf.
---
If I could Id not choose any faction, just be human, but without any allegiance. I understand that the majority is backboneless
---
Even Towelliee is part of it now. His stream title today:
---
&gt;Starting Our Descent Into Soon™ Land | Timer Begins Tomorrow
---
MMORPG in offline mode. Yikes.
---
Ah, a real hunter weapon right there, good for you!
---
Damn you should have quoted what he said. I bet it was really stupid.
---
And that would be perfectly fine. Or even just a Beta and no release date yet would even be okay.
---
Yeah now that I think about it I think you're right, I remember it clipping the ground when it was out.
---
Yeah old horde races are ugly af, but my friends all refuse to roll another alliance character so looks like I’m going horde.
---
When the game first came out I rolled a Nelf Humter.  So much fun to level...never had any problem dinging through levels.  But as a casual gamer once I hit the upper levels and 60 I couldn’t find groups.  
---
My next character was a troll rogue and I had no problem finding groups.  
---
So i don’t know what I’ll do this time.  I think mage might be a good answer as they’re not too tough to level but are perhaps a little more utile for sheeping and aoe.  
---
Interested to hear what others think i’m far from an expert.
---
I like those G &amp; F keybinds all the way over in Africa.
---
I wouldn't expect anything until the 15th at the earliest. I know tips hint had to do with the 19th, and something else was supposed to be the 15th, which mrgm hinted at. I think it's beta announcement on 15th and start on the 19th? Guess we'll know in a few days.
---
I go warrior, which isnt very good in pvp until 60 and geared. Mages are always good in pvp for example. But once Im 60, and arms, equipped wiht potions, Ill make sure the cleanse what I think is detrimental.
---
They get backlash for a lot of things, but those farming methods weren't used back in Vanilla, so removing them would actually make the game more vanilla than keeping them in. The private server players might cry about it but most people wouldn't care.
---
This is true. They do tend to only make blue posts when deemed important.
---
Beyond what was mentioned combat gets riposte which is really good against warriors and rogues. Daggers has more on-demand burst but is hard to spec in to if you plan to pve as well
---
Lucky one :( How I could convince my gf to play with me? She loves fantasy books and board games but not much computer and everything related. Anyone with proven method? :/
---
How did you know?!?!
---
Bradygames makes a strategy guide for vanilla
---
Lol, Paladins have double the popularity of Warriors in this poll, that's insane.
---
There's like, one major TBC server and one major WotLK server. Vanilla servers are far more popular. Simply in terms of the measured, readily available playerbase already resorting to piracy, there isn't a clear reason for Blizzard to do anything beyond the currently slated Classic content.
---
Things can change in time. I'm not omniscient. But as I detailed to the other respondent, I wouldn't hold my breath if I were a TBC fanboy (and I actually am a TBC fanboy).
---
Think I saw a book on Amazon for levelling, dungeons and a gold making guide by some guy called Vincent Verret. Not sure if you can still get it on Amazon but you could also try eBay.
---
Survival PvP specced too. People would run in my deadzone thinking it was safe then get a 2k damage raptor strike.
---
For sword spec war abilities can, and I don’t believe so for non sword unless your using a weapon or trinket that can proc them
---

I like that you hovered over the clock for the screenshot, 0:00

Druids are so furry and cute! Lmao!
---
Nobody extends testing for the sake of marketing. Testing is expensive, both directly in terms of testers and maintaining the environment and indirectly in terms of subs.
---
Obviously one can never count on the reliability of these polls, but it's nice to see the results to this one are a little more well-rounded than the usual ones. Althought, that might change by the end of the day, so, yeah.
---
Curse you!!!!!!!!!
---
Same here, lol
---
Very true, I do think that less classes compounds the issue in Vanilla though.
---
I just dug out my old Warcraft Guide too :D
---
Druid. Stealth creep together plus heals.
---
He said "k"
---
Same with Paladins. They're crushing every other class if you divide by 2.
---
Everybody loves a mage
---
Druid is probably more survivable. Paladin can last a long time, but unless you bubble hearth, you can't really run away that well, especially from more than one enemy.
---
And then your paladin actually became good
---
Looks great! I'll give this a try when Classic releases.

they took away mana? what the fuck?

So let’s say I’m out in the world questing, and I may even die. I finish up all the quests and head back to the city and my current chest is 22/40 durability. But one of the quest reward is an improvement on my chest, so I equip it right away. Now I head over to repair and sell my stuff. Will the repair cost include the chest that is no longer equipped that’s low on durability? Or should I sell everything first, then repair?
---
Classic burning crusade will be even bigger than classic
---
sweet thanks man!
---
Jaedenar
---
1 in a million? You're buggin bro lmao. And if I sound arrogant to you then it's because something I said resonated.
---
As I will be off in two weeks, I really hope they wont release too soon :p
---
You know Shaman and Paladin are faction specific right
---
You might be able to find a written version of Joannas guide, there were a few on eBay back in the day.
---
I would hazard a guess to say they will be in, but if they're not, the Morrowgrain quests are a way to get Darnassus rep too.
---
Yea, I feel like healers are super overrepresented here.
---
Was lucky enough to play with and chat to Cableguy a little bit through Shader (awesome undead rogue who eventually moved to Stormscale to join ZOMBIES or DOOM SQUAD, can’t remember which), to top off how good he was on WoW he was training to be surgeon IRL if I’m remembering correctly.
---
Had no idea he was actually e-famous outside our server though!
---
Scaling does happen.   
---
MC warriors, warlocks and hunters with do X% of damage  
---
Naxx warriors and warlocks will do &gt;X% of damage while hunters will do &lt;x% of damage.
---
This is just how it is, it isn't a reason to or not to play a class. All classes are viable and needed. Understanding your role as X class through the entire span of play is important to many people's enjoyment so should be considered.
---
We all know the Internal Beta started a few Weeks ago and we all know the Public Beta is coming Soon™. The Beta will not take long, since there is nothing new to test, just the general Gameplay and small stuff the Devs might have missed. I don't think the Beta will take more than 6 Weeks. It will be a focused Stresstest.
---
It might be better that you stay analyzing whatever you analyze now and leave this to the people who knows their shit.
---
Can you remove the griffons?
---
If I can find a way to limit mana I’d love to buff might. With warrior/paladin stacking AP it has to be crushing.
---
Wow, what an odd question.
---
Im a bit out of the loop. What was the hint that tips said?
---
If you click the repair all button it will repair items in your bags.
---
Haha, yeah I also get that tbh. Not to mention it's much easier to name a male character rather than a female. Ah, if only trolls could be druids in vanilla...
---
Hopefully they send out betas to people who have played since nov 04, with an active sub, and also played the blizzcon demo and provided feedback.
---
Raid portal in Strat was intended to port to Naxx, no ?

I second this HP enterprise is good stuff

Yes, yes I am very much aware of this. I thought it’s still nice to have the genreal idea and look already layed out so that when the time comes, I can go to work on it and already know exactly what needs to be done.
---
Make some flyers and put LFM on them
---
There actually was barely any in vanilla, on pservers using 1.12 there are a TON, on my experience so far, pve servers = tons of warlocks on the alli, not so many on the horde, pvp servers = tons of warlock on the horde, almost no warlocks on the alli.
---
Isnt that a quote from Warhammer ?
---
Ahhhh zinrokh, I wanted that for so long but never saw it :(
---
[Literally asked and answered not even a week ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8hx8po/which_patch_allowed_runecloth_rep_turnins/) You would have found it with a simple Google search.
---
No, it won't. The quest was not added until later in Vanilla.
---
Go Horde or go home, I don't see the issue.
---
Which means it's shockingly high for paladins for example! Gotta ~double the percentages
---
If pictures like these give me such intense nostalgia, I’m not sure if I’m mentally ready to play WoW classic when it returns.
---
I thought the trade ins come with patch 1.5 if you use search you will find topics
---
Except Warlocks. But it is a very versatile class in pvp.
---
If I had 10 to 15 hours tops to spend on the game and rolled pvp, I'd be rolling rogue or Druid. Stealth is just too good of an asset, especially if you have kids. You simply choose whenever/if you want to fight. I expect servers to be crowded af and you might have a hard time leveling as a mage. 
---
Quote me if I'm wrong but i feel like mages get most of their potential later on compared to other classes. 
---
As a main druid , I can assure you that you do have the means to kill w/e you want. Rotations take some time to learn but it's nothing you can't overcome. Wpvp is where you truly shine and it's tons of fun. 
---
Rogues always will be rogues. Deadly efficient. I'll be rolling one this time around.
---
ofcourse ;)
---
If you’re just gonna try addons you shouldn’t really be on the beta. It’s for testing.
---
First of all, you're wrong in almost every way imaginable.
---
Second, you should probably attend more lectures and solo less kegs at parties.
---
What spec do mage take in bgs
---
This made me laugh! Well done!!!
---
Yeah this seems off. You should be developing on BFA. Then when wow beta is out, you can see which API methods they decided to lock down for 1.13.
---
That's Shattered Hand EU? If so... nice! Used to play there entire vanillla tbc and till this very day!
---
Returning for WoW Classic for sure! 8)

Hello. Did Blizzard say anything about WoW Classic being free up to lvl 20? That would be awesome. Thanks.
---
I don't belong to many online communities (I don't have any social medias accounts) but WOW seems to attract quite a lot of sick fucks that enjoy the pain / distress of others and worse they seem proud of it ...
---
I think it's the PVP aspect of the game that attracts those profiles.
---
Thank you, yes modernist and modui has been a great inspiration indeed!
---
The 2nd edition of the Bradygames Master Guide is pretty solid (great intro guide for beginners). It was written post 12 patches, which is pretty much right where wow classic will occur. The only difference being the further phase items dropping later in classic. The dungeon companion is a really good resource for basic strats, layouts and various hidden/confusing aspects of classic dungeons. Both were published in 2006, before BC released, so they have the most updated content that's relevant to wow classic.
---
Does the middle monitors refresh rate being 144hz, and the side ones 75hz cause any issues for you? When i connect a 60hz monitor to my main 144hz Asus PG279Q 27 it lowers the Asus to 60hz
---
Thanks and sorry mate

And here I am Digging for that sword for the same 10 years. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Pretty nice troll, Mon!

Oh man, this Hitler meme-format takes me way back. Thank you!
---
I own the Bloodscalp EU server blade (where I played from vanilla and my main chars still live).   Currently hanging on the wall of my man cave.   Good stuff.
---
Low effort troll, C-
---
Look at all these angry nerds you've created
---
Are there hybrid builds that allow you to be sufficient in both PvP and PvE? Or do you just have to respec when you want to switch it up?
---
Any raid frames pics?
---
bravo
---
I don't think Blizzard will do anything - Classic self-polices. Steal mats for +4 stats on chest and your character is forever blacklisted for anything at all.
---
Have you ever looked into how amazingly well EQ has done with progression servers?
---
MASSIVE sub boost every time a new one launches.  *Every* time.
---
Depends what you have in mind. Most hybrid builds will work from 1 to 60. Like Ele/Resto sham can heal dungeons and own wPvP. Same goes for Ret Pally afaik. And Druid.
---
No one specs fucking riposte for PvP. Please...Hemo or dagger, everything else is a meme for PvP.
---
Deep Combat for PvP, you should get banned from this sub for suggesting trash like this.
---
What steps did you undertake to recover? I need to do a similar thing, would be useful to hear your process. Thanks!
---
Interesting, thank you, I was deciding between hunter, mage or rogue. My only experience thus far is raiding in Wotlk, ICC mainly.

Troll. Only played BE for paladin. But seeing as paladins are only good for healing in vanilla im going back to the master race!
---
Listen to this guy, op. The only one who commented who actually knows what he/she is talking about. Take my upvote.
---
Ur a god
---
Playing the beta will just ensure you get to replay the first 20 levels or so.
---
Oh OK, but why not develop and test on BFA ? I would guess the changes needed would be minimal compared to 1.12 --&gt; 1.13.
---
I don't have the specific talent tree, but it's definitely deep frost as a standard. If you wanna go for one shots, it's pom/Pyro.
---
Yeah I agree that’s way too long in my opinion. The hype will die
---
They haven't mentioned anything regarding a free trail period for Classic yet.     
---
I don't think we'll see anything in that regard for at least a few months after launch, but I might be wrong.
---
Nope, the middle stays at 144. I have the side ones set to 60. Have not had any issues yet at least.
---
You are a sad human being
---
It's going to be a long curve though with the number of people all starting off.  So even being partly ahead, if not at the front should still carry benefits.
---
Yes! I love these. It's like another badge of honor for Classic.
---
yeah I'm going for one shots 😂👌 What does pom mean?
---
It's not guaranteed that the classes that were popular or not in the past will have the same popularity. Back in the day, most people played whatever they felt like but nowadays most people just want to play the best class and you can have this info easily which wasn't the case in 2004.
---
Paladin &gt; Warrior &gt; Rogue &gt; Warlock &gt; Mage &gt; Hunter &gt; Priest &gt; Druid in that order.
---
Yes if you have the option it's best to wait until energy regen is about to tick. Though really this is mostly a PvP 1v1 tactic, in other situations you generally want to just open immediately and start contributing to the fight.
---
Awesome! I was 14 when Vanilla was out and plan on leading a guild this time around. I’m going to give this a watch.
---
Should I just roll a mage instead of warlock? Am I fucked as a fresh 60 lock  in terms of PvP and PVE? Also I want to play Sm/Ruin not SL....
---
If TBC comes out people will delete again there accounts or switch to private. this was after first expansion and will happend again. 
---
Retail player dont must understand classic players. some comments about TBC must be from braindead players 😂
---
Hasn't been more than seven days with an update since when? Some random arbitrary date recently?
---
I get the frequency has picked up but this is very obviously arbitrary
---
Uhhhhhhh...id love to hear how this happens
---
People had their pitchforks ready in case someone like you said something reasonable. Take my upvote you poor bastard.
---
Warrior rotation feels like a chore?
---
Can you ellaborate on this please?
---
Vanilla servers were not based in Aus. I’d be extremely surprised if classic servers were not.
---
Any rogue spec can work for PVP in Vanilla, don't be stupid
---
First focus on getting to 60, and after that year you could start focusing on gear!
---
Fucking HH was constantly underbidding or buying out and reprice everything. Pretty sure that’s all he did. Didn’t he stop sometime in WoD?
---
Threat is the limiting factor for Warlocks. Mages benefit from better talents i.e hit and threatreduction. Alliance has better margins for WL because of paladin. If threat wasn't a variable I'd reckon mages and warlocks would perform about equal, but we'll see in Classic with correct threatcalculation values etc.
---
Also, Winterspring Tiger will be on off the bat if you are interested in a fucking brutal grind.
---
I see the guild have the same musical taste than 10 years old me had.
---
How brutal?
---
I know. But thanks for feedback \^\^
---
&gt;old horde races are ugly af
---
GTFO now!
---
Orcs are the most beautiful race there is!
---
Hehehe
---
Thanks shedo, what are your thoughts on possible changes in classic that may affect pummelers or even the wolfshead helm not stacking with furor? I heard that may be a decent concern if you are going feral.  
---
Love your work and can't wait to start my feral druid alt
---
There will be plenty of guides out on youtube by the time you ding
---
except it isnt and under the right circumstances, 1 input = 1 action per character it even condoned by blizzard. i believe one of the forums mod used to multibox shamans but i cant remember his/her name.
---
All of this teasing better be real hints. If it turns out these are fake hints, just for the luls, then people are gonna be super mad.
---
Gives me hope. My account is about the same age.
---
Human, as bizarre as it is for me (always avoided rolling boring humans in any game that had other pretty races available). Was considering Night Elves, of course, but they're too big and bulky and before the rework their head/hair shapes also look a bit jank.
---
i only started playing blood elf because rl friends began playing horde on the same server i was playing alliance -.-
---
deleted all my alliance chars and started a blood elf paladin, was my only blood elf, even when i created alts other races simply won animation wise.
---
what i will be playing im classic? hell if i knew, im switching class/race combos on a hourly basis.
---
but i really love dwarf, their animations, their style. and the find treasue trait is nice for farming chests in duskwood - and i love duskwood.
---
Looots easier with friends
---
I played in Vanilla, but played a belf paladin in BC. I will be returning to my roots! THE ORCS!!!!!
---
Orc Resto Shammy to be exact.
---
Sorry I am ignorant to the subject but how do steamers ruin the game for everyone?
---
I love rogue, faults and all, and will be playing one for sure. But that's just me, the class clicked for me from day one. But I definitely agree, the points you made about 1v1/1vX are painfully true, lol.
---
Just used Blizzard support chat on their website. Told them I'm trying to get a long lost account back and I'd be happy to play account trivia with them to prove its mine. Needed to tell them my two main characters names and what I thought was my old account name before the b.net merge. I got that wrong but it was close enough it was a pass. Also fully described the Hunter pictured in the thread.
---
He's also correct. At no point in WoW's history has the faction war been anything but manufactured nonsense.
---
Individual factions, like the Warsong Clan having a beef with the Night Elves makes perfect sense. That provides options for PVP for people that want to support one group or another.
---
But the Alliance and the Horde as a whole hating each other makes basically no sense after the Third War. Mistrusting one another, sure, having some minor disputes, sure... but the War hasn't been in Warcraft since Warcraft 3. 
---
With shit like C'thun, the Burning Legion, Ragnaros, and Nefarian around, there's literally no reason for the Horde and Alliance to fight. The Third War proved this, there's always a big bad to fight and unite against, and that's why the faction war no longer matters and hasn't ever mattered.
---
I'm gonna kill all you alliance scum on sight :))
---
In vanilla a large number of the player base did not get past MC. In classic I think that will be different, for a number of reasons. 
---
Firstly the content has been out for so many years there are extremely detailed guides on how to beat every encounter. Secondly people in general are much better at using additional resources such as YouTube guides, and add ons. Add this to 1.12 talents, 16 debuff slots, buffer gear and most players coming back potentially having experience in later expansions where raiding and 5 mans needed more strategy and co-ordination. I don’t think there will be as much struggle for lower end guilds to clear raid content as there was in vanilla. 
---
More people progressing, more people scaling
---
I know, I was disappointed as well my bearded brethren.

UD Warlock to be the fear master

Hit up limited iten vendors. If your herb enjoy uncontested black lotus farm. If skinning go to ungoro crater and make retarted cash skinming the devilsaurs. Farm fire elementals . Farm water eles. If your ahead of the pack and dpnt mind farming/grinding there is so mucb you can do in the world just requires time and patience
---
Why do people really want to get in?
---
It’s the same game you played 14 years ago....the same thing. I want to wait until it’s released for the nostalgia factor and playing with friends.
---
If you’re devastated about not getting an invite, go play on a private server.
---
They were used, but they weren't as widespread I think. There are videos of people doing it and even soloing first boss in DMN.
---
No?
---
Im guessing OP just dont wanna play on the same server as a major streamer, as this could lead to faction balance issues(fans wanna hang out with him in Ogrimmar) and in general that one guy easily can influence a big bunch of ppl at the same time etc.
---
They add a lot of artificial population which can result in queue times.
---
That population mostly goes to the faction that the streamer is on, causing faction imbalance.
---
When classic WoW viewership drops the streamer goes to a new game, the server experiences a large decline in population over night.
---
I'll wouldnt even accept an invite. A beta key will be much more useful in the hands of an addon creator than mine.
---
I’m with you, I don’t get it either
---
No, I'm really not excited for that. Not interested in playing on a PvP server at all, played on private servers and PvP servers are toxic as fuck.
---
I love battlegrounds, so I'll definitely do some PvP, but I absolutely despise the pathetic excuse for World PvP that PvP servers offer. 99% of all pvp interaction on a pvp server is ganking, griefing, or some other form of harassment. That's not what I look for when wanting to PvP.
---
For a warrior main looking to raid and tank what professions are recommended? I see tons of stuff for mining/engineering but I always thought that was more for PvP. Can anyone elaborate for me? Thanks guys. Looking forward to classic!
---
I was torn between mage and priest until now. Enjoyed the montage.
---
Getting offended over a very real observation is extremely sensitive of you. Who cares? Live your life
---
willitclassic.com
---
Thank you for that!
---
&gt; Pick a class you think is cool and fun, don’t try to min/max.
---
I keep seeing people say this, and I understand the sentiment, but what a lot of you guys don't seem to understand is that for a significant portion of players min/maxing ***is what is cool and fun.***
---
That death from above ambush and the clip near the end in Tanaris is brilliant. This is the only thing that worries me with capping the realm pop to what it was back then is that crazy and memorable moments like these will just be far less likely to occur.
---
Thats not how statistics work
---
From the business/marketing perspective its the best to release it in July. If they release it in late September people will get mad, won't have vacation days anymore and might not be able to play it. As people said before when they say 'summer' it should be a summer WITH the game, not the last days of summer...
---
&gt; making them "promise"
---
Yeah that's not how NDAs work...
---
go get fucked
---
Tips also streamed on Friday but deleted the VOD. At the end, he said there will be classic stuff “very, very, very, very, very soon” while gesturing/counting with his hand.
---
This was assumed as how many days away, which lands on Wednesday.
---
Ayy
---
Thanks! It's a big task to take on be sure to have some good friends to help !
---
Alright yea, interesting thought! Right now the user can use what I call "compact" frames which are the ones you can see in the pictures on the gitlab page. The user can also choose to have "extended" frames which look more like unitframesimproved if you're familiar with that addon. I will experiment and see what I can come up with later regarding this.
---
Damn it looks so comfy
---
Nothing to worry about it. Most streamers are going to pve server due to stream snipers
---
Because their followers are retards who ruin the game for everyone else.
---
Bruh I wanted that sword soooo bad in vanilla. Sick
---
I'm waiting for a realm list too. I'm scared to start on a realm with a streamer.
---
I'm sure it kind of makes the streamers feel bad that a lot of players want to avoid them because of their fanbase...but I'd really prefer to play on a balanced realm.
---
Played some Undertale and came by Muffet, and immediately thought of Maexxna. And decided to make a Parody while waiting for Classic.
---
1 in a million is fairly accurate
---
Ive personally met maybe 6 people in my entire life I was genuinely shocked by how good they were at something of value. I also run my own company and travel country to country all the time and meet a shit ton of people. Writing this from a japanese airport
---
Ya
---
You keep repeating that as if it was a fact. It isn't. I was playing from vanilla to TBC, never got asked to max out my professions. It was a typical casual guild.
---
Imagine being the person who typed this out and sent it.
---
If you want to progress fast and not rely on anyone else, going blacksmith, specialising in armor Smith can be useful to make all the fire resist plate gear. The blacksmithing trinket can be useful on some fights too. 
---
Ultimately there is very little outside of engineering that is exclusive to they profession, so it doesn’t much matter what you go. Everyone can use potions, everyone can wear the fire resist plate gear, everyone can get the same enchants.
---
We’re already splitting the guild master 3 ways, but will be grabbing many of our past friends that we played with in Vanilla.
---
The other guild masters I’ve been playing with for 14 years now (met in Vanilla), so naturally we’ve already fleshed our drama out between us three lol.
---
Ya what’s up I have the reddit
---
Any chance at more town of Salem videos? Love those ones.
---
My OG Undead male warlock.  Same hair, skin, face, colors, everything.
---
I'm out of the loop, what did he do?
---
Only on pvp servers due to WotF, on pve servers alli is full locks since the bigger shit for locks is threat and alli have access to BoS.
---
Dps classes can use a pve spec and do ok at pvp. Once you get some decent gear, you may even do quite well as you outgear other players. Mages and hunter are probably better suited to this than rogues, but they all can work
---
i try to skip stv
---
When is next blue post?!
---
&gt;My point is that Druids definitely do not struggle to tank on AoE packs if needed.
---
This just isnt true though. I have played all three tanks. Druid is the only one that cannot effectively tank aoe packs in raids, and they struggle doing so even in dungeons.
---
I guess you just played with terrible DPS?
---
People not getting into a beta of a game that they have been anticipating for years and you get enjoyment out of that. Okay.
---
Yes I actually also have a foundation made for the BFA client too. It's not as complete but still for reference or maybe as a starting point.
---
That's very true. That makes it a bit better.
---
Yes, yes and yes. I don't want to wait in a huge queue just because of some dudes who can't play the game except by following a streamer as if they were their god.
---
Unless they're using third party cross-faction communication to make sure no one can ever farm them outside of the mafia, it wouldn't be against any rules.
---
You can be certain that the dominating guild/faction will have constant raids ready at them though, which is fine.
---
I’m worried about this as well. Being on a streamer server will ruin the experience for me.
---
As some other users suggested - level up skinning+herb/mining. This way you'll make money and be able to gather the mats for your gear. 
---
I get the idea, though. Just like you, I enjoy keeping my gear while leveling up to date and the professions items can be really useful for that. But again, you don't have to pick up a crafting profession, if it's just foe leveling gear.
---
is that a pvp set or what ? can you link armory ? thx
---
Presence of mind, an arcane talent that makes your next spell instant cast.
---
There's going to be a lot more streamers than servers, no matter what server you pick you're going to have streamers on it.
---
he said wed be multitasking while watching the next GoT episode which airs next sunday on the 19th
---
&gt; What the fuck is with this insistence that Blizzard is going to simply reiterate the entire expansion cycle? It's Classic, not Classic+all the other expacs.
---
The idea comes from a combination of the logic that Blizzard will want to maintain momentum, and make as much money as possible, if Classic is popular, and also from people wanting the experience to "last longer".
---
As well, of course, remember that while there's probably a majority who thing Vanilla was the best overall, there's still a very large amount of people who think BC was the best version of the game. Like a 55/45 or 60/40 split.
---
There's only two situations, in terms of popularity and profitability:
---
1. Classic is very popular, "goes mainstream" to some degree, and Blizzards gets a lot of subs
---
2. Classic is not popular, in the grand scheme of things, and is essentially only played by the fanbase of Vanilla
---
Most people are hoping for number 1, because they want the game to be very populated, and also for the game to be experienced and understood by many people.
---
If number 1 is the case, then what do Blizzard do after ~2 years? Only the hardcore audience will stay on for many years on fixed content.
---
So either they do nothing, and have a precipitous decline from wide popularity to only the hardcore base, or they try to keep engagement from a larger base.
---
Releasing BC seems like the easiest/most logical way to do that.
---
But, I'd add, that given the whole "thing" around Classic coming in the first place, they'd be crazy not to maintain Classic as well. Or implement the expansion differently somehow.
---
i.e. they expand to BC, but with a new set of servers, and you can copy your character from Classic over. As if you're doing the PTR.
---
And BC and Classic run concurrently, and everyone has 2 versions of their characters, like a parallel universe.
---
It's definitely even worse for them. Imagine having hundreds of fanbois following you around harassing you with party invites and sending you gold all the time. These people can't play the game.
---
[This video gives a lot of good reasons.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev-cy000SaM)
---
Yea in retail hunter uses "focus", which is basically energy.
---
Do you have the links to the side ones as well?
---
Haha yeah, I got the idea from Provosorisk’s “September is basically Christmas”, and wanted to simultaneously reference it and exaggerate it.
---
You will still have population issues with the fanboys selecting their side and following them around....
---
The best part is the sooner the beta is out, the sooner the release will be, I guess
---
Unless your Christian
---
Having a streamer and hundreds of fanbois following them around is far from a Vanilla experience.
---
Faction imbalance will be a thing on those servers. Not much of an issue for EU as most streamers are from US.
---
I feel sorry for people that will end up on servers with the most popular twitch streamers like  Mr. "Paladin is hard counter to warlock! " as that guy has pretty toxic community following him and there is a few more like him.
---
There are of course like of Frostadamus that are complete opposite.
---

We use Dell
---
...and here I was thinking about starting a stream.
---
 That all sounds so shitty. I would hate for the game to be ruined for me like that.
---
He's not on the Armory probably because her just got activated and I had to reset my name. And yeah, epic PvP set. Some of it anyway. I got to level 61 on him in TBC before quitting so a couple items are shitty Outland greens (replacing awesome gear with quest greens was one of the big reasons I quit so far y) but for the most part he's 90% vanilla. I'll link when he gets cached into Armory.
---
I expected way more warriors. Seem like a god class to me: top dps alongside rogues and the best tank by far.
---
I'm personally debating between druid and warrior. I'm mostly going to level and tank 5mans... i love how strong druid is at leveling but i absolutely love warrior tanking.
---
Releeeeeeease
---
Rogue here, you won't be tanking 2-3 people. If that's the standard for being a hero, go warrior or pally or druid. But if you wanna gank clothies or CC essential personal in a fight or join in on a fight at your leisure, go rogue.
---
Mage could potentially kite 2-3. Plus the speed of portaling around could save you valuable hours.
---
I'd go mage if your worried about not having much time to play.
---
Yo dude, good to hear from you.  My favorite OG warlock pickup!
---
&gt; I still have an occasional pang of guilt over you getting banned.
---
Don't!  I was 100% in control of what happened over my account and I can safely say in hindsight that your activity was NOT what did me in.  There were other people helping me grind that were equally "noisy" in their activity and honestly I told everyone to do that because I didn't give a shit, ha.  I wanted that R14 bad and there was absolutely zero precedent for permabans at the time, but Annex and the macedonians were legitimately THAT jealous.  All good though.
---
Yes, everything will be the same as vanilla, except for skill trees...
---
Im going warlock, but holy shit, im going to have a really hard time finding dungeon groups with that many mages and priests.
---
I just did the same thing!!
---
It used to have the point toward the ground, so it was more like a scythe instead of a sword.
---
I'm also amongst the confused as to why they butchered the weapon by flipping it upside down.
---
Most tbc and wotlk servers are trash with stupid bugs even on basic stuff. Vanilla private servers are much more polished so people flock there. Also the ones I have seen allow you to buy items with money which makes them shit. I'm sure there would be a lot of people who'd love proper working official servers.
---
Surprised Hunter is so low. It was quite popular in Vanilla. Guess people don’t want to be last on the DPS charts.
---
This is the main guideline/rule of polite/civilized pug loot interactions within wow.
---
BOE = Greed, usable for wearing/selling/de'eing/whatever. Everyone has an "equal use" out of it.
---
BOP = Need, usable by your class/spec/whatever for a specific purpose. Greed = offspec/selling/de'eing/whatever
---
In this case, all 3 clothies unanimously agreed to break this guideline by saying, "Hey, we all want this for the specific purpose of boosting our player power." Also, the 2 non-rollers gave up their claim to the boe as a courtesy to those seeking to empower themselves for the "greater good". By not equipping the item, the mage committed fraud in a sense. "Hey guys, I'm like you. I want to increase my power level to help out too. Wait nevermind, I want money more." 
---
Legally speaking, this is not enforceable; however, socially speaking, this is very enforceable and considered common sense/fair play among society. For example, "Hey mom, can I get some new shoes too? 'Sure honey.' "Thanks mom." 'Hey Bob...where's your new shoes?' "O, I sold them so I could get some ciggarettes." Some may argue different ways to divy loot, but those tend to be niche specific (loot council/raids) or create a toxic community effect (needing on everything for everyone). This is backed up by Blizzard's loot systems changing to force this (needing made it bop) and now just making everything personal loot (assume everyone is a ninja).
---
\*Tl:DR - the mage lied/broke the pug loot guidelines then proceeded to claim others must abide by it.
---
Yeah WoW is not the kind of game you want to stream. Even if you don't have many viewers, a lot of them will follow you around just because they want to appear on the stream. It's really not an authentic Vanilla experience. If you end up getting really famous, the game is immediately ruined for everyone who plays on that server.
---
You're definitely right, I looked at some old database pics. They broke my sword. :(
---
I think we will see a lot of the streamers joining the same servers, creating chaos. but I'm sure blizz will announce the server names before the game is released
---
Investment banking!  So *you* invented Auctioneer!  😉
---
&gt; What's next is speedruns and rerolls. That's how private servers have worked for years. And it takes a long fucking time to get an entire raid into BiS T3 gear.
---
Only an extreme minority is interested in this. Most of the player base are more casual and aren't interested in doing 1-60 a million times.
---
Orc Warlock is master race. Orc casters are badass in general.
---
Soon^TM
---
Found the bubble hearther
---
I hope they don't allow the beta to do 1-60 it would ruin the fun
---
It should only be specific areas withotu character progression
---
Yeah I feel like i would get one of those clear coffee tables and put it in there haha
---
Druid: Night Elf
---
Hunter: Dwarf
---
Mage: Gnome
---
Paladin: Human

Warrior: Orc

The launch was a mess in typical blizzard fashion.  I waited in line at gamestop for the midnight release, then rushed home to my shitty apartment stocked up with mountain dew only to pop the disc in and find out that I needed to re download the patch.  Then the server constantly crashed and was laggy for the next 8 hours, but once it settled it was amazing.  My main was a hunter back then and I rolled around hellfire with the OP at the time marksman build headshotting gnomes with arcane shot.
---
Im rolling a prot warrior with engineering and enchanting :D 
---
At least i'll get used to fishing
---
This only impacts the top streamers. No offense, but unless you get 300 consistent viewers within the next few months, you're clear to stream with sub 100 viewers as you aren't impacting the game to that degree.
---
Lol this is such horse shit.
---
You're acting like everyone gets treated like Asmongold. If you have less than 300 viewers it's a normal experience.
---
These are so good but I can’t help but mute it everytime I watch these, speaking German :(
---
TAUREN MASTER RACE BEST MASTER RACE
---
That gear looks like porn. Really takes me back lol
---
I'm actively avoiding it because I don't want to level a character twice. I'll just wait a wee bit longer, and enjoy the game when it hits.
---
Np. Just a heads up, the prices have increased abit due to increased demand/lower supply. It's still reasonably priced, about $12-20 apiece, but not like the $5 it was a few months ago.
---
Oh interesting, the results have changed since I posted that. Originally it was Hunter/Druid/Shaman.
---
Locks are pretty powerful in both PVP and PVE. There is alot to master but a good lock is nasty.
---
&gt; I'm sure it kind of makes the streamers feel bad that a lot of players want to avoid them because of their fanbase...but I'd really prefer to play on a balanced realm.
---
Im sure the money they're raking in from offering vapid content to autistic 9 year olds helps soften the blow..
---
itll be august release so my guess is that we get beta this week and release date info in june
---
Not sure what you’re gonna roll... i love sylvanas and I’m ally.
---
Apparently, I will be avoiding most of the population  as I am one of 12 people rolling on a pve server. xD
---
B-but... WSG...
---
One day we will tell our grandchildren about the great drought.  Nearly 15 years of a world without Vanilla—a span of time that ironically lacked flavor or originality.  
---
Future generations will ask us how we got through the final moments before its return.  How we were able to contain our unbridled joy awaiting the precipice of its unveiling.
---
So what will be said in 40-50 years, when asked in our old age—how it felt to taste perfection twice in our lifetime?
---
I’ll simply reply, “I’m not quite sure, grandson.  Still waiting for a release date.” 
---
😕🙁☹️😞
---
Here ya go buddy

---
And our custom gaming PCs had Core2Duo E6600 and GeForce 8800GT
---
I don't think people will be that upset, and I honestly hope it's a smaller, closed beta just for people actually interested in providing feedback. If they make a huge open beta that is going to have everyone's progress reset, that might kill some hype for the actual release.
---
Lol, I see you're enjoying your stats 101 course. Well, feel free to make another poll to capture faction balance and class populations per faction to literally come to the same conclusion as I did. Or just keep making vague, snarky comments from your high horse, whatever.
---
Since the pvp gear won't be available on launch -- run dungeons. Check BiS guides online for what you need.
---
I told my wife I NEEDED to build a new rig for classic.
---
Since it would sit in a main living area of our house it needed to be subtle and clean in order to get the ok.
---
The informant addon does
---
I think theres a point when you get hooked on the game. But that said, if shes getting camped in a pvp area, it might help to be her knight in shining armour and come rescue her. So maybe have a character to play when she is online, and a character you play by yourself.
---
Well, only Hunter switched with Paladin, so not much changed. Shamans are still looking like one of the most popular classes.
---
&gt; Because I like rogue better. But as a top tier raider I must do what benefits my guild the most, and that is to play fury.  
---
Are you suggesting that an ultra top level guild will bring 0 rogues and like 10 furies?
---
I’d put the streamer on friends so I would know where they are at all times and can avoid them.
---
You must not have seen it. It best describes how garbage and broken the pvp system is. Not only that don't forget how each class has nothing unique to them anymore. Everyone has a stun/heal/slow/escape...
---
Basing what servers Blizzard will make based off private servers is stupid. Yeah, private servers got us classic, but anything after that will be based SOLELY off classic and not private servers anymore.
---
24, pfft. WoD special crafted cloth made 30 slot bags
---
Classic format for classic wow
---
Frost isn’t na is he? I’d be cool being on the same server as madseason.
---
This is why robots can't be trusted
---
Some people will be, those on this sub more likely then the general pop.
---
Lol same.
---
😂

---
Wish this thread would get some comments
---
Understand utilities under undead
---
Yeah, but I think with how widespread they're known now, it would affect the economy too much. Hell I'm playing a hunter and I'd like them to remove it.
---
Investment banking and herbalism ruined my life
---
As I said to another respondent, there's a lot more that goes into the process than merely "releasing the new expac". It took them two years minimum to datadive into copies of copies of copied servers on off-site locations to piece together an imperfect jigsaw puzzle of what "True Vanilla" was and then reverse engineer the missing data, and *then* rewrite all of it to work on modern server infrastructure. And "two years minimum" is being generous, since that's merely when it was announced. More likely they were working in the background for another year or so before that.
---
There's a difference between people talking about "their favorite expansion" and the number of people actually playing those expansions. The Vanilla playerbase vastly outnumbers the TBC or Wrath playerbases, unless there are hidden servers I'm not familiar with. So on top of there being a clearly measurable phenomenon that Vanilla is the most popular type of legacy server (and thus trying to implement other expacs will receive fractional returns at best), they also have to deal with all the issues of trying to implement those other expacs. And Blizzard doesn't exactly want a situation wherein the majority of their playerbase is engaged in 15-year-old content and refusing to check out the new stuff, either, since that just spells disaster for the company. They finally announced Classic because it had the largest amount of support, the least amount of work, and the most amount of longevity. It would take just as long as it took, if not longer, to recreate an "authentic" TBC or Wrath rerelease, and it would also be an admission of defeat for the company to keep creating splinter servers for ever-shrinking numbers of fans who want to progress a decade late while ignoring the new content.
---
And it's not accurate even in Blizzard terms to say that old games can't maintain strong playerbases despite a lack of content updates. People *still* have Starcraft tournaments, and people *still* play Diablo II to the point that Blizzard releases official season updates and bug fixes and such, if only infrequently. A perpetual Vanilla WoW environment would still have rerolls, speedrunners, supreme minmaxers, etc., long after it was released. Naxx content alone could keep the Classic playerbase occupied for ages.
---
Maybe they rerelease TBC four or five years from now. I don't know what they're going to do. It's not like Blizzard always makes perfect business decisions, and it's speculation on both our ends as to what will happen (yours based on what I'd summarize as "community nostalgia statistics", and mine based on pserver numbers that are clearly tainted by survivorship bias). But the audacity of OP and others declaring things like "*when* the expacs rerelease" when we haven't even gotten Classic to release yet is just silly to me, hence why I laughed.
---
2 to 3 hours every day for at least 2 months
---
Very nice dude best luck on getting things sorted and hope you have great success!
---
I care when they have solid info about classic
---
Damn this was one of my first servers back in Classic/TBC, remember guilds like Order of the Hammer and WHO
---
It aint the streamers that are the issues (for the most part), it's the fans, which Frostadamus isn't an exception.
---
What?? How is that bad? Paladins are awesome in vanilla, this is very good for alliance.
---
Pvp sets for shaman and hunters are same outfit? Looks pretty similar
---
Streamers will be most likely rolling on pve servers so....no lol

Think they're talking about big name streamers, which probably won't happen cause many will join the sames servers together.
---
Granted also depends how many servers there are...
---
I wish vanilla had a outdoor pvp zone, weve gotten the shitty epl towers but this should become a real event instead
---
I reaaally wouldnt do that
---
I care more about server location. I want a west coast pvp for lowest ping. So hopefully they release this info before launch.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent
---
There you go. Click on the class you want to see, and what's there is what's going to be in Classic.
---
*Surprise, it's the 1.12 talent trees!*
---
I'd rather not have to do that. It's not just about avoiding their location in game. The server is ruined in many other ways.
---
watch out, dont get spoilered.
---
No, OP knows nothing about raiding or how classes work in vanilla. Both mages and warlocks scale quite badly at the start of the game so neither will be top dps in MC/Ony. By BWL they become more competitive, especially warlocks once they get some hit gear. ZG adds a tremendous boost to warlock dps with bloodvine and more hit gear. 
---
In PvP warlocks are very powerful at the start of the game because they have a really good balance of defense and offense. As the game goes on they become more of a nuker than controller, which is still good, but I think is really boring. 
---
I've found that it's about a 50/50 split between SM/Ruin and DS/Ruin. As a raid leader and warlock CL I want as many SM/Ruin locks as possible because they buff the raid with extra stamina. SM/Ruin is also quite good in PvP which means you can do both with a single spec.
---
Like maybe I'm a bit biased because I've played warlocks for 3 years now, but I really fucking love that class.
---
Well I'm glad your farm boy arguments amuse you. I don't think you ever need to build that many strawmen though dude, just one per field. Maybe work on your directness though. 
---
You seem pretty upset that I can differentiate between a video game and real life. It's pretty easy to do. One day you too will be able to do easy mental tasks, I hope.

People always seem to think there are way more rogues than there actually are at all times. I have no idea where this comes from. On any private server I played on there really weren't THAT many. I only played from BC onward in retail, but there weren't too many rogues either.
---
Yo, Energy drinks are still a part of my diet. It's the one thing that reminds me of the good careless times when I could play 10 hours a day..
---
Streamers have no choice but to play on pve.

Needs something on the wall i think, otherwise thumbs up.

I logged into mine yesterday (Bliz said the last time I played was November 11, 2009 but I was raiding cata?) and got really into the feels. I was so confused about the new system though and all it did was make me more excited for Classic. Cheers!

The streamers should balance the server themselves, one goes Horde and one goes Alliance. There's like 4-6 "big" streamers right? Apply the same concept to 2-3 servers.
---
&gt; Why do people really want to get in?
---
See, this is a problem. People are always treating beta as an early access version of the game. I'd imagine there are *a lot* of passionate players who would actually want to *test* the servers and make sure the experience is smooth once the game goes live.
---
+1  just for playing an awesome troll :)
---
On the chance that they DO release a realm list before release, can r/classicwow please compile some sort of master list for people who want to avoid this? Pretty please!
---
Asmongold is obviously the extreme case but even with only 300 viewers you can catch these parasitic fanboys. Even if you're not followed 100% of the time, the experience is still going to be bad. You're well within your rights to play on a streamer's server if you really want, but I don't recommend it.
---
PvP sets of the same faction and armor type share a model. Horde shaman and hunters have the same armor shape in different colors.
---
That's what I was thinking. Someone will surely do this.

That happened to my OG Hunter :( RIP.

Once a streamer changes realm or quits it. the population will change drastically as every fan is going to follow him.
---
it could be -dont tell or we'll never give you early info again. doubt that is what happened but its possible
---
Do you have one of these for rogue / hunter =D
---
Yeah that would be great if they actually went for this. It could add an element of rivalry within the streams. That could be a pretty cool thing. I still wouldn't play on it though.
---
\#NoBetaClub  
---
Only streamers will get in and a dozen other, don't get your hopes up just like BFA streamers get in others get in way later.
---
Oh ok thx for info
---
MC will be a cakewalk. The first boss of BWL is a major hurdle, harder than most of that raid actually. If they can get past Razorgore then they can probably get through BWL. ZG and AQ20 is really easy. AQ40 though... oh man a lot of guilds will run their heads at the pre-twin emp trash and quit the game out of frustration.
---
we've already waited so long, not going to ruin that first zone into classic wow by playing beta. although i appreciate those that do want to play it, because it it will make the final product better.
---
Naturally server location will have an impact on my choice.
---
Thank God those prayers were completely ignored and blizzard isn't ruining classic

OMG, look at the leeches chasing him....

I think the go to build for pvp as pompyro mage is this https://classicdb.ch/?talent#obxy0RbquxgMzf
---
Although I saw some discussion about not using arcane power, you might want to look into that.
---
 I just want to be clear that this kind of build is really only a one trick pony type of gamplay. With good gear and the right target it is fun as hell. After your use your cds though, you don't have much to do until you get cds back. And it's only a high level build, only really suitable for lvl 60. Leveling with this would be an absolute nightmare.
---
Rogue surprisingly low here
---
good thing most of the popular wow streamers are NA, EU ppl are kinda safe :D
---
Shit, everyone is rolling mage
---
This may be insane but I am actually with yall on this.  I would love to play with my peers but I am hoping my Vanilla Guild makes a guild on a PVE server so I can chill there lol.  I spoke about this today on stream.  Server pops going from FULL HIGH to LOW if variety streamers leave the server.  Honestly the Classiccast guys servers are best bet for streamers servers.

Shouldn't be a problem my account got banned after I quit and gave it to a friend in the Army stationed in Korea. I quit midway through leveling in BC for similar reason as OP, realized I had put all this time into a character who's progress got wiped out in one day. They found the account and I was able to see my old hunter. Unfortunately it looks like I had vendored all my tier 1 gear once they were replaced by greens. I wouldn't be surprised if my thought had been that I never wore less powerful gear after replacing it therefore I might as well vendor. Now I'd just like to have seen the old character in his old raiding gear, oh well classic will be here soon and I can gear up a new character at leasure.
---
While inconvenient, it is not that big of a deal. Also, while Ally locks need to deal with WotF, Horde locks need to deal with constant dispels coming out from paladins. Alliance locks are better off than Horde I’m organized group pvp.
---
Every two minutes an undead can escape one of your fears. No it’s not that big of a deal. Sub optimal yes. Game breaking no.
---
&gt; As I said to another respondent, there's a lot more that goes into the process than merely "releasing the new expac". It took them two years minimum to datadive into copies of copies of copied servers on off-site locations to piece together an imperfect jigsaw puzzle of what "True Vanilla" was and then reverse engineer the missing data, and then rewrite all of it to work on modern server infrastructure. And "two years minimum" is being generous, since that's merely when it was announced. More likely they were working in the background for another year or so before that.
---
But this was with a very small team, initially anyway.
---
Point being, it will take less man-hours to reproduce BC than it took to originally make it.
---
Additionally it's plausible they have better data/copies etc. for BC simply because it's not as old.
---
&gt; There's a difference between people talking about "their favorite expansion" and the number of people actually playing those expansions. The Vanilla playerbase vastly outnumbers the TBC or Wrath playerbases, unless there are hidden servers I'm not familiar with. So on top of there being a clearly measurable phenomenon that Vanilla is the most popular type of legacy server (and thus trying to implement other expacs will receive fractional returns at best), they also have to deal with all the issues of trying to implement those other expacs. And Blizzard doesn't exactly want a situation wherein the majority of their playerbase is engaged in 15-year-old content and refusing to check out the new stuff, either, since that just spells disaster for the company. They finally announced Classic because it had the largest amount of support, the least amount of work, and the most amount of longevity. It would take just as long as it took, if not longer, to recreate an "authentic" TBC or Wrath rerelease, and it would also be an admission of defeat for the company to keep creating splinter servers for ever-shrinking numbers of fans who want to progress a decade late while ignoring the new content.
---
Maybe, but this is kind of skipping over the main context.
---
BC being released is just an idea under the umbrella of "what do they do after ~2 years?"
---
If Classic is highly popular, it will not maintain popularity among a remotely mainstream audience if it remains completely static.
---
Now, that's obviously fine as far as the hardcore Vanilla base is concerned, but for all the other players, and Blizzard's revenue books, it seems logical to expect them to do *something*.
---
&gt; And it's not accurate even in Blizzard terms to say that old games can't maintain strong playerbases despite a lack of content updates. People still have Starcraft tournaments, and people still play Diablo II to the point that Blizzard releases official season updates and bug fixes and such, if only infrequently. A perpetual Vanilla WoW environment would still have rerolls, speedrunners, supreme minmaxers, etc., long after it was released. Naxx content alone could keep the Classic playerbase occupied for ages.
---
&gt; Maybe they rerelease TBC four or five years from now. I don't know what they're going to do. It's not like Blizzard always makes perfect business decisions, and it's speculation on both our ends as to what will happen (yours based on what I'd summarize as "community nostalgia statistics", and mine based on pserver numbers that are clearly tainted by survivorship bias). But the audacity of OP and others declaring things like "when the expacs rerelease" when we haven't even gotten Classic to release yet is just silly to me, hence why I laughed.
---
Yeah, I'm not claiming exact timelines, hence the "~".
---
Just the point is an "acceptable" playerbase is subjective. Both to the players and to Blizzard's business/accounting.
---
I would just be of the assumption they wouldn't be happy with running a long term service of just hardcore Vanilla fans, and would want to do whatever they could to maintain higher numbers than that.
---
Whatever that ends up entailing, on whatever timeline.

---
Have you considered playing on a pvp server on the opposite faction as another streamer?
---
Tbh you guys will have palas and fearward as well so it's actually not like Horde locks is that much better. Also i think Gnome is abit better here because humans only provide the stealth detect and you will have plenty of humans anyway and escape artist is better against a variety of classes.
---
And if you PvE you also get more Int than the rest. Only con is that gnomes are so god damn small it can be quite frustrating at times.
---
Best at Hidenseek as well.
---
Eh, I disagree. We should be encouraging healthier options. Soda is so fucking bad for you, and the fact some people drink 4-5x a day is fast tracking their life to diabetes, rotten teeth and more.
---
Seeing people get mad about a soda tax implement is funny. Yes, they want to discourage it (And make more money if you choose to do it.)
---
I feel bad for the streamers though. You can't enjoy the game. Your experience will be the furthest from a Vanilla experience.
---
Nah no way I did PvP and high PvP ranks in Vanilla already. Don't wanna go through that again. Sure the big wars will be fun but it can be super time consuming to stream constant graveyard run backs. Anyone streaming on PvP server is a marked target. I  will definitely make an alt on. PvP server and level it offline.

Maybe a pointless question, but who are the big EU streamers?

The only big streamers I know are NA ones, like Asmongold, Sodapoppin, Lirik, etc. Which EU streamers should I check out at launch to see which servers to avoid?
---
Meh I already experienced it. I feel safer on a PVE server. I mean fuck it we will probably get free shit. It definitely be a new experience lol
---
Most popular streamers are picking PVE to prevent getting harrassed/ganked in the open world, so picking PVP will cut down your chances a bit.

this would be literally the best time for me

---

---
I don't know any. If Blizzard does release a realm list prior to launch, someone will surely compile a list of all servers streamers intend to play on.
---
Talk about being ignorant
---
To each their own, I don’t fault those people.
---
This is factually incorrect.
---
Do we know if wotf will provide temporary immunity as well? I know it was nerfed/buffed as some point
---
I actually think streamers can bring a lot of positivity to around. Can you imagine all of their followers getting together and there being some kind of big battle? That stuff would be fine
---
There's so much I want to say. /hugs SR
---
I love it! It's good natured on the forums and fun ingame get into the spirit
---
Warriors are not a god class. Yes they are good in PvE endgame and can actually hold their own in endgame solo world pvp despite that some people think they need a healer to be good. If you play your cards right as a warrior you can still beat just about any class. Heres the thing though. Leveling as a warrior is very slow, and you struggle with hard quests if you solo. Below lvl 40 you will have a hard time vs most classes in pvp. Now if you're looking for a real god class. Mage. Meanwhile both mages and warriors are superior than other classes in endgame, mages does not struggle in the leveling process. They can solo most content, aoe grind, crowd control, conjure food and teleport around. They do not struggle in any shape of form throughout anything in vanilla which makes them the true god class.
---
Dont flame me but im genuinely curious. What is the problem with playing on a streamers server? I dont watch any streamers so I dont really know
---
Simple answer: No, you can start it with AQ Patch
---
Be a streamer.
---
THANK YOU GOD
---
So..pretty much like every other class?
---
But he said he can't watch it now because he's working, and wanted to know whether it includes a specific piece of information.
---
I don't see what's wrong with that. Yeah if it was worded like you interpreted it, I would understand it's rude.
---
Skill trees like...professions? Or like level up skill trees?
---
&gt; There's a decent number of people who will be less inclined to start after release due to feeling behind 
---
i don't know why people make unsubstantiated claims like this with no data whatsoever to back it up. and i've seen a few other people here and on discord say this. this is just not true. WoW went from 5m subs in vanilla to 10m in TBC to 12m in Wotlk. There is no and has never been any phenomena of people not playing the game because other people are already ahead of them.
---
12.18% priests? Thats pretty damn nice. No shortage of healers. As a warrior i approve.
---
I have a hard time feeling bad for them. If they want to avoid the issue they can easily not stream the game and play in their free time. Streaming is their job after all.
---
&gt;Horde locks need to deal with constant dispels coming out from paladins

My concern is that some streamers will attempt to keep it secret which server they're on for this reason... Biggest fear is that's the case, they don't announce their servers and I end up waste a couple days power leveling before I find out I'm on asswhipegolds sever.

how do you know? I highly doubt you're a stream with thousands of viewers.?

&gt;  
---

---

---
I could see them putting TBC back together, in the 2 years after Vanilla is launched. A lot of the difficulty in putting together Vanilla, is that there are so many basic features that have been overhauled from current expansion. It's easier to get TBC's outlands, level cap, spells, enemies, 60-70 stuff etc back - than the whole of Vanilla. It's why they COULD push out TBC after Vanilla, because it only built upon vanilla, and didn't overhaul so much at the time.
---
Hope you know what I mean, didn't know how to phrase it.
---
Some (certainly not all) streamers have a community who enjoy being in the same area of the game as the streamer. This can lead to a lot of people suddenly arriving in a particular location which makes completing quests difficult. A lot more so with classic as the tagging rules are a lot more strict. It's certainly not going to happen with all streamers. I'd say it's the minority rather than the majority.
---
That's it. Cross-faction communications. You are spot on. Very hard to monitor
---
I'm curious how the manual crowd pummeler works. I'm assuming the buff goes away when you switch weapons, but can it be used more than once per fight? Does it have a cool down? I'm trying to measure how many I would need to bring to a raid night.
---
No that would not be assumed.
---
What are "safe" (not 100% guaranteed) assumptions, would be:
---
1) Big Name Streamers will get them because it is "free" marketing
---
2) Not everyone will get it 
---
3) Wide range of computer specs of people will get them
---
If Blizzard does it "right" (take that with a grain of salt), then they will give out beta keys based on:
---
1) People who have done betas before and given bug reports/etc because betas are usually designed to catch/fix bugs.
---
2) People who have a wide range of computer specs because it allows them to get a better testing of different computer specs
---
3) People who have had a WoW subscription at one point or another on their account
---
The reason they may make active WoW subscription a requirement though is because it would cause a temporary boost in revenue, which is good for business. From a beta standpoint though, there would be no need for it.
---
Having a retail sub would help probably. I can see anyway they give out a bunch of beta invites to people who aren’t subbed.
---

---
Mages basically have their entire kit at level 30, they are very strong in low level world pvp.

Lets take the streamers and push them somewhere else!
---
&gt; Vanilla Coke Zero = zero vanilla ~~beta~~! ~~June release date~~  **Cancellation** confirmed! 
---
There, fixed that for you (I don't expect this to be a popular opinion though :D )
---
I get the hype about the release of classic, but I honestly don't understand all this fuss about the beta. 
---
why not just use a private server as your 'beta', the difference isn't gonna be big and it's not like you're gonna be allowed to transfer anything from the beta to classic
---
you could try switching to a keyboard with an easier/softer click. That way you won't use up your hand as fast.
---
Edit: You could also try to put an important skill on multiple keys so you dont use the same fingers as often in a row.
---
&gt; Do you need to quit your job, ditch your girlfriend, make a pact with Satan and delete every game you own except classic to become accepted by this sub? 
---
i should bloody well hope!
---
&gt;The morally ambiguous Illidan? Insane and cruel overlord now.
---
Well I think the point is that he's ambiguous, so the insanity and cruelty is only our perspective of him, at this small time frame.
---
I'm going alliance. Horde since beta.. Probably going to make a human female because I'm boring like that.
---

@TheGilius
---
With the current-age strategies that warriors employ while leveling, they are actually easier than rogues to level. The ability to hamstring kite with a slow weapon swing timer allows them to have to facetank mobs less. I used to believe the best warrior race to play was night elf cause the of the wisp form while dead (cause I was dead so much) but now days people have figured out warrior leveling. Rogues are essentially forced to facetank all the time so gotta use lots of bandages and food to recover.
---
That said, I'm going rogue again. Love the class too much.
---
How much did these go for?
---
To tag on, your e-mail address on the account, the server names those characters were on and any major items you remember them having, any paid character stuff you remember doing (ie I transferred davebob the 65 orc warrior from magtheridon to kil'jaeden) would also help them search.
---
Going back orc baby. Less humps, more hunch
---
Pretty sure almost everyone I've seen except Tow is going for a PvP server.
---
Remember when a content creator meant someone who made content for a game, like addons, or guides rather than just plays the game while talking annoyingly over it?
---
I don't understand why streamers are even a thing.  
---
Personally, I will do my best to avoid streamers, simply because they're basically the lightning rod for abuse of the ludicrous RCR system we're being saddled with.
---
I can't wait to suddenly be disconnected and find myself squelched for 72 hours because a streamer was headed for the same herb as me.
---
&gt; How much would it suck to play for a week and then finding out that a streamer started playing on your server? That instantly ruins the game for everyone on the server.
---
Uhhh how?
---
Just look up the videos of asmongold trying to play ESO. He's trying to avoid people but just ends up with like 100 people following him around. I don't ever want to have to deal with this wondering mass of shit. Imagine being on the opposite faction. Hell they'll ruin the zone your in if your on the same faction.
---
Just listing alliance only off the top of my head
---
Rogue:
---
Human for Pve (weapon skill OP) 
---
Gnome for pvp, getting out of slows is a big deal in bg's or wpvp especially for a class with basically no mobility
---
Human for fury/dps, again do not underestimate weapon skill.
---
Dwarf is a great choice if you plan to tank too for stone form, but the weapon skill racial of human is still very useful for tanking (more threat) 
---
Mage:
---
Go gnome for the Intel buff, this is an easy one for alliance. 
---
Again choose gnome this is also an easy pick. Your only other choice being human which have no racials that benefit casters. 
---
Druid:
---
Only one race per faction can be druid, at least you don't have to think about this one 
---
Hunter:
---
Dwarf for the weapon skill. This has less of an effect for ranged weapons then Melee, and many of the best end game ranged weapons are bows or crossbows but it's important to keep in mind that you don't get to choose what drops in raids, if an epic gun drops you'll wish you had that juicy weapon skill. And stone form is a nice bonus 
---
Paladin:
---
Because you'll mostly be healing at end game this one is more up to you. Both human and dwarf have their perks. The dwarf racial isn't as powerful for paladins because they already have a lot of survivability but the human racials aren't going to be too insane for you either. If you're going to try ret though that weapon skill is always nice. 
---
Priest:
---
Racial abilities have far more impact on priests then other classes, with non dwarf priests being denied the use of fear ward. This ability alone can make or break certain boss fights with fear mechanics. Please pick dwarf if you go priest 
---
I'm not claiming to be an expert or anything though, do the research yourself before you pick because you won't want to have to reroll once you've sunk a lot of time into a character.
---
Why wouldn’t you do deep prot?
---
Encouraging healthier options does not have to mean you must reduce consumer choice.
---
Cigarette packets in Europe carry somewhat harsh imagery to discourage their consumption and "quit smoking" campaigns, support, and alternatives are widely available. You can of course still opt for the cancer sticks if you wish. To probably shouldn't, but you have freedom of choice.
---
Relating back to sugary sodas, yes, they are bad for you. I'm not disagreeing. What I am saying is that man made chemicals are frequently also bad for you and some of the combinations in "sugar free" sodas are well documented in being downright bad for some people.
---
Is it really that bad to suggest drinking water instead of both sugar and "sugar-free" sodas?

What they need to do is Wow: Remixed.  Release content without straying from the principles of vanilla that we loved.  No class homogenization, interesting items, community focus etc.  But implement the good stuff from future expansions like 25 raid size, Arenas and more pvp options, actual interesting play patterns in pve etc.

Can confirm this. Athene joined my server way back then while he was still fairly popular and it made the queue times and fps in cities significantly worse.

What does being autistic have to do with this?
---
I mean, it still sucks having a toxic playerbase if you are trying to play on PvE.
---
A hybrid Fire/Frost mage spec is pretty popular for PvP. Something along the lines of [0/24/27](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oZVgMzf0uZVzGhkbth)
---
I mean on top of avoiding streamers, it will certainly help for people trying to make guilds for launch. Assume you have 40 people ready to go, and no one knows where to make the character until your GM picks a realm, and then that realm is either pop to the max or you are the only 40 people on it for some reason.

MN is the best content creator from this underground private server era. Every one of his PVP montages is worth a watch.

I'm happy that we don't have this problem over here in Europe. It would just suck to have a big streamer on my server, whether it was on the same or opposite faction.
---
Where has it been confirmed that it will be invite only?
---
In vanilla the ignore player list  had a 20 person limit, that limit needs to be removed
---
I just learned who he is yesterday. Is the general consensus that he is a huge douche?

I don't care for living in boarded up houses or mud huts.

I can imagine people naming their character Adolfhealer
---
Beyond being a streamer or media influencer invites are sent out indiscriminately as long as you have beta invites checked on your account.
---
This is pretty much a non issue. If it's a big streamer they'll roll on a PVE realm and if they're a small streamer they won't affect your server. As long as your plan is to play on a PvP server streamers will have zero effect on you.
---
Well, yeah. Odds are if you played during retail vanilla you were dogshit without a clue. (I was, mostly)
---
Having played at a high level on private servers means you know all the meta game strats which were mostly legends back in the day.
---

I started on Icecrown, I still play on Icecrown, and if Icecrown is available as a classic realm I'll be playing on Icecrown.
---
google.com some info might be 15 years old but its still relevant.
---
I think it will be the badge of complaining. 
---
The more I see info from private servers the more I think they've gotten things a little off. Mainly resistances, armor and other boss related stats. I have very limited experience from pservers so I won't say I'm 100% on this but I think it is probable that those numbers are wrong.
---
If that is a true, I think we shall see a lot of complaints tied to boss fights not being the same as pservers.
---
Haha!
---
This is the build I plan to use for all of vanilla. 
---
I want to heal and I know once I get leftover MC epics I’ll be fine in 5 man’s to tank using this build. 
---
I’m just wondering how viable I’ll be at the start of the game using a bunch of quest blues etc.
---
Might be mentioned when applying to guilds ect
---
"have experience on naxx from p-server" ect
---
My spreadsheeted hypothetical best / most efficient paladin build is normal deep ret, using imp might (no wis) with rank 1 SoC and 3-4 pieces of crafted spellpower gear after level 40 or so. Hits like a truck with mana out the ass.
---
That Server launched like 3 weeks ago
---
Everyone getting together like this is really what made the game
---
Assuming a better Holy build for raiding
---
OP is probably 26+ lives at home with his parents still and gets yelled at for not paying rent. Instead of facing his real problems,he focuses on others disappointment and feeds off it.
---
Marry into Morhaime's family quickly.
---
Another difference in gathering professions in retail, is that (provided you have the appropriate harvesting profession learned), you can harvest any relevant node. Level 1 herbalism means you can pick Bruiseweed; the only difference being you are guaranteed to get smaller amounts or even fractions of a single herb.
---
In Classic, you straight up won't be able to harvest the herb or ore if your skill isn't high enough. You'll even have a chance to fail harvesting too if the node is "Orange" difficulty to you.
---
The likelihood of no Warrior gear dropping from the entirety of MC/Onyxia in even one week is incredibly low.
---
Those are five things
---
Alliance this time because that's where the paladins are. And elves. That's it, really.
---
Holy cow this is nice, thanks a lot bud!
---
I doubt that, because all of the classic streamers I know of keep talking about how awesome wpvp is going to be. "Most likely one faction will steamroll the other".
---
Tnx a lot for the answers :3
---
If you go nice and slow it should be fine. A big factor of paly tanking will be if jugement of light transfers the healing as threath for you.
---
I know.
---
I've always fought for the Horde. I just find the Horde races more interesting, which has always been my main reason.
---
I highly doubt the opposing faction will have a guild close to this, they've literally rolled on the past like 5 private servers, nolifing their way to the top. They bring more than "war" to the server anyway, they ruin it in a lot of ways. I remember questing in WPL/EPL against his guild and it was a fucking nightmare.
---
Pretty sure they've confirmed no cross realm BG's.
---
asmongold? nah, this sub just hates streamers lol
---
Ya, it was around WotLK if I recall correctly. Switched us to using focus like our pets. Completely changed the way the class felt. Now, all classes are more or less equally shallow, so it feels relatively ok.
---
Gorgeous
---
He was just talking shit to towllie because hes a moron that takes twitch too seriously
---
I know its probably not lore friendly, but I always felt like the alliance gave more freedom to their people; like to me I always orcs/trolls as members of the military regardless of the class.
---
Taurens and NE's, I viewed as having equal freedom as they both seemed bound to protect nature, while simultaneously not necessarily controlled in how they do so...
---
Gnomes, I think were bound to break the bounds of creativity and innovation, but once again not controlled.
---
Then undead and humans I just view as having unlimited freedom to do whatever.
---
Yeah, I'm a Paladin so that is a pretty valid point, since Horde doesn't get Paladins until BC.
---
Its like having tons of PTR experience. Some things may change but overall pserver players will be more knowledgeable than retailers in classic wow.
---
Good luck getting any world boss kills or contesting PVP at all if they're on your server, it's just not possible. If they want all the Devilsaur leather they're gonna get it. If they want top PVP ranks before anyone else they'll get it. They are on the extreme of the extreme end of no-lifing.
---
For entry level tanking I'd try and get Holy Shield since it's a pretty good damage reducer as well as threat generator.
---
Something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuoxZVRtI0zvo) should be good. You almost never use Holy Shock, the 5% crit is nice early on but not that necessary since the fights are so quick in MC/BWL.
---
Lol.  You have nothing to worry about friend.
---
I mean it's against the TOS so saying that in-game is probably going to be a pretty bad idea.
---
Teach me how to be so enlightened and unentitled master
---
Why does asmongold have such a huge fanbase?  What does he do?
---
Still annoys the f\*\*\* out of me that they flipped Zin'rokh.  **(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻**)
---
I played on the only viable PvE vanilla ps. Thier where jerks ,still they where far less common. The community was overall good until the merger announcement . While on the active pvp ps the communities where almost as horrible as DotA2's
---
I can tell you that gear in that guild is carefully distributed based on where it will help the guild the most. Obviously PvP gear goes first to the people that actually PvP heavily though, like Mn.
---
Cause its using political/corperate speak
---
The game is 15 years old and had tutorial then...it isn’t as though there isn’t a quest—like quest number 2–that takes you to your trainer to learn skills.
---
He's not a bad guy at all.
---
Why not gnome? Racist.
---
Horde all the way...STRENGTH!
---
Especially for warlock.
---
You torture them.
---
You drain their life essence
---
You drain their soul.
---
Then, when they die you eat their corpse, often just to spite them.
---
@creiss74 - This is how I always PvP'd as my rogue. Sure I cant claim I had the real skill of a good dagger rogue, instead I just brute forced the opponents with Sinister Strike, Adrenaline Rush, Riposte, Eviscerate. They died. There wasn't much to stop you when you had Adrenaline Rush and you were in BWL/AQ gear and the opponents are just sitting in BGs day after day trying to get blues.
---
Take this info with a grain of salt though because this was actual vanilla, not some private realm where everyone knows how to min/max today.
---
&gt;Unless they're using third party cross-faction communication
---
Cant really prove this, and it's not against the rules to NOT kill opposing faction members either.
---
My first guild was run by a family. A mom, father, and two brothers from hawaii. Good times. Progressed all the way up to Sunwell with them.
---
Don't even have to be a good one, just cash in on the hype as much you can
---
Just play Night Elf 4Head
---
Any amount of time playing the game is considered good experience really. Pservers are slightly different, but pserver experience is also less than 12 years in the past, so theyre almost equal, Id probably consider someone with recent pserver experience a lot better than someone with just retail experience from over 12 years ago.
---
As for some sort of arbitrary sense of having been there over people that havent, somewhat, people are proud of just having played Vanilla at some point.
---
Would be nice to reserve spots. Such as you can see a list of who intends to play on a realm. To mimamalize lies, you need an active account and can only reserve 1 spot on 1 realm
---
Lovely, gues that is why we got pve servers
---
UBRS, scholo, strat, then MC
---
Show her the fan made Naxxramas trailer
---
&gt;Why argue at all?
---
Because I want to and because I can. I don't need another reason :D
---
Asmongold is a big reason that WoW has maintained some popularity imo. His stream brought me back to the game after years of hiatus. Very entertaining stream.
---
I 100% Agree with this. Playing on a realm with a streamer would be horrible.
---
Start farming fire elementals in Arathi highlands, or make runs in Searing Gorge, or in the Charred Vale in Stonetalon. You need to capitalize on the little competition, and utilize gathering professions like herbalism, mining and even skinning. Get a friend or two and go kill devilsaur in Ungoro for the leather while also killing level 50s which are easy targets (sorry it’s the truth). If you  run mining and herbalism and have both at 300 you can make runs in Winterspring for rich thorium and black lotus spawns, while also farming the Winterfell mobs for the firewater or e’ko or just for rep.
---
I don't know what he actually *likes*, he complains so much
---
You mean internal alpha, right?
---
He puts on a bit of a persona on stream because being an elitist wow player is his schtick, but he’s a good dude at heart. You can see that in the way he’s always talking about supporting his family, especially his mother.
---
Do not listen to this comment.  Ice Barrier is critical for pvp and deep frost is the way to go... there are a lot of preference points but putting this much into fire is unacceptable.
---
Asmongold is probably one of the nicest wowstreamers out there. Him and Sloot I would say. But still. I'd hate to be on the same server as one of them.
---
devilsaur mafia won't be possible on classic though, even the guys in current private server mafia agrees. Mainly because of smaller playerbase and non international community on servers, devilsaur demand won't be as bottomless as it was on huge private servers. Also it will be bannable by blizzard to cross faction collude
---
Im not sure this meme will ever truly die. I mean, it's still fucking hilarious.
---
They are probably still unsure how many servers they will need TBH, and I think that might be a factor in why they haven't given any news regarding servers.
---
I didn’t know it worked like that to be honest.
---
Thank you for the tip!
---
im pretty sure im gonna get a beta invite, somehow i managed to be in every single beta since the Burning Crusade
---
&gt;Why do people really want to get in?
---
Because after playing private servers for 5 years, my choice of class in Classic will depend on a few unknowns regarding the scaling of specific abilities and items. I need to test this in the Beta so I wont have to reroll in Classic.
---
^ Exactly what u/Javander said.
---
PvE realms will be great for folks who just want to explore azeroth
---
"but have began to consider playing for the Horde in Classic"
---
Care, undead warlock baiting you.
---
Citation needed. I’d like to see where in the terms of service that saying you previously played on a private server is disallowed.
---
He is talking about the bottom 3 =)
---
I feel like if everyone still thought this way, they'd have a lot more fun with the game.
---
Someone who does this kind of thing for a living is likely a better source of information than all the PServer kiddos trying to defend hardcoring a 14 year old game :D
---
Server info will probably released with data centers. Choose closest datacenter to you for ping purposes and I'd save a name for a main on each one of those, just in case.
---
All the suggestions you've received are solid and reliable. I'm going to recommend a high risk, high reward method of farming, that's also incredibly fun.
---
I love farming Tyr's Hand mobs via Mind Control. 
---
Lots of the caster mobs have a variety of spells that deal a ton of damage and can even CC. The ideal scenario is to grab a Scarlet Archmage or Enchanter; engage another mob, and have them both get to around 10% health. Then break the MC, and finish off the two mobs. It's incredibly efficient, considering you're using an NPC's health and mana as resources rather than your own.
---
I was able to successfully farm for rare recipes by doing this, namely Enchant Chest - Major Mana, Recipe: Elixir of the Sages, and Enchant Weapon - Crusader.
---
There's definitely a learning curve; you'll have to learn ideal locations to position yourself, so that patrols don't walk into you. Because you're essentially a sitting duck whilst channeling Mind Control. Additionally, you'll have to memorize the order in which you killed mobs so that respawns don't get you killed. But remember, if there's a pesky patrol or additional mob in your way, feel free to MC it, and just get it killed. Then just MC the mob that killed it. 
---
Finally, Mind Soothe will allow you to bypass a lot of trash you're not interested in. Or it could be used to ensure a patrol doesn't engage you as it passes by. Yes, you will have to deal with the occasional resist causing problems, but as I said, this is high risk, high reward. And by all means, feel free to get creative and try this strategy in any place populated by elite humanoid mobs.
---
There is no Alpha LOL. Do you even know what Alpha means?
---
&gt; Regarding the map, it’s scalable and remember its position so just scale it upp to the normal size and leave it there would almost be like default without the black boxes on the sides.
---
I mentioned the world map and mini map. Is this related to the world map? It looks fine in the screen shot except for the shadows but I assume that's what the checkbox on the top left does. That was all I meant for that map.
---
For the mini map on the top right: the N/zone label/clock hideable and able to make the map itself square shape is what I was saying.
---
In any case, can't wait to use it. Thanks for making this!
---
Part of the problem with "pre-gaming" Scarab Lord is that the most important part of the quest (getting a shit load of scarab bug parts so you can deputize people) can't really be done effectively until pre-patch. Also, there is no real benefit to collecting war effort materials as everyone needs to chip in on this.
---
I did a large part of the scarab lord by myself back in the day, and a lot of it just can't be done without people. If you want to collect the materials for an arcanite buoy, great. Otherwise good luck.
---
True, perhaps not the best example. I just thought it would be handy to have a list so players are informed before they start playing. Like Hunters needing to feed their pets food. A little knowledge isn't a bad thing.
---
The "hardcore" streamers will have to roll PvP because thier fans demand battle
---
That's a nice mentality. If you survive STV you'll have PTSD and end up murdering every poor soul that crosses your path.
---
Assuming you're on a PVP server anyway.
---
Beta in 2 months, doubt we'll get anything soon.
---
What? WoW has a dozen or so million subscriber and you think the few thousand people that watch his stream make any difference on that?
---
Paladin only has stun. Warlock felhunter has one though, and priests can spec into silence.
---
Thanks for the wonderful reply man.
---
Right? What's with the hate? I get if the faction balance can suffer because of it, but the general hate towards streamers is just weird.
---
Because if the paladin percentage exceeds 20% you start seeing rets in your dungeon groups
---
He's been streaming and youtubing a long time so he just has a larger fan base. 
---
Imo I don't think even someone like him would "ruin" a server. It can be nice to have someone who will usually be doing a large event that you can just hop in to. 
---
The only thing I don't like about large streamers is the donations they can get in game can be ridiculous, I wouldn't doubt someone like asmongold could have every BiS boe handed to him before he hits 60, or someone offering to pay for his 60 mount, or stacks of consumables so he can pvp.
---
It's just impossible with the sound xD
---
Reminder that everyone and their mom streams. But I get you want to avoid the popular streamers yeah?
---
Read this. Jesus, before you try to lash out and "LOL OMFG IM 1337" get your info straight. 
---
Blizzard has revealed that internal employee alpha testing has started for WoW Classic, and that the new build data from a few days ago was related to this testing process.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=291323/employee-alpha-testing-for-wow-classic-has-started
---
The vitriol in the responses make no sense to me. Pick a class and have fun. If you end up being marginally worse than someone else in raids, wtf ever.
---
I remember a warrior called Arnold on Shattered Hand. There was a rumour going around that he had been buying gold, because he got banned for it. When he was unbanned, the rumour was that he had sent over thousands of gold in one go in the mail.
---
Somehow the entire server knew about this lol. I used to look up to that little gnome.
---
Also does anyone remember a rogue called Lillith? She would literally just sit around in Goldshire or the entrance to Stormwind next to the dragon heads. Every time I went there, she was there.
---
I'm just going to play on whichever PVE server is closest to where I live. I haven't really given it much thought beyond that.
---
They need to release a realm list so I can make small printer size paper posters and put them around my town at Gamestop and other places so I can try and get as many people in my area on the same server as possible. Thats really what I want.
---
I was watching Asmongold try the Classic Demo on stream. Except he really didnt get to try anything, because 50 other people followed him around everywhere and killed every single mob in the area.
---
Oh ya what a horrible thing to be randomly sent gold in classic wow... such a dreadful feeling!
---
Its doable, but in P1 youre going to have little to no SP gear in your tank gear. Your threat is going to be very bad, youre only big threat boost is going to be from Judgement and Holy Shock. Without Imp Judgement, youre one decent threat ability can only be used every 10s, so youre pulls will look like, Judgement, Concecrate, SoR, Auto-Attack. At this point, you really need to Auto-attack the second target already so you can build threat on it because the first target will probably die before you can Judgement the second one. Youll likely be losing threat on one of them and have to blow your Holy Shock. 
---
On single target bosses, I think itll be worse, you can frontload a lot of threat with Judgement and DF Holy Shock, but I think most DPS will catchup to you very quickly and pull off you.
---
Again, doable, but very awkward and will require a lot of cooperation from the DPS. and if youve tanked before, its not often that your DPS really cooperate.
---
that would mean we are computers and able to erase our memories in order to create new ones, ones that whack our happy brain centers in the way that makes it feel like it's the first time, every time
---
but we can't, so all we can do is maximize the fun we do have
---
for me, that involves reminding myself to enjoy the other people in a game, cuz the people are always changing
---
One of these things is not like the others
---
They can have an invisible account, also they are getting paid. 
---
I’d rather have nerd losers spam invites than have a real job that shits on me weekly.
---
Warlocks have to buy more spells than any other class due to their pets all getting multiple spells with multiple ranks. So the free mount partially exists to assuage the overall higher costs warlock's incur. Additionally, you're just going to have less bag space as a warlock due to soul shards / soul bag(s).
---
Dude you'd make a very bad tank, you have absolutely no rage or agro generation ! /jk :D
---
This is actually a really good point that did notnreally cross my mind. If realm pop caps are like 3000 or so like back in the day Asmondgold can just take over a server. Streamers should just have their own servers.... Who knows
---
Thats a whole lotta bullshit. "It's not an authentic vanilla experience" Well no shit, you'd need a time machine for that experience anyway. Its a 15 year old game. Streamers didnt even exist back then. And how do you know they will be followed around? Theres less than a handful of classic streamers with an actually big followerbase, one that would cause any of these side effects youre talking about.
---
Blizzard EULA Section 1(C):
---
License Limitations. Blizzard may suspend or revoke your license to use the Platform, or parts, components and/or single features thereof, if you violate, or assist others in violating, the license limitations set forth below. You agree that you will not, in whole or in part or under any circumstances, do the following:
---
(ix) Unauthorized Connections: Facilitate, create or **maintain** any unauthorized connection to the Platform including without limitation **(i) any connection to any unauthorized server that emulates, or attempts to emulate, the Platform**; and (ii) any connection using third-party programs or tools not expressly authorized by Blizzard.
---
Emphasis added.
---
Theoretically they would never do this because it's bad PR, but admissions that one has played on a private server within the Warcraft game client are more than grounds enough for them to temporarily suspend your account if they so chose.
---
Are people right when they say orc racials are much better than undead? As undead you can use FAP/LAP potions every time u face classes that stun etc, and its on a 2 min cd. There isnt much that counters fear other than pvp trinket for rogues etc. Or am I missing something?
---
He is the Id of the hardcore wow gamer, to a degree. He isn’t the most talented, but he is pretty good. He raids mythic but not like method, pvps but not like a venruki, he has been playing forever and everyday, he has coined a few memes and generally holds a position that many of us who love wow, have played forever and are dissatisfied with what the game is have and he voices it. 
---
For a streamer, he is pretty aware of how absurd his “job” is, too which makes him seem human.
---
Ofcourse the numbers are a little off. The scripts are a little off. Even Nost couldn’t figure out how blizzard wrote onyxias breath. But the differences you’re talking about are largely percentage based. You bring up resistances for instance. They are in all likely hood 70-90% correct. 
---
How much deviation do you expect (in the way the game is played and the effectiveness of private server experience) between a 20% accuracy gap?  
---
Private servers are not blizzard. This is true.   Private servers will have been played largely the same way we will play blizzards classic.  The only difference for the most part is what numbers you see on your screen.
---
Oh it’s that guy, the mouth breathing star into the distance guy. 
---
Yeah he seem alright. There are like ten decent human being streamers, the rest are all filth.
---
I saw a WoW streamer a loooong time ago hide what server he was on by completely hiding all names, he had some addon that completely removed all names from literally everything, it was impossible to see what realm he was on, maybe that's what they need? I dunno.
---
This has been a pretty active subject of conversation lately. It's a problem that didn't exist (and couldn't be predicted) in Vanilla but now it's a huge threat to a lot of people. There's a popular YouTube video on this subject.
---
damn this sure is one of the most ignorant comments I've seen in this sub for a long time now.
---
This circlejerk again. Same thread every week.
---
Quick follow up: Energy ticks at 20 per 5 seconds and with Adrenaline Rush ticks at 40 per 5 seconds.
---
Fair enough. Perhaps I'm too critical. 
---
Pservers have all but done away with wearing resistance gear for example. I am very curious to see how that will be handled in classic.
---
Correct. Until then, I believe the best drinks will be available from The Argent Dawn Quartermasters, namely Enriched Manna Biscuits / Blessed Sunfruit Juice.
---
I'm going to do three things.
---
A) Choose the closest datacenter to me.
---
B) Choose the lowest populated server.
---
C) Make sure that the server I choose has NO streamers on it.
---
Net-o-matic, thorium grenades, gnomish cloaking device, reflectors are all essential. Also pick up a furbolg medicine pouch and a skull of impending doom.
---
Portals are OP in vanilla. Gotta earn that mount money.
---
"Ok everyone, right click report this guy"
---
True, but Asmon and less than handful of other "big streamers" can actually cause this. So it shouldnt be too much of a worry
---
The amount of exposure World of Warcraft gains from being on the top 10 on twitch is a huge deal (Acti-Blizz knows this and their investors know it). Asmongold is the main contributor in this regard outside of official tournaments.
---
I remember C4ing Total Biscuit over and over on a Bf4 server while he was capturing footage at launch. 
---
Was good times.
---
11 year old noob me used to look up to you guys
---
Robes of Arugal are one of the best cloth leveling robes that will last Priests and Warlocks for nearly 20 levels.
---
Will all names be available? Even those taken by current retail WoW. 
---
Is there a character minimum for names? Example being a short name like "rock" or even a single character "A"
---
What people never seem to understand with these polls is that half the people voting will be rerolling to something else before they even get to 60. We can never tell what class will be most/least played until the actual game is out and a few months have passed by.
---
Buff goes away when you switch weapons. On use buff has no cooldown. So you spend 90 seconds with the buff up, swap pummelers, wait 30 seconds for the item swap cooldown, then another 90 seconds of buff, etc.
---
There should be servers dedicated to streamers. Streamer segregation!
---
From my experience everything below 21 points in prot is a pain in the ass for you and your dungeon group. 
---
I'm going 20/31/0 early on, since imho you need holy shield to keep the reputation of being a reliable dungeon tank as a pally (scholo, ubrs, lbrs) while farming bis. I will change to 30/21/0 later on. Maybe in progress of ragnaros, bwl or when AQ opens it's gates.
---
You really have hatred for people having a passion for something?
---
People are just sick of them.
---
Because Dwarves.
---
Because I'm 6'4 in real life, and very shy, and being a loud, boisterous, commanding Dwarf Prot Warrior makes me happy. Running around with a 5 foot Thunderfury as a 4 foot boulder with more spikes than a cactus, thanks to T1 Warrior gear!
---
Classic demo confirmed for summer 2020
---
It's a giant arena in a pve area where no matter the faction you show up hostile (I think?) unless you're on a team together.  It flags you for pvp immediately.
---
Actually its the Undead Rouge thats luring me
---
Really any class would work OK as a partner for a rogue, but a healer is extra beneficial to minimize downtime. The hardest part about leveling on a rogue is your downtime due to damage between mobs.
---
&gt;a dozen or so million subscribers
---
kek
---
Considering these are brand new servers just for classic wow I'd say no names are taken
---
I'm an alliance shaman main so my main will definitely be a horde shaman. But my dad is a pally main so I'll level an alliance too. Not sure what to make my alliance class. I'd like to tank so probably either warrior or druid. If druid it will be night elf. If warrior idk what race to pick.
---
Yeah I don’t want to be on a server with streamers or no life guilds that raid and organized PvP ruin areas. They get enough fanboys as it is, and it’s really lame.
---
Ice Barrier is *not* critical for pvp, especially in BGs if you're Alliance, as purge and dispels will be everywhere.
---
If this will be a thing, I'll most likely go for the server with the highest population cap. I like my community huge and competitive. Oh, and no streamers.
---
Ah yes, the good ole Focusrite Solo 2!!
---
I think you’re confusing two things here. 
---
1. Actually connecting to the private server currently
---
2. Typing “/1 I have previously played a private server” then pressing the enter key while currently connected to a classic server
---
Does option 1 or option 2 violate the TOS you have listed?
---
4:28 STFU
---
Never heard of these ones except Kungen, are they only on Twitch, or do they have content in youtube?
---
Honestly I feel for both parties
---
Streamers will be dealing with hell while leveling/making gold.  Their following will kill their experience
---
People that want to avoid streamers MUST be on a non streamer realm, as we all know what comes with the fanbase
---
I just want nice hair... I rolled on a private server to check what I wanted to play so I don't get alt-ahol poisoning when classic releases and I realised I'm really this picky.
---
I honestly don't think they're all ugly, they look great but no good hair styles, no deal. 
---
Just gonna play Alliance until I figure it out, then play horde later.
---
Of course this is my opinion and judging by the downvotes I may have to reconsider it. I've seen a lot of streams and the viewers very frequently try to interact with the streamer in game.
---
Have a link to that? id be curious to watch.
---
&gt;I feel bad for the streamers though.
---
It's their choice to stream though.
---
More than just numbers can be off. Private servers can also change how spells work and how different classes interact with each other. I remember a certain cataclysm pserver that the warrior herioc leap wasn't the same as retail wow during the time. It was actually radically different (you could jump up cliffs you weren't supposed to but retail you would have issues with any uneven terrain)
---
I’m looking forward to the side by side comparison videos. 
---
I imagine you’re going to see YouTube flooding with these. 
---
“The left screen is private server wow. The right is classic wow. Watch as a lvl 1 rogue uses sinister strike on this boar. Notice the left monitor causes 7 damage while right monitor causes 8 damage. “
---
WotF is mostly a problem out in the world and even then your death coil will buy about 3-4 seconds so you'll have fear soon enough again. 
---
In BGs you'll have lots of targets to fear so you can focus on fearing non-undeads. Put your felhunter to spell lock the priests while fearing players going for your fc or other important targets. 
---
There will be so many mages that you'll probably have a hard time to get a spot in premades and raids. Same with hunters and rogues.
---

Use rank 1 frostbolt to get a quick slow on targets. Use rank 1 fireball to DoT rogues. Downrank CoC to conserve mana if the slow is more important than the damage. I use rank 1 nova, personally. Get rocket boots for WSG if you plan on flag carrying.
---
I think it’s safe to assume when we say private servers we aren’t meaning all of them as a lot. We are talking about one specific server that’s emulations blizz like conditions.
---
I don’t have raiding experience on pservers (I did ZG, MC, BWL in vanilla and through sunwell in BC) and I don’t know if the meta is different than my experience, but I feel like druid healing has always been underestimated because people just see them for their utility, and because of that the druids don’t have to try as hard. 
---
I can see that you don’t need a lot of them, or that you would want them as a feral/resto hybrid for their great versatility as off-tank, heal and dps. But, I think that a resto druid can do a lot better at healing than people expect if they actually try.
---
I think since the 1.12 news came around people have been shifting since Warlocks are pretty OP in that patch. Meanwhile hunters which don't scale very well have taken a fall.
---
No he's great! His streams are really good but his fan base is cancer. We just want to avoid streamers in general. Not because we don't like them but because the server basically just becomes an extension of their stream.
---
Oh I understand but I'm just saying I've had the same experience on blizz conditioned servers too
---
Female undead have a few decent options. For me it’s mostly the posture though. Female troll have alright posture, but the feet and hands are a deal breaker.
---
It might. Its one of those unkowns about paladins.
---
This is why I felt they should have included d2 at
---
release. Some builds really do rely heavily on having that specialised gear and it gives players something to work towards. Alot of the pieces will be next to useless once the set is actually released.
---
This needs its own thread so it can be pinned.
---
They changed it going into Cata. In WOTLK hunters still used mana (although they never ran out iirc) and had arrows.
---
PVE server master race.
---
Okay awesome man. Thank you for providing the link
---
&gt; The amount of exposure World of Warcraft gains from being on the top 10 on twitch is a huge deal (Acti-Blizz knows this and their investors know it). Asmongold is the main contributor in this regard outside of official tournaments.
---
And that is why they effectively cut him out... right?
---
also people don't want to deal with the server being turned into twitchtv chat.
---
I realize comparing world first kills to current kills is flawed, but there simply wasn't enough consistent data I could find from late Vanilla when players were better geared.
---
The world first kills are at least all consistent, and all done by good players who presumably had a decent level of game knowledge.
---
I can understand how raid strats can be improved and classes can be better optimized, better buffed etc.  But raid strats shouldn't have massive impact on individual DPS, and I still have a hard time believing Vanilla players were so dumb that they were missing out on 600% worth of optimizations.
---
With 16 debuff slots Warlocks are more appreciated in the end game as well. So there should be enough room for 4 Warlocks and 1 Shadow Priest in every 40 man raid, imo.
---
Number 1 absolutely does, even if it would be difficult for Blizzard to find out. Number 2 is not itself a violation, but it's an admission of violation that Blizzard could use as justification to revoke its EULA. Believe it or not, any particular nation's Rules of Evidence don't have much bearing on decisions to rescind private contracts, so claiming that your admission of contract breach was a "joke" or something along those lines isn't going to help much, nor do they need to demonstrate that your admission was truthful.
---
Again, I don't see them actually *doing* this. But they'd be able to point to that clause as justification if they weren't concerned with the PR fallout.

That's not what I heard while playing on said private servers.

Don't have kids.

10 furies? You don’t understand bud. The top speed running guilds bring TWENTY.

Alliance warlock is fine. Makes u play better. Go gnome female, always have noggenfogger shrink you, get engineering, and join a guild with a pop culture reference for a name. Can't be beat in PvP if you follow these steps.
---
Nah bro. Female trolls get me hard
---
Asmongold said he will have no choice but to go on a pve server in fear of stream sniping.

Blood Elf Warlock on Retail, will be Forsaken Warlock in Classic.
---
&gt; they effectively cut him out
---
What?
---
Eating the body and soul. I like it.
---
This is not actually true, you can with careful pulling and movement assist a rather lowlvl character close enough to loot all the bosses.
---
Yeah it's their choice but it still sucks.
---
Correct. Those will be attached after Phase 3 is introduced, just like the updated boss loot tables of any other bosses that got new loot throughout Vanilla.
---
Unfortunately we'll probably get the 1.12 talents which are pretty overpowered for the content that will be available at release. Would much rather have the 1.1 talents instead.
---
&gt; I'm incredibly worried that I'm about to invest my time into a character that will be on an empty server. 
---
This is something that I think get overblown.  In classic, even smaller population servers can be very active.  I was on a smaller server in Vanilla/TBC and there were guilds pushing progression content, lots of active communities, and tons of activity in the cities.  Smaller population servers even have a slight advantage in that there is less competition for the resources in the world.
---
&gt; I'm going into classic wow by myself but hoping to make friends and join a dedicated guild...
---
If this is your goal, then stop worrying about what server has specific guilds/streamers/population numbers.  Play on a server that you want to play on and make friends.
---
However, If you want to play on the same sever as a specific streamer (I don't advise this), then you will have to wait for them to tell you what sever they are on. 
---
 If you want to try and be part of a more hardcore PvE/PvP guild from the start, then there are guilds already recruiting for Classic Launch.  I would check the "Classic WoW Guilds" discord, or others like it, to try and find a group of like minded individuals.
---
Love the theory mate, but the time stamps are definitely not something to read into on my tweets haha! Glad you enjoy the podcast :)
---
I guess we know where the cancer came from now
---
Really? Sorry, I've never seen anyone post this before.
---
It's not weird, we've had little to no information since the announcement of classic wow, and these streamers and content creators keep pumping out the same stupid bullshit, hyping up absolutely every little tiny piece of information they can find. It gets old, and it's unnecessary.
---
But Mike doesn't work at Blizzard anymore, so I'm not sure that would increase your chances.
---
It's an meme mate, no need to sperg out over a joke.
---
If you think voicing an opinion you don't like is a "tantrum" - get help. 
---
This trolling gets old, sport.
---
Sick of what? Its not like youre exposed to streamers unless you watch their streams lol
---
Is it better than he predicted?
---
People like Frost and Madseson have this positive vibe coming from there. This does not attract toxic following. Of course none is perfect but you see a lot of those toxic channels on twitch, which are just nests for trolls and haters.
---
I can imagine getting friends by hundreds of fanboys if you did anything to hurt the streamer.
---
I mean other modern games are banning people for killing streamers on pvp games
---
I instantly think less of someone if they use twitch emotes on any platform that isn't twitch.
---
How do you confirm C)?
---
Why do you think that's the only thing Paladins do?
---
[https://youtu.be/VozAoQ3gPCQ](https://youtu.be/VozAoQ3gPCQ) check the description for the lowbie escort
---
I can understand this. But not the general hate they get. Its like bashing on artists or actors whose work you dont listen/watch.
---
You can join a streamer's server of you want.
---
Is tailoring worth having for the entire duration of vanilla? I want to have tailoring/herb and have an alt be Alch at some point, perhaps Mage, on my Lock as I level up (only really focusing on keeping herb up) but looking at tailoring at max there’s Robe of the Void and Bloodvine gear, I guess I can make/sell Glacial too at some point. Aside from that that’s it, so is it a good idea to keep tailoring for personal crafts and gold? The gold potential seems high if I put the effort in making bags or gear with Mooncloth but idk the cd on it.
---
Sad y'all germans will never have the chance to...not understand this piece of art to see how all those meme fit so perfectly when you dont understand what they say
---
Thank you for this.
---
Streamer segregation is the answer.
---
No you could buy the PVP gear from vendor at end of vanilla regardless of rank. he was rank 10, evidenced by his title, Champion. He would have originally only had access to the blue version of the PVP set, which was purple and had no glow.
---
Asmongold is a nice guy, but he's also strongly opinionated and will take the opportunity to wind people up in the name of comedy, I feel some people don't understand when he's joking and when he's being serious and he rubs a lot of people the wrong way because of that.
---
He also has built up quite an audience and they aren't exactly known for being the most well behaved,  his on-screen persona encourages that, even if he sometimes doesn't intend it. He's definitely a good guy, but an understandably divisive figure with a fanbase you'd probably want to avoid, you don't want to be on his server.
---
Ouch, this really has me questioning deal now.
---
Guess I'll have to mess with some half-ass targetlasttargets
---
TheDonc77 barely speaks English, I dont think he speaks german..
---
Can someone explain the disdain for playing on a server with streamers? I know it's not something that existed during classic, but its not really a huge deal to me. I must be missing something, so i'm hoping someone could provide insight.
---
They are going to lose a lot of potential subscribers if they release a game in September when everyone is back in school. Granted it is Act-Blizz, but they are smart enough to know that that’s a terrible fucking decision.
---
Nope, I do that too. Everyone thinks they're Elitist Jerks these days.
---
Human warlock. I mourn the fact that troll warlocks weren't a thing until until TBC either.
---
I am looking to heal in PVP, raids, and dungeons but also be able to solo things myself for gold. Would I be better off going shadow and healing dungeons as I level, then switch to full resto / disc at 60? Or would I be better off playing a Druid? Thanks!
---
Yeah I thought of this but I'd imagine that the last thing they want to do after a 10 hour WoW stream is play WoW on a secret alt.
---
I'm currently selling mine for £3500 so that I can get Stormscale, which the person is selling for $10k, but some are cheaper.
---
Based on earnings reports, there’s speculated to be 1.7 million subscribers or less at the moment. WoW hasn’t had 12 million subs since Wrath.
---
Yes no one else vote for Hunters so I can get a raid spot even in BM (with aimed shot ofc)
---
Yes? So why do you watch them then. Theres a whooole lot of unnecessary stuff in the world. You dont have to go through it all. You can just choose to not watch the streamers. They pump the same bullshit because some people enjoy it, and watch the same stupid bullshit.
---
Go watch his streams around last Blizzcon / Classic demo. He mentions it and states that he probably is not going to Blizzcon next year.
---
On retail ? Because they can definitely crit on classic.
---
wut
---
You can't bolt while repositioning. Burn gives you an excellent nuke to spam while moving. If you were doing poor enough DPS for a few lifetaps to build a relevant threat buffer, you weren't a very good warlock. Losing some buffs and being able to go full tilt DPS again resulted in higher DPS than slowing down enough to stay under the MT. Did you even warlock in vanilla, bro - or were you just not very good?
---
Yeah it might sound great at first but I think it would take a lot away from your experience.
---
Oooh ok thx, now it's clear
---
Most, if not all, streamers will not choose a low pop server. 
---
They will choose a mid-high pop server because their fans won't follow them to a low pop server. They just won't.
---
But there is a list of people streaming classic wow, or planning to, and no doubt they will all announce their server intent for their fanbases so they know they'll have people with them. I'll just check the channels a few days prior, and make sure to avoid those servers.
---
Right? Even the biggest polls suggest this. The biggest ones actually had pallys and shamans as 2nd and 3rd most popular classes for their own factions.
---
How much originally though
---
You know you can disenchant low level greens and sell them for a HUGE profit at level 60 right? Jesus, I'm amazed at how shitty you are TheDonc77..
---
Another issue is the fact that you can't predict what your server will look like 6 months after the release.
---
Are both factions equally represented?  Are there enough people on your server or will it end up having a very low population? If you spend 200+ hours leveling your character, only to find out you've picked the wrong server.. 
---
I actually thought about waiting a few weeks after the release before I start playing. Maybe I'm overreacting though.
---
The autistic ones, apparently
---
Yeah I saw that too. They're parasites.
---
If I remember correctly originally the auction started at $100.
---
I don't watch them. I stopped watching anything in this sub about a week after the announcement because that was the last time there was anything good here. I still come for discussions.
---
Just giving a reason, no need to get defensive.
---
Omg they shut the server down in 2010, holy shit time flys. I remember playing with people from that server wth
---
That would be really cool!
---
Alright gotcha, I will make that possible, no probs!
---
Overall he's a nice guy but then stuff like this happens:  
---
https://youtu.be/rAlTrPySgtQ?t=1584  
---
In this clip you can see a random dude writing the n-word in chat for whatever reason, but Asmongold automatically assume he's doing it to ruin his stream. He could be right, but instead of just ignoring the guy he report him and tell his followers to do the same so that he gets banned.  
---
   
---
Now I know that this case might be a bad example, but my point is if you get in the way of a popular streamer such as asmongold it's easy for them to fuck you up in that way or another just by using their followers.
---
I'm assuming it's a D&amp;D reference.
---
I keep seeing all this tanking as a Pally in posts lately and I'm here again to help shed light on one of the "broken" specs in Vanilla. Pally tanking has several HUGE issues at endgame that really make it the least valuable tank and essentially not worth raiding with at all
---
1. Itemization doesnt support Pally tanking at all. Not even a little bit
---
2. Mana issues. Mana is how you maintain aggro but due to issue #1 mana is always in short supply. You have to bring a TON of consumables to counter this deficiency but it's very time consuming, expensive or both to do this
---
3. Survivability. Due to needing a larger spread in attributes than warrior or bear tanks thanks to the different tanking mechanics of a Pally, Pally tanks have the worst survivability outside of gimmicky Shaman tanks 
---
4. The Pally specialization tree is oddly designed for PvE encounters such as needing to be crit to proc redoubt which is counterintuitive for raiding
---
Can you tank as a Pally? For leveling content and especially farming the answer is a resounding yes. For leveling dungeons kind of sort of though it helps to have blue gear. Once you get to the end of Mara and definitely starting with ST, this becomes far, far more difficult. Raiding with a Pally tank...maybe if you out gear the hell out of the raid then yes as an offtank...I guess? Definitely not remotely recommended though. Trying to push content with a Pally tank even in an OT role...just no. You are wasting your guildmates time and yours. You would be FAR better off leveling a warrior or a druid to 60 and gearing them out to raid. Druid, especially as an OT, is WAY better than a Pally tank in 99% of raid situations.
---
I realize people dont like hearing this but it's reality. Vanilla was not even remotely balanced and there were a number of specs that seriously underperformed in raiding. Specs like Ret, Enh and Ele shammy were BEASTS in PvP but were lackluster in raiding. Not every spec was good in every aspect of the game. That's Vanilla
---
Streamers would be retarded to announce the server they plan to play on. Someone will log on that server and snatch their name faster than they can say classic.
---
Looking into the classic wow guilds discord! Thank you!
---
I think people are associating a server with a streamer with longer queue times and a bigger gap between horde and alliance population on the server. Though I may be missing something else.
---
I'm just gonna complain on the forums until they add blood elves to Classic. ^^/s ^^obviously
---
My main was a Void Elf in BfA (same thing) and I'll probably either roll gnome or troll.
---
Hey man, just wanted to say eat some shit. ❤️
---
No problem. You have my blessing.

Gnome if alliance. Orc if horde.

So whats wrong then? Those people have the passion for the game, and want to create discussion and speculation out of the small things that we are given, even though its not much. I dont definitely watch them that much myself either, but they seem like quite enthusiastic about the game, and people apparently enjoy them. So no reason to hate them.
---
&gt; To add a bit more background to this, I was basically told that Blizzard doesn't want to support me or do anything that could be seen as supporting me because of the politically incorrect things I say as well as some other stuff.
---
&gt; Obviously Blizzard is free to choose who they want to and don't want to support, but that doesn't make the feeling any less shitty when you go the convention and everyone you know is getting treated one way and you're getting treated another. As someone who has played and loved Blizzard games for over 20 years, it does kind of hurt.
---
&gt; Because of all that, I felt kind of out of place and uncomfortable at Blizzcon and I probably will not be attending again in the future. Maybe it's an overreaction, but I don't want to go to a convention when nobody wants me to be there.

---
Others games have showed that different types of species and races have natural resistance to bludgeoning/slashing/piercing damage. Because undead are rotting shit bags, they have resistance to piercing damage, as shown by a warframe cheat sheet. 
---
also theres evidence to suggest that the hunters pet might not want to melee poo monsters and the hunter and pet moral drop significantly during the attack the shit citadel.
---
I shit you not and mark my words "These are the answers all raiding hunters looked for!!!

Its funny you mention the Overwatch Beta. That was a beta where very few people got in and there was a lot of people disappointed on the subreddit.  Then there were iirc two big "please let me into the beta" threads where users would leave their battletag. I thought it was bullshit when people from the first thread started to overwhelmingly say they got in to the beta,  so I put my battletag in the second thread and lo and behold, got into the exclusive beta very shortly after and was one of 20 odd friends who signed up and none of them got an invite. Coincidence maybe but it seemed like a vast amount of people who commented had edited that they got an invite.
---
So if anything, that beta showed that a bit of salt and begging can get you in.. kinda contrary to your point?
---
Hoping they mainly play on pve servers
---
Lol Jesus dude
---
All the big streamer names will be taken on all servers immediately.

---
I agree, that's why I'm going Druid. And of course, because I love the Hot playstyle, which seems to be really good by the time you hit endgame.
---
So healing will become more and more versatile as well. Also an absolute pleasure to play them in PvP.
---
Can't wait to play my Resto ;D
---
That’s awesome! I stopped playing towards the end of Wrath, and I wanted to come back for the launch of Pandaria but found my account had been compromised and subsequently banned by whoever hacked it. 
---
Tried to explain to customer support what happened but all they would say is that the account was banned and no further reviews would take place. Wouldn’t tell me a thing about it. Still bums me out thinking about my original character and all the memories tied to him. 
---
Seeing this today made me decide to see if I could get someone at customer support to listen and understand my problem, even though this was so long ago, but nope, same response. They said a ruling was made back when the account was banned and no further reviews would be made. It’s a bad feeling to feel so helpless, but I guess there’s nothing to do but move on.
---
I didnt downvote you btw, all I did was correct you
---
&gt;  I'd much rather see a page and a half of "FOR THE ALLIANCE!" and "LOK'TAR OGAR!" comments than a single other gods-forsaken "look at my battle station" post
---
Guys you aren't going to believe this, but I horde useless digital media and I kept ALL COLLECTORS BOX SETS OF EVERY EXPANSION PACK EVER RELEASED.
---
Eh, they have a much better chance of getting their first of they don't announce it until after character creation.
---
For the Holy/Prot build you should ACTUALLY drop Holy shock and go down to 1/3 in the Lasting Judgement (you can refresh with autoattacks and in a raid it rarely lasts 40 seconds due to debuff limit).
---
Then with only 30 points in Holy you can grab Blessing of Sanctuary. Personally I'd also drop guardians favor and go 3/3 Precision and get BoKings. You could also even grab 3/3 in imp Conc Aura.
---
The whole point of the Holy/Prot build is that it's specifically designed such that one paladin in a raid group uses it instead of a pure holy build so you have BoSanc in the raid. Holy Shock is a very meh talent due to 30 second cooldown and poor scaling. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxubgkxVhtI0z  is a much better all-round build and perfectly viable for Raid Healing and tanking anything a protadin can tank throughout all of Vanilla. Sure a 14/32/5 type build will be better for tanking but your healing will be much worse.
---
You can easily tank anything as 30/21/0 because the BoSanc damage reduction and reflection works like a minor Holy Shield.
---
If you want to go all out as a tank go something like 14/32/5 and accept that your healing will be a bit meh, or 20/31/0.
---
Why does being on a streamer's server ruin the game? OOTL
---
Warlocks always skew more heavily toward Horde. Especially on PvP servers.
---
One type throws you into a world of ruthless monsters that prey on the weak, steal your loot, and amass an ever growing force of evil, and the other contains video games.
---
Have to have 1:1 faction balance with regard to streamers
---
I can tell you’ve never played a Druid in your life :D
---
Barkskin takes away pushback, regrowth spec can top meters, shamans stack mp5 and therefore are top tier healers. Just so much is wrong with what you said...
---
Streamers bring along a lot off people just because they are popular. A lot of them might play at first, but end up bored when the game gets too tough or grindy. Once they quit it will leave a big hole in faction population.
---
No they don't wowhead or thotbot could probably answered if vanilla was your starting point
---
Yes, we certainly won't run into them. Or the people following them around. No, that will never happen. Not even once!
---
Also in Hinterlands in Classic
---
So glad I live in EU and playing on German servers so the chance is extreme low
---
Yeah I wasn't stating that. I was just fixing a 6% AP per combo point rather than 6% overall on a comment. They will not be top DPS. But they will be towards the top if played well.
---
Losing your consumables and world buffs isn't enough to completely cripple your dps? HAHAHAHA
---
Nobody is forced to listen to artists they hate. I cant kick Asmongold off my server. All I can is move to a new server. Which is a waste of my time.
---
Hoard*
---
Also that's actually pretty cool, though I don't know what it has to do with my original message.
---
I’m a warlock on a private server.  Have herbs/alch and it’s a decent money maker.  However all money goes into buying mats for tailored gear/bags and enchant materials.  Going tailor/enchant for official servers.
---
The problem isnt the streamers themselves. It's the side effect their presence has on the server.
---
If my experience from private servers will resemble classic closely at all, then yes you will be fine tanking in this spec in phase 1. I tanked all dungeons except ubrs as a holy/ret pala without any of the tanking talents from the prot tree, and it went fine and smooth, just slightly slower than normal tanks woulda done it. You'll have to tell your dps to wait with dps'ing for maybe 2-3 sec on each pull though.
---
I was born on nazjatar, ill die on nazjatar
---
Like I said, I get that. But the hate they get in general is weird. Just doing their job, and a nice job at that.
---
No one knows if there will be a beta :)
---
I know, and I get the problem with the same server, but the streamers get a lot of shit(not all of them) for no reason imo.
---
I know one surefire way to avoid streamers. Start on a RP realm.
---
"Warlocks can spend extra time grinding an area if they’re there for a quest, quickly rack up money and XP, then move on to the next. Running a bit slower but mopping up mobs like nothing."
---
That touches on another consideration; If the player keeps grinding WHILE relocating, the hunter speed bonus means even less, as their higher movement speed makes leashing boundaries less forgiving, and they wouldn't be able to pick up as many simultaneous mobs - if they could finish even one on the move before leashing snapped it back.
---
I think if two experienced speed levelers of similar skill set out to grind 1-60 in as little time as possible, I'd probably bet on a warlock over a hunter, if I was confident that the warlock was a solid multitarget manager, and would keep grinding during travel. (So long as he didn't let it distract him or slow him down)
---
I have always wondered why warlock theory and speculation are so scant among the broader community. Were we really that rare?
---
I dont know what makes you think the streamers would tell people what server they would pick. They would tell their friends and other streamers they want to create content with but no one else. They want as paniful free start on their sever as possible to get ahead of all the snipers.
---
They need to keep it a secret for as long as they can on release for their own sake. If they told their community before release they couldnt get out of the starting area.
---
The faction balance would also be screwed from the start if everyone knew, you think they want to play on an unbalanced server? I sure wouldnt.
---
Alliance players are the protagonists. They are the heroes. Horde players are the bad guys. They are mobs, just like boars. These are the people who CHOOSE to play as brutes. They are mentally unstable.
---
Just kidding. For the Horde!
---
play a private server
---
^(Just wait like the rest of us you potato.)
---
Woah, didn't think I'd see undertale on the classic wow subreddit of all places
---
I read that as ‘stabbed’ pets. In either case, the answer is no.
---
Not that I know of. Its a tricky thing. Will they have a TON of servers on launch to sustain the many players and then merge them later when players fall off, like a truncated version of what they did in Vanilla? Will they just shard the starting zones to alleviate the problem and have much fewer servers? That might work for a while but will eventually lead to long wait times to get on the servers. There are a lot of variables at play here and I think its one of the many reasons we are likely to see some sort of open beta at some point. They need to test the starting zones so they can best assess the many variables and nail down their plan.
---
Long winded and I am not even sure I answered your question, lol. Too hype for Classic and I likely ranted, clap
---
I could tell you but I'd have to kill you
---
Yeah, people saying otherwise must have been in the same faction or not played in private servers...
---
Always been a fan of magic so I just play MTGArena in the meantime.
---
Just lmk
---
It's not something you can really separate though. Like ok you can say "being a streamer isnt bad". But when you're a WoW streamer, because of the nature of WoW, you cannot separate the side effects of said streamer. It goes hand in hand with them "doing their job", even if it's not intentional. The existence of the problem is reliant solely on them.

---
Would you rather I called it victim culture?  Sack up. It's an important life lesson people need to learn.  People can be assholes.  Fuck those people, ignore them and press on with your day.
---
What a great AI. It's just like Blizzard. A bunch of features nobody wants and no release date announced.
---
Don't listen to that crap, yes in world pvp 1v1 you have a slight disadvantage as alliance due to wotf but in battlegrounds or anytime a paladin is present horde locks have it much worse, they instantly dispel anything warlocks put on their enemies. Besides, you only rely on fear in 1v1 when leveling or when you have just hit 60, a geared warlock don't rely on fear to win fights. You can kill a rogue inside a death coil if you have tier 1&amp;2 gear.
---
Pservers are filled with jaded undesirables who've played thru the starting zones 10 times each. It's not the same experience.
---
It would be incredibly selfish of them to intentionally keep it a secret. Besides, I give it about an hour until someone finds Asmongold.
---
Until level 42, Fear is the only way to get people off of you. Forsaken are by far the most common horde race, and you *will* be ganked relentlessly as you level. Forsaken rogues will be the bane of your existence. People are downplaying the 5 seconds of fear immunity that WotF allots the enemy, but assuming a rogue opened on you, but it will absolutely be the difference between surviving and killing your opponent. Your best bet will be getting them to kick your fire school or to fake-cast Fear. Also don't forget that an Amplified Curse of Weakness will cripple a rogue's DPS.
---
Oh and keep in mind that WotF will dispel your succubus's Seduction spell. 
---
That said, once you're at 60 and have decent gear, it won't be nearly as gamechanging as it once was.
---
Arguments can be made for both Gnomes and Humans; Escape Artist is always good. Perception has the potential to win you fights, depending how good you are with it.

Damn you’re just laying down the law.  The sheriff of /r/classicwow over here lmao.

I feel the same way, why do we have to beta test a 15 year old game!? Give it to me now!

No thanks there's something creepy about rp realms.

Would this be considered BiS post-naxx? Lack of hit, but I was thinking at this point in the game I would be focused on PvP

so basically, no one really knows

Is it better to play frost mage or Sm/Ruin lock in PvP? Who requires better gear to be decent ?
---
You will have your savior
---
This. Getting ready to do this myself
---
I don't get your point at all. Overall he is nice but then he banned a guy for using the n word so he isn't nice? What? He didn't overuse his power there, he used it right. He did something that gets you banned so fuck em. That's like saying someone with a lot of money and power who gives light/money to a charity is bad because they're even using their power of fame to do anything.
---
It'll happen once more :)
---
Complicated question and depends on what you want to do.  
---
Most people advocate shadow to 60, then respec holy for raids.  
---
Druids are great solo though, but generally less desired in raids.
---
I played trolls in vanilla, and mostly blood elves after TBC (mostly because paladins).
---
I'll be playing a turen shaman if I go horde this time. I usually play human if I go alliance, which will be a human paladin (again) this time around if I play alliance.
---
All require significant investments...

Nah that guy got what he deserved simple as that. You're over hyping what he can and can't do in your head, it's more what he would and wouldn't do. Do dumb shit get hit with report stick.
---
I think all servers will be listed as High pop on launch day. I dont think they will have enough servers because they dont want anyone to be stuck on a dead realm when 80% of the people end up quitting eventually. They will likely have fewer servers but shard the starting zones to balance out the load on each server. Therefore, your (B) option is basically pointless
---
800g when you hit level 60? You're probably playing the auction house all the way up there and if not, then I'd like to hear how aswell.
---
I saw one person work around this by saying something along the lines of... Pick the first server that's starts with L. Maybe that'll work for you if this is a big issue.
---
No, but then, I'm not a bad. If the situation was tight enough, you pop new consumes. Losing world buffs only matter if it's the first death of the night and, even then, losing them and going hard resulted in higher overall DPS than slowing to stay under the MT threat - - if you knew what you were doing. But you didn't even Shadowburn during repositioning, so you're clearly a little out of your depth here.
---
It's okay, I'm sure you won't be as bad this time around; older and wiser, right? Well, older, anyway.
---
Oh my sweet, summer child...
---
I'd bet gold he'll be salty that some streamer got an invite and he didn't. Awfully defensive lol
---
IMHO they need to make it open. It will result in the same overall bug reports in a shorter period of time. However, they would then have to do specific tests (like 30-33 or 1-10 etc)
---
Ignore him. His comment is as useful as he claims your post to be. Post what you want, just make sure to follow the sub's rules.
---
awesome, thank you
---
It depends on your class, but tailoring tends to fall off after AQ. 
---
Before BWL you can get BIS robes for priest/mage.  The ZG sets for tailors are amazing for warlock because of the hit and crit provided.  The patterns from MC are also generally really good.
---
Tailoring is somewhat important in AQ to make the NR gear too.  But to my knowledge Naxx didn't add anything much for tailors.
---
When WoW released, and mind you I am basing my B choice off of what happened in the original release, Servers went from high pop to Full.
---
I chose Bloodhoof because it was green, at Low, on launch day. I didn't know about Streamers then, because it wasn't really a 'thing' back then. But now? Yeah. Definitely going to hope they copy what they did before, and I'll go for whatever is green or closest to it.
---
Mostly because we’re getting 1.12 cut into 6phases, Frankensteined together with a modern client.
---
thank you. i  checked all wikis but that specific info i could not find
---
Playing a rogue who wants to use engineering should I level using mining and skinning for more gold and then replace skinning for engineering when I want to level it up using the mats i got from mining?
---
&gt;WoW has a dozen or so million subscriber 
---
N OMEGALUL
---
There is a reason WoW hasn't released its subscriber numbers in years. Its because its embarrassingly low compared to what it used to be. I'd be shocked if it had more than 2-3 million.
---
I thought so too at first, then I played on one. The creepers are real, but they stay to themselves and don't bother anyone. The people I met were super nice and friendly, very chill. I was really surprised at how much it went against the stigma of what people think RP servers are like. I'm really considering rolling on a RP-PvE realm for classic. 
---
Not gonna lie, stay away from Goldshire. That much is true. Everywhere else is fine.
---
Just started a Mortal Empires campaign in Total War Warhammer and Civ 6
---
So now I'm stuck in an endless turtlefest except that if I am lucky in a few hours or days a GM will slap them on the wrist. It helps in the long run, it is true, but not as much as a stacking debuff on the flag carrier does.
---
I'm quite positive a lot of the downvotes you're getting are less "dude that's kinda mean :(" and more people prone to saltiness over exactly this kind of thing feeling called out.
---
Play Dungeons and Dragons!
---
You are right and I didn't mean to defend that guy, I was just trying to prove a point but I guess it was a bad example. Nevermind.
---
Hunter is orc. Wc3
---
I would, but I don't know where to start
---
Someone has an idea of what they are going to do, but that information isnt published or available yet. I think this coming week a lot of these answers are going to start being answered in the form of beta tests.
---
Is this sarcasm?  I can't tell.
---
Heroic and mythic raids are what ruined retail raiding for me. Wiping to a boss I can’t beat for days? Cool, fine by me. Wiping to a boss I’ve already killed 2-3x this tier on different difficulty? Why.. it ruins content.
---
To me the first many levels is very close to the exact experience from vanilla :)
---
No man's sky has come a long way since 2016. Picked it up for $20.00 
---
Lots of exploring space combat and base building.
---
Massive amount of fans will follow them to which ever server they choose. That will result in basically all gear being filtered to the streamer(s) along with gold. You can forget about even trying for the gong to open AQ since most likely the streamer(s) will be funneled all the quest stuff, etc.  
---
Trade chat will end up like twitch chat, spamming memes and all that. Quest mobs will be camped to no end. Basically it will be impossible to do anything or have any fun.
---
You can only get 5 per hour, and only if you're lucky.
---
the witcher 3 if you haven't played it before
---
I’m gonna go for an RP-PvP server to see and partake in huge scale battles and be apart of server story lines.
---
And I don't know why people require scholarly essays for every common sense point made on the internet nowadays.
---
People like to play on freshly released servers. People like leveling at the beginning with everyone else, breaking ground on raid content, and PvPing when less people have a massive gear advantage over them. There's a reason that "FRESH" is a meme in the private server community.
---
&gt; WoW went from 5m subs in vanilla to 10m in TBC to 12m in Wotlk.
---
Your completely irrelevant data is worse than having no data at all. Just because the game gained popularity over time doesn't invalidate what I said above. That's like claiming that if a city's population is increasing, that means that there aren't any people who wouldn't want to live there. Completely ridiculous.
---
Praise Geraldo
---
It was a bad example and my point came out wrong. I didn't mean to defend that guy.
---
What if its just open?  I think its likely they will start with invite only and open it up rapidly until its public.
---
&gt; This is pretty much a non issue. 
---
Why are you assuming no one wants to play on a PVE server?  How will this not be a problem for those people?
---
god shes hot
---
It doesn't "ruin" the game for everyone. If anything being on a streamer's server makes the world more eventful. It was super cool walking by xroads and seeing a giant mob of people around Asmongold. Sucks for the streamers, but its a cool thing to come across as a player. Different strokes for different folks, but I'm definitely eager to make sure that I do join a server with a streamer
---
Considering most streamers have fast internet, the best hardware, etc it might not be so much of a miracle as you think. They'll at least be able to be competitive with the trolls if they are spread around all of the servers rather than all of them targeting their server
---
I wouldn't say Horde is necessarily the bad guy. There are many instances where the Alliance have done shit that was 10x worst than the actions of the Horde.
---
Did you play on actual launch day tho?
---
The fire elementals in Ungoro are always a good place to farm those. They also have a small chance to drop essence of fire as well. Some thorium veins there too
---
Picked up Factorio recently, both the best and worst decision I have made in a while.
---
Ok thanks
---
Fell Seal: Arbiter's Mark. Turn-based single-player RPG, like FF Tactics
---
&gt;It's definitely even worse for them. Imagine having hundreds of fanbois following you around harassing you with party invites and sending you gold all the time. These people can't play the game.
---
Do big streamers even play WoW classic? I would have assumed the potential audience for the game is way too small.
---
Mage, Warrior, Warlock, Priest, Rogue as the top choices. Not even surprised. There are going to be a ridiculous amount of Warriors all trying to do dumb stuff like Fury dual wield tank, or Fury DPS. 
---
We had a Fury Warrior when we raided BWL and he was made fun of every night.
---
Yeah, that would lower my DPS like I said so why would I do it?
---
I really like Preach's UI, so if I can get close to that, awesome.
---
My friends and I are avoiding private servers to ensure we have full hype train momentum with zero burnout when classic launches.
---
Currently we are playing Rocket League and Terraria together. Solo playing I am trying Mass Effect: Andromeda but have been subjected to a seemingly endless stream of bugs. Will likely uninstall.
---
horde obviously every girl will want to play a stinky undead or a cow
---
Have you tried not being this thirsty? Grab a Sprite.
---
Oh really? I didn't keep up with sub numbers, but I thought they had 9 million around the time they last reported?
---
Idk man. Red team in any game is evil.
---
Light’s Hope is a great one, just started there recently- huge player base! Almost too many in some areas
---
The duality of classic wow Reddit community. 
---
* Wants 10k population servers, and dismisses all thoughts about server stability. 
---
* Wants to avoid streamers because of over-population leading to unstable servers, and troubles leveling.
---
You're quite the pogchamp to say that. 
---
There's always that one yeet who doesn't get the hip new lingo.
---
I can tell you I've had this same experience with runescape when oldschool was released. It really is *that* fun again, the feeling you'll get when you see that login screen again for the first time is unreal. The rush when you login and see everybody else starting completely fresh.
---
If they use Vanilla names Ill prob jump on either my OG Vanilla server or the one I joined later and still am on, Illidan.
---
also 20k+ is not a few thousand people
---
Yeah you’re probably right. I’m not stuck on holy shock but my biggest thing once I drop holy shock I like dropping the Crit chance and going into reckoning lol.
---
Hard for me to be half in the pool at that point lol.
---
He seems nice, but he is pretty odd and some of his fans come across as straight up insane.
---
They invited him to try the 8.2 patch at Blizzard HQ tho - he just couldn't go because of his dad IIRC. So their opinion of him has changed since then.
---
Youve never heard of Mikepreachwow?
---
He does Youtube and Twitch and has been giving Blizz loads of shit since WoD for design choices. He pretty much praises raiding and M+ but shits on everything else. 
---
He also does a stream and youtube series called Dramatime where he reads drama that happened over WoW and other MMOS, a lot are from Vanilla-WOTLK era.
---
If you're not going ice barrier, you go Pom Pyro I think.
---
Yes of course. It was a bad example. The point I was trying to make was this: https://youtu.be/Ev-cy000SaM?t=196
---
I agree depending how n the streamer and the size of their fanbase.
---
lol! Hi there, Barrens chat!
---
That’s what I was wondering about. It feels doable to me as well. I’d probably go 21 into prot at this point.
---
Well the game is not out yet but yes there will be big streamers playing Classic.
---
Anyone know for sure if Hemo was normalized in 1.12?
---
I'm not saying it's frequently used but the fights that do have fear mechanics really do benefit from fear ward and tremor totem.
---
Hmm I've always felt that Night Elves have the best character models in vanilla. Humans are just so tiny.
---
Surprised at so few shammies.  Y'all not remember what Windfury was like back in vanilla?
---
Elite dangerous. It’s a little hard to get into cause of the controls and lack of direction but it’s a really fun sandbox that looks incredible even on my laptop
---
Well done man i laughed
---
I played druid in vanilla, but i forgot. 
---
Can you switch into cat straight from bear? Or did you need to go in cow/elf form first? 
---
And, weapon enchants didn’t work iirc?
---
Does weapon skill do anything in bear/cat?
---
Ty in advance :-)
---
Monster hunter world, and sekiro were the last two games I played. Might have to take a break from wow when MHW Iceborn comes out in september.
---
Your post is sort of unrelated.
---
I’m not planning to raid as prot lol
---
I hope you have tons of fun!
---
Dude. WoW's launch was AWFUL. I managed to make three characters. A night elf warrior, a night elf druid, and a dwarf warrior. I didn't get to play a lick past reserving my names. Servers were up, down, crashed, 'try again later', all sorts of errors. Not exactly the most iconic launch, I'm sure, but it was memorable. The sheer amount of bitching in my then guild's TeamSpeak server was astounding.
---
I’m starting to lean 30/21 myself now to be honest.
---
Great troll post.
---
Heffercraft
---
The last time they reported actual subs, it was around 5.5 million and that was several years ago. They only report earnings to shareholders now.
---
Engineering has force reactive disk, which is really good for tanking.  Particularly early tanking.
---
My suggestion otherwise would be alch/herb.  Having a supply of buffs and healing pots while leveling is great for a war, as they don't have a way to disengage or heal during fights.
---
It shouldnt come as a surprise to you that they are selfish. As Asmongold says ‘Can i get that?’
---
An hour is better then months in advance, the less people aware the easier it gets for them to level up.
---
Like your comment's karma XD
---
I know it was, thats why I was asking. Because of all those errors, it was hard to tell which servers were actually low pop and were just coming back online or whatever. I picked a low pop server and it ended up being actually dead as fuck. The Forgotten Coast, ugh!
---
hearthstone
---
woot! sparks is legit atm
---
yeah, pretty much
---
and if they release tbc and you haven't found a girlfriend by then you'll have plenty to choose from because of the blood elves, so yeah go horde
---
Have a long-term BFA sub and be a streamer.
---
He as a person/streamer is ok. It's his fanboys that you want to avoid.
---
woah FFT is one of my all time favorite games, will look this up
---
As much as I want to play an undead rogue and gank asmongold over and over, I too really want to play on a non streamer server
---
Yes, a true neard's lair. 10/10
---
So tanking phase 1 is only referring to dungeons? My bad. I actually just looked at an alliance guild recruiting for Classic and they have a Pally planning on being primary OT. Figured you were going that direction too
---
Sweet, this sounds really fun! Appreciate the response.
---
But colluding with the other faction isn't allowed either, and it's one of the things that Nostalrius didn't take action on, which allowed the Devilsaur Mafia to keep going strong throughout the servers lifespan
---
And on top of that there was plenty of speculation that they got help from the GM's/owners of the server. It was just all around an un-fun experience.
---
Thanks for the good info!
---
Depends if you wanna ‘rush’ to 60, or take it slow and enjoy the journey i think.
---
Gettin engineering asap will cost you some gold, and will not get you any. But it’s cool to use. However, getting a mount at 40 fe is going to be harder to pay for...
---
Personally my ‘main’ druid is going for gathering professions, getting to 60 with descent gear ready for the honor system.
---
 My ‘alt’ lock will get mining, engineering, fishing, cooking, first aid, the whole shabbam, his journey will be the truly epic one ;)
---
Remember that reckoning is fairly average in Vanilla because you wont be able to /sit and force it to proc, so the more defense gear you get the less chance it will trigger. It's still nice but it's not as essential as you may think. If one handed spec works as espected and is a pure 10% damage increase to ALL damage when using a 1h/shield then this will be worth more than reckoning.
---
If you're dead set on maximising your damage and threat as prot though (which I can understand, I'm planning on doing the same thing myself) you should just bite the bullet and go 31 or 32 in Prot and grab Holy Shield and heal as best you can. Just get 14 holy for the increased heal size and snag the cheaper seals/judgements from Ret and spam mana pots to make up for the loss of illumination. 
---
30 Holy 21 Prot is pretty much indistinguishable in raid healing power from a traditional 31+ Holy paladin. 31 Prot is a definite weakening of your healing but if you have a more casual raidgroup that accepts you as primarily a Prot paladin that heals in prot spec most of the time then just go all out prot. Lacking illumination, divine favor and 5% crit is more about your mana efficiency than your healing output. 
---
You can still heal pretty well with just 14 in Holy, you'll just have to manage mana a lot more closely and the rest of the team will have to pick up some of the slack.
---
Alternatively 20/31/0 should work fine but will be that awkward halfway house of being a mana inefficient prot tank and not QUITE as good at healing as a pure holy. I'd rather go all-in on one spec.
---
I love Asmongold! I just don't want to be on his server.
---
I never saw it in vanilla as a hunter. Play mage now on pserver and have done zg to exalted and never seen it.
---
Pretty sure you had to macro between bear/cat.
---
Weapon enchants didn't work.
---
Weapon skills didn't affect bear/cat.
---
Asmongold will be virtually untouchable at all times. I would be impressed to see him and his parasites wiped out by a group of the opposite faction.
---
That could run BFA just fine.  Out of curiosity how much are you looking to pay for a machine like that? I just came across a 1060 laptop for [$699](https://www.amazon.com/IPS-level-i5-8300H-Processor-GeForce-Gigabit/dp/B07JF6HRJ1) and is the best value setup I have seen.
---
well I've done it once I'll do it again.
---
So don't stream wow as your job? They can't be a wow celebrity and then get mad when the paparazzi show up.
---
Are you mentally challenged?
---
I feel like a huge chunk of people would be just trying it out, instead of actually trying it out though
---
And here I assumed the Classic community would be more mature than retail.. 
---
I know this is a troll post.. but the kind of person who finds this post funny is pretty much of the same mental maturity as the kind of person being mocked. 
---
Maybe being in my 20's just makes me too old to find this shit funny, idk.
---
I think Priest is one of those class that lots of people want to play, but will realize how hard and boring it is.  
---
All they'll be doing is either wanding mobs to death, or running to dungeon all day (now LFD teleport). At least they should be always up to date with relevant gears.
---
Magicka 2, the gameplay and combos are amazing. it's on sale now too 😁
---
Lol it will not even be that bad.
---
Thanks. 829usd before tax. Is the one you are talking about the same or better specs? If so where can I find it?
---
This is all Fegelein's fault.
---
seems legit
---
https://www.amazon.com/IPS-level-i5-8300H-Processor-GeForce-Gigabit/dp/B07JF6HRJ1
---
Finding a group should be ok. Good luck getting gears though. Lots of competition.
---
Sekiro and Katana Zero were both amazing singleplayer games, and I recently got into Mordhau which has been an insanely satisfying way to scratch my multiplayer itch
---
Any sort of group that want's to play together will be in a discord channel together the minute it releases so it will be very straightforward to organise regardless of when they announce servers.
---
Yes I agree. I'm not saying they're victims. I'm saying it's unfortunate.
---
”scaling does happen” - On a large sample sure. On individual basis you can’t guarantee that. You might be that warr that never ever gets to see a 1h drop. Week after week you grind your intances and those fuckers only drop those 1/10 raids you miss out on. Likely? No? Impossible? No
---
How... many ants did you eat to get that title ? :)
---
Eat a snickers bro
---
Yeah but classic diablo and diablo 2, could still be played without some illicit third party service.
---
&gt; "These are the answers all raiding hunters looked for!!!
---
[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]
---
Lighten up...
---
Cool, I’ll look into that.
---
yikes, this comment
---
That's bad we want retail to have no popularity then It might get changed lol
---
Anal
---
You should play with me. Haha. We can take over a low pop server together! =)
---
Thats the point tho, to an extent. Starting zone test will need just raw people. Server stability in certain zones is also worth testing and with the streamlined reporting features of 8.0, I think many more people will report stuff than ever before.
---
I know one of them got their fans to flood moonguard for some reason recently and disrupted shit for a few weeks. I have a feeling at least one of them will roll on a classic rp server just to be an asshole. I hope I'm wrong though, cause I love rp servers.
---
I play Foxhole every now and then. 
---
It's a World War 1/2 theme'd MMO where teamwork is basically everything. (I HIGHLY suggest a microphone for it). It's the first MMO in a looooong time where I actually communicated with others.
---
It sounds fun. You could start a guild dedicated to ganking a streamer.
---
Was a male orc shaman on vanilla, went female belf hunter on tbc and onwards.  
---
  Will be troll female on classic.  
---
  Male wow models are too bulked up to look good as hunters imo.
---
Or he could have gotten to rank 13 then stopped grinding honor and dropped back to rank 10
---
I agree with you, but I'd add that another reason to go the 20/31/0 is that it's pretty strong for PvP compared to 30/21/0, and you really only lose a tiny bit of healing power
---
There's literally nothing you can do to increase your chances, besides be a popular streamer or YouTuber.
---
much better card than the one you described, and the one I linked has a 256gb nvme solid state drive which is super fast and quiet
---
Answer to all these below.
---
It's several down from the top if you look at my posts on my profile, but there's not much to it. It was my first attempt at humor on this subreddit and was more of a half-assed attempt at starting a humorous dialogue than a post presenting quality comment, and it got locked within a minute of being up before any comments were added. (and i got banned lol) It was somewhat vulgar for this subreddit and might rub some people the wrong way (though I have fun having joking conversations like that). I've tried to clean up my posts and make them more broadly appealing since then.
---
I am pretty down. I plan to have a good guild on a lower pop server. Less competition for Scarab Lord :)
---
I'm playing through Ocarina of Time. I only played the first two bosses and Ganondorf on a friend's N64 back then so I'm giddy about finishing the game. Really fun actually and my gf is watching me fail at jumping. 
---
If you like 4X games then Imperator: Rome was just released by Paradox. It's a Risk-type game set in the time around the Roman Kingdom and Republic.
---
found the guy who wore suits in 9th grade
---
Hi, /u/The_Adm0n
---
I would like it to be open as well, but they've never done open beta, so when I said "right", I was speaking more in-scope of whats currently being done with their closed betas.
---
Rosenbaum and Pearl is a must. You would need to have those concepts nailed down before an interview from b school. The PDF is easy to grab with some Googling.
---
thanks my good lad ;)
---
Your a priest, you would know if someone is being one.
---
Gnome prot warrior for the memes
---
I dont see any comments saying what keyboard your using.
---
You're assuming a whole fucking lot here, tbc never had the push classic had for a reason and they already stated classic will remain forever.
---
Instant hunter attacks were normalized, but to my knowledge Aimed Shot was not.
---
What, is logic not making sense to you?
---
The absolute septic tank that is [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv) chat culture is horrid and I want to avoid it at all costs.
---
I don't fight for anyone. I play the game. :)
---
In Warcraft I played all campaigns. They were all interesting. In WoW both sides are equally interesting. My guild chose a side, because you have to, and so I'll play that side. That's it.
---
I find any kind of "choosing a side" a bit weird.
---
They also normally do 6 month long betas, or more. They don't have time for that now. Opening up to public would be best and with the stream lined method of reporting stuff from 8.0 engine, more people are likely to report stuff, its so easy to report stuff now. I think they will likely start with it closed and invite only and rapidly invite more and more people until its open to everyone. Tuesday private only, wednesday 25% are in, thursday 50% are in, Friday everyone is in. BINGO
---
They have never said or even vaguely mentioned such a thing.  
---
  It's not a vague memory, it's blind hope.
---
They where good dps. Except at MC/BWL mainly because they needed so much hit. They did scale pretty well and have some of biggest gains, in terms of dps. Mages/warrior/rogue are the kings of dos but the lock isnt too far behind. And some fights they can out dps some rogues and warriors.
---
I don't particularly like him. But, ya it's his community that is horrible more so for sure. I wouldn't have an issue with him if the community wasn't basically 4chan.
---
Hi, Im thinking of playing either a mage or warlock when classic launches.
---
The thing is I Dont know which proffesions to choose : Tailoring/enchanting or Engineering/mining(or maybe some other combination)
---
I want to raid with the occasional bg. Also I want to gold farm, so that means a bit of world pvp aswell...
---
Help me choose a profession pls
---
I remember you having to switch back to the "neutral" form before going into cat/bear/travel/etc.
---
As far as enchants I believe the weapon proc enchants like crusader and lifesteal did not work but if you had stats like +22 agility they did.
---
Ye and he is literally the only one of the big streamers that is scared of world pvp (because he sucks at it lol).
---
STV at 30? Hell nah lol i usually go there when I'm 34-35. Earlier than that and you're just asking for it
---
There is always a bigger fish.
---
Notsureifserious.jpg
---
Fury is not only viable but with proper gear it can out dps any other class.
---
Swing by his stream and read the twitch chat. It's less him and more the fact that he has an insanely toxic community of viewers.
---
Most probably human girl. I want to main tank and I think that aggro is important. But sometimes I'm thinking about Night Elf girl, she is so pretty and some avoidance won't hurt either! Main tank have to survive after all. But probably human, she looks more like a warrior. Probably I'll roll Night Elf HUNTRESS to farm gold.
---
Thanks man! I think I’ll get this one then. You just saved me 200$! Not too keen on computers and specs.
---
Imagine believing in a magic man in the sky.
---
I run bfa on a 12 year old shitbox with a video card from 2006.
---
Haha I'm sorry but this is just absurd. Twitch has exploded over the last few years. There are thousands of streamers with 10k+ subscribers. There is literally no possible way they could have enough servers for there to be one with no streamers on.
---
Alliance! Girls like pretty faces and Alliance have plenty! Avoid dwarves though...
---
Haha. And there it is there. Great logic.
---
100% this right here!
---
git gud
---
Was really hard last time i played it on a pserver, most of the time the healer is a priest, people will usually take a mage into the dungeon over a lock for the cc, so thats two cloth users already, most people dont want a 3º player fighting for the cloth gear, so it takes way more time looking for group that the healer isnt a priest and doesnt have a lock in the group already.
---
But it makes the class more fun for me, being hard to find groups, so whatever.
---
Nope,  he's a self admitted scammer and proud of it
---
Troll or not this is what a lot of us nerd gamers want :P
---
I am 30 and I found it funny. 
---
Being a virgin really does make guys all wound up.
---
People absolutely solo farmed in dire maul in vanilla as well as Mara.
---
For sure Alliance. Only fat girls play on Horde
---
There is a single druid spec that is amazing for both healing and cat DPS.  It's HotW.  All you need is two different sets of gear.
---
I mean do you expect different in here? Lol
---
Think about all the poor spaniards who have to watch all the memes comming from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgzdb0txR_c) clip without sound
---
Id assume itd be till 10. 20 would be waaaay too much for classic.
---
Oh boy!  We seem to have had a very similar childhood.  Gearing up for interviews again, so been brushing up on that book.
---
That's a pretty awesome laptop for 699
---
For engineering and PvP does it matter to go goblin or gnomish?
---
Interesting. I never made it there. Thanks for filling me in.
---
/shrug. Sure it will. Transferring characters won't delete them!
---
Do you know if your wow account has to be active to get a beta invite?
---
I am not going to lie, its the main reason I am even going to play this game again. Low Pop PvE server for my best chance at doing what I couldn't do in Vanilla, Bang a Gong!
---
Are you me?
---
t2.5 on mages looks so nice
---
He's trying out ESO a bit now and its the same shit. Can't do anything for real because theres always 20+ dicks just running around him.
---
I'm playing ESO heavily right now. Really digging the world, and the fact that you can pretend it's a solo adventure without much trouble.
---
They did say they would like to do TBC. Nothing I have read about wrath though.
---
Yeah, but streamer fanboys are cancer to the human race, and if they are following their golden gods to our PvE realms it will suck.
---
Stuck aswell, will save this post
---
The server I was on when I did the quest was one of the servers that got fucked over.
---
We had seven or eight, can't remember which, people with scepters. I was one of them. All of us were waiting to bang it together so everyone could get their mount.
---
Some absolute FUCKWAD came in and rang the gong in the middle of the night when nobody was there. Everyone else got screwed over by it. 
---
It was an absolutely horrible situation, and I legit shed a tear out of pure anger.
---
&gt; We all know by now to avoid streamers.
---
I think you're overestimating the Classic community's current involvement in WoW.
---
I couldn't name a single streamer or was even aware it might be some kind of issue until seeing this thread.
---
Who cares who they are or what crowd follows them anyway?  Just makes it like an extra world event if it's as bad as you all say.
---
One of them requires a phone
---
Apex, LoL, Ascension (Private server with random abilities)
---
Does that info get published? Like servers say US - East, or US - West?
---
Your post isnt even a rational thought. It makes no sense. I honestly feel bad for you...
---
No one is untouchable in PvP. You don't have 40 CDs to save someone in open world. You could have 50 people around you but all it takes is a few rogues in stealth to zerg you and force you into a 5 minute run back.  And if you fall behind leveling it might be worse.
---
And if they are deadset on not having a RP-PvP realm at launch, we need time to organize which PvP realm is the defacto one.
---
Yeah I don’t want to get into that kind of thing. Holy is life lol
---
&gt;It's definitely even worse for them. 
---
I mean, sure it is, but they are also making money doing it. The rest of us just suffer for no benefit.
---
I hope she sees this bro
---
Rust, League of Legends, Rocket League
---
i was thinking skinng until like level 30 then leveling engi and farming arathi to make iron bombs to sell to work towards mount. then i will be able to maintain engi until level 60
---
Bruno Ganz acting is so good in that movie, i rather skip the memes and watch that scene again and again.

Are there any Oceanic streamers with a big enough fanbase to cause problems for a server? I don’t really watch twitch so if anyone knows any big names could you let me know please!

Just talent Soul Link. You won't need fear to ruin everyone and everything. Ambushed by an Undead Rogue? Seduce, start staggering away (you'll be crippled), Fel domination, Curse of Agony, stop for .5 sec to summon Voidwalker, start moving away again, Soul link, (CoA's first tick will break Seduce around this time) Corruption, stop for Drain life chain spam, sacrifice the voidwalker for damage shield if you dip below 35% hp, summon succubus, seduce, repeat. Mix in nightfall proc SB's as they become available. Deathcoil and healthstone for emergencies. Look for kiting opportunities (after Sprint is on CD), and don't forget to weave in shadowburn between DoT refreshes while you're maintaining distance.
---
Every other class is easier than that except the mirror match - then WotF becomes a small advantage.
---
Boom. Fearless warlock pvp wreckingball. If you're trying to optimize your warlock, go gnome for Escape Artist (the int is just a bonus). Me, I prefer human, but that's because gnomes make me sick.
---
Here's all I read...
---
"There are always smaller fish."
---
\&gt;:)
---
Pros:
---
Portals, food, water, good at farming gold, easy time finding dungeon groups, easy time getting into a raid guild, decent at pvp, 3min 1shot mage fun with pom pyro, have different specs to play during the server progression, easy leveling, easy gearing pre-bis, can farm gold while in raid spec, doable pvp outdoor on raid spec, can raid while watching netflix while using the frost spec.
---
Cons:
---
?????
---
Have to conjurer water and food for everyone on the raid, but there are probably other 7 mages that have to do it too, so no so much at end, just macro it for when you have to do it on bulk.
---
Profit.
---
I would never stay a prot spec for a full time thing.
---
I plan to heal end game content. I just like the ability of throwing some of my scrap epics on and tanking dungeons for friends and alts etc. I’ll probably tank when I farm for T0.5 during the later phases. 
---
I just wanted to know about gearing BIS. I’m going to rethink about going a build like you’re saying because I feel I’ll gear the fastest being able tank and heal. Once I’m done phase 1 BIS I’d go back to deep holy.
---
I’m a girl and I’ll play whatever faction you want big boy
---
Can't really remember that many raid encounters where interupts were an issue.  
---
And warriors have 2 by default, pummel and shield bash.  
---
When it comes to utility, that makes it pretty moot.
---
Easy bud
---
The most significant thing about that exchange is that he stated “End of Summer”. Blizzard just said “Summer” but this is more specific. I would say we are looking at late August or September.
---
It's rank 13 gear. I have it on my Hunter too. A week before The Burning Crusade got released, Blizzard let everyone buy R13 and R14 gear with just honor, no rank requirements.
---
Everyone had rank 14 armor and weapons. It was wild. We were basically given it for free
---
I play horde.

Dude. My kid is 9.
---
I met my kid's mom in Vanilla WoW. She was the only dwarf priest online when my guild needed to do Nef. Fear Ward was OP AS FUCK.
---
Long story short, we had the sex. And I love my son. She's nuts, and we aren't together now, but seriously. Be careful when you date women online. Sometimes shit gets crazy!
---
Upsets me that with the way streaming and youtube is, some people will get the mount basically for free. I have to find the perfect conditions and still hope to get a bit lucky to even hope to have a chance at getting it.
---
I miss the "Massive Multiplayer" that today's MMOS have been lacking. It is true that there are always bigger fish, but for example in a place like STV your practically forced to form massive groups / raids just to get anything done there, which brings the element of "Massive Multiplayer" back into gaming if you feel me.
---
While I realize that essentially all of classic you require a group / guild to overcome a lot of the content, I feel that PVP will scratch the itch that I've been having
---
This isnt available anymore?
---
I'm 34 with a kid who's 9 and will play Classic WoW with me.
---
Both of us think you need to calm down and have more fun. Your life doesn't need to be so serious.
---
No, they didn't, which is why all the "what after naxx" talk is probably the biggest topic on the table.  
---
  Give me a source where they said it.
---
Tauren. Theyre probably my favorite Horde race after belfs. And they have Hunter, which is what Im rolling
---
omegalul
---
Now where are my upvotes from the hip, cool kiddos?
---
Alliance..
---
..because Feral DPS sucks on Horde side compared to Alliance.
---
Alliance. All the girls at my work are, ironically, rolling Night Elf Hunters. Literally ALL of them running the same faction, class and race!
---
Exactly. 34 here, with a kid. Found it hilarious. Mostly because my kid's mom? I met her through Vanilla WoW.
---
You also get the first very good ring. I think its stamina and strength. For warriors atleast, youll keep it for a very long time.
---
Just a heads up, you're going to need to mine quite a bit more after you hit 60 if you want max engineering.
---

Woah, that was a rollercoaster

The worst part about AQ40 was the emps to cthun trash. Took so long to clear.
---
I didn't even think about the pop culture thing, great point.
---
fucking hell this is prime internet banter and cynicism i love it
---
While you are correct overall, your argument of not many people making it far in raiding will not apply to classic the same way.
---
Apart from players being more knowledgeable and skilled in general, blablabla, the real important issue is time. There will be a lot more of it. Don't forget most people who played vanilla didn't play from start which gave them averagely a year? Now they easily have 3 if there will even ever be a whipe. This means a lot more people will reasonably get far.
---
As a vanilla hunter that made it to 4 horsemen, I can tell you, you do fall behind. A big reason is that you keep full t2 till you can almost replace it in its entirety by t3 (skipping aq40) which doesn't help. Even the AQ ranged weapon upgrade is from a very hard optional boss, which might very well be skipped in favor of naxx.
---
I miss my hunter but I don't look forward to feeling 'gimped' (too strong but still) for what for me will be the real interesting part of the game.
---
i like this spice.
---
Yup. That's why I'm going to lead my guild as a prot warrior and main tank. Always been a tank. I like doing my job well. That'll give me a solid chance at rectifying the past hell of getting screwed.

Pvp servers are slight less terrible in the first couple of hours. Then they sick just as much as they always do.

Pvp is stupid

Two weeks of family vacation without a chance to PvP ruined the final part of the grind.

The Horde ganks because the Alliance ganks.
---
Well, that's not quite what I meant. I meant getting into that mindset. Sometimes people seem like they're engineering the fun out of the game by accident, especially when the same folks try to get all the content done as fast as possible and then turn around and say there's nothing to do.
---
I understand that a lot of people probably find min/maxing to be a lot of fun, but I also see people who almost seem to do it out of obligation. I feel like those people would have more fun if they'd intentionally adopt the mindset you spoke of in your first comment and just ignore the optimal path to instead immerse themselves in the experience. I did, at least.
---
I'd also love world pvp to be kicking, but not by no lifers like those little monkeys.
---
much rather get a release date over beta. Beta doesn't excite me since anything on it will be wiped, will be limited in scope (level cap as example), and probably limited invites to begin with. Release date is something concrete I can actually use. Like finally being able to ask off work. Even server names and the amount of servers at the start would be preferred to me as it helps with planning.
---
Towelliee has been kind of a manic weirdo in this subreddit recently, posting a lot of spammy semi-coherent comments about how wrong everyone is about the news in May.
---
He's the last person I'm interested in hearing from.
---
Going Alliance 😀
---
DANG SHOTS FIRED!!!  
---
True Though...
---
Ice Barrier is pretty much necessary if you're playing solo in pub groups. If you're in premades with support (heals/dispels) than you don't need it and the extra burst of fire can be put to good use.
---
I don’t know, I’ve heard about elemental mages on organized pvp a bunch recently
---
i feel like the big dates are 14 &amp; 21, being tuesdays.
---
Just the other day, I saw a Nelf warrior about to get destroyed because he pulled too many. I ran up and saved him on my Tauren.
---
Sometimes there is pleasure in breaking the rules. It was a sudden breach of peace between Horde and Alliance. And more importantly, a giant middle-finger towards something even bigger.
---
I mean, it doesn't matter too much. I only went through the trouble to perhaps increase my odds of a beta invite - I'm not going to play him.
---
Did not expect hunter to be so low on this list, and warlock and priest so high.
---
This is a troll post
---
I definitely agree with the whole progressive push of multiple waves of invites, but I just don't foresee them doing an open beta. At "best" maybe an open (closed) beta for all active subscription holders.
---
if you muted it though ;)

If you pick one or the other there are drawback either way.  I love the gnomish death ray and chicken and you don't get those if you go goblin. Goblin crafts the useful consumables like the sapper charges.  You can use these as gnomish but it's a lot more of a pain to not be able to make them yourself.
---
If you're in it for the long haul I'd go gnomish, craft the BoP items, drop engineering and go goblin.  Then you can use all your gnomish bop items and you can craft all your useful goblin items

To me, most streamers are kind of like minecraft. The actual product is good, but their devoted fan bases are fucking cancer.
---
However much no-life power you think you have, someone can NEET even harder. There will be level 60 Rogues within the first week.

Getting ganked in an unfair fight from a lv 60 sucks, its the worse thing about PvP servers. You just have to ask yourself if all the other benefits outweighs this for you.

They very well may tie it to something. I can not see a universe in which blizzard doesnt offer some special edition of Classic for like 20$ or more even. Buy that special version, get into the beta. Profit for them and profit for us. This way people are serious about the game get into the Beta and nobody who cares is really left out. Win, win, win
---
Guild already exists on ND, god bless their souls
---
I am playing Horde this time around, almost assuredly.
---
"Strength and honor!"  
---
When I first started out I played Alliance because they were kinda shown as "the good guys." I was pretty young, so why wouldnt I want to be a good guy?  
---
Then I was shown the truth
---
The Alliance are pampered, racist snobs who know nothing of honor and nothing of kinship. Look at the races Alliance has in classic. Human? Im already a Human! Night Elf? Elves are cool, but these treehuggers sit up in their tree away from everything. Dwarves? Yeah no thanks, I dont want to be short, hairy, and angry. Gnomes? Are you fucking serious?
---
Look at the HORDE. Kinships bonds stronger than steel. They fight with the upmost honor they can. Theyre misfits who want a place to belong and call their own. They gladly welcome in any race willing to fight for their brothers and sisters of the Horde. What about their races in classic? Orcs? Classic counterpart to humans, with big ass fangs and shit! Tauren? Fucking. Cow. Warriors. Easily the coolest race in classic. Forsaken? Badass reanimated people fighting under the ABSOLUTE BEST FACTION LEADER. Trolls? Cmon mon! Who dont want to hang with da voodoo?
---
Obviously this is super exaggerated but I just never felt like I connected to the Alliance more than I did the Horde. Lok'tar Ogar!
---
What should be my priority for rep grinds when I hit 60 as a mage tailor?
---
This is vanilla you’re talking about? You and I had a much different leveling experience if so.
---
Horde is always mad cause they're ugly so yeah..
---
Most of the bug streams rolling NA realms?
---
It's really not that big of a deal for PVP.
---
In classic wow you need to be comfortable grinding out a level. The reason for this is multiple. From the obvious fact there arent enough quests to go 1-60, to avoiding getting ganked.
---
If an area is being patrolled by lvl 60s, just move to another area. If you don't have one with quests, just grind out a level or two.
---
That's the worst case scenario.
---
Other then that, in the past I have seen a relatively solid response to world pvp bankers. Especially if you are a part of a guild.
---
Lvl 60s are often bored, and while some are out ganking some are usually hanging around looking for gankers to go fight.
---
Just dont get caught up in trying to 1v1 a level 60, and hope you dont end up on a server with a poor population ratio.
---
There will probably be inter server transfers eventually, as population decline can only be expected.
---
That's a good point, still I'd imagine it to be a lot less likely in the first month vs a year or 2 in... idk mane I'm so split 😭
---
People who play alliance read fantasy books and think dwarves are cool
---
Horde are Bros
---
Bro! I played a Night Elf Druid called Susanna rank 13 and I can't remember one loss against you guys, only wins :) Only team that put up a fight was Llaw Arian from stormscale
---
Against what streamer?
---
My main is an Alliance though I have played alts as horde, I'm going horde this time, not because I have a preference but because I'm playing classic with my brothers and that's what they wanted to roll this time.
---
I'm definitely going to play a Druid in Classic. 
---
Night Elves girls are prettier, look better in gear, have better animations, but I dislike every other vanilla Alliance race.
---
Tauren girls don't look as good in Druid gear, I don't like the race very much. However, they never have to PvP against Shamans, which is a bitch for a Druid. Plus I love every other Horde race.
---
I've been torn over this choice ever since I decided I was going to be a Druid in classic.
---
Not at home right now, but I'll add you once I'm in front of my computer.
---
That's a really good point. I change my mind.
---
Baggyman
---
I think he seems nice and genuine.
---
Indeed.
---
Literally any alliance who stream the server lol, they have 4 episodes up on YT
---
Sacrifice. Lots of sacrifices.
---
As all things should be
---
&gt;Based on earnings reports, there’s speculated to be 1.7 million subscribers or less at the moment.
---
Crazy, that actually puts it less than ESO(2.5mil active players) atm.
---
No, it doesn’t at the end of the day. It was more of a nostalgia thing for me. I’ll live! Best of luck getting a beta invite, friend!
---
Hey, got the wow icons on my store! https://www.etsy.com/listing/691944534/handmade-warcraft-class-icons-from-world?ref=listing_published_alert
---
Probably not. Honestly it's better to assume the worst. End of summer. If it releases before then, then you get a very happy surprise and you don't run the risk of ruining your own hype with wild expectations.
---
The best enchant was +7 damage or something just raw blue enchant for melee cat druid
---
But then you find yourself surrounded by dozens of Asmongold's goons whose god just got brutally murdered. Also hello again
---
Loved my old Ret but I only played WotLK onwards. Why were we good in vanilla?
---
But then they will need the same gear
---
What's wrong with your name ? I have the same thing for some of my character aswell.
---
Agreed. Low key, good music, no obnoxious commentary. I love watching him during the FRESH madness of servers.
---
Said like a true key turner
---
I’m going alliance mostly cause all my RL friends are going alli. We all played horde originally in vanilla and wanted a new experience since none of us are familiar with how the leveling is on the alliance side.
---
imo it is far more frustrating to level on a PvP server, but at 60 there is a lot more content out in the world because of WPvP. 
---
I'm a bit torn on it as well, but I think I'm still going to roll PvP server. World PvP looks very fun in vanilla.
---
Also, it pretty much guarantees that you avoid big streamer's servers.
---
PogChamp!
---
I was Horde in TBC and Wrath but I'll play Alliance this time around. I was a shaman for a long time back then and never liked that class, until I finally rerolled a Mage, and I really loved it. However, I'll play a Paladin this time, as in the last few years, I found my role as a support in other (competitive) games, and I realized I really enjoy it. I put a lot of research into my class choice, so I'm pretty dead set on that and I can't wait for Classic. Or a release date. Or anything.
---
I don't see any porn. I'm just saying.
---
Just go moonkin instead and farm mana pots and demonic runes dark runes
---
I'm definitely going to play a Druid in Classic. Unsure which faction, keep going back and forth.
---
I'm talking abojt the big streamers. There are many comments saying that it wouldn't be an issue. Nobody's holding a gun to your head saying that you're not allowed to play with your favourite streamer. Most people will be avoiding streamers for reasons that have been explained several times. You can do what you want.
---
Always horde!
---
Played horde mainly, had a couple alts on alliance just to try a paladin. Still gonna roll horde
---
LOK’TAR OGAR
---
It's flagged to be changed - if you haven't logged with that char for so long you'll be asked to rename your character. This does not necessarily mean your previous name will not be available.
---
What's it called? I want to see this
---
one of the best things is all the original names people had
---
A quick search of r/classicwow will provide you with all of these answers...
---
yeah, that comes down to everyone having to define what 'fun' means for themselves
---
those people who race to finish content, then complain that there's 'nothing to do'...are probably among the people who repeatedly start over on 'fresh' servers, because repeating that content is what they enjoy
---
but would they enjoy it as much if they...didn't have to wait? if they 'finished all the current content', then the very next day a new fresh server opened and they could go right over there and do all that FUN stuff again?
---
would be just as fun if they did that again? and again?
---
this is what I always talk about: we've played this game a lot, and some more than others. we've played multiple expansions, or the same expansion many times. In our heads, we have a checklist, and as we play and level up and hit max level...we check things off of that list.
---
Without even trying, we'll zip right along taking the 'most efficient leveling route', because many define their joy in that experience. It's not as much joy as they found in it once upon a time, but it's incredibly difficult to 'intentionally take your time and immerse yourself' in something that, let's face it, you're a little burned out on.
---
After you've grinded timbermaw to exalted twelve times on private servers, how do you do it in a 'fun, immersive way' on blizzard classic? after you've journeyed through fifteen years of changing expansions, and with each expansion blizzard PREDICTABLY made rewards slightly easier to get, and gave us more of them, and allowed more content to be seen through less time invested. When that effort to time to reward balance has gone through so many changes in your brain...how do you revert it?
---
that's a question each person has to grapple with themselves...but I know that for some, they find some semblance of immersion in 'the game' when they seek social interactions in 'that game'. when they invest time into building that community, they meet people, make friends, blah blah, doing the same old stuff but with new people can very much 'reinvigorate' the experience.
---
level racers have their own definitions of fun. my definition definitely doesn't involve level racing, and I know that my desire to be a part of building an in-game community will naturally bring refreshing fun to it
---
but really, if you don't want it...why do it?
---
lmao essay
---
I’ve never once been able to turn an entire key. They are very hard
---
I just want a pvp server named Arthas
---
Lol, they could literally just stream on one character and play on another server without revealing themselves. However, the server they stream on will be perma-ruined. It's definitely worse for us, not them.
---
These are all made out of MDF, meticulously cut on the scroll saw. Then painted in matte paint. Now to find more WoW things to make to pass this painful waiting period!
---
This post is more toxic than anything like what you're referring to tbh.
---
https://youtu.be/Ymk80wcPsX0
---
This is a really cool video by this guild too. "light of elune" is a one time use 10 second invulnerable. You get it in your mid 20s in ashenvale as a quest reward I think. Really clever play.
---
Apes will be a fun guild to watch in classic.
---
Very well made, nice work OP.
---
So they spend 10 hours streaming WoW. Then to relax after a long day of playing WoW, they play some more WoW on an alt.
---
Thanks!
---
Is everyone a streamer these days?
---
Yup I'm 34, married, job, kid, etc. I don't want to be in a guild of peeps like myself, invite me to your try hard guild and carry me ;)
---
Interesting even the survey with 15k responses still shows rogues behind warlocks like this one
---
Cloth or Plate
---
But you're not always going to have a paladin at your side?
---
Well, the one racials helps you with classes that stun, and the other one with classes that fear, simple as that. Yes, there are LAP/FAP potions, but at the same time, there are shadow reflectors and fear immunity trinkets from engineering and blacksmithing.
---
Also, the stun resist is passive so it'll always be there, but you rely on RNG. Really depends on what you like more.
---
96% now.
---
My first level capped character was an 80 BE pally
---
Right now I think I’ll be playing a Dwarf Priest
---
I have not seen that video in a long ling time. Thank you
---
Elemental mages have a great deal of mobility, CC, long cast range, strong instant casts, and impressive damage. They also have 2 magic schools so interrupts aren't the end of the world.
---
Sfk is sick: Good drops for virtually every class, horses can drop bags, fun for pallies and priests to try out anti-undead stuff, cool spooky theme, some mobs require legit tactics and group spacing and of course lots of fun/grief pvp outside. Take the trip it is worth it.
---
While it's great to speculate, I would just be happy with a Collectors edition that maybe had some kind of statue..
---
One issue is when 1000 people roll characters to follow that Streamer.  Suddenly there's a massive faction imbalance.
---
Is this new or has it been there?
---
Not sure how your expertise as an economic analyst plays into this :)
---
While Berzerking is active, does the attack speed increase during the duration as I lose health, or is it static from when I first use it?
---
Lol
---
NA, I was in malicious and hit list toooooooo. I'd love to play with satsloader/sapsloader again. Satloader owned Western plague lands in vanilla. Shout out to vaibek and roarssk. 
---
Epic video:
---
https://youtu.be/4GcetWn5z9Q
---
Oh yeah, that's nice.
---
Do you take commissions? I'd like one of these
---
Not sure , Jaythebard was visiting the Blizzard campus and posted it up. I personally have never seen anyone else post a picture of it when they visited the campus.
---
Good chance I'll roll horde, not for certain but fairly likely in order to stay away from my first trip in classic 15 years ago
---
In a raid you will have a full accoutrement of blessings
---
Correct.  I didnt log on for so long that my characters names become available again.
---
I want to pet every Druid!
---
Why shouldn’t you roll on a realm just because a streamer is there?
---
They all have cell phones, right? /s
---
Not according to the guides I’ve read.
---
Main reason I'm picking durid is because feral is the closest classic has to duel spec "tank and DD". 
---
Warrior is my 2nd choice. Problems is that thier dominated by mages and No duel spec.
---
Couldnt they always just make a character they play off stream ? Still sucks balls though
---
Whiffing WF 20 seconds in a row in PvP was one of the greatest bummers ever. Also the PvE "non-viability" of both non healing specs makes the class way less desirable I guess.  
---
As a shaman way my main back in vanilla, and people were quite carefree and I didn't pursue huge goals aside from PvP, playing the meme specs wasn't that much of an issue, but with Pserver elitists, classic purists,  and a different attitude towards gaming, time management, effiency and performance as well as the widespread consensus to check that stuff, I believe classic will play out a "bit" differently this time, definitely for the worse IMO.
---
and set up addons / UI
---
I think non-potato computer specs, long-standing, active, bnet account and no (or at least no recent) infractions on your account are the most important things. I got legion beta even without and active sub so I don't think that matters too much, but I would suspect having played the game in recent years would help.
---
None of the Alliance zones compare to the glory of the Barrens and Crossroads. But one fellow listed three Alliance towns so those will suffice.
---
Tailoring enchanting mage, free bags and enchants and teleport!
---
Yes they could, but I doubt if they would want to play WoW on an alt after finishing a 10 hour stream.
---
Doesn't have to be an NDA.
---
But nobody is going to take a feral as DPS
---
woohoo my server :)
---
Weird I remember more ally players then horde ;(
---
/ thunderfury undead warrior tank Rankorr :p
---
i remember you and those you wrote :p especially skyddsängeln for some reason think he lived in the same city Gävle :p
---
 are you talkin about classes?
---
WHAT!? Hahahaha
---
Just you wait, if forsen plays classic it's going to be just as bad for EU.
---
Love to purchase one of these. Have a store ?
---
Probably impossible seeing as the amount of people streaming WoW Classic will be insane for the first month. 
---
Then it'll die off and whose to say who sticks around.
---
Nice setup, but your mousepad is upside down! ;)
---
Yep, you definitely want 30/21/0 then. You can honestly stay this spec 100% of the time as you want ONE holy paladin with BoSanc in every raid group so it may as well be one that enjoys tanking.
---
30 holy is literally all you need to be the best raid healer you can possibly be. The other 21 points are all fluff that don't really help your basic healing role, just your utility. Doesnt matter if you stuff them in prot, ret, or all over the place. 
---
21 for BoSanc is perfectly fine for tanking all dungeons and also with 30 holy you can heal any dungeons in the event you have a tank but lack a healer (though this will be rare). I'd rather tank an instance as 30/21/0 than heal one as sub-21 holy.
---
Professions don't have skill trees. Talking about talent point trees.
---
if only they had a choice to stream their gameplay or not
---
🦀🦀 JAGEX IS POWERLESS AGAINST BAGMAN 🦀🦀
---
I'm going to be quoting this for as long as I play wow.
---
Can someone explain to me why people want the original itemization?
---
They redid things because the original itemization sucked, and actively punished certain classes, especially pretty much all healers as well as feral druids.
---
Most +healing gear had too much spirit, and not enough +int, and feral drood itemization was hot trash.
---
Paladins had a tough time as well, their epic sets worked ok for Ret/Healer builds, though the odd combination of all the stats except agility made them under-powered, but they had no class tanking gear at all in the purple range.
---
1.12 didn't exactly fix everything, but by that point a significant number of welcome changes had been made, unless my memory fails me.
---
nice feet
---
What is it with all these people on this sub begging everyone else to "not min/max". Just play however you want to play and stop preaching to everybody else. 
---
Also, you're actually wrong about scaling. What you're describing is RNG. RNG is a factor, too. You could get extremely lucky and get decked out in 3 weeks, or you could get extremely unlucky and not get one piece of gear in 4 months. Either way, scaling will happen. Eventually.
---
And that's not even taking into account crafted gear which is a guarantee for anyone who farms it. Bloodvine set, hello?
---
Yeah I think this is the best answer here. 
---
You’re right, I might as well go 21 into prot because someone has to anyways.
---
you're all hip and now , ill break your hip RIGHT NOW
---
Pirates of the pancreas, stream sniping
---
They better not release a collectors edition that would cheapen the ppl who bought the real ce 15 years ago
---
Imagine watching kungen in 2019. He’s really bad at wow and honestly raiding back then was nothing like it was these days, people clear tbc/wotlk and vanilla raid in a week,
---
What about after leveling? World pvp, bgs as a duo, etc.
---
Obviously they do. Just because they have a choice doesn't make it any less unfortunate.
---
He did zero analysis and basically brushed off scaling with "you can't be certain to get gear". Scaling is a thing, hunters scale terribly, nothing he ever writes will change this.
---
The two games aren't connected, at all. On your thought process nobody should get scarab mount in Classic because it would detract from those who got it in Vanilla? That train of thought is a slippery slope.

He's not wrong, you're just upset.
---
I've also been wondering this. I enabled beta on my account but i let my sub drop in april.
---
Eh all chats are gonna be toxic, that’s just how the player base is nowadays
---
In ascending order of importance I reckon. WoW ftw!
---
This is one of many spawn points during Scourge invasion - a pre-naxx event. Those mobs drop the standard undead tokens if you have the Argent Dawn trinket equipped, blue anti-undead 3-piece armor sets, other random drops as well as Necrotic Runes, a AD currency for that even that can be turned in for some consumables, especially for DPS toons going to Naxx. A deep frost mage can solo all of them or get rekt if mobs resist some of the CC (reason to do it in a group to get people take rogue mobs that aren't the part of main AoE)
---
* [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Necrotic\_Rune](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Necrotic_Rune)
---
Except within 30 minutes someone would find out what server you were on and spam it in chat...
---
This wouldn't affect anything, except for the smallest of streamers.
---
Asmongold has thousands of viewers. This would encourage trolls more than deter them. It would become a game at that point.
---
Asmongold is taken on every server already trust me
---
&gt; I'll just check the channels a few days prior, and make sure to avoid those servers.
---
Yeah, I think it's very likely someone on this sub will make a consolidated list of streamers and the servers they want to play on, as long as Blizzard share the server names before hand of course.
---
Same!  Our girls are done with school now, and they both are looking forward to playing with us.  Back in vanilla they were a bit too young and only leveled their toons to 20's or 30's...but now they want to raid :)
---
It's crazy because he's never like that
---
/who [class] [zone] [level or level range] [player name] [guild name]
---
e.g. /who warrior westfall 18-22
---
He could easily hide it.
---
What does it matter if there is a streamer on your realm?
---
There will be dope and cool, if new Classic will don't have support any addons! xD
---
This drama about streamers is pointless. Who cares about those geeks?
---
Played as alliance on the the NA Shattered Hand. So many memories.
---
PM'd
---
What I remember is: "No current plans to progress servers but we are listening to feedback"
---
If nobody does, I myself might do it. A vast percentage of people really do NOT want to level all the way up to 43, just to find out there's a gang of 200 fanboys following StreamerBob on their server.
---
Who cares? You're not doing that on a Warrior until you out gear the content. And Druid probably still clears the dungeon faster anyway thanks to Innervate and self heals (little to no downtime for the healer).
---
In real situations that actually matter: Druids can make use of sapper charges just as well as Warriors.
---
I’m on the lookout for an Alliance guild rolling on an EU PvE server. Ideally looking for something with weekday raid schedule.
---
I’ll be rolling Hunter. I played one in Vanilla and TBC fairly hardcore and I’ve been playing on and off since then through various expansions.
---
Cheers!
---
Getting downvotes for telling people to be kind rather than turn the ass-ometer up to 11 at the first sign of a repost?
---
Righteo
---
Undead female Lock. Male Tauren Drood.
---
Insightful commentary.
---
I would love one of these!!!!!! Can you PM me info??
---
I play mostly without addons and default UI. I may get some basic addons eventually but nothing that I NEED to have.
---
Haha, U2
---
Yea, that can help.
---
Some streamers are keeping their character names and realms a secret to avoid stream snipers. If you start playing immediately you may be playing on their server without even realizing.
---
One faction worships a clan who is known for drinking demon blood, leading to the slaughter of most of their people, and thinks Thrall is a genius.
---
The other allows a woman who just so happens to share a last name with Deathwing's human disguise stand next to the future king of Stormwind.
---
They're both horrible, so I usually just go with the ones who can stand up straight, can wear boots, and whose architecture isn't just mud and stone with spikes shoved in it.
---
you win sir.
---
Well, there won't be BGs for a little while. They won't be coming until a further content cycle, along with the updated PVP system.
---
Static when you first use it.
---
I'll give my first gold to that individual
---
Hello everyone,
---
I am planning on rolling human warrior when Classic launches. Am I going to be limited to tank in the endgame? I’m completely okay with being limited to tank for PVE, but will I be able to be a DPS warrior in PVP? Or will my PVP gameplay lack due to being a warrior?
---
I'm glad someone made this! This is gonna help so much! I can find me a healer to pal around with in a zone on my warrior lol!
---
Or maybe you played with bad DPS? You just need two globals to Swipe 6 targets before your DPS can start attacking. Two of those targets will get hit with Maul in that time frame as well - and you don't have to use expensive consumable shields to get that result.
---
If I'm playing a Warrior, then I would be happy to let the Druids do that so I can save my shield for when it actually matters.
---
There should be a poll with class AND primary spec (or role). It would be interesting to see what percentage of those Warriors are planning on being tanks.
---
I want to play paladin but I want to play horde &gt;:(
---
How? I'm sure it would be differentiated from the original WoW CE, would probably say "WoW Classic Collectors Edition" I'm sure.
---
Streamers have 1k-30k concurrent viewers. Many streamer servers will have multiple streamers. Concurrent population for each faction is about 1250. It will be bad.
---
Or just count Shaman and Paladin together, as "buffs guy" class!
---
Either way, they're leading, proportionally. Very surprising to me.
---
can they not target by party/raid frames?
---
What add-ons? They haven't been made yet? Can't use old add-ons.
---
Never played blood elf, cus elves are gay. Orc master race.
---
Sylvanas doesn’t love you back, she hates alliance.
---
I watched that. He estimated there were close to 100 people following him at one point. I don't feel super bad for him, because I'm sure he's doing fine streaming for a living, but that has to be frustrating.
---
That's great the youngest back then is now a teenager and is checking out WOW right now and might join in on the fun.
---
I disagree.  We have downvote buttons for a reason - to get rid of pointless posts.  No need to throw a hissy fit and get hostile with people who post things you’ve seen before.  Downvote and move on.
---
Not gonna apologize for preaching some positivity in this sub and sticking up for somebody posing a genuine question that relates to classic wow.
---
Is rip scaling as hard core as people claim (6% per combo point) actually true vanilla or pserver rubbish? 
---
Combined with being allowed to use a debuff slot and also power shifting with consumes, how raid viable does feral get? Also, will horde always be worse than alliance for feral?
---
(Can’t watch video, at work)
---
That's not greek. That's military.
---
Yes, it was going to be a MC through BRD style of entrance for naxx 40
---
Explain?
---
Oh god I forgot about the ignore list thing. Hopefully they kept it at modern capacity, yeah.
---
Doing this was the only reason I got exalted with argent dawn, super fun event though. I remember the world pop getting a shot of vitality because of it.
---
Why don't you set up a discord channel? That way you can contact everyone at the same time.
---
Because it will be done when it's done. I'd rather them get it perfect than rush it out the door.
---
Why are streamers on the same server bad?
---
Servers are in 350 E Cermak in Chicago. I live a block away and my ping is 900usec.
---
He's clearly Kenshin Himura.
---
Nope, endgame for most warriors is DPS, and they are one of the best classes for that job. There's relatively few spots for tanks and guilds typically have them selected. You may have to tank the odd dungeon or two though. Warriors are great in PVP too!
---
That's awesome, as I have come across a family in wow. What even funnier, we used to compare the best way to ground our kids when it came to wow.
---
It does not. A trial account from 2007 could receive one.
---
Yeah and it could only help both sides too, I hope it gets sticky'd for a while if it does show up.
---
Kappa, *am I right, guys?*
---
5/19 sound like 11/11/11 for Skyrim... So now if someone calls a baby born on 5/19 *Mankrik* does he/she gets lifetime sub to WoW? :)
---
As a single mum, I agree.
---
I don’t understand this post. I donMt think you’re thinking it through. First, don’t assume majority of people want to avoid streamers. Most players want to play with/troll streamers. So with that knowledge, the streamer’s realm will be the more populated ones. If you want to avoid streamers that is fine, but in a few mknths don’t whine about being on an empty server.
---
They stopped reporting when they dipped under 5 million in WoD. It's believed, because of what seems to be a slip-up they now deny, that Legion had 10.2 million early on, but that's about it. Estimates for how it's doing nowadays are definitely on the low side.
---
Awesome, thank you for the reply. 👍
---
ESO's 2.5m includes non-subscribers, though. Still impressive as a buy-to-play game, of course.
---
Rogues are top DPS in early vanilla, fury is good but it doesn't really shine until aq/naxx gear and even then you need a lot of BiS for it to be insane like you see on private server vids.
---
The Tuxedo Jacket and Pants required level 30 in vanilla. It was changed to 1 sometime after.
---
Must have. He just called Zin'Rokh a hunter weapon!
---
It's crazy how wrong this is.
---
Flask of distilled wisdom is a must, a flask that is literally used only by healers. Mana pots are a must and demonic/dark runes should be too. Mageblood potion (once released) and Mana oil are both also necessary...
---
Not to mention Elixr of Sage's, Greater Intellect, Sagefish and Nightfin. There aren't any +healing consumables besides Mana oil, but there are a ton of needed consumables to augment Mana. If you're not using these things then your raid is bringing too many healers and sacrificing dps.
---
Hunter or rogue is the correct answer for lowest consumable consumption. Get jujus, Giants, and firewater then call it a day.
---
Most streamers won't miss the opportunity to steam on launch. You will be able to find out a fair amount of the servers to avoid if you can wait an hour before choosing a realm.
---
What shop?  Asking for a friend.
---
What VOIP service are folks using nowadays and will people be setting up and linking voice channels for PUG 5 mans? 
---
Back in the day it was all about vent but I don't know if that exists any more.
---
I better have access to the damn scarab mount lol
---
What patch?
---
Back when I played vanilla, I started as Horde but swapped to Ally for some friends, and only managed to hit 60 on Ally. It wasn't until WoTLK that I finally had the chance to level a horde to max.
---
I really want to go horde, but part of me wants the full nostalgia of being Ally again. I can't decide.
---
Not really I guess haha
---
I’m only playing alliance because my close friend is only playing a paladin. Actually, I should roll horde and kill him until he switches
---
I'll reserve my name on all the PvP servers in my region then see how the population is shaping up before committing to one
---
Elwynn Forest.
---
Clever Goldshire Retriever post. What kind of dog is that left of Malfurion?
---
Scholo/Strat farming doesn't give more? Those token turn-ins are superb low in rep value (but the invasions does last some time).
---
STvietnam. Say goodbye to the merry adventures.
---
I have a very good memory of the levels 1-30. Beingin Elvynn Forest, Westfall, and Redridge Mountains. Some how they burned deep into my mind.
---
If you mean one specific are id say Ironforge.
---
even though I'd love to experience levelling as alliance scum,  I'm horde for life I'm afraid.
---
I agree, this other guys train of thought is kinda backwards.
---
Ah true. Then paladín for heals and durability.
---
Show her one of your level 20-30 characters and then let her make a new character on your account. She'll want to play more the next time she comes over.
---
Why? the real vanilla supported addons in 2005...
---
Oh and please, your english. :D
---
40 man raids will end up taking anyone with a pulse
---
And im sure the beta wont cover all 6 phases, most likely just the first. The other phases will prob be ptr
---
not sure how they will be named but when you sign in server you can tell by server time.
---
Do go on how it instantly ruins the game for you...
---
Just imagine what chaos there will be!
---
And yeah, sorry for my bad english skill, I'm russian xD
---
Finally an Australian server, right?! 😂😂
---
&gt;just so happens to share a last name with Deathwing's human disguise
---
I think it's funny that the Alliance is the faction of racism and bigotry, but on this one we were like "well hold on hold on, let's not prejudge anyone here."
---
If like to order
---
Winterspring
---
Addon developers with beta access can start porting them to Classic
---
I would would be willing to pay a higher subscription fee to play on a "no streaming" server.
---
Not with a macro.
---
Why does Reddit revel in other people's dismay/turmoil?
---
I get the beta is like irrelevant and not something to be actually upset over but it's a common trend on Reddit and gaming in general to relish other people's "salt"
---
Looks like everyone wants to order these and I’m a bit interested myself , how big could you print these?
---
There's a BE outside the inn in ratchet were you end the escort quest as well.
---
Please stream it happening.
---

---
There's a lot of you here who instantly become confrontational because they don't immediately see why playing on the same server as a streamer is a bad thing. If you don't understand or you have a different opinion, feel free to join your favourite streamer and follow them around.
---
Oh yeah for sure.
---
Dude makes more than i do playing video games and watching YouTube, im not gonna cry for him.
---
But its still fucking dumb to have to deal with
---
No, he is talking about diablo, warcraft, and banking
---
Its obvious there are more than 3 items, also obvious that they equal 3 different things
---
Burning Steppes,  it had Black Lotus, dreamfoil,  Thorium, multiple treasure chests, good humanoid mobs for runecloth, dragonkin for black dragonscales and it was easy to reach.   I was never much of a farmer, but when I went, I went there.
---
Classic was designed to run on Windows 2000 computers, yo. Your computer is already more than good enough for it.
---
That being said, if you ever want to know if something can be upgraded, it's all about the motherboard. Whatever's compatible with the motherboard is compatible with everything else (at a broad level, anyway), so just check to see what the best X part is for your particular MB.
---
They are made of wood, so about 4 ft x 4ft if needed, but i don't think that would make it viable for shipping. The ones in this photo are 10 in x 10 in x1 in thick.
---
I didn't play in Vanilla. Only in tbc. Is rogue a good class choice if I want to do mainly pvp but also end game pve? Are rogues good at solo leveling?
---
Also has blizz announced a release date yet??
---
I'm so pumped for these epic moments.  I felt like building my computer was the equivalent to the AQ war effort.  My mom wouldn't let me skip school when my server opened the gate...  Now that I'm an adult I'll just skip work.
---
I looked longer than i care to admit for a crudely edited in dog like it was some sort of puzzle.
---
That kind of stuff is what will be changed because 1.12 was ported up to the 7.3.5 code base. Similar to how classic will have the same 50 character limit as retail does today.
---
Of course I'm talking about the people who DON'T plan on following streamers around, praising them, and having the whole game dedicated to them. The point is for us regular players to avoid these people. If you do plan to follow streamers around, you are well within your rights to do so.
---
I tried the benchmarking, which came to the conclusion that my graphic card and processor needs to be upgraded as well. Or do they suffice for the Classic and the other games I mentioned?
---
Josh will join Esfands guild on NA and play on NA servers.
---
everything is good in pvp in their own way, and rogues/warriors are top dps in pve. rogues are one of the slower levelers but it's not that bad. no release date.
---
it's all about discord these days
---
These are amazing!
---
It definitely was published back then, I played on a US East server.
---
I keep seeing this posted a lot and I think it's the completely wrong mindset. I intend to play on the streamer servers as they bring good communities that will help keep the server consistently popular over time. Negative encounters with streamers will be .1% of your experience and sometimes it will be good in terms of getting into large scale wpvp scenarios. Overall I see no issues in terms of it bringing immature audiences. In fact most classic streamers have very good communities. I just wish server lists/timezones would get announced early.
---
Westfall.
---
So if i am understanding you correctly. A hunter which is physical range dps doesn't need mana pots like healers or mages do? The only bullshit a hunter deals with is feeding pets and ammo buying?
---
Last time I saw a Downfall meme was probably actually retail classic.
---
Planning to start as mage then bring up a druid or shaman alt to 60. I want herbalism/alchemy somewhere on those two. The mage would start with skinning/mining (arcane crystals prices?) and then switch professions - tailoring and enchanting as an option - But enchanting on leveled toon it's kind of questionable. Without rare enchants as well as raid enchants later on this will be quite dead profession aside of oils. Tailoring to get bags rolling, craft the BoP chest, likely get some rep recipes like Flarecore Leggings and so forth. If farming a lot of mobs could be used to funnel enchanting. Still not sure how to organize it :) Main will have rep here and there and it would be good to take advantage of while use alt for gathering.
---
Also depends how the world will look like when hitting 60. Skinning may be handy to source dragon scales for sale, skin The Beast or maybe even Onyxia if guild so desires so. Will pristine hide will be in Phase 1? Mining could be used to stock on future arcane crystals needs if those will be rare/expensive or just to stock mats for temporary engineering to make guns for enchanting boosting (engi guns, tailoring armors).
---
All of Teldrassil, even though it was kinda lame to level in (rummaging around in Furbolg lairs? No thanks) the atmosphere of the place was fantastic.
---
???
---
Impressive break down, nice work mate
---
Theres a reason they were called ‘clothy killers’
---
Every University I went to in Australia had some form of gaming club, and this was 4-8 years ago.
---
Would like info to get one of these please (I'm French)
---
I lost my shit at that part LOL
---
i feel like we should spread more awerness of this as classic is nearing , many kids are delusional and think rogue is some unstoppeble god
---
Good looking out.
---
Awesome, thanks!!
---
One hour after launch is an eternity caught in the zerg :(
---
This is awesome!!!
---
The salt is already pouring in lmao. I gotta say, i agree with OP and love it too. Your throbbing assholes make me laugh.
---
Oh, it's definitely not that great for the other games listed. But the other games listed are leaps and bounds beyond Classic in terms of required processing capacity. It's like comparing *Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* to *Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time*. You can run OoT with a Nintendo 64. Good luck doing that with BotW.
---
If you want to play the other games at really high capacity, I'd recommend at least a 900 series graphics card, a solid state boot drive, twice as much RAM, and an 8-core processor. But your setup would handle them reasonably well as long as you at least upgraded the GFX card. 4 cores is adequate, and the other stuff is marginal for things other than boot time.
---
[Here's my very-overcompensating setup for comparison.](https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/16893554) Surprisingly, I'm pretty sure the worst component is my pretty old computer monitor? Anyway, if you get even halfway toward that, you'll be good to run basically every game on the market at a decent capacity.
---
We didn't have hashtags back then and we don't need them now.
---
Its cool that you did this. But I can’t ever see myself use this guide, can’t imagine how being stuck to strictly following these steps is any fun.
---
all i did was sell boes that i got throughout leveling, you really don't need to spend that much gold during leveling besides your mount at 40, usually end up with around 600-800 and then i just grind the rest and buy my 100% mount
---
Loooooooool
---
there's no proof of anything though
---
He did play vanilla though.
---
Duskwood... oh the memories
---
***...Lyme disease...***
---
Less than 2% of the people that will play classic are under 18, soo the term ‘kids’ doesn’t really apply here.
---
doing quest chains, being efficient with choosing rewards that sell for the most, selling boes to people instead of vendoring them, gathering professions, etc
---
Looks really good, Ive been following the videos and trying it out myself. Any plans to include the maps you made for the videos in the writeup?
---
Nice! Do people just provide links discord voice channel links in party chat?
---
Must have been quite the nostalgia high^^
---
Your boss sounds awesome.
---
The rest of us pay for the privilege of that suffering lol
---
Oh man.  I glanced through this at first and was crushed.  Thank goodness it was just an AI.  I want to get back into Classic WoW where there was meaning behind the community on each server.  You knew who all the big PvPers were and all the big raider guilds.  You watched your adversary on the other faction leveling with you as you jumped into a battleground and saw the familiar name "N00bMaster64" killing you at level 43 the same as he did at level 27.  Even though you were worlds apart in language and culture you still shared something.
---
Darkshore, I spent levels 12-22 on my hunter going up and down that coastline killing murlocs until my bags were full or I couldn't kill them anymore.
---
When the mobs got too strong I went back vendored and started again. The ever present mystery of what I would fine farther down the coast drove me onward. When I finally crested that mound revealing the Night Elven ruins and the entrance to Blackfathom Deeps I was blown away (these were my first NE ruins on my first character).
---
I was compelled into those depths and after finally navigating through to the instance portal I had hit another wall. I did what the game naturally compelled you to do. Form a group. Go into the dungeon. Go through those winding watery caves and ruins that have been appropriated by dark cultists, kill them all, and take that sweet loot. 
---
This whole experience hooked me on the game. I scoured every cave and ruins in the game throughout my leveling experience and the reward of finding chests, rare mobs, and the occasional dungeon made my day every time.
---
Dwarfs are gorgeous shut your mouth
---
To be honest I don't hate the program, it works great even though I do seem to have a few bugs here and there but it's not a big deal. It's just used as a carrot on a stick a lot. People require discord idling for certain services, memberships, etc. Not a fan of that is all.
---
Barrens
---
and the Murloc lake
---
You think you're going to get the diablo pet for buying s new version of the ce today when the only ppl who should have it are the ppl who bought original ce. Dream on
---
Depends on the spells, you should always be buying stuff that is going to make kills easier on you, just visit the vendor at every opportunity and you can make due with smaller bags for quite some time.
---
&gt;How much would it suck to play for a week and then finding out that a streamer started playing on your server? 
---
Incoming character transfers
---
Absolutely.
---
Every time I hear that music I'm flooded with nostalgia.

yeah discord is pretty easy like that, you just put in the link to your browser and it should auto join to the channel in your browser, or the app if you have it.
---
have to download the discord app if you want to have push to talk though
---
As an macro-economics PhD I disagree with this sentiment, and simply point to my diploma if you have any follow up. 
---
P.S. call me doctor.

P.P.S. I have a masters in classic wow speculation, respect muh authoritah
---
I started Horde and raided Horde up till BFA. I'll be going Alliance for 2 main reasons.
---
1. It will be a "new" experience. I was Horde for so long that I missed abunch of Alliance things. Switching to Alliance in BFA had me like, "Hey guys how does Alliance get to x?" constantly.
---
2. I'll be playing druid so I need that fear ward :/ and Alliance seems to be more inclusive of druids. Took me till the end of BC to reverse the stigma left on druids even after patches buffed them. "Naw find a warrior" 'Guys..I'm in T6 with Wildfury Greatstaff...I can handle heroic Shattered Halls...'
---
Thanks for the reply
---
Should probably have focused on grammar instead.
---
I admire the initiative, but I would suggest basing the workout on regular time intervals only. Get a timer, set the timer, repeat
---
West fall killing harvest golems or duskwood running into stitches
---
Ashenvale, or perhaps Un'goro. The former because of that boss music. The latter because Un'goro.
---
why would a gathering item be bop ever?
---
black lotus is going to be irrelevant in vanilla, they are tuned to spawn very often on private servers which isn't blizzlike
---
everyone doing endgame raids on private servers can use flasks because they're so abundant
---
It's personal preference really.  For me I won't go any larger than 27" for any game.  I think you'll be fine either way though.  You might need a UI mod though.
---
It's the music man.
---
Tailor/chanter druid. Farm my own fiery enchants/crystals and such, stealth ftw. We all know cloth is the best healing gear too :P. Although with these stats on leatherworkers...
---
Still though, the odds of him getting BRE or something like that quickly aren't exactly high.
---
That's fine.
---
blizzard will almost certaintly do this if they care about the game
---
streamers will ruin every server they're on for everyone disinterested in them
---
unless you want your in-game chats to be stream chats then avoid them like the plague
---
Once you go Troll, you never reroll.
---
That shaman one is lit
---
Play Undead if you don't want to play an "ugly" race. Or roll Alliance. Or don't play Classic.
---
The desire to play a char doesnt always mean that will be the percentage of classes at 60. Pally is hard to level and most people think they need to be healbots
---
I'm interested in a few please message me
---
Not at all.
---
What essential element to PvP does shrink ray provide?
---
I thought "Die" was part of the once every 10 levels workout session.
---
The majority of the people on this sub want to avoid big streamers, 10 or 20k wankers wanting to follow around some guy with a webcam don't represent "most players".
---
&gt; Why are you assuming no one wants to play on a PVE server?
---
I'm not, it's just that doing so isn't accepted by the community. If you're not the rooster in the hen house strutting around saying "duel me brah!" people look down on you.
---
It's my favorite, with Warlock right behind!
---
Why are you so hostile? I personally care not for any pet in the game save maybe the Tyrael pet from Paris.
---
I'm pretty bad so it'll be way more often than that haha
---
Going troll, never played one in classic past level 10. Plus they have great racials, goofy dance, I love raptor mounts, and start in durotar
---
Pretty sure Asmongold stopped raiding semi-seriously at the mid-point of Legion. Some of the Legion Mythic raids broke his will to raid. He's effectively a casual raider now. I believe he also mentioned when he Mythic raids, he gets angry, can't interact with chat, and isn't good for viewership. By being a "casual" player he gets to engage in chat more.
---
He only killed two Mythic bosses last tier, and 7/8 of the first tier. He also doesn't do weekly Heroic clears like most do.
---
I plan on playing on the most popular server that all the streamers are on. Watch them cry their eyes out when me and my boys stream snipe them 24/7 with our gank squad.
---
warlock with sm/ruin
---
mage with winters chill and some other taken stuff like shatter and imp cs.
---
30/0/21 ele/resto sham is not bad for healing dungeons but bad in raids. 
---
it really depends on the content, raids will obv be harder in your pvp specs but dungeons are doable.
---
Wait, are you suggesting that people who bought the CE originally should get the pet in Classic as well? I understand that thought process better but still disagree with it. As I said before, the two games are separate entirely.
---
Let me know when that happens
---
Someone fill me in, why are streamers bad??
---
What’s the point of picking a faction if you’re gonna change? Lok’tar.
---
This is crazy !!!
---
Ungaro. Nearly 60 and such a cool looking zone and mobs everywhere so you actually have to be careful roaming around!
---
Please PM me pricing
---
I'll never forget the Spanish druglords meme one with blizzard making Tseric the paladin spokesman in vanilla that meme video was great. 
---
Edit: I cant find it at all. Either was deleted or i didn't save it to my YouTube favs.
---
30 days /played on average for leveling? Cmon...
---
Im fcking crying
---
Bookmarked, thanks for all the work!
---
Five seconds in... I can already tell there’s no one I can listen to someone speak like that for twenty minutes.
---
Oh you’re kidding I’m super intrigued, Human master race end game? Would you be willing to send me your active spreadsheet? Thanks for the replies all aboard the hype train.
---
I want to roll horde, but honestly, alliance has way better cities.
---
Crazy cool I hope!
---
Do you have a source showing how bad he is?
---
Once something like Questie gets added into the game, people will just follow a general zone flow and looking for the markers on the mini map as well.
---
Loch Modan.  Spent so much time in Dun Morogh - crawling through that tunnel into bright sunshine and a hobbit like village was amazing.  
---
Westfall is a close second.  When I imagine playing classic it's always in those zones - everything fits just right, the music, starting to get stats on gear, talents, professions - things start to come together.
---
Youtube commenters.
---
hey, what country do you live in?
---
Super super cool! Much love !
---
Waaaah! People aren't having fun the way I want them to! &gt;:(
---
U.S!
---
Yeah goth is absolutely nuts.
---
I very much suspect he has a separate account that is private for when he actually wants to play games. If he even really does at this point lol.
---
That's not really fair... it has more to do with him being the single biggest source of WoW Classic misinformation out there right now.
---
the shaman one is killer, good work
---
How much?
---
Barkskin may not always be available. It existing does not disprove what I said about Tranquility being able to be pushed back by damage. This isn't even the worst part of Tranquility. It healing for barely more than Prayer of Healing is the real issue. PoH can be cast any time, no cooldown. An 8 minute CD and it barely heals more than PoH? PoH also has a 30 yard radius, up to 36 yards with talents. Tranquility is 20 yards, no range increase. How is this even an argument at this point?
---
Regrowth spec is very inefficient and only tops meters on short fights.
---
There is not enough mp5 in vanilla to make shamans into a decent healer. Consider also, that shamans are required to drop totems often while moving through trash, especially in a speed clear setup, and in top tier guilds, some are required to totem twist GoA and WF, which is even worse for mana and takes globals away from healing output.
---
Please, take a look at legacyplayers. Tell me how many shamans are in the top 30 for any raid on LB or ND. Some raids have no shamans at all in the top 30, some have as many as 2, molten core has like 5. Top tier, yet mysteriously absent from top lists?
---
How much for the Paladin one?
---
You picked the wrong thread to say this in.
---
Ehh no coords?
---
Love these! PM me your info?
---
Who cares about beta you can go play on a Pserver now.
---
