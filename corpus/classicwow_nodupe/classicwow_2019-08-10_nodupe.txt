Your question is a bit confusing. If you meant "is it possible to only travel to Chicago for a realm hosted in Los Angeles?" then the answer is no, the realms aren't hosted in multiple locations at once.
---

---
If you meant "do realm timezone labels and their actual hosting location ever differ?" Then the answer is no, at least not anymore.
---
There was an era when the timezone of some realms did not correspond to the data center they were located in. There were PST realms on NY/Boston servers, EST realms on Seattle servers, and a bunch of each in Dallas for seemingly no reason. But when AT&amp;T consolidated their hosting locations, and Blizzard stopped having to worry about hardware quantity limits in any one location, they opted for just Chicago and Los Angeles and stopped doing this.
---
Obviously we won't know for certain until we can get into the game and run traceroutes, but I don't see why Classic would be any different than Retail has been for years.

Murlocs are from Warcraft universe :)

I want to play on bloodsail so bad
---
Basically you're just seeing a different area of the story, rather than following the story happening in the Undead lands where you normally would level up.
---
You can always go back and do these quests for fun if you want. Or you can roll an alt and see them that way.
---
I do recommend you level 1-10 in your starting zone just to get a feel for the game, your class, and so on, before venturing off to join your friend in barrens. But that's just me.

This needs to be higher up.  If Brasil is playing there, I am not.  Sweet jesus, we had a time on Kil'Jaeden server group with them.

Where are we getting the Herod resurrection of BG9 rumor. I was leaning toward it simply because I liked the name. I’d be down for a resurgence of the bg9 era.
---
Logistical question: how on Azeroth does all that beard fit under that mask?
---
Roll a rogue, get some more rogues and pvp them right in the butt.
---
Heck yeah! On a Long Weekend Vacation - stoked to get a chance to play when I get back.
---
Still on the fence for bloody faction lol.

Going NA PvE server, just wondering if I'll be bored as fuck with Paladins sniping with flash of light, and if Horde pop will suffer/be way lower.

its supposed to tick consistantly for 20. it doesn't. i don't wanna self promote in your thread but i made a post about it  40 mins ago. but i'm afraid its gonna get drowned in memes and never get any attention

Thank you

What do you mean fixed? It is fixed, it's exactly how it was 13 years ago.

---
Same here on both counts, looking forward to meeting y'all!
---
Why would they want to roll on servers where people who want to avoid them are? They each have a large following. All together, they have a HUGE following of players that will want to play with them and follow them the entire time they play. They have no need for people like us, they have plenty of people to play with. Trying to roll on the same server is people who are trying to avoid streamers will just end up shifting a huge portion into another server and that will help no one.
---
RemindMe! 1 Year

/world will exist in Classic.
---
You just can't do 250k/12. You're assuming an even somewhat close to even distribution among servers which makes no sense at all. Looking at realmpop.com we can see that the total 1-120 population on EU is only 13% RU-speaking yet they have 16.67% of server allocation which is the same as the German population which makes up nearly double, 24%, of the overall EU population. When the EU server population is split not only into the different server types which are popular in differing ways but also split into language-specific clusters on top of that it seems to me that you can no longer assume a somewhat even distribution.
---
From [realmpops.com](https://realmpops.com) again we can see that players on RP servers make up just 8.5% of players and yet they again have allocated 16.67% of server space. Both the RU and RP cases are ones where the server allocation is "too high" compared to demand, which is essentially just wasted.
---
We also know from this thread that there's a subset of both the German and French populations that will play EN servers despite being FR/DE which is further going to mess up the distribution of players, this in favor of even higher pops on EN. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I also want to bring up the fact that with your estimate of 250k players, layering is entirely unnecessary. They can, as you've shown, probably fit the 250k people into the 12 servers so why do layering when it gave so much backlash? The simple answer is that even Blizzard considers your estimate of 250k to most likely be way too small. There's around 500 million people in the EU so a 250k participation rate means 0.5% of EU nationals will be playing Classic. This I believe to be a gross underestimation, if I'm correct in assuming you're talking about the launch numbers. If this was a realistic guesstimation, why would they go through all the controversy with layering?
---
If you're not assuming it's launch population then there's still the matter of the rate of decline. Ion specifically said they wanted layering gone asap, with phase 2 launch being the backstop absolute deadline. This means that we've got a somewhat predictable window of between 1-2 months before phase 2 is launched where the population **must** have declined to a level where it can be fit on the 12 servers without any of them bursting at the seams. If we have a million players at launch and we assume the target is your 250k, then we have only 1-2 months for the playerbase to be reduced to a quarter of the launch. I know people are expecting tourists, but damn. Even WoD had better player rentention the first month than that.
---
lmao I love it.

---
Yeah /join world
---
[I did](https://i.imgur.com/4C8pGur.jpg) on the low pop realm of Hakkar during a Sunday evening (not really prime time) and it still crashed the server.

Brock Sampson, Venture Bros. reference right there.
---
Whitemane gang
---
Wow as at its prime with very little streaming going on. Now that streaming is there the numbers are down. This isn’t pubg or fortnite.
---
just saw this! thanks
---
Good news for you then, it's been extended until Monday.
---
Both are amazing, thanks for sharing!
---
Exactly... Don't go out of your way, but that doesn't mean it's bad as a nice little supplement to an already good farming method. That is what I am saying.
---
the true vanilla experience, queues and opening servers if needed
---
cant get shot in a mall if your grindgin rank 14 all day
---
1)  Is that the case for warriors too? I'm pretty sure warrior skill binds get  updated to the highest rank automatically.
---
If I'm not mistaken, all Eastern servers will be in the Chicago datacenter, and all Pacific servers will be in the LA datacenter. Can someone confirm?
---
If this is true, anyone on the east coast who wants to play RPPVP has to deal with high ping, since there is only one. Somewhat of an oversight by Blizzard.
---
After reading this I'm embarrassed for you by association.
---
You are shit at anything else, so pretty much.
---
It’s fun, but keep in mind the druid motto in vanilla was “jack of all trades, master of none”.
---
While you can tank, heal and do range and melee dps, you will never excel at any of it and will have to put in extra effort to not hit “useless” levels.
---
Well you put shaman enhance and elemental as neutral for dungeons, as well as disc and shadow priest. But all 4 of those specs will have a much easier time getting groups and making friends than a prot pally, both while levelling and for lvl 60 dungeons.  
---
  
---
Similarly you put resto shaman and disc priest as neutral for levelling, put you put ret pally as bad? In what world is levelling a resot shaman easier or faster than a ret pally?
---
Then just play in windowed mode like everyone else.
---
“To give us”
---
They aren’t giving us a dang thing. What is wrong with you?
---
It'll be the kids....guaranteed
---
OSRS has gradually worked its way to current numbers, though.
---
The launch had a 70k peak, which dropped down to 20k and almost killed the game - which is when they decided to add regular content rereleases (like phases in Classic).
---
I suspect that Phase 1 will be a similar situation to pre-GWD OSRS.

---
They confirmed it's exactly as it was suppose to be.
---
While I was never a fan of the BfA UI myself it's nice that people are taking the time to develop addons so that other people can play the game the way they're used to.
---
Where are you getting this 100k stress test number from?
---
Be specific when you reply, if you even bother.
---
Also, can you explain how you think a survey translates into concurrent players on any given server?
---
No I have no idea how many players a server can hold. The limit was around 4k online back in the day, and that was a hardware limit. So I'm guessing they can handle a lot larger populations now.
---
Source?
---
Brutal.  12 healers, and they all pretty much want the same rings, neck, trinket, etc...
---
why is so hard to understand?
---
if both you and the target is in movement you gain extra range for melee skills
---
He's packing some heat too

Yes that's where my confusion comes in. What exactly is left to be fixed?

You'll be greeted by the BRs.
---
Have you seen any of their videos/streams? They have at least 100 people following them at all times like horny teenage boys follow a hot, sweet-talking girl, ready to do their bidding at a moment's notice. Even if you'll be able to catch them by surprise without a hoard of their viewers right beside them, even if you are able to kill them even once, get ready to be slaughtered over and over and over again by their die-hard fans. 
---
No thanks. I'm avoiding their servers. I don't need that drama - The good old-fashioned Vanilla guild drama that awaits all of us is enough for me. I don't need streamers "spicing that up".
---
If they end up on the same server, the amount of fans that will follow them around will be smaller because they will be competing with other fans to get on before space is filled. Smart! That server will get full, but there will be smaller hordes of followers per streamer, and less of an inconvenience to other players than it would be if all of that streamers posse had been able to get in the server. Unless of course streamers group up, then it’ll be nuts.

If you're a gay dude, you already know what a huge turn on it is to get wrestled down and completely manhandled by a big heavy daddy.
---
are u SERIOUSLY asking if its possible that you can bring your millions of gold into a fresh economy where even 10g is a considerable amount of money?
---
It seems like it's never giving less than 20 though, only 21 sometimes? So other than it being unpleasing to the eye, it doesn't seem like it's gonna affect much, right?
---
If I were a fangirl, wouldn't I want to roll on an APES server? Do you think that the people who talk about avoiding the Asmongold server are Asmongold fangirls? 
---
I'm not talking about some magical admirable SWAT team, just a bunch of well organized NEETs who have too much time on their hands. If I told you that there are 100 organized autists who spend all their waking hours ganking flight paths and that I don't want to play on the same server as them, would you call me a fangirl?
---
&gt; but paladin was almost as bad as warrior for leveling from every source I found
---
nah, they might be slow, but they have great sustain and can survive bad pulls. Warriors cant do either of those things
---
I have not seen anything on Facebook or what not but I’m willing to take that as a just me thing so I may wrong there. Hoping for the best regardless.
---
Fake news! OP is just a bear hater.
---
For those who dont know
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/ProductiveGorgeousOrcaDoggo
---
I think you’re being unfairly cruel. It seems to me like he’s asking if retail players will be allowed to offer their gold to other players for their classic gold and vice versa. There’s no easy way to prevent this but it would still be nice to know if it is against TOS.
---
Open Battle.Net and uninstall it through there.
---
There is also some precedent of them intentionally crashing servers. 
---
I see them sort of like those multi boxers with 40 accounts or whatever. It’s just too much game influence for one person to have.  And since they have a financial incentive to do do weird/meme stuff their behavior will be unpredictable.  I plan to stay away from them completely. 
---
Of course the next big streamer might come up organically on any server....  so who knows.
---
They know what they’re doing. Three will still prob be dead within 4 mo of launch.
---
I only play healers, so I'm not sure. It would be a little strange if it worked that way for only certain classes. The test realms are still up, so maybe someone else can confirm.
---
I’ve been struggling to pick my class and these are helping me narrow it down. Thank you 👍🏻
---
I didnt get mine in the mail... what server was this EU or US?
---
Horde for life, and PvE for the wife!  See y'all there
---
Yeah I did not know this and this does say allot imo. Allot of us did not know this. I wonder that it even worked tbh. I understand that you want people to be able to play the game and not have like a WoD release where it takes you 5 hours to set up your Garrisson. However people did really like the lvling experiance in WoD and once people flow trough from beginning, this is quickly forgotten.
---
If this was part of Vanilla I hope they can figure out how it effectively functioned and make something that resembles it as close as possible. Im fairly sure that the current system feels vastly different and spawning feels nothing like Vanilla wow. 
---
 I also strongly disagree with tinkering the game tbh. I understand the goals.. But I have faith in Vanilla and I dont think it needs this streamlining. It needs Blizzard to stop trying to fix or improve the game.. Launch a version that tries to simply be the best possible immitation of their original game and learn from themselfs and their own product. Personally I feel they have a very linear philosophy and have a hard time accepting and understanding that They did decline from their golden decennia when they made Wc3 and WoW. 
---
 I highly enjoyed this stress test even tough there was no Achievment or any "long term validation". This was the most fun I had in WoW.. wel since Vanilla. 
---
I personally have no problems with a "terrible" launch experiance. If I had.. I would wait a couple of days or week and avoid the cluster.
---
You don't see this? https://imgur.com/hT5gNdD
---
I don't know about general consensus. That's just how the class plays. 
---
When they refer to trash clearing, they are talking about raids specifically. That is because other tanks have a cap on how many mobs they can hit, but Paladins don't. Even still, you won't be taking a prot paladin to raids often and  they won't get a spot other than for trash. 
---
They lack a taunt and they only have one AoE spell to utilize, so they will be very bad in 5mans.
---
You make it seem as if it's not that much of a big deal to open more servers post launch. Private server history has shown many times that secondary servers are doomed from the start. Not to mention the amount of planning for players needed to inform their circle or even entire guilds to relocate somewhere else? Blizzard needs to get this right from the start.
---
If I had to chose, I would go with Vanilla. 
---
I wonder if I would say the same thing had I not played Vanilla WoW prior to classic. 
---
Also, I would need to see it in action first too.
---
You posted this seven hours ago. And also last night but deleted it.
---
Healers and tanks are always in demand. Always.
---
Befriend a tank, then just “LF3M dps &lt;instance name&gt;”
---
Instant party.
---
lmao
---
&gt; What exactly is left to be fixed?
---
People who still think Classic should be the same as their private servers.
---
Gate keeping fuck
---
umm why lol
---
Arugal it is then.
---
It’s the default ui but with the microbar (character sheet, system, talents etc) and bags moved and that spot is filled by another action bar instead. So bottom right can have two action bars rather than 2 left and 1 right.
---
These are all soo good keep up the good work guys 👍
---
I think Sodapoppin is interested in rppvp
---
Every interaction I've ever had with the guy left me feeling that he was a giant moron.
---
Is it bug-feee? I was considering it myself!
---
Please not Mankrik. I want to play a normal server and level without being corpse camped or griefed
---
I assume TomTom is working for you? It's fine if I set points manually but clicking on a quest doesn't do anything, I assume it needs a library to know where all the quest mobs/hand-ins etc are?
---
You will be gods among men when together.

according to avoidstreamers.com soda chose Faerlina immediately
---
My hate isn't blind.  It's completely based around the things that I've seen... Which is the opposite of what you're implying.  I'm not following the crowd to hate on streamers.  I watched his stream and his youtube videos.  At first I didn't mind him and I even enjoyed his reactions on some videos.  Then my opinion evolved into a hatred for him for his shitty antics and his self over all personality.  While also observing that he isn't good at the game, especially classic.
---
He is an elitist that's the whole point of a fuckin mount off.  He sits there brigading people against store bought mounts (don't get me wrong I think selling mounts is a bad thing too, but punishing the individuals who liked the mount and got it the only way it can be got is a completely shit thing to do).  His antics and his playstyle are pretty crap and I look forward to punishing him in classic as often as I can.  I have experience with the 3v40s so let's go Asmon let's see how shit you really are at this game.
---
People saying druid cant tank need to check out skarms coverage of druid taking
---
He could be baiting people to pick the other realm. You don't know.
---
What do you Mean by bfa normies?
---
Buying the next rank of a spell doesn't replace it in your bars. Be sure to replace when you upgrade.
---
I didn't either, I'm from EU.
---
Yea I noticed that too. Was kinda annoyed. This macro will have to do, thanks.
---
Again, I understand your example, but it seems that when you're at 24 energy, just assume that it's gonna be a 20 tick and don't plan on RNG to get that gouge.
---
Classic is really small compared to retail. I bet it can hol 50k to 100k on todays hardware.
---
Priest will be the better healer. Shaman will let you blow shit up instead.
---
Love these
---
Oh I see. Nothing wrong with wanting changes to the game I suppose but it's not what we wanted and asked for :-)
---
What a tool. Guilds trash with a bunch of tryhard elitists.
---
Ya I played 12 hours as warlock all the way to 15 on the stress test and my demons talked the whole time. Void walkers saying things like “I don’t like this place” or “send me back”, and my imp saying “better make this quick” and other quips when I pull. Might be a setting, maybe dialogue or minion text or some like obscure setting you didn’t even know existed haha.
---
You could easily do restro though don't be surprised if you need to take up tanking position if the tank dies ( assuming a dps class can cover for heals)
---
Faerlina it is :)
---
Tips Out on yt said that dungeons are a surprisingly good way to level and that private servers got a lot of stuff wrong with regards to them.

Just be aware Thalnos is being chosen by the South American community as their hub.

woooo i'm only 200 miles from my data center. Hopefully i'll have low latency

Chill out. There will be more servers, eventually.

Let the project grow at a steady pace.

Good news everyone.

Servers will remain up until Monday.
---
The black dude named doomfist lmao
---
Still big guns tho..
---
this is my exact point, I play and raid with german and french speaking players on global private realms, those guilds wont break up because omg I german realm, no they will stay with the same guild and all play on an English language realm
---
Check HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall
---
Not really. Esfand was just explaining on stream that it's completely understandable why someone would not want to play on a streamer server. The desire to play on a non-streamer server is obvious. The topic has been a mainstay of this subreddit for months. You're overstating it.
---
Oh so now you finally understand why your comment, "lol just play at a different time" is stupid?
---
this is great! I saw ur post on guild recruitment and saw urs guild promo video on yt, it looks really great! Im still not sure if I want to roll ally or horde but will most definitely play on  Zandalar Tribe.
---
Fortunately most of the spergs won't make it past level 30 so I don't think it'll be a huge issue end game
---
Bring different things to the table of course, being able to dispel poisons is no joke vs hunters trying to mana draink you/your mage friend. And as you said, your own burst dmg to add on would probably count for a significant amount of situations.
---
A troll priest however, can Hex your enemy. If no warrior is near to help, you still get -20% healing on target, which only mage/druid can remove. Would certainly fuck up a paladins day with that, mana burn and dispels for freedom vs a frost mage slows.
---
Not sure how that didn't register to me until you pointed it out. But yeah thats amazing, lol.
---
Yeah...my guild along with a few other guilds decided on Thalnos after we learned the Streamers weren’t going there. Now unsure if we’re still planning on going to Thalnos or not...I’ll probably need to find a new guild if they decide to roll on Thalnos. Feelsbadman.
---
1000 will cause much more server lag not to mention with a 40 man another 40 man could easily counter them.
---
the client has nothing to do with the server
---
&gt;but it will come as small consolation when all the imps and felhounds respawn behind me
---
Haha I remember this happening in Vanilla and was like wtf all of them at once?
---
The regen rate is the same in and out of combat? Part about mana confusing.
---
The gold is being farmed and "spent" 1 time before it goes back into the hands of the "honest" player, it isn't real world money increasing the amount of gold in classic artificially. So someone is always farming it, the only real negative, and I think it's a big one, is that the people who trade outside the game are basically accelerating themselves ahead of other people, and it can be used to clear higher level content.
---
Nobody ever cared if I gave my brother 100g because he bought me a pepsi last week, that kind of crap probably happened all the time, but real world trading will effect the "world firsts" it will affect the race towards milestones, and that feels cheap and like cheating. Ironically, people giving gold to streamers isn't cheating and it falls perfectly within the "friends can give each other gold" category, but they still get that same step-up over other players.
---
Is like to add that #8 is a little inaccurate. I always recalled that enemies could not dodge from the back, however, my rogue was subjected to a FRUSTRATING amount of dodged backstabs (on top of landing maybe 40% total of my attacks...). Makes for sloppy improvision during fights.
---
Lol where do you think these players came from? Many of them were on Tich in tbc.
---
Hello Grobbulus my new home. the only RP-PVP server and it's in my timezone.
---
Also as an Alliance player it's kind of good knowing my server will be one of the few with an Alliance advantage because more RP players are Alliance.
---
SUBVERTING EXPECTATIONS
---
well the dynamic respawn, which was called 'overspawn' back then isnt as easily exploitable as retail dynamic respawn because its dependant on the entires zone population. This also means that it will be slower in higher zones, i imagine westfall/barrens (where you leveled to 15 just now) was pretty packed, even lowlevels should count toward the population tresholds)
---
Thalnos is br
---
Don't freak too hard out at the lack of servers.  They'll scale things up if need be, just like they did in the past.  They won't have an idea about how big classic might be until next week...after they see the surge in inactive accounts resubing over this weekend and the character creation that opens Monday.
---
Chill a bit.  Remember way back when servers were lagging, glitching due to load and we had login queues?  That was part of vanilla's charm.  It wouldn't be a faithful relaunch of vanilla without those headaches.
---
There's gonna be plenty of time to make fun of lolrets and other junk specs.  Patience my friends.
---
I picked it as soon as I saw the list. Love the character and the HS card. So glad streamers won't be rolling there. A few smaller streamers are totally fine, I think streaming is great, but the crowds the big ones pull together can really put a hamper on your experience, if you care about your personal experience.
---
Non-mana classes' abilities automatically get replaced with the highest rank, you can't even find lower ranks in the spellbook since they all require the same (or reduced) amount of resources.
---
The server population sure ballooned...
---
What is the streamer server, as of right now?
---
I think they're awesome other than grobbulus
---
I support my korean pvp brothers and sisters.
---
Give them a proper realm!
---
Shamans are usually on higher demand.   
---
And overall more fun to play.   
---
I never wiped a group for not having dispeled something.  
---
I only roll priest because i play mainly alliance. Otherwise i would go shaman.   
---
Pick something you want to play, not for them. HF
---
It is noun.
---
Because everyone doesn’t understand what he’s asking, here’s what we are talking about -
---
Say I have a bunch of gold in classic, but I need to get sub time.  I reach out on the exchange discord, and offer up x amount of classic gold for tokens worth of gold in retail.  
---
At this point in time, there is nothing from blizz saying this isn’t ok
---
Half the English speaking eu community on this sub reddit. So, far from anything representative. Most french people have never even heard of reddit, for example.
---
It's a buff to rogues that they shouldn't have because it isn't blizzlike, and for other obvious reasons they have grown accustomed to the 20 per tick helping them track their energy.

Amazing! Thank you for sharing :)

Thalnos

Ty! Seems really useful.

I’d honestly still trust blizzard over any private server, they have 15 years of experience with this game alone. It’s fine with me if you want to be paranoid, but I’m fairly certain that the servers they added will be more than enough. Like I said, we don’t even have any numbers when it comes to capacity, layering, background information, man hours put into it. I’m pretty sure they know what they’re doing, and if not you can always post in 6 months that they were wrong.

Does KDE plasma use a lot of memory? At least compared to xfce?
---
It's a generator though. Would be nice if they used Murloc names from in game.
---
From what I’ve gathered, the damage was only off while leveling and is either identical or very close at 60.  While it was off by a ton at lower levels, it was very close when checked at level 58 during the AV test.  
---
Unless there’s another source of this that I’m not aware of.
---
Keep in mind, no transmog, achievements, or collections tab. This means pets and mounts occupy inventory space.
---
well thats not very friendly

Thanks man. I leveled ally during my time playing vanilla-cata so I’m looking for a new experience best of luck to you too
---
This is so fucking cool great job man!

Wait until stv or hillsbrad

have you tried updating graphics drivers to the latest? i remember there was a wow fix in a recent nvidia driver update.

I loved both the priest and this one. Can you provide links to the others (if you've done them), or maybe put each one on your profile or megathread so we can find them once you've done them please?

Nice to see the wallpaper I made in the wild :)

Stream sniping had better not be a punishable offense. If streamers are choosing to stream their gameplay that's their choice, they reap the benefits and suffer the consequences of their action.

Can anyone with a sub enter, or only people with a Beta key?

what does ffxdeath do?

Language barrier aside, I could swear I read a post from a Brazilian player once explaining that there was a strong culture there of looking down on tryhards who want to pay attention and do things right. I might be imagining it, I'd like to hear more inside perspectives if there's anything to this.
---
It's pretty clear it doesn't change shit, because fr and de server well be overcrowded as well. And on retail at the moment, there are more German and French servers when combined than English servers.
---
Apologies. Above the "PLAY" button there is a box titled "Version" where you can select "World of Warcraft Classic."
---
Yes, the classic client is already available for download through the standard Blozz launcher.
---
Are you trying to showcase how good the new lighting looks or how we can't recapture the old look? It isn't clear by your post.
---
Having your settings at max for the Classic client makes me think that you're showing it off, not complaining but again, I can't tell.
---
This is only my opinion. I want my classic experience to be as normal as possible. I understand that things have changed over the years with social media and twitch. But with streamers comes a very toxic community of people who spam chat for their 1 minute of "fame" to be noticed by their favorite streamer. I'd rather not have my general chat turn into "omegalul" "f in the chat" and "OMG asmongold"
---
Someone explain why does it matter if its a streamer server?  No idea just asking
---
Would love to get you in our group as a mage that way I don't have to play it and can paly warlock or hunter like I wanted to but unfotunatly we are east coast so 11pm is a bit late for us to play together :(
---
I’m not sure. Stress test is live now. Unsure how big the download is
---
Was just curious
---
Ok I haven't check in a few days. Also.. damn you're fast lol
---
The speed of turning/camera rotation
---
That's a Ziqo confirmation if you know anything about him.
---
There aren't any. You don't even notice they are there. I'll never understand the hate boner people have for streamers here
---
TBC heroic on steroid attunements though, as we've seen in Cata MMO makers of back then vastly underestimated how people enjoyed a very low difficulty curve. Classic being braindead easy is the best part about it.
---
“I went from a tiny twink to the musclebound freak before you”
---
Yes. Open your blizz launcher. Click on WOW. Right above the PLAY/INSTALL button there is a drop down menu. Select World of Warcraft Classic, and install.
---
damn dude you are too tough for me
---
Does someone have a link to an article or videos explaining why they’re not doing any develop to improve the near unusable class specs?
---
There are many other reasons as well but there is a rather large community that feels the same way. Aka someone made a website specifically to avoid streamer servers.
---
Anyone else read this as North Korea got its own pvp realm?
---
Boot it up, install a linux distro, run wine and play wow classic on it. Good luck
---
I am happy about everything except the dual talent spec.
---
But i can live without those.
---
So with the Grobbulus RP-PVP server...I know that with regular RP servers character names can be reported and Blizz can enforce a name change. Will they be enforced on the RP-PVP server? Like if you have the name Pepsi...that isn't RP. Can it be enforced to change it on the RP-PVP realm or just the RP realm?
---
Thanks. Haven't opened the client anytime recently, and just assumed. I see it now, and appreciate the help. I'm a newer player, so I'm hoping Itll be fun. :)
---
Same. Feels bad man.
---
Just level to 11 and got to xroads. By the time you get to valley of trials your friends will be level 3 or 4 and you'll be level 2

After we are all said and done i'll probably make one final thread directly linking to the main imgur album as well, really hype everyone up for classic :D
---
Selljunk 3.0.2 worked for me for auto selling greys and "junk" loot whenever you talk to a merchant. Or if you don't want auto, you can have it set to need to press the Selljunk button which it adds to the top of merchant windows.

RP PVP realm down for the weekend or what?

Thlex.

I didn't know MoveAnything had a Classic version, i'll have to go get that, but I *assume* it should work with it
---
Boy am I glad I live in EU where there aren't any massive streamers beside Forsen.
---
Nope, have him restart battle.net and that will probably solve his issue. It is a battle.net update that gives you the wow drop down

Didn't group with anyone so can't say that party frames work.

No worries. If you have an active wow sub, you can play till level 15 until Monday. Good luck!
---
You dont know that.
---
It's because Soda's fanbase is cancer and Asmon will ignore their safespace.
---
It would impact normal people too.. For example, you would have people who are willing to drop 50 bucks on their epic mount vs those who aren't. Or people going into PvP with BoE epics vs those who don't.
---
Even in the market place, whales would have more money to spend on expensive BoEs, which would drive those prices up.
---
You were right the first time, they were just big Ali G fans
---
Thalnos sounds like thanos so i thought they would choose that
---
If they keep 2 realms on release then yes they'll simply have to wait a few weeks for the entire hype to die down, as the majority of people will not stick around having 20k+, or 2h+ long queues, random friends will quit, guilds will rip, and then it's over and blizzard can go ' I told you so '  after all.
---

---
I’m picking thalnos because a golden Blood Mage Thalnos has been in hearthstone collection since it was released.
---
Thank you so much, been wondering what they would be. Will we have to download the new content (all ready subscription) or will they be in the old realm list?
---
Yepp. You can change the timer (think its between 1-10min), quality of the video, sound and it can also record your mic if you want.
---
Unpopular Opinion: I think the amount of Realms on Classic Launch was a smart decision. With Layering in place, the servers are scalable to account for large populations, without affecting queue times. So essentially, you have a dozen mini-servers linked into one, with the same overall community, economy, etc. 
---
Now, come Phase 2, when Layering is done with, what happens? Well this is where the "smart" comes in.  
---
This gives Blizzard time to analyze the numbers and see if they need more servers. They can then open up free transfers to new servers from the High-pop servers. This will allow for people who may feel "stuck" to get out of the Realm without feeling like they lost time/money.
---
There is a lot less overhead &amp; risk involved when transferring players from one server to another than there is doing a   
---
low-pop server-merge.
---
I see no discord so far, making one now
---
Per the Wiki it says KDE uses about 60Mb more than XFCE.  I just checked for you.  See link below.  Manjaro also has a prepackaged KDE Plasma flavor as well.   It's fantastic so far with Latte Dock.  I am currently downloading wow again (because I forgot to back it up before format) and going to test with and without gamemode.  
---
Have a feeling my weekend is already spent playing with the OS though.
---
https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php/Install_Desktop_Environments
---
Aka Faerlina. They already said no to Thalnos and Herod is huge already with both of the latter showing SA/Latin speakers. 
---
Faerlina sounds like the one?
---
Can't wait to dine on your fresh corpse.
---
So if you're mountain West it probably doesn't matter?
---
Essentially name changing is the big difference. You lose your server identity and possibly guild/character names with server merges.
---
Didn't test parties so not sure. Also didn't test debuffs since I wasn't keen on leveling in the stress test.
---
Well, since there are so few servers idk how much it will impact it anymore, also the fact that all the big streamers will be on the server can be a good thing. A major reason is server population. If a streamer logs on, a lot of their viewers will log on, so there might be a queue. If a streamer quits the server, a lot of people might leave the server. If the streamer plays on one faction vs another there might be a large faction imbalance.
---
Like I said though, since there are so few servers and the population will be huge anyways the fact that streamers and their viewers are there might not be too impactful. And the fact that they're all rolling on the same server will help with the server imbalance since there are large streamers on both factions.
---
Sounds like a fair number. Classic will be Classic. If there's enough people on your server to do the content you enjoy with in a timely manner, I don't see why the total population of the game matters too much. If it turns out a smash-hit like it was 15 years ago they can always spin up new servers. If it's not, at least we probably won't be playing on ghost towns.
---
Can someone explain me what the 10char means? I see this so often in the forums is that kind of meme or what is that?
---
Merging servers (crossrealms) can have characters with the same name but different server, Xxlegolasxx-serverA and Xxlegolasxx-serverB. With layers this is not the case since they are on the same server.

Players don't get separated if a server/layer splits.

You can test your latency for your own connection right now. Just ping these IPs:
---
137.221.105.2 (PST realms)
---
24.105.62.129 (EST realms)
---
If you don't know how to run a ping, I'm happy to explain. It's probably best for you to run the tests over the course of the time of day you intend to play the most often, but a test at any time will still give you a good idea.
---
Complaining that I'm being harassed and having my choices limited by Blizzard influencers when **I am PAYING FOR A PRODUCT** is not crying. Funny how you want to support the streamers demands and whims and as they like to say "gatekeeping" 3 out of 5 servers.
---
We simply don't want to play with people like you. Blizzard can make one super server like they did for Swifty and you can all go there and pretend you are e-friends with streamers because you send them money. Maybe if you send them enough money you can be a "social" in their guild and spend time farming them gold/mats so that they can have better gear.
---
This, I believe, the foremost argument against the PvP imbalance.  
---
My first big guild had a couple Alliance accounts we shared to help fill Alliance BGs, typically WSG, so we could help keep some raiders we’ll-equipped.
---
Gathering professions. Solo Princess. Solo BRD coffer runs. DME lashers. DMN bugs and dogs. 2 man DME boss farm. Tank Live astray runs and reserve PBD’s and Righteous Orbs.
---
People don't understand that the entire reason for being able to make characters 2 weeks early is so that we can manage our friends and guilds into same realm. Can't do that shit with sudden new realms.
---
Can we get the up to date addon via Twitch/Curse App so we can benefit from an easy update method ? :)
---
Agreed. TWO!? What the fuck, they are in for a fuckin HUGE surprise at launch. I thought we'd get at least 10, hoped for 20-30. Shit
---
Is this a new copypasta?
---
Its a huge problem my man. I plan on playing a warrior and Melee Leeway would give me a huge advantage but it doesn't feel right. Also based on this video I'm pretty sure people care about this haha  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3GH5cWPFOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3GH5cWPFOE)
---
What is this streamer entitlement? If I were them, With as many people that shit on them, I’d keep it secret before I get my name as well. Why does you wanting to pick a server before you can even name characters come before someone getting to have a shot at their name? If you think this sub trolls Thex, imagine if all the streamers announced their server before they got their name.

Not really all that much. All the EST realms are hosted in Chicago, so whatever your ping is there, just add about 50 to 60ms to it and now you're in LA.

Will it be against TOS? Idk?

Anyone with a sub. :)

Do you mean to 60? 4-5 days played to 40 definitely sounds slow lol

Having not played classic back in the days I don't really know what you mean by that, however it feels good so know that there seems to be quite a few ways to get some sweet golds!

Thanks for your answer

If no streamers I’m in both ways
---
I don’t support any WoW streamers not nor do I plan on the streamer servers. They are announcing their ONE server choice on Monday. Stop pissing your pants for 48 hours and it’ll be fine, you child. “ITS MY MONEY AND BIG DADDY BLIZZ WONT CATER TO ME BUT IM EQUALLY IMPORTANT.” Life isn’t fair,  get over it.
---
Typical response I expected from a streamer sycophant, showing a lack of education and class and someone who can't even interact with people on any social level. You wonder why we want the streamers to identify one server? People like this are a great example.
---
Are you sure?  Do you have an active WoW subscription?
---
I'm considering making a druid with the plan to go resto. If i wanted to stay somewhat resto leveling up so i can heal dungeons, is putting some points in the balance tree advisable? Or should I just commit to the resto tree as I level?

Go back to r/politics
---
That's the 4chan server
---
A regrowth druid can put arguably the highest HPS while raid Healing during constant air damage fights. That being said druids are also strong tank healers. Good players need to know how to play to their strengths based on the content at hand, and good raid leaders need to know how to make assignments accordingly.
---
how is that known? is there a 4chan thread?
---
since when is thalnos a south american server?
---
BGs and raids don't really have lag spikes because they're instanced. Most EU cities ping to Chicago with an average time under 100ms.
---
Yes the are already mememing it cause of it's name
---
Cause that's how mature they are
---
Thanks!

---
It's largely speculated most of them will hold, but at the very least we'll know what will FOR SURE be working.
---
They should carry since this is the build we will be using.

I'd rather play with the streamers honestly. Language barriers in MMO's are awful

wait we cant use the name pepsi?

Don't worry, I fuck around there too
---
"Harassed" Holy sweet fuck you are delusional.

Right? Theres only two streamers with the influence over cringe players to mess up a server and neither are in California.

---
They are Blizzard influences and Blizzard hires people from their organizations. No one will care if they get their names reserved. They are basically Blizzard employees anyways (they are just cheap labor). It's preferable to them holding 3 out of 5 servers hostage.
---
Resto druids are still great dungeon healers. The “no Rez” meme is for bad players who can’t stay alive.
---
I am not sure, I'm only repeating what I saw on another post here. Havent gotten to try it myself.

Did anyone other than the BR discord say they were rolling there?

I am also thoroughly confused.

gaming being filled with normies is the reason why it has been going downhill for years and everybody is hyped for a game released in 2004.

Idk i seriously doubt theyd be a majority at all with how few servers there are.
---
Yes, of course, why wouldn't they? I wouldn't even consider the Linken questline a real Easter Egg. Cluck! is an Easter Egg while that chain is just a pop culture nod.
---
Ohhhh interesting thanks! I haven’t played since WotLK so I have no idea about anything anymore. Just waiting for the 27th

3/5
---
Oh sweet didn’t know that! Thanks
---
I'm gonna put my tinfoil hat on and say that the streamers that got invited to play in the closed beta (like tips did) already have set up their characters already on set servers, he said in his last video that he believes Blizzard will name their server names from Classic, he gave an example as Mankrik.
---
This is very specific, why did he think of just that?
---
Might be pure luck, but this guy feels like he likes to *leak* things just for clicks, just with the streamer server.
---
Link to the video with timestamp

---
Myself and about 8 others are also going Horde on this realm so we're getting there
---
Who?
---
It does seem like the general consensus is that paladin tanking is rated too highly for dungeons! I'm happy to change that later, I was about 50/50 on it since i heard so much about them being great for trash, but clearly I should have rated it lower!
---
This one was especially hard for me to make as I played horde back in the day, so I never personally got to experience trying to do a dungeon with a paladin :P

They will more likely speak Portuguese.
---
Why in the world would South and Central America choose a realm hosted in Chicago over a realm hosted in Los Angeles?
---
Honestly, people are making a much bigger deal of this than it really is. Yeah, there’s gonna be streamers and yeah they might have some annoying followers. But look at HOW MANY people are going to playing. The odds of you being in any way effected by a streamer is pretty low. 
---
Just play the game. It’ll be fun. Don’t worry about it.
---
A fairly decent sized streamer
---
The problem is that there is already a very strong anti-streamer sentiment in the community. Holding out is just sticking a finger in the eye of everyone wishing to avoid them. It's good that they at least name a couple servers they aren't going to. That's a god half measure, but it still won't be received all that well because it's basically the streamers telling them which servers to roll on and that just rubs people the wrong way as well. I get that it kind of sucks, but streamers need to really just bite the bullet and announce. Yes, name reservations will suck, but they don't have to use their retail names. Do sports stars refuse to play if they are traded away from their favorite team? Be a professional and recognize the tremendous privilege that you have to play video games for a living and suck it up for the good of the community. Otherwise they simply risk further entrenching streamer hatred to levels that could really start to impact their ability to do what they do. 
---
What really should happen is Blizz should be managing this. Give them guaranteed name reservations and make them all roll on one (or to) servers. Blizz should be proactive because what is going on right now is a vortex of anger that could do some real damage to the community. This is pretty shit community management on Blizz's part.
---
okay, thank you!
---
Other than a flood of people raiding a town, is it really that big of a deal?  It might actually be pretty rad to see one of them lead a massive army on a capital city.  Then again I hear you on the “asmon layer” bullshit.

I think it’ll be ok.

Yeah, that's my answer. The holy sanctity of classics vanillaness is already fouled so find another argument.
---
Alright, this is now my new favorite comment on this sub. It's just amazing and you're amazing.

I see the experiences in your life haven't been very good ones if all you can do is come and shit on other people. Usual rule of thumb, if everyone around you is an asshole...maybe you're the asshole.

From Stormwind to Darnassus and then to Orgrimmar, my journey led me to Thralls chamber where I punched him before being murdered to death.
---
Does time zone really matter? I’ve never paid attention to that but since I’ll be playing past midnight pst a lot I’m wondering if I should avoid east coast servers.
---
I'm legit gonna laugh when the streamers decide on Fairbanks lol. It's my buddy and I choice as well so far, but things can change. Just reserve your name on every server to be safe lol. (if you can, idk really)
---
like half my guild is germans.  this is half the fault of whiners (the people who originally killed wow), and half the fault of blizzard listening to them
---
TL;DR
---
the spawning in classic is based on the amount of living NPCs, herbs or mining nodes in a preset area
---
dynamic spawning is based on the amount of players in a preset area
---
While it may look like they are interchangeable they affect the game in a completely different way. 
---
100 people camping a named npc have no effect on the respawn times in classic - while a dynamic system like in retail or crime servers would force that named NPC to crop up in mere seconds
---
I bet you have plenty of memories associated with this game that you still cherish
---
This comment doesn't make any sense... If there are no CST servers then all the CST have to play on EST (assuming they play on EST over PST for the smaller time difference). 
---
There's gonna be people to play with, just chill out and stop making issues out of nothing.
---
you are correct. i noticed today while leveling that the spells on your bars go to the next rank on their own. and the lower level rank no longer appears in the spell book. if you learn rend rank 2 the bind updates automatically and rend rank 1 is not in the spell book at all
---
If you got paid ok to play a game you know damn well you'd play that game.
---
I'll be there. In redridge. Come say hi!
---
Didn't realise that all of the non-English Europeans (bar French and German) will also be on them. I definitely think they need to add a third. Would it not make sense to change a non-PvP one to PvP due to the likelihood of those servers being less popular than than PvP ones?
---
Well played.
---
I don't see why they would do that. They don't punish that in retail. The issue I see is the streamer deciding they were stream sniped and calling their legions to right click report to silence someone or report their name to force them to change it. (Both automated systems in retail, possibly in classic.)
---
The only irritation I have right now is Asmongold, arguably the biggest potential impact streamer stated he's not announcing it until launch.
---
Inscription was introduced in WOTLK.
---
TIL YOU DIE!
---
watched your stream the most during the beta, thanks for the heads up!
---
more like nekself LMAO
---
Agreed, abysmal

I settled on whitemane too for [no](https://puu.sh/E3m3T/0372a3d82d.png). [particular](https://puu.sh/E3lYh/39acb13ecb.jpg). [reason](https://puu.sh/E3m32/7782af9e24.png).
---
I'm ready for some goldshire grobbin'
---
Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev-cy000SaM), it summarizes things nicely. No hate to streamers, it just changes the game environment a lot.
---
Did you choose Whitemane after visiting DeviantArt?
---
anyway you can update the demographics to show the alliance/horde percentage per server?
---
Yeah but level 40 is less than half of the time to get to 60. If the world record for Paladin is 10-11 days played then someone is doing something very, very wrong. Also he's trying to say how Ret is boring but not slow. So his point here is that ret is significantly better than warriors but warriors(speedrunners) will likely be hitting 60 not too far off from that time frame(110 hours).
---
And that world record is like 15 years old.
---
Yup. This really put a damper on my hype big time. Imagine them announcing a new batch of server after you've leveled for 1-2 weeks. Just do it right from the start, Blizzard!
---
I'm seriously considering waiting it out right now...
---
There’s nothing to fix.
---
🏆
---
I fucking detest streamers and even in think you're being a whiny diaper baby.
---
lol
---
Grobby. I love the nickname.
---
they dont work
---
Seems like atleast German servers are safe lol (idk the german scene though)
---
Reddit's probably overreacting as usual. They’re probably being conservative, worried that if they have too many servers each won’t hit a critical mass of players - hard to amalgamate servers without name issues etc - easy to add another server and good for PR ‘vanilla does better than expected’ etc
---
I gotta say solo farming the barman's shanker in BRD from Plugger, in the bar was one of the best memories I have from wow.
---
You had to stealth past so many mobs, pull off so many tricks to get there and then manage to solo the boss and pull him away from the rest.
---
It was so fun. I'd go rogue again but I want something new
---
Willitclassic.com
---
I think this is the same cvar that leatrix-plus modifies.
---
In that case, it's the desaturating screen effect that occurs after you die and as a ghost/wisp.
---
I'd honestly much rather avoid APES than streamers. Apes are like what actual intentionally toxic players are, streamers for the most part only unintentionally bring toxicity through their fanbase.
---
Blizz:  Let's rename The Nicker but name a launch server Whitemane
---
Couldn't they just take all the players on a given layer and move that data to a new server?
---
1 sub
---
Keep in mind there is no consistency between servers timezones and physical location. There are PT servers in Chicago, EST servers in LA. For information regarding ping (that matters for some people), the current information we have means nothing.
---
Really hope they do a classic only sub.
---
I want to play warlock for classic but I'm worried my pet names will suck.
---
Upvote for the word mongoloid. Could have been topped by homunculus. 8/10
---
Damn this comment didn't age well, only took 2 days to be proven horribly wrong.
---
We may have both been right. Someone just mentioned spell ranks are only applicable to mana-based abilities. If you play a melee class, it may explain why you haven't experienced this.
---
This is one of the better shitty memes tbh.  Not one of those rehash drake picture garbage with low resolution pics.  Or any of the other super reused ones.
---
The me and the bois is overused but this is a good new way to do it.
---
Anything new will attract streamers. Classic is great for filling time in between BFA content droughts(and vice versa).
---
So Herod-US seems to be the new Illidan-US as I can see
---
wait, i know you're colleen :-)
---
I just want to be on the biggest server no matter what, so I will follow the streamers regardless of being a sperg around them or the spergs in general.
---
Lol
---
StreamerDumb
---
Typical response I expected from a streamer sycophant, showing a lack of education and class from someone who can't even interact with people on any acceptable level. You wonder why we want the streamers to identify one server? People like this are a great example.
---
You're hoping for a lower price point, let's be real.
---
Does it matter?
---
nobody switches servers after launch.  everyone will be like "i hope all these other idiots would switch" and keep playing
---
The best thing about being hyped for this is that we already *know* that we like this game. 
---
With something like Fallout 76 we were hyped 'cause we love Fallout, but had no idea if the new game rocked or sucked. 
---
But with this we already are aware of how good classic is.
---
this is a big effort post when at the end of the day its still dynamic respawn
---
**I SHALL**
---
It's not so much the streamers that are the issue. Most of them are decent people. The issue is the legion of morons that will follow them around. Again, a lot of these people are probably okay, but you have the outliers that are only there to make life miserable for others in an attempt to be on stream.
---
Definitely Cataclysm was the best expansion. The game desperately needed a small raid equivalent to the 25 man's. I have so much more fun coordinating with 10 people to get through a dungeon than 25. I raided both ways for Cataclysm and 25 man was just easier. In 10 man every death matter where as you could have a couple of dumbasses in 25 and still do well.
---
I guess you're right i just would've never known about it if it wasn't on G4 tech tv CHEAT! Never played vanilla so i always wanted to do that quest.
---
What’s best PvP or RP-PvP?
---
A couple of friends and I are looking to play, hopefully on a populated server have some PvP engagements every now and then since it’s part of the thrill and obviously complete quests and do group activities. We have never played WoW on such a scale so I could use some insight.
---
Thanks suga!
---
You are correct.
---
Flying sucks no doubt my man
---
Just a thought, you could just write in your guilds Discord "lets change server, this one is fucked up" and then maybe say the same to your friends?
---
STREAMERD BAD!!!
---
You’ll make money the exact same ways everyone else does. The only difference is that farming in the world can be a bit difficult due to not having strong multi target CC or big damage bursts.
---
Everyone can make money, don’t sweat that.
---
Server upkeep and GM salaries will keep the price up. Not to mention propping up the bleeding retail
---
Streamers bad

I am so fucking happy there is only 1 oceanic pvp server, it basically guarantees I won’t accidentally pick a low pop realm. So excited to play!!!
---
I think aesthetically it was the most beautiful of all of them
---
My plan has always been to just make a random character with the names I want ASAP on naming day. I’ll wait til like 4-5 days before launch to create my full character when there’s less chance of it being stolen
---
Because Asmongold doxxed him on stream early on in the beta, someone I know was watching and mentioned it in Discord, and I enjoy reading cases. After watching the duel tournament and seeing how focused he was on advertisements rather than content, I took a deeper dive and made notes.
---
That girl is famous now and will always be remembered because of this by WoW players. Hardly see how that is a terrible thing considered she loved the game.
---
It seemed fine in the latest stress test
---
TBC, yes flying sucked, no I don't care.
---
Warsong was a BR hellhole back in the day and I’d rather deal with streamers than that again.
---
How we do that?
---
Nothing is stopping them from spinning up new realms on the fly though, if they see a need they will do it.

Not really. Swapping services exist within other games. He's asking if Blizzard is going to be taking action against people who swap gold.

If it isn't deemed against TOS, that means buying gold will be 100% legal via WoW tokens and player-run swapping services. It should be a serious concern for anyone against WoW tokens in Classic.

hahah, I actually don't care about which server SA picks, if it were up to me they could choose a streamer one, as far as I know a lot of people would rather not interact with us.

Until now I was sure that blizz would give us at least one pvp server, this pretty much killed the hype I had (nevertheless, I'm going to play).

Blizzard needs to quarantine streamers onto their own special server.
---
People who like to PVP open world will be on that server. People who don't like that will be on the other server.

This is such a low IQ response which only shows you have no idea what this is about.

How about raid tanking?

Absolutely lol

Do you mean, will anybody there at all be reporting offensive things in general? Probably.

Imagine if the swap rates were something outrageous like 10,000g BfA per 1g Classic.

Are you high? This conversation is about how to fix the ping problem with the servers they currently have. Your assertion is putting the only server on the east coast solves the problem. NO IT DOESN'T. It just makes it so that a different half of the country gets screwed. The only solution is to add another server. How is it taking you this long to comprehend this? It isn't hard. At this point you must be trolling on purpose. That or just unbelievably biased.
---
I think you did a good job. You said all 3 specs are shit tier leveling which they are. And you indicated ret is the preferred tree to level.
---
Great work guys!
---
I made a server, hope its not terrible https://discord.gg/RZBaJUV
---
I didn't say play at a different time, I said people don't play 24 hours a day. Some people here are confusing total playerbase per server and concurrent online, like the person I was replying to, and I'm assuming yourself. 12000 people total are not too many at all, that's like twice less than decent size vanilla realms had.  2500 was concurrent online cap, not the total population.
---
You're going to die, a lot.
---
holy shit. Only 2 West Coast servers and 3 East Coast servers.
---
This makes avoiding streamers even more important. We can royally get fucked if the 2-3 big name guys split up. It would be critical to follow [http://www.avoidstreamers.com/](http://www.avoidstreamers.com/) to avoid Asmon at least.
---
I hope so, but oce in retail is listed under us so it is in the us queue foe bgs, which i hope is not in classic or ffs.
---
Cheers!
---
The issue is more about crushing blows. Private servers never had real info and made most of it up. I remember seeing one druid ot one of the fights in mc that used multiple warriors. You'd be crazy to let a druid tank over a warrior on most fights. Even as OT.
---
No cross realms in classic afaik
---
&gt; it would be wise to assume we will also take on most of the gold farming population.
---
No not really. The gold farmers want to play on the realms with the biggest markets and the biggest pockets. They don't care about proximity. Proportionally, the US is certain to have the majority share of gold farmers, followed closely by Europe.
---
If your main focus will be PvP I wouldn't bother with Lock unless you are playing on Horde.

Oh yeah for sure, but thinking "everyone involved is a shitty person" and "embarrassed to be associated" just makes me cringe from how pathetic and non-dimensional it sounds. Its not like they went to someones funeral IRL and through poop at the attendees or something.

The biggest issue is feral gets no attack power stat sticks till the green dragons/aq

Thank you for the heads up
---
Vanilla was the "rough draft" of World of Warcraft. 
---
Things were OK, but not great and it was rough around the edges. 
---
Every hybrid class in the game is sub-optimal except for healing. 
---
Paladins, for example, don't even have a taunt so they can't tank properly. 
---
Cat druids (you get at level 20), don't get a decent finishing ability until level 32. 
---
The exclusion and timing of some of the abilities for hybrid classes is perplexing. The general consensus in Vanilla was that, since you were a hybrid class that could do anything, you shouldn't be very good at whatever you specced into. 
---
Which is bullshit when you consider that respeccing is cost prohibitive and not convenient or "fast" time wise since you had to speak to a trainer. 
---
So if you plan to go Oomkin, keep all of that in mind. You're going to have an uphill battle and you'll need to likely put more time into the game than other classes / specs need to.

Soda's brother helps him with finances and has him put a lot of his money into properties. That is why he moves a lot, he will jump in the new house and rent out the old one to make even more income. I'm pretty sure at least one of the houses he rents out is to streamers, but I'm not 100% sure.
---
Him, Asmon and quite a lot of other streamers also live in Austin and do irl streams with each other. If you see Soda and someone else together often, chances are they also live in Austin and aren't just flying over every week.

As a lock main, I’d of course say lock. But from a non bias POV, Mages are so unbelievably strong, probably best overall class. Also super fun, great levelers, great pvp, top 2 raid dps, amazing gold farmer. Warlocks have great utility and cannot do as much destruction in bgs in terms of big CoC crits, but you can dot everyone and watch them melt. In raids they are both not very exciting but their shadow bolts crit huge numbers and you’ll be up near the top dps but have to constantly watch threat. Locks downside for sure is their gold making is much worse, and people will always want you to help summon. But f you are truly only pvping either is fun for their own ways
---
Its basically like a very committed guild of 12 year olds
---
The PVP realm is bound to have 3 to 4 times the playerbase. Whether that means the PVE realm will be underpopulated or the PVP realm will eventually need a sister realm with free transfers remains to be seen.
---
Feline Swiftness is absolutely worth getting. It makes you run 30% faster which is great for leveling, obviously. 
---
You'll be spending a lot of time in cat form for that reason, as well as the fact that cat form is decent for leveling in general. 
---
Prob not really worth the respec honestly, but if you feel the need to spend your first respec (1g) on it, then go for it!
---
Cross-server bgs completely kill the PvP community. Please do NOT add them, Blizzard.

Druids cant tank raids is simply untrue.

They dont have crushing blow mitigation but they can MT MC and nearly all of BWL. They start to even out with warriors in AQ till late AQ when warriors outclass bears into nax.

Yep. A dungeon that was scrapped in vanilla. The area is accessible as a ghost by walking through the gate in the crypt behind kara.

Go PvE. You can always run around flagged. The only thing you'll really miss out on is ganking and thats not really world pvp anyways
---
I don't know his videogame history. If he downloaded Questie and was adamant about leveling that is a realistic number. For someone that is completely green, you're right that 200+ hours maybe a more accurate number. In another post he mentions spamming dungeons with heirloom hear so I assume he isn't totally fresh.
---
Yes pve and pvp will be mixed. This was also the case in Vanilla and even in the Classic beta it was mixed.
---
Even if 100% of American Spanish and Portuguese players choose the same respective realms, there's no way either will end up as the majority population.
---
 Only two PVP servers duuudeeee... Blizzard doesnt have any idea About the gold they have in their hands right?
---
During wrath of the lich king blizzard made a change to warriors. I don't remember exactly what they did, but they made it so overpower triggered off blocks, and had no cooldown, and combined with some talent that let you hit multiple targets.
---
For about two weeks, until they fixed it, prot warrior was the #1 damage for 5 mans. It wasn't even close. I could do saronite pits with people way more geared than myself and I'd still do 70% of the group's damage. It was absolutely insane until they put a cooldown on it.

So yeah, that'd be my favourite.

I thought Blizzard mentioned that reporting alone in classic won't silence someone nor force a name change.
---
O we out here
---
Whelp, Blizzard, even though you made the decision over a year ago, now that this guy said it 2 weeks before launch, you have to change it.
---
asmon is a streamer that has developed an insane number of followers from classic beta. Enough to possibly affect the player dynamics of that server.
---
Sorry, they're already in there
---
Wait, why would Spanish and Portuguese players from Europe play on an NA realm with 500 ping?
---
So it's Remulos for me.  I'm worried we won't have enough players for two servers.

One of the first mice I've ever seen with a braided cable. REVOLUTIONARY

The trolls over here just silently judging the hypocrisy right now.

---
US West &gt; OCE in terms of ping, but it's a fairly negligible difference. Though if you want to raid, being in the same timezone is really important so probably go OCE
---
This is a really well done. How many paladins are generally in a 40 man raid?
---
Good tip! 
---
If I do take your advise, Out of druid, Hunter, rogue... What'd you recommend?
---
Its going to be THE big server for US PvE alliance guilds it appears....
---
God, I remember setting my first steps outside of Elwynn, so surprised the whole world wasn't just woods, then starting the quests and absolutely sucking.
---
I I had about 4 of those mice, its gets harder and harder to order them..
---
Yeah there's quite a few things weird about this. One of the first things that made me start noticing weird shit was the mailbox "Open All" button.
---
I heard thalnos but not 100%
---
Is it really a higher skill cap? Leaning towards lock but won’t regret playing either
---
They might not be the majority but they zerg when top streamer logs on. They can have a larger impact. More so with a streamer with 10k+ viewers. Takes a third of them to fill a server on a whim. 
---
This is goon squad levels of but almost 50x worse.
---
&gt;benefits
---
Fair
---
It would be extremely easy for Blizzard to add more servers.
---
Sorry we dont use these here
---
 START THE DAMN JOUST BEFORE I PISS MESELF

Yep already looking this way. The guilds will be choosing over the weekend. Ours chooses Sunday, but its pretty clear Pagle will be where the guilds (Alliance) all go.

Im pretty sure he is from the Netherlands. Might live in sweden though.
---
It's not the streamers I want to avoid. It's their fan base.
---
To be honest, I just opened it and cleaned it right before this picture  (for the first time lol)
---
Appreciate the well thought out post. Certainly open to both, might just end up being a game time decision. The healing that exists for warlock seems to allow for greater solo potential in WPvP, and SL seems really really strong.
---
Nah, I'm not confusing anything man. I wasn't even talking about that and neither were you yet you're acting like it's magically an argument now when your initial argument was that people wouldn't be playing 24/7. No shit, but a majority will be playing at the same times.
---
I agree. We've always had success in staying quiet over things we don't like and just trusting in blizzard to do the right thing.
---
We may make exceptions if it's related to World of Warcraft, but generally, leave the real world political stuff out. This applies to religious topics also. There are plenty of subreddits dedicated to politics where you can have these discussions.
---
Still saving my anger for Druids. Who cares about Paladins lul.
---
How does the mage vs lock matchup tend to go? I also heard that Lock could solo some dungeon that nets around 50 gold per hour? Not too sure though, played classic when I was like 9 lol.
---
I really hope they change their minds and go clog up the high pop streamer servers. BR's love the highest pop they can find.
---
Why so many people here hate streamers?
---
done
---
Thanks for sharing the polls!  I didn't know that players felt such a strong emotional tie to their choice of abbreviation. I was under the impression that only new players used DM, and I wanted to point out an alternate option to avoid confusion in trade chat at Dire Maul release. Clearly I was wrong. I feel pretty neutral about it.
---
Fair point I agree.
---
I was leaning towards RP-PVP, but it's in the wrong time zone for me. My internet is pretty poor here and don't know if I can consider RP-PVP anymore (not exactly sure how much more it will affect my ping). I don't really mind rolling on a normal PVP realm if the streamers would announce where they are going, but even then I think the RP-PVP community will be way better overall...
---
you're wrong.
---
I think all paladin specs rock in PvP/BGs. Change my mind.
---
Why not?
---
Nope it isn't
---
I'm not sure there are many folks here that don't already know about WillItClassic. It gets linked in countless threads every day since the beginning of the Classic Beta.
---
And then have all guildies just tell their friends that time to reroll, and then they tell their friends and guildies etc on a moments notice because the names go quick? You can't manage a big group of branching people so fast.
---
It was usually this. Also, grabbing 5 was easier than grabbing 10.
---
I think they just released a reworked version of this one. I think it's called MX518 Legendary.
---
What do you mean by that?  Lots of named mobs?
---
Thats not true on my server there was a line for Garrick Padfoot's head, except one or two guys people were cool
---
Ive heard shit on willitclassic doesn't work
---
Healthy servers had a population of about 3000 people playing at any given time. By phase two, layering needs to be GONE, there CANNOT be multiple world bosses on one and the same server. By only providing five servers, Blizzard thus believes there won't be more than 20k people playing at any given time on PVP servers in the Americas, a continent with a population of one billion people. Everyone supporting Blizzard on this is completely delusional. It's not enough.
---
I'm brazillian and no way in hell I will be playing there. There amount of trolling is absurd. Some people in my country do not receive basic education from their parents. Yes, it is sad.
---
Thanks for your insight!  I’ve did a dwarf paladin in wrath and don’t think I want to stare at another one!
---
They can log in to start the top of the queue and then do the "start the stream" roll and everyone else gets in queue behind them.
---
I’ll never have the time for tier 3 but I’m hoping to get some of the t1 set at least

---
I’d imagine with layering it can hold as many as they want because they are just partitioning more servers. But when they inevitably remove layering, we’re going to have mega servers with way too many users playing.
---
Any population greater than 8k+ is not healthy for a server identity.
---
AFAIK, WillItClassic doesn't do any of its own testing and provides no way for users to report on any addon's functionality, it just categorizes addons into buckets based on what their developers have said and done.
---
This comment is the very first thing I thought of when the announcement came out lol
---
It'll be too late by then. Those servers they'll add will be doomed from the start. Private server history has shown this many times.
---
What's your exact specifications? 
---
I wanna get it running really nicely on my iMac and my MacBook Air.
---
&gt;I don't mind playing with BR.
---
spoken like someone that was never experienced being non brazilian on a brazillian server
---
That’s all I ask!  Thanks a lot!
---
It depends where the data center is. I don't think Blizzard has released that info
---
Hmmm the Hound and the Mountain ?
---
I am reminded of an old image of a kid getting suspended from school for yelling seal of command.
---
I think you’ve persuaded me to go hunter!! (Until tomorrow when I reconsider for the 200th time). Thanks a lot!
---
They are all choosing to go to the same server purposefully. They are making a genuine decision where to go together in order to spare people the streamer crowds. This post means they have eliminated a couple of options guaranteed which means those servers are safe to choose if the only thing you cared about was avoiding them.
---
Ignore lists are the size of bfa’s so no worries there - closed beta barrens chat was amazing and chill - the only thing different this time around is that people substituted Keanu jokes for chuck norris jokes.
---
In beta, which was like a throwaway experience - I was expecting folks to be shitty and rude to one another since everything is deleted afterwards .... but I had the opposite, kinda of a kumbaya experience
---
XrEaLm KiLlEd PvP

There's one on r/Grobbulus
---
Thank you Staysafe! Are you still courting a nazi audience or are you too mainstream for that now?
---
No, it's just the look of the mouse. No dents here.
---
I expect nothing but edgy left-wing turbo nerds spewing their retarded opinions and maybe the occasional "where's Mankrik's wife?"
---
13,5 = 14 servers
---
Warsong, Drakkari, and Quel'thalas... *cringe*
---
Most of the really big ones that are actually gonna play the game for more than a week are more than likely gonna be on the same one regardless. Asmon, Soda, Esfand, StaySafe are all likely to be in one server, and that's most of the cancer. I'm sure a bunch of other big streamers will be playing too that just pick whatever server, but there the ones that hop from trend to trend and will be gone in a week or two.
---
It’s 240 hours normally
---
Sure. 60ms in vanilla with 400ms batching really means a lot
---
Which darkUI is that?  Any other recommended rogue addons?  Anything that shows kidney/CS/gouge durations?
---
People were calling it VC before dire maul was out, OP is on the money
---
You're
---
If only there was a stupid quote that would fit this situation.. I've read it around here somewhere
---
Servers will probably choose herod
---
Are normies the streamers or the people not wanting to play with streamers? Like the biggest audience on twitch is kids.
---
Warlords of Draenor
---
World was nonstop with vc vs dm today
---
Herod , whitemane , and faerlina are the hot spots for streamers and high pop alike. I suggest putting a chat name on each of these.
---
Hmm, it was so long ago. You could be right.
---
The languages may have originated in Europe, but Europe is a tiny fraction of their native speakers now. Given the context in OP's post, assuming he meant Europe was very foolish.
---
There are no pros, only cons. Blizzard needs to force them all onto their own special server.
---
love how everything is on top of a turtle
---
Very worried it'll be horde dominated because my friend wants to roll pve, and pagle is a shit server name.
---
Upvoted bc Trump
---
yup i can now confirm this. Makes death look completely normal
---
Im rolling with the streamers. I think it would be fun to participate in the streamer events and I'm not all that bothered by their existence. So I'm waiting to see which one they role.
---
I also think the accessibility of OSRS does it some favors. Free to play, can run on anything (although basically WoW can too), more mainstream due to all the memes, less intimidating of a game overall its more simple. So I'm not sure if wow will surpass it. Would be great if it did but yeah. Just a higher barrier of entry imo.
---
The brazilians make up for less then 10% of that server. This thing about it being for BR is BS. Don’t be afraid to play with other players.
---
They’re still enforced just as much if enough reports roll in. Had multiple guildies renamed as recently as this year
---
Dm didn’t exist when people were doing dead mines, people switched to VC when Dire Maul was out because most people were 60.
---
You're not going to recapture the magic that was wow
---
Yeah if you want WPvP, Warlock is certainly a good pick. 
---
Especially if you want to either do SL or use VW sacrifice and Enslave an elite demon in Winterspring to harass Priests farming for Benediction...
---
Last I checked that was mostly the elves which are currently blood elves, aka within their own faction. 
---
Trolls were siding with the horde before the attack, it just made it official.
---
This analysis is crap, there's another post saying is Faerlina
---
  Alliance? There was some dude in elwyn who wouldn’t shut up about being ice cube.
---
No, because I'm an adult and can make simple, unimportant decisions without anguishing over them.
---
3k x 11 = 33k? Am I missing something? Lol
---
Not sure if one has been made or how many people the others have on it if it has, but i did make an Arugal server last night when the names rolled out [https://discord.gg/f3Vuh5U](https://discord.gg/f3Vuh5U)
---
garrosh as a final boss was great though right?
---
I wonder what the race would look like if you launched a server with all content unlocked at the start, and its just a race to KT.
---
In Grob We Trust
---
Yes I did.
---
Idk man, I feel like trade chat will turn in to twitch chat and there will be toxic 12 y/o's running around
---
It does a body good. 
---
Pass it on.
---
Weird thing is we got more servers than the Europeans.
---
Yeah I probably could've rephrased that. I get what you mean
---
I'm not talking about the recent wars but literally the entire history of the Alliance committing genocide on trolls for their entire history. You think Trollbane got his name from having a really good gambling trip in Zuldazar? Most human kingdoms were built on the blood of trolls.
---
They can and did.
---
Easy for us Aussies since it’s either pvp or not pvp lol.
---
Ah, I wouldn't know as I don't pick the faction with a lore history full of Nazi-esque tendencies. ;-)
---
As an oceanic player my options are pvp or pve im kind glad as i dont have to choose but at the same time im kind stuck with what i get on the pvp server but hey im just happy i get to play at 25ms pvp or pve todays a good day
---
Proud of you for that
---
More like 0.5-3% imo tho the latest stress test could be different. Idk why you still needed an active sub.. How do they calculate the playercount if they dont allow all into stress test?? The amount of currently unsubbed players resubbing for classic are a big '?' in any prediction calculation
---
iirc there's a limitation on cast bars in classic.  
---
The site is fine.  It's just a base where people can collate info about addons for classic.  Some will still work better than others.
---
Every class is good while leveling, and Warlock has good single target, multi target, and AoE damage. Plus Soulstone and Summons mean you'll be desired beyond just the good damage. When necessary your VW can also tank a mob
---
Unbelievable how its only 1 pvp server for oceanic
---
That's fine. Continue your life as usual then. I'll avoid them and you can play with them.
---
what exactly do you think will be the bigger of the cons? Ill add to the list.
---
Thought vc=vietcong
---
100%
---
3 million aren't concurrently logging on. When they said sub numbers, that's how many active subs.
---
I can't wait to raid as a ret pally and prove everyone right.
---
In any case, you Aussies love the gold so much many of you spend your entire lives digging holes in the ground just to find chunks of it. I'm sure the gold farmers will be welcomed with open arms, that is as long as they don't reveal their skin isn't white. ;-)
---
English is apparently the hardest language to learn because it has the most depth

Thanks for the input
---

This is fantastic! Thank you

normies are the average person who game casually and like to play easy games. They cant think for themselves and follow/watch streamers.
---
Swe? Swe? Swe?

Yeah thats how it goes haha. Good luck bro, thanks for the info.

Then I think it’s fair for him not to have special name reservation privileges.  I don’t even know why people like the guy.

Raiding on a west coast server while living east coast is shitty. RIP sleep. The other way around is much more manageable.

I don't think classic will hit the shitter if they do get their name.

We have an subdomain for arugal already set up. Both discords are quite small at the moment, so I'm kinda waiting to see what happens. Perhaps yourself and the admin of the other discord could work together.
---
we fuckin on the warcraft sheets tonite
---
This makes 0 sense. All people they're live playing the game doesn't mean those are the only times the server will have a que. The server will be flooded regardless if they're live or not just because there favourite WoW streamer has there main character on it.
---
Wouldn’t it make more sense that since dire maul wasn’t there at launch, that deadmines would be called DM at first?
---
This isn’t new people that are saying VC and it caught a trend.
---
You're welcome. There's so many discords, and they're hard to find good invite links to sometimes. I just hope this makes things a little easier for people.
---
It seems (per the dev of classic cast bar) that blizz broke some of the combat log apis that worked in beta so a lot of addons in general are having to rush some fixes in.
---
Honestly it seems like with spell batching and leeway, the small ping difference won't make any difference whatsoever
---
Well Billy, this is where mommy and daddy made you.
---
Calling it now, Faerlina is gonna be the Proudmoore of Classic
---
Do what?
---
Same here. It's all I'm afraid of that could possibly diminish or ruin my Classic experience. I'll write back once I have info where he'll be!
---
Well, at least from things like Sodapoppins discord server, it seems they are going to go eastern and likely do Faerlina as "Herod is too obvious." So assuming that's true, Whitemane and Fairbanks should be safe and Herod *likely* is.

Im still rofling
---
mages stronger locks more useful
---
I personally don't think 12 year olds have the attention span to play classic so I'm really not worried about it. Maybe I'm just optimistic about humanity, but I refuse to  believe anybody cares enough about streamers to talk about it to other people outside of twitch chat. And if they do theres gonna be tons of people telling them the shut the fuck up immediately afterwards. I really don't think it will be that bad.
---
They literally announced that mailboxes were staying the same as retail at Blizzcon. Were you living under a rock this whole time.
---
I can guarantee you that 100% of those naked female humans are guys irl.
---
I think... the question there was to highlight that the list doesn’t contain the class of the undead, “forsaken” is just used in its place. Think the guy with the list meant Undead Rogue but not sure.
---
What makes you believe people will transfer and fill up the new servers? They won't, people have endured the queueu before and will do it again (see private server history). All adding server does is creating dead servers.
---
What is funny is the streamer server may be the most balanced since the streamers split factions
---
Home sweet home.
---
My OG main, Tauren Shaman, will be on Grobby for sure
---
I second this. I clearly remember calling deadmines DM back in the day.
---
Beside, how would a lvl 16 saying "LFG DM" be confused with Diremaul? diremaul is like lvl 50+ or something.
---
And here I thought this was another out of season April's fool joke
---
Nah, there are an entire group of Blizzard defenders in this subreddit that all act the exact same. I think a generalization is entirely reasonable when they all walk in step.

Not thee best way to establish your reputation. I could see everyone in line adding to the ignore list.

All the good PvP players will be there. Depending on your plans it's either a pro or a con.

I remember in vanilla, it required level 5. my guilds bank alt was specifically level 5 because then we could get enchanting on the thing and disenchant BoE junk
---
Internet janitors always find a way to group up
---

---
Blizzard thinks they can just cram everyone into the minimum amount of servers and use layering to make up for the lack of realms. Why? Because blizzard EXPECTS this to fail and we'll only need these few servers by the time they remove layering. With layering it doesn't matter if the server has 10k players. The real problem for all of us is if the server populations DONT diminish and then blizzard has to force servers splits to accommodate the removal of layering.
---
Man, if this were in 1920x1080 it'd be my wallpaper in a second.
---
&gt; Blizzard said a thing, they will do that thing.
---
How are you this gullible? They've already changed this numerous times. You need to stop putting your faith in corporations.
---
&gt; and you have not bothered to address it.
---
Pretty sure I did. But you just called it a "strawman" which is a completely different concept by the way.
---
played on emerald dream for the last 3 expansions, saw a ton of world pvp roleplay, never saw any level 5s roleplaying in a major city. ur nuts.
---
Late to the party but here's what I've been testing (will update as I test more):
---
\-Peggle (seems to be working, at least solo quick play!)

\-Sexymap (wood framed turns my map green but the others are fine)

\-VuhDo (haven't tested downranked spells yet)

\-Dominos (was able to bind keys)

Were you a Tauren?  Did you factor in the extra hp from their racial?
---
Hey, are you Spanish speaker? There will be any Spanish speaker server? (Chosen by the community)
---
Its literally the opposite Wrath baby, Wrath babies call it DM.
---
I wouldn't mind playing with Staysafe, Tips, or Esfand. It's just Asmon/Soda's massive hoard or braindead, racist trolls that I don't want to be with.
---
People who say VC are just trying to be smart or plain stupid IMO. There are 3 wings of Dire Maul so you'd never just say DM, then there is something called context. Or they try saying, well they are both in the same expansion yet DireMaul was released at a later date.

Because if streamers didn't exist it would be organically the most populated server because of the name, and Herod is a good PVP mascot.  The most populated poppin server with no streamers is all would be the formula to success.
---
I wonder if BFA servers are just going to be Ghost Towns with tumbleweeds blowing though them.
---
People didn’t start saying VC because of the first players. They started saying VC when DM came out patches later. 
---
Horde never even had this problem because no horde even ran VC so only half the community knows about this.
---
&gt;sarcasm
---
Killed himself on a cooking campfire, maybe?

"Living the childhood dream." Ain't that the truth.

Oceanic only has 2 populated servers on retail and classic might be more niche. Not to mention that region has a pretty small english population.
---
The coalition of guilds have spoken
---
Staysafe move?  He used to be in Portland, at least he said so on stream a few months ago.

There needs to be way more servers tbh. Please change my mind

A rifle, couple bombs, and a flagon of something strong. Sounds like a night worth posting on PornHub!

Ummm wait did you just say ganking isnt really wpvp? Its like 1 of the biggest wpvp things, your trolling right

They need to give streamers a day in advance for name reserve so we can know where they'll go.
---
I'm a vanilla player and I call it VC

Got a link?

RIP the english language
---
If/when a streamer quits that server will lose a huge portion of its population.
---
This is probably my favorite WoW video. I remember when this happened. People were soooo mad.
---
Even if 100% of American Spanish and Portuguese players choose the same respective realms, there's no way either playerbase will end up as the majority population. They probably couldn't even join forces and manage to take over a single realm. They should absolutely still organize themselves because it will be good for their communities, but there's no reason for every English speaker to write off those realms.
---
It's slowly growing, I have faith!
---
I was saying just last week how blizzard are setting Classic up to fail with the lack of resources they are giving it. This is just further proof they are expecting classic to a small niche.
---
They actually mentioned on several occasions one of the things they are trying to avoid are server transfers..
---
I understand where your coming from, but the math does not add up here mate.
---
cool!
---
I leveled a pally as ret back in vanilla. Never made it past like low 40s. It's HORRIBLE! You can't even liberally judge/refresh seals or you go oom. You just sit there auto attacking.
---
as someone who had 2 60s in vanilla... no. it’s the greatest.
---
Yep, in another 10 years we'll probably view it in a similar way. People will look back at it nostalgically and whatever is the new trend will be viewed as cancer. Then the cycle repeats.
---
Why should Blizzard get involved in what's clearly a community problem
---
Come on over to the US pacific RP-PVP realm tbh.  Grobbulus.
---
- Chat will be spammed with "PLZ INV TO &lt;insert streamer name&gt;'s GUILD", "HAS ANYONE SEEN &lt;insert streamer name&gt;?", "LETS GANK/DEFEND &lt;insert streamer name&gt;" etc etc.
---
- the server community will no longer be about the game, it will be about &lt;insert streamer name&gt;
---
- instead of various server events happening naturally because of the actions of the players, they will be instead promoted and organized by &lt;insert streamer name&gt;
---
Do you think that for the sake of streamers and players alike , if the streamers where to spread runner across all servers it would be better?
---
I know right. I’m still going to bookmark this post, but it took the wind out of my sails for sure.
---
Lmao way to quote a couple of words without any context. You’re a super reasonable dude, my bad.
---
Hard to engage with humans when there are none left because the server is dead.
---
according to sodapoppins, Faerlina is the most likely, so that seems fair. I also hope since I am shooting for Whitemane.
---
Trail of Tears :(
---
Oh god I feel this, and it hurts

The ticks are inconsistent (not always 20) but the total amount of energy regened doe equal out to an average of 20 per 5s

Don't worry we're far too timid and submissive to trashtalk anybody

Wait what? My experience of Horde players on PvP servers is they camp you starting in Redridge mountains. They also have roaming PvP raids of 40+ people that just kill everything in sight. I never see any alliance doing this.
---
alliance day 1 players called it VC
---
Same
---
No they didn’t.
---
Needs to be fixed

dude
---
you could and now can end up with odd numbers  due to energy refund from missed\\blocked\\parried abilities. It should not come from the energy regen.. i've scanned many wow videos from rogues, be it pvp or pve without finding a example showing this regen that we got in "classic"

Four normally. All healers.
---
Major streamers? Dear god no! Keep the all on same server please.
---
Little ones are w/e, they wont have any impact on the servers
---
PVE realms have usually been very biased to one faction for whatever reason. It's like that even in retail now, if you look at realmpop.
---
This. The three biggest offenders of writing in their own language already get their own servers.
---
Paired up with a Felstriker... could be good
---
Herod is the only answer
---
Yeah I some what agree

replying to this hoping you get some info on the streamers :D

ret is one of the fastest leveling classes

It's just a lame horse.

Avoid thalnos to avoid the low skill rag 2.0 we all know it will be.

Sure

Cool man, head on back to the we hate blizzard clubhouse and come up with some more things to bitch about. Simple concept, layering will be gone. They have not wavered, they have not been vague,  I'm sorry you are so sure they will betray everyone for some reason but reality does not agree with you.
---
I played in vanilla and people definitely by in large called it VC. No shit. Might have been different on your server.
---
Yikes.
---
Too late.
---
*Be or feel like a hero for your streamer*
---
/rasp
---
Well fuck it, might as well make up my mind on launch day at this point lol
---
3k is concurrent online players, not total players
---
Hate to say it but this discord has almost zero interaction amongst each other in current BFA and lets hope that maybe classic changes that.   Have been in the discord for about a year now , have posted numerous times, never to get a response =/ literally the exact same as in game..
---
I'm on the west coast but will be playing with friends on the east coast. Will ping be an issue playing on an east coast server? Will there be any other disadvantages? (besides EST raiding times, etc).
---
I've almost settled on a main. I've narrowed it down to 9 classes and 8 races.
---
Ahhhh. So it’s pretty easy for an alliance guild to get the paladins they need for raids. That’s good.  Four doesn’t seem too hard to find.
---
OGlow is the one I used in the past. Not sure if anyone develops it now 
---
https://legacy-wow.com/tbc-addons/oglow/
---
It’s generic, but i really liked WotLK.
---
Something about storming an island full of mindless undead really worked well, and the story overall was captivating about how the battle went on.
---
It also still connected strongly with the RTS series, something which i greatly enjoyed up to that point.
---
We need 4 maybe 5, I Don’t want to reroll! Fome on Blizzard!
---
These are brand new discords, made today. Maybe you are thinking of another server?
---
I think you're going to realize that at least 90% of players will skip lines, which are barely even a thing in the first place.
---
You can make up arbitrary rules and shame people for not following them if you want - it's a video game, with quests and resources designed for competition. If you already from the start expect people to abandon this fundamental aspect of an MMO, you will not be having a good time at higher levels.
---
&gt; Paladins as a whole has another AoE spell in Holy Wrath, in case you have forgotten. Yes, it only affects undead and demons;
---
It only affects undead and demons and has a 30 second CD. 
---
That's not even worth mentioning, especially if the OP's goal is to give a quick look at class capabilities. 
---
The initial problems still exist - lack of AoE spells on demand and taunts, something that no other tanking class has a problem with. I have no idea why Blizzard decided not to give paladin's the proper tools in the first place.
---
i want it to be close to classic as possible
---
but i want it to be as close as possible to how it was in 1.12 and not 1.10
---
This isn't like my favorite private server, therefore it is wrong/not working as intended.
---
No, not really. While highly organized communities like Reddit might decide to avoid a realm that is rumored to have non-native English speakers, a majority of Classic players won't have even heard those rumors. Whatever realm Brazil picks will still be overwhelmingly English and the same goes for the unofficial Spanish realm.
---
shhhh we dont talk about that
---
Newest version works
---
Then he’s never played on a server plagued by them.
---
Didn't know there's no barber shop.
---
Nope. 100% real and originally in vanilla it had weird pathing and aggro and level 60’s could drag it up to the streets and it would run rampant for a bit killing nearby low levels before resetting or being killed
---
Why is RP-PVP EU has more votes than RP EU? The only explanation I see is that pure-RP players are very attached to their characters in actual WoW and don't really want to start from zero.
---
There will be if there needs to be. They have made it clear they are starting conservative and scaling up. Its the sensible thing to do. If we fill these 2x over they will start to add more realms.
---
sigh, both est pve servers have horrible faction balance.
---
&gt; everyone with a brain
---
Right, so hardly anyone
---
The barber shop was added in Wrath IIRC.
---
Not enough to really matter a lot. I was playing on the oceanic stress server and never noticed a single latency issue. I used a fast auto loot addon and had to turn it off because I didn't like how instant it was.
---
Eastern because the servers are actually in Chicago.
---
Damn whitemane lookin thicc
---
?????
---
I actually suspect Fairbanks is where a lot of the organized West Coast guilds are going to end up.  No streamers, isn't the favorite of Brazilians and other South Americans (according to their forums), it's PvP and it's West Coast.  Plus it isn't white man with an "e" at the end.

Tips out said it in a tweet
---
Well, we are talking about a problem specific to the Alliance, so I'm inclined to agree with you.
---
Several hundreds of thousands or maybe more.. dropping off to less than ten thousand?
---
I fail to see how that's possible. I'll admit I might be a bit negative here but I think this signals that layering might be staying a very long time.
---
haha what, do you call all instances as the name of last boss, or is this just a snowflake case ?
---
These guys decided this after the streamers I think
---
dude looks goofy as hell and I love it
---
i cannot confirm nor deny that without having the internal data.  avg over how long? also if that is the case then the tick timer is off by a small amount to cause that to happen
---
Brah we’ve known these names for less than 12 hours and there’s people already talking about how this realm is to be avoided. I’ve seen just as such 5 hours ago in two separate irl friend discords.  This realm is already screwed to be the target of br memes.
---
Great artwork. Ninja’d.
---
I had a Brazilian Ret Paladin in my hardcore raiding guild back in Cata. Legitimately one of the best players I've ever met. Even he admitted most of the Brazilian gamer community is god-awful. It's a stereotype for a reason.
---
Sadly he was killed in a mugging maybe 5-6 years ago.
---
Most raiding guilds will do 3-4 hours per day, 3-4 days per week.
---
Time spent farming will heavily depend on what time of guild you're in, what type of consumes you're farming and server economy.
---
If you're trying to put a decent amount of effort in to raiding, I'd say you'll need to dedicate about 10 hours per week to farm for consumes.
---
It shouldn't be as bad as you think, myself coming off private servers for 3 years, where there hosted in EU and 100ms isnt awful but not great, you connecting to east which is actually Chicago won't be bad.
---
It matters if you don't have a guild yet.... Then you will want to know that most guilds start raids around 8pm their local time. In that case, your free hours should align with that, or close to it if you hope to find a guild.
---
Or you could join the Classic Guild discord and find a guild that raids looong before launch day so you don't have to worry.
---
This is amazing!   
---
What's your process? Do you make a scene out of the original models then paint over them?   
---
It looks so good!
---
Yup, this helps with re-populating farming hotspots while not dooming the rest of the area/zone to massively increased re-spawn rates.
---
Pretty much.  It's all about finding the guild that works best for you and what you WANT to put into raiding.
---
Meh, too many of us are hardcore min/maxers where giving in to even the slightest disadvantage for a cosmetic choice isn't an option. Combine that with the group that wants to feel like they own and belong to a server and won't if its timezone doesn't match all of ours and the vote was a landslide no.
---
I look at dogs on insta and watch South African people make breakfast on twitch 🤷
---
If they're all on a pvp server, they can help each other out. Plus I have no doubt that they will absolutely have a blacklist, and when 80% of the server will be streamer fans..
---
Word, thanks for the reply!
---
Can confirm my guild is rolling there.
---
I'm glad there a gonna be an rppvp realmz hope it'll have the what world pvp and not just be dead
---
Ride with the Grob
---
I totally agree. I’ve been saying this to anyone who will listen. Assuming they aren’t lying about no layering after phase 1, and blizzlike server populations, we will have 6k server capacity for EU English PVP. 8k altogether if they’re really generous with a single server population. This is *significantly less than a single private server*. It’s obviously not enough. Let’s not forget that according to this sub’s poll, EUPVP is about 7 times more popular than PvE. 
---
It’s blatantly obvious they will have to open more. It would be a huge mistake to not open them before launch. If they want to just congregate everyone on the layered megaservers first and then meet the server demand by opening, I think they’re going to cause a lot of guild drama and annoy a lot of people. They need to stop rationalising and just open servers, soon. The whole community is planning out which server to go to in advance, this is unlike any launch they’ve had before and they have to treat it for what it is.
---
I feel like anyone that wants this in is to take advantage of it. This was not what vanilla PvP was  all about. I remember having very interesting battles rogue vs warrior around melee deadzone. We all had lag back then so it made sense. If the goal is to recreate vanilla as best we can this is not it.
---
To be clear, I'm not offended.  It was a reference to another really bad post earlier today where the poster was offended.  I'll add /s.
---
What the fuck. This is cringe.
---
If this is true, y'all need to try to spread the joy that is RP to the people. Get a leveling party together and play the game like a D&amp;D campaign, really *be* your characters as you work to endgame.
---
Retail WoW still doesn't even have an oceanic RP realm :( (I think? Been a long time since playing retail)
---
It's not necessarily the streamers themselves, but their fans. Even Staysafe said that if he wasn't a streamer, he'd understand not wanting to play on a streamer server.
---
Plus it fucks up things like scarab lord, world pvp, and a few other things as streamers will have an ungodly advantage.
---
As far as I know, the pets only utter /say (through speech bubbles) when you MANUALLY order them to attack through /petattack or the skill bar. They don't have voices, though they are in the 1.12.1 files.
---
Oh not sure. Go to willitclassic and search for ClassicCastbars
---
Nah not just you. I get the 3d acceleration error too. I haven’t tested it but people say disabling discord overlay fixes that issue.
---
Yeah Idk why they made it shit here.
---
Do you mean when did Blizzard stop testing things? Because that was yesterday. Or do you mean when the test servers go offline? [Because Blizzard extended them all the way to Monday about 4 hours ago](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-test-realms-open-through-monday/247137).
---
Firstly, you don't have to be in any channel you don't want to be in chat wise.  Also in the past, Blizzard hasn't moderated general chat as much as say, Riot in League of Legends.  However they tend to be more strict on regulating general chats as opposed to private messages, so if you want to be safe, send a whisper instead.  If someone doesn't like what you say they can always just ignore you.
---
My whole life is a lie.
---
Yeah, being able to host streamer events will have a monumentous positive effect on their streams.

Of course they did..VC refers to the quest which takes people to Deadmines for the first time. So people posted “LFG VC” just like they said “LFG Hogger”.
---
Back in day 1 of WoW, most people had no idea it was a dungeon.
---
To be honest, I'm sort of glad that we only have 2 servers. My one misgiving about rolling Oceanic was that the numbers would be too low. Just having two servers should guarantee a healthy population on both.
---
I can't say I understand the second one whatsoever, but have fun.

You need it though. It's the only way to see unit frames in a raid using the standard UI

10k people in one area won't be possible for a long, long time, as number of players scales processing power (and data transmission/bandwidth) required in an exponential fashion.

I'd say most NA people have had many bad experiences with Brazilian players.

---
I'm central time and can only play from like 10pm - midnight.  Should I go eastern time and be on at 11pm - 1am, or go pacific for 8pm server time?
---
Obviously, with only a couple hours a day, I'm on the casual side, but I would like to eventually raid.  Do most guilds raid closer to 8/9 pm or later?  I'm leaning towards pacific, because I suspect I know the answer.
---
I dont agree with the 'the economy will be skewed', because ultimately materials are being consumed.  To me, it sounds like a thriving economy.
---
I agree with everything you said except "more mainstream". I'm not sure any game in the modern era has been more mainstream than WoW. You're talking about a game that had ads on regular TV featuring A list celebrities. South Park did an entire episode of it. They made a major Hollywood motion picture on the back of this game.
---
I was gonna roll rppvp anyway and this whole streamer thing just greatly reenforced my decision.

But if you put any time into fishing and cooking you could probably make the money back.

Not clear whether ACGL will be phase 1.  
---
Not sure it's competitive as an offhand with bonescraper considering you get 5 weapon skill as a rogue for free anyway.
---
I added those cvars to a macro and couldnt' get them to work. I guess I will need to add them to the config file like you said.
---
It feels cool coming across characters you've played with before and you recognize their face
---
As someone who has never watched a wow streamer, what are the drawbacks for being on the same server as one?
---
You want it to be in Chicago so it will be closer to the east coast.
---
If the server is in Chicago it will screw over people on the west coast for exactly the same reason the current server location screws people over on the east coast.
---
You are resorting to name calling because you have no argument and you're pissed off that you're being called out for your bias.
---
I realize Chicago is not on the East Coast. You pseudo-intellectual, arrogant, know-it-all twat.
---
It's Blizzard's decision if they want to make another server. But unfortunately, the reality is the only way to solve the problem is to add one. Switching the server from the west coast to the east coast solves nothing. It does not get rid of the problem that half the player base is getting screwed.
---
Just because YOU live on the east coast and want to have lower ping, doesn't mean you're more important than people on the west coast that want low ping too. Not once did I EVER say I think it's a good idea to have only one server and have it be on the west coast.
---
I get it. You're upset because you're used to spouting bullshit and browbeating people anonymously on the internet until you feel better about yourself. I get that it makes you upset when someone calls you on it. I'm sorry your feelings are hurt because you don't like admitting you're not the most important person in the world. Go troll somebody else, then go to bed. It's almost your bedtime.
---
People want to committ and choose realms prior to launch with their guild. Doesnt take 200 iq to get
---
Just roll your main name on 3 servers
---
That’s a pretty lame hill to choose to die on. But whatever. Have fun.
---
Pray that I don’t get a streamer server
---
Ya it’s really ashame. And since they only announced 2 servers it 100% means that it’ll be 2 servers forever. Blizzard can’t ever add new servers on a whim as demand dictates like they did in vanilla. They definitely can’t add new servers if there’s crazy character creation demand on the 12th and announce these new servers 2 weeks before launch. Looks like Europeans will just have to crawl into a hole and touch themselves for comfort while they wallow in despair.
---
Make a giant normie guild to challenge them.
---
I will happily put money on the paid Appearance Change coming to classic at some point.
---
I would. Sounds like a good time.
---
Way to ignore everything that I was saying and stick with your obvious argument that there are more popular playing times. Again, 12000 or even 24000 people per server is fine, this is exactly how the game worked in actual vanilla, with online capped at 2500. I don't know why I have to repeat this point three times and you still can't seem to grasp this.
---
They are going to Herod or Whitemane, my guess is Herod.  I am just going to roll PvE.  Everything is easier on a PvE server, and when AQ farming comes, you better be in a top notch guild or on the correct faction, or you won't be getting a sceptre.  I am playing for late game here.
---
youre far too kind sir
---
Atleast rp-pvp has rules so we still won't see stupid ass names and twitch memes in trade chat.
---
Esfand and staysafe are 100% going to the same Server as asmongold.
---
I'd think Soda would join too but that's not confirmed afaik.
---
So they’re being pessimistic, right. 
---
They would have to screw up royally to need to close one of 3 eupvp servers due to low pop. After phase 1 their total capacity combined won’t even be 10k. That’s less than one good private server.
---
This sub’s polls indicate that for EU, pvp servers are 7 times more popular than pve. So the entire EU population of the game would have to be under 15k concurrent, 3 months after launch, being generous, for dead servers to be an issue. If that’s the case then things have gone much worse than any of us could have imagined. 
---
If they feel it’s best to just open a server after launch, we’ll that’s going to fuck with the community and create a total imbalance in the composition of the new server population vs the old, since no preformed guilds are going to move 1 or 2 months in, during levelling or early raiding, while they’re just establishing themselves. Any that feel obliged to will have to go through mad pain and drama.
---
Are you trolling? EU got 2. I dont care what France and Germans got. We got 2 english realms
---
Haha pepehands haha poggers
---
Also, server chats were a lot more useful in vanilla when everyone with whom you were playing was on the same server.
---
What do you mean? We only have two :(
---
If you want to change them in-game, you have to use /console:
---
    /console farclip 10000
---
instead of 
---
    SET farclip "10000"   
---
But any CVARs you set with /console will not persist across game sessions.
---
I would rather deal with streamers than BR also.  Some of them were really nice and good people, but the majority I think might be all related, not in a good way.
---
And we all know they won’t do 10k caps. Layer sizes are around 3k and they indicated that  be the normal realm size after phase 1. If they seriously do 6k, 8k probably generous, for all EU pvp, we’re fucked. It’s less than one private server... 
---
They’re inevitably going to have to launch another server, so they’d better do it before launch to actually let the community plan and organise themselves to spread evenly. If they open a new one with phase 2 when people are just levelling/early raiding, it’s asking for a troubled, insignificant life for the new server.
---
I follow him. I follow a lot of streamers.

The question isn't answered here, it's answered by you playing the game and seeing what guilds are on your server
---
Thanos it is for me and the boys.
---
Why do you say this?  A server with 25k players is going to have a SOLID economy with a much higher velocity of money.  This is a good thing. 
---
It’s my understanding they will have dynamic respawns to account for greater competition.
---
Hah dont act like we dont already know your name, *Thex*
---
^^^ now I’m thinking maybe playing on east coast servers might not be a great idea if they are in dumpster fire us-east-1!
---
There is no evidence pointing to that, but if he did join that server, we would show him that he is not welcome in our Horde.
---
Good so when his stream crashes a server, we can use this VOD to get him banned.
---
RIP, Blizzard changed their minds about RP-PVP. GG boys.
---
I tested a private server a couple weeks ago for warrior and while I didn't die a lot I did notice that the dmg mobs did and the sheer density of mobs was off by quite a bit so the difficulty of leveling a warrior felt super exaggerated, watching streamers on the on the stress test looks like the low level mobs do a lot less dmg and of course the early zones are way more populated so pulling extra mobs is less of a concern.
---
Why is everyone panicking?
---
I don't see any issue here. Honest!
---
They are getting out servers not for launch, but for naming purposes, and from what it seems to test the waters on demand from current active subs.
---
There are a lot of people that will start their subs on launch and not before. I have 10 irl friends that will sub on the 27th for example.
---
Also, it's a better idea to start with a few servers to get the populations high, and then keep launching new ones to meet demand.
---
It's better than having 30+ servers at launch, having most people confused which to choose for the first couple of days.
---
Knowing how Blizz operates, I expect more servers on launch day, if not witching the first week of launch as well.
---
We are getting classic! So, personally, I am damn excited!!!
---
Yeah I’m not an RPer myself but I generally go out of my way to avoid “gamer” types - the types of people who think racial and homophobic slurs are funny
---
Pulling out the race card? No, it's not 'xenophobia'. It's because they usually aren't very good at playing the game and that's annoying in a group.

it would be a huge mistake for them to think that people who are currently subbed to retail or who resumed to fuck around on stress tests is accurately representative of how many will sub for August 27th just to play classic
---
He is 100% right. Thanks for letting us know man, I am going to be much happier on on Thalnos.
---
The true oceanic experience too, we're already an anomaly region because of how ally dominated we are
---
You joking?  I was a little older than that when I was nolifing everquest.
---
Yeah I've heard. Not sure what I'll do now
---
Grobbulus has the most readers by far on its subreddit @ 400+ vs second place is still in the hundreds
---
There really is something disingenuous about a pro-con list that has contradictory reasons. If you are going to say both, why say either?
---
huehuehuehuehehuehuehuehue
---
Us millenials are actually in our 30's.
---
All three volumes of the Chronicles are entirely about Vanilla or leading up to Vanilla.
---
The one listed has been forming for months in anticipation of RP server reveals FYI.
---
In trade chat I use VC because that's worldwide and it avoids confusion with dire Maul. In Westfall I use DM because no dire Maul group will be searching for members in Westfall.
---
What the hell is C L I L S S I C
---
I would play on a Korean pvp realm
---
Who cares about his guild filled with shitty sperg players? lol
---
Until someone makes a total twink and pwns you over and over in pvp.. even then it's ok.  I love this sht.
---
I'm going back and forth on which to play as well.  To me the lock feels calmer and more methodical(not in a bad way).  And the mage faster, kind of frantic(again, not in a bad way).  Both feel strong and capable in most situations.
---
I doubt they will choose the only rp-pvp realm
---
That was my guild.
---
Username matches the comment, that's always funny
---
Two nights a week for 3 hours is plenty of time to clear and progress current content and in phase 2 farm mc/ony as well. I wouldn't expect many leadership groups to schedule farm nights where attendance is noted for content that is 2 phases earlier, but phase 5 and 6 you probably want 3 nights a week early on anyway.  
---
Personally I'm looking for a guild that will raid 2 nights a week 2x, on alts and mains, to feed gear to mains, and 7 days a week, 2x4 hours a day for a week or two whenever new content becomes available, but I don't think it's going to exist on the oceanic realms. Anyone else who is looking for something similar hit me up.
---
It’s all about perspective
---
If you sub on the 12th what do you get? And at that point can i cancel my BFA sub?
---
Im a very rare whinger. Not a usual part of the chorus of whiney blizz haters. Don’t bitch on Reddit, the forums, or anywhere else.
---
Having thought about this for a few hours tonight, it’s pretty clear they need more servers. This just doesn’t add up. It’s impossible for them to bring these servers into phase 2 and not have queues larger than the server capacity.
---
Same. These weren’t our regular antics or anything.
---
Is possible.
---
Ok I just saw them appear in all zones after midnight 12 AM server time lol. Saved.
---
PvE servers are nice when you don't have a ton of time to play. Trying to get things done only to be corpse camped by the opposite faction can really demotivate those with stricter time constraints. Also some people are just carebears.
---
 I was on several different PvP servers on retail but more recently I've been playing on Stormrage PvE because the Alliance didn't seem like they ever wanted to fight so it was lots of just 5 on 1 gangbangs. With warmode it's a bit different now but I swapped in Legion because I remember taking a flight path and there were like 100 horde there and no Alliance because Blizzard decided to merge my server with some super horde biased servers. That was kind of the straw that broke the camels back for me.  I'll be playing on a PvP server in Classic though but PvE has it's merits.
---
Congrats on your new shaman and your divorce!
---
I've always enjoyed alliance leveling better just b/c the early zones are a lot more enjoyable and the cities (stormwind/ironforge) are a lot more aesthetically pleasing than Orgrimmar which is basically a town of mud huts. Also, NE models &gt;&gt; Tauren models, most noticeably in cat form.
---
I'm sure if you say something now they might change it.
---
We need to get blizzard to make more servers for Portuguese and spanish speakers. You can't communicate with them in game because of the language barrier, and this breeds animosity and toxicity on the forums and in game between language groups. I've seen it first hand on private servers with Chinese and english speakers.
---
brbrbrbrbr
---
Usually healers with deep points in prot for blessing of kings and improved devotion aura...
---
Yeah, report those wherever you see them, but honestly that’s a rarity on RP realms imo - WRA on retail actually has a fairly mature player base, I had some crazy deep debates and convos just in trade chat lol
---
The ones that open few days later still have like 3k players on them, or do you expect to have two servers with 10k+ on each??
---
3k pop is the estimate for the original vanilla servers
---
Then you need to also be against phases, and against the 1.10 gear not being added til later.
---
At no point in classic was both that gear unavailable and strath/scholo capped at 5 players.
---
Prevent what exactly? This is pretty childish tbh
---
Yep, that’s exactly why right click reporting should not be in classic
---
+3 for the grobmob!
---
I remember that too, and I don't have a link to the interview either. It was a pretty long time ago, perhaps around the time they first started announcing their phase system.
---
I’m trying to remember but if I had to guess it was like 60-40 tilted toward the lock using a fel hunter assuming equal skill. This of course changes when the mage is in naxx gear when they become totally broken. At that point it’s either 50/50 or maybe even slanted toward the mage if they can silence you and you don’t have the felhunter silence off cooldown.
---
The ideal is 3,000 concurrent players, not active accounts.  You will probably want like double the number of active players.  5000 active accounts ~ 3,000 active players
---
I bet their names get sniped anyway. There's only like 3 options where they will go. Snipers can use one of their 3 reservations to try and grab a streamer name. A few dozen people do that and some sniper will get it.
---
If Blizzard isn't going to reserve their names, then the next best thing would be to convince friendly viewers to try and help grab their name too. Then they can give it to the streamer at some random minute later.
---
All Blizzard had to do was reserve their names, and then everyone could quit worrying about it. Everyone could just focus on their own names on the exact server they want, right on the 12th.
---
Well, /u/ThatFunkoLife, there's your answer. Instead of standing up for your opinion, the moment you received any opposition, you rolled over and deleted the thread. That's how you ended up with Layering.
---
Messed around a bit and found that maxing the settings, but putting ground clutter to 3 and water quality to low was the best. Feels like vanilla but with better lighting and sharper textures.
---
Same. I like watching Asmongold but I don't want to see him and a gang of spergs following him around handing him gold. We all know he's gonna get carried through the raids and get items like Thunderfury and the Hand of Rag and to me, that takes away the epic feeling of seeing someone with that weapon. It kills a part of the game for me. I remember watching the vod of Soda ranting on about a blacklist in Classic. That was the moment I wanted to avoid them at all costs.
---
It's ganking not gangrape. Can be quite enjoyable to gank when the odds are against you, or to take down gankers when the it's in their favour. Like when you spot that rogue but play is cool and just have that wombo combo ready to go
---
The Bobby b life
---
HE COULD HAVE LINGERED ON THE EDGE OF THE BATTLE WITH THE SMART BOYS, AND TODAY HIS WIFE WOULD BE MAKING HIM MISERABLE, HIS SONS WOULD BE INGRATES, AND HE WOULD BE WAKING THREE TIMES IN THE NIGHT TO PISS INTO A BOWL!
---
Bobby B is that really you? Who let you out?
---
A BIT OF WINE NOW AND AGAIN, A GIRL SQUEALING IN BED, THE FEEL OF A HORSE BETWEEN MY LEGS?
---
With the little amount of servers that they announced, do you really believe layering will be around for no more than two months?
---
DO NOT pic that female dwarf in the yellow dress, ugg just hideous.
---
My motherboard died last night just after getting to level 10 :((((((
---
Why read books or go to school when you can just figure shit out on your own?
---
I think you need to calm down lol
---
Dude the difference between 10 ms and 50 ms is nothing. You will be fine.
---
i always called it DM IIRC
---
nope.avi
---
Which is odd considering it was literally always DM, never heard VC till I started on pservers.
---
Yes. Because the moment Blizzard has any indication post-launch that more servers are needed, they'll create them and offer transfers. They've already said they're prepared to do this as needed at a moment's notice.
---
100%.  Having servers slightly overpopulated is better than having people abuse layering for world boss kills.
---
The underlying issue is streamer fanboys are insufferable.
---
a great internet firewall
---
It was fixed later on in vanilla too. But originally it was bugged to hell and the guards acted weird around it too - sometimes attacking it and sometimes acting like it wasn’t there at all lol
---
My entire server used VC in early vanilla. People first did it as part of the Defias Brotherhood quest line that required you to kill Van Cleef. "Looking for group Van Cleef" turned into VC being the defacto abbreviation for Deadmines.
---
I'm sure it differed by server.
---
On the one hand, he comes off sounding like a clown. On the other hand, it probably does suck on some level to be generally unwanted by much of the community you’re going to be relying on. 
---
You can throw around the “well he has plenty of fans” but those fans probably aren’t leveling to sixty or doing anything with classic long term other than following them around.
---
Agreed... I was there and remember.
---
New phases in classic and new content in OSRS are completely different... 
---
OSRS launch would be Classic wow from phase 1 to 6; new content OSRS would be classic WoW phase 7+ if it ever happens
---
Phases releases in classic won't bring additional players, it will only bring back some players who were already playing and quit,
---
Yes. Just plugged it in to a rogue dps spreadsheet to compare with bonescraper and it's significantly better.
---
What a weird thing to get upset about.
---
How do you fish without a fishing rod?
---
With you bear hands.
---
It’s an absolute joke
---
with dynamic respawn threshold as low as it is in the starting area, it's still more effective to just stay in the initial zone imo
---
Nah people called it VC in Vanilla. US - Frostmourne
---
20k people when layering gets turned off in phase two... 17 hour queues here we come
---
There isn't a location on the East Coast that gets 10ms to Chicago and 50ms to Los Angeles, but thanks for playing.
---
I see. Thank you for your rapid response Bobby B.
---
Link it? I don't see him saying anything specific about whether they're playing east/west
---
I ASK YOU, NED, WHAT GOOD IS IT TO WEAR A CROWN?
---
lol for real, I played everything up through Cata or so on 160ms. 50ms is dreamboat material
---
Dwarf priest is best priest.
---
I played on Ragnaros for a solid year and hated it
---
Name reservations for launch servers open the 12th. You will need to keep your BFA sub active as it is one shared subscription for both games.
---
Whitemane as in High Inquisitor Sally Whitemane, the once boss of SM Cathedral and later resurrected as one of the Four Horseman of the Ebon Blade.
---
Not the person you asked, but: 
---
Name reservation is on August 13 (or August 12 depending on your timezone). You can click on the date/time link in the server list announcement post to see the time: [US post](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-realm-names-and-types/246645) / [EU post](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-realm-names-and-types/246645) (same difference, just wanted to throw both links there). 
---
You don't need a separate subscription, the same one that allows you to play retail/BFA will let you play Classic as well.
---
Nope died to him once.
---
Guessing that guard got you before you could even miss your punch.
---
Gold in osrs and rs3 have two very different values as well.
---
Love it!

I’ve heard different things from different sources. The latest source I saw was that we were getting original loot tables...so maybe stuff like viskag is not available - on the other hand I know only t2 legs will drop from rag...so...that conflicts and I can’t imagine there being no chest from major domo...
---
It’s definitely all over the place it seems.
---
Upset? No. It was a fleeting consideration at best. Not a single person in the guild is upset we won't be rolling on Grobbulus. None of us is really the type to get upset at such frivolous things.
---
I cannot wait to see a filled up Ironforge again.
---
&gt;It's not hating Brazilians or any ethnicities, it's the language barrier when playing. I dont want to be on a server with non English speaking players, because you can't communicate with them, and I'm sure other groups feel this way against other language speakers etc. I've gone through on private servers with the Chinese, and it's not enjoyable. Again, nothing against Brazilians, it's just the language barrier
---
That's one reason i really understand and i have no problem with that
---
It's the same sub for both.
---
Nice to see you again beard.  Will take your advice and forgo heart of the mountain to concentrate on engineering.
---
Ganking a funeral? Just sick of the OMG LAYERING WILL RUIN CLASSIC all the time.
---
Don’t play the game you whiny little bitch, my God does everyone just have a bunch of pent up anger over Blizzard, throwing hissy fits like little five year olds over a game this company has practically bent over backwards for to make for their community? I thought this would be a civilized thread but man the backlash is embarrassing. It would be funny to see Blizzard pull the plug just to upset you more!
---
This should be seen by everyone on this thread.
---
When I last looked, there was next to no guild recruitment on the discord linked in the OP. On the other hand, the one /u/Presenex linked has numerous guild recruiting in it. In addition, /u/Presenex discord link appears to focus more on guild and server collaboration, then straight up RP. Where as the original seems to be RP focus. So in my opinion they currently do serve separate purposes.
---
You're wrong. It was Deadmines since day 1 and always has been. It's not "Dire Maul" since Deadmines was there way before that. Always said DM always have. Never met anyone during retail that said "Lets do VC!"
---
Hopefully you all land on Herod. A fittingly makes server for it, no doubt.
---
I just want you to know I see what you're doing and appreciate it
---
Jesus
---
Im just happy that we're even getting vanilla servers...
---
Christ
---
Doesn’t matter, only the streamers and private server guilds are getting it
---
If this girl was able to be around for her own funeral she'd have cherished how it played out.

Thicc
---
It is Xenophobia and I'm a white American.
---
Saying it's not, they just all suck.... It's considerably racist.
---
Most wow players suck, especially in vanilla and again in Classic.  It's so obvious that they suck from wipes or other retarded stuff they do.  White Americans aren't immune to sucking hard at WoW. 
---
It's like all hunters are huntards.  Except there's plenty of really good ones.  You just don't see them because they're in high demand, they have good groups, or they're being invited to join others like them.
---
The good Brazilian players won't randomly pug with you.  So your opinion of a whole country of people is based on the ones who can't get a group and just join yours instead.  Those aren't the cream of the crop my friend no matter their country of origin.
---
The good ones are off being good without your ass in their party.

I’m sure blizz has reasoning; they have years of population data.
---
Based on appeal to authority?  lol.  It's based on Capitalism.  End of story.
---
Demon Hunter obviously
---
I remember Rag was a test of how good your mages actually were.
---
Also being a healer for that fight was intense, I remember one of the pots I used for mana would give me so much mana but at the cost of my character being asleep for x amount of seconds
---
Yes there is apparently a 10 hour window after the first person does it. I have seen that cited several places so it is probably correct. Given how long and complex the quest chain is to get to that point it is unlikely that more than a few would get it.
---
I guess theoretically if the entire server collaborated and everyone held off hitting the gong until everyone had completed the quest chain you could have everyone on the server get the mount so I don't think there is a fixed limit... just one of practicality.
---
Certain websites like  [https://willitclassic.com/addons](https://willitclassic.com/addons)  are collecting addons that work with the Classic client, but I've only got a few and think one of them came from the Twitch/Curse thing.  You just download the .zip instead of trying to install it through them.
---
Once you've run the game once there should be an addon folder in the game's directory.  You just put the unzipped folders in it.
---
I've played on plenty of pservers, just like most people on this sub.
---
We asked blizz for vanilla servers, it took them a while, but they're giving them to us.
---
If you don't like how they're going about it, that's too bad, cant please everyone.
---
If you think you know more about launching huge multiplayer games than blizz, maybe you should try applying for a job there
---
You can check [WillitClassic](https://willitclassic.com/). Just download addons from the sources listed there and extract them to \World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns
---
Wowhead says it is an ability only the quest pet has and cannot be found/trained any other way :(
---
Exactly.  He's basing his opinion on pugging with randoms who couldn't get a group on their own.  Not exactly a good representation of the playerbase no matter which ethnicity.
---
EU is getting 5 PVP realms, just like NA, even though your playerbase is smaller. Just because you voted for Brexit doesn't mean anyone else cares.
---
I stopped reading after you stated you already have a boyfriend. But pick a mage so you can make me food
---
Its a ruse!
---
Are you saying that /r/classicwow doesn't need gay fanfiction? Bold statement.
---
🤣🤣🤣 dead ass
---
I am rolling together with over 60 people and many guilds are doing the same. The moment the first character is lvl 2 we'll already be locked into a server so hard that we cannot possibly switch servers simply because of the logistics required to coordinate so many people. 
---
What's so hard to understand about that?
---
Yeah, all streamers [totally](https://clips.twitch.tv/ProtectiveCheerfulCaterpillarKeyboardCat) accept handouts and crap.
---
The strest test is open till Monday. Hop on and play around to see what you like. You can level to 15 I believe.
---
Kind of goes without saying by this point
---
Inb4 they choose Grobbulus
---
Exactly. If some dork is butthurt enough about something as silly as jumping the line for a quest item to put me on their little blacklist they're doing me a favor anyway.
---
You guys don't realize that eventually every server will become a streamer server, as people who have worked their butts off to build an audience will eventually critically mass and have a gorillion lil zoomers running around doing their bidding.
---
&gt; EU is getting 5 PVP realms, just like NA, even though your playerbase is smaller. Just because you voted for Brexit doesn't mean anyone else cares.
---
You think EU playerbase is smaller than NA? What pot you smoking?
---
He had the biggest guild during the classic beta. A lot of the community congregated in his discord. There was good info about bugs and working add-ons. None of it from him of course.
---
This is a list of servers at launch, not ~2 months after launch. Blizzard has already stated they'll be ready to add realms as needed with free transfers at a moment's notice.
---
Jajajajajajajajaja
---
Besides the cool axe and armor and all the muscles, this is totally me.
---
Streamers
---
I tried that and the realms were offline! Heart broken 💔
---
Looks great man. Will def be using this!
---
&gt; This is a list of servers at launch, not ~2 months after launch. Blizzard has already stated they'll be ready to add realms as needed with free transfers at a moment's notice.

Learn to read my entire post.
---
what does APES mean?
---
How dense are you, m8? He's tired of people harassing him so he's talking shit back at them. Don't take him seriously.
---
I don't even watch the guy and I can tell that's the case.
---
...it's LITERALLY an RPG.
---
PVP has always been more populated in general.
---
My Settings for the Previous stress test were still on for this one I was astonished I didnt have to turn on instant quest text again.
---
It just fucks up the entire server. Huge population means queue times, lag, competition for resources, instability (if a streamer quits or moves servers the fanboys will follow and leave a server dead), massive faction imbalance, etc... The list goes on.
---
The ONE positive is that streamers like to host events, such as duel tourneys, which I agree have the potential to be fun, but would only be a one time interest for someone like me to experience, so it is heavily outweighed by the negatives.
---
But hey, if you really love pepememes and being layered with so many people you can't actually play, knock yourself out .
---
&gt;If I remember, some of them caught bans for this 
---
Whoever told you that is flat out lying. There was nothing bannable about it. They were on a PVP server in a contested zone. Was it shitty to do? Eh, kinda? But it was also a widely advertised event on a well known PVP server that easily could have been done in a number of NON-contested zones. They basically set themselves up to be attacked and then got pissed off when it happened.
---
From rags to riches.

[628,727 players seen in the last 30 days](http://www.warcraftrealms.com/realmstats.php) versus [444,266 players seen in the last 30 days](http://www.warcraftrealms.com/eu_realmstats.php). Any speculation that Europe will have a larger proportion of players returning to Classic than any other region is foolish.
---
Probably somebody who devotes themselves to their Guild and their friends
---
you may be right, but I was just asking out of curiosity because IMO its one of the hardest to obtain mounts of all time
---
It's only the bear you get for the quest, that "tame" item doesn't actually tame the pet but just gives you control over the NPC for 10 minutes, that's why it keeps it's abilities.  
---
When you attempt to tame the pet once you learn how to tame, it will not have this ability anymore.
---
It's missing a French option for NA. Quebecers are people too!
---
America has been making some of the best beer in the world for like a decade now you toothless serf

Wow, racist much?
---
Gonna be honest thought this was gonna say get the Skyrim add-on now
---
Someone mind linking the horde version for those of us who missed it?
---
pissweiser
---
That would honestly explain a lot , some of them can be geared as fuck but give like zero effort in fights rofl
---
No... I'm not Australian. /r/woooosh
---
Every prot warrior creating their own guild seems to think that they'll be getting it
---
Jesus Christ how fucking jealous are you
---
You mean this?
---
&gt; It will also make the name reservation useless if you're adding post-launch servers. 
---
Because that just shows how simple-minded you are. They could allow transfers from the overpopulated realm to the new realm *before* enabling character creation, allowing everyone to keep their name.
---
Have some respect, it's called Seal of Casino
---
I thought it was wotlk
---
You must mean the guide this post is about? I can read that you have composed another guide on another forum on how to install WoW, itself. Is that the guide you mean?
---
I have added the outcome of that command, like you stated in the guide.
---
I'm not by my computer now, but I can provide screenshots and the output later.
---
I'm running Ubuntu 18.04.

Depends on your level and the state of the economy.  Def not 30 mins of farming for the first couple weeks.

It has a lot to do with it.

It is a dumb question.

No.
---
&gt; 628,727 players seen in the last 30 days versus 444,266 players seen in the last 30 days. Any speculation that Europe will have a larger proportion of players returning to Classic than any other region is foolish.
---
You dumb or? press "overall" on EU, many realms with no info. Compare the green and yellow between NA, EU, for "snapshots". yikes
---
Were my numbers wrong? No. Did I make an argument for why they're relevant? Yes. Have you done anything but whine and make baseless accusations providing no real evidence? Obviously.
---
I think it would be ~10,000:1.
---
This will undoubtedly happen between players behinds closed doors but I don’t see it being spammed in trade chat for some time; depending how well classic does.
---
I've yet to seen where Quebec is rolling but I've seen a 1000+ ppl Facebook group
---
Has anyone been able to get the "cooldown" option in Leatrix Plus to work?
---
When someone rings the gong and large scale server event where the qijrai/ old god minion things invade Azeroth occurs for 10 hours. Anyone who bangs the gong during that time gets the mount and title. Feasibly speaking if people actually collaborate to bang the gong at a time that is convenient to everyone doing the quest a few people can get the mount. 
---
The quest has quite a few road blocks to allowing situations where entire guilds can get the mount. Namely most of the difficult shit to obtain is one per kill. So typically only 1-3 people per guild can feasibly get it unless everyone’s extremely fucking patient. On top of that to even get to the point where you are given the quest to assemble the scepter you need to engage in just about the most dull long and ridiculous rep grind that has ever existed in wow.
---
That's what I'm saying. Even if classic has a million players that's still less than 20k per server. 11 servers is enough
---
3-4 days a week?! More like 1-2 days. Effort and dedication are not needed to clear any content in Vanilla. Maybe in 2005 but now with guides and add-ons phase 1 raids can be cleared by 20 man and higher tier raids are a breeze. Tanks dual wield to keep up with aggro, healers never run out of mana down ranking. After 6 months of MC you'll be running it to gear alts.
---
Great point on the summoning stone.... Yeah I know about Righteous Fury but is that enough to keep a back stabbing Rogue from pulling aggro? I’m concerned as well for Warlock because I know I’ll be competing with the mages and priests for gear end game as well.
---
Where did you read that? Because on the official post I can see 2 PVP "english" realms for Europe.
---
PANTS OF TIGHT!
---
Fuck trump
---
I don't get this logic. There are 25 total realms? They had shit odds of not getting sniped in the first place. All it takes is 25 people trying to take their name out of the tens of thousands that will be coming back.
---
Yes, I do. I just understand that experience as largely irrelevant to Classic. Blizzard is capable of much more than Private Servers ever were. No Private Server ever had Layering. No Private Server ever had this large an audience. No Private Server ever had players paying $15 a month.
---
You're cute
---
People are bitching even when streamers are trying to help the community out. Unbelievable. They don't have to do ANY of this shit.
---
Lol EU but no Dutch?
---
&gt;I love Asmond but I'll 100% be rolling on the same server as him
---
&gt;just for the chance at fucking with his fans
---
So you fuck with yourself? I mean chose one fangirl.
---
No worse players in the game than the Brazilians.  I feel bad for any poor fucker that accidentally chooses that server.  Talk about a HORRIBLE experience.
---
Blow me you ex
---
Pvp
---
OP never mentioned English. He said EU. Germany alone makes up 20% of the EU WoW playerbase.
---
Ok, first things first, your using "gamemoded -s" while the blizzard launcher is open correct?  Can you also try this with Steam and the alternate start command and see if game mode works?
---
You seem cool, don’t come to zandalar tomorrow.
---
It would be nice if the high/medium/low label for servers indicated what it was for each faction
---
Wow amazing
---
Thank you, horde scum.
---
it aint you're right XD  I was thinking between all realsm but thats more like 40k or so
---
I call bullshit, why would people abreviate this one dungeon after the end boss, especially when Dire Maul wasn't even a thing during vanilla beta?
---
I am US but I hopped on the Oceania server by accident, went from 50ms ping to 350ms ping.
---
No. At this rate they're acting like dicks, toying with people who just want to play on a community not filled with cultish streamer fans, instead of just saying what server they're going to play on.
---
The last thing they deserve is to have any recognizable name.
---
&gt; Were my numbers wrong? No. Did I make an argument for why they're relevant? Yes. Have you done anything but whine and make baseless accusations providing no real evidence? Obviously.
---
I already told you it was wrong...
---
Fucking yikes.
---
&gt; vThere won't be any queues or overpopulation thanks to Layering. Just make sure all the necessary overflow realms are launched by Phase 2.
---
oh like the stresstest yesterday then? lol absolute moron
---
Even if Germany have their own server I can bet most of them would want to go on the English one. At least in retail most local servers are like that.
---
RNG passive.

You right it is taste, and na has iconic names but not cool ones, if i was eu youd def see me on golemagg that sounds bad ASS
---
i mean if youre L10 or something it's really not a big deal. but honestly they'd probably just allow you to transfer the char(s)
---
Jaja
---
They can add realms during name reservation period up until launch depending on demand...
---
That's not exactly encouraging.
---
Either the streamer accepts the gift and gets geared faster than the average player.
---
Or he throws away valuable items.  What if the gift is made from Devilsaur Leather, Black Lotus, etc?  Should he throw those away too?
---
After the first person rings the gong there is a 10 hour period where anyone else who has finished the chain can also ring it for the Black Qiraji mount. After that 10 hour period people can still ring it to finish the chain (you get an amazing healing dagger!) but will no longer receive the mount. 
---
Just a fair warning you won't actually get a title for it. The Scarab Lord title wasn't added until TBC.

Although I am going to be playing primarily on a US server (reconnecting with old guildies) I am excited for the prospect of having alts on the OCE servers. Trying out the stress test seeing the difference in latency was jaw dropping. US server was around \~170-180ms and the OCE server was &lt;4ms consistently. I don't even know how to play with such low latency!
---
A good guild is going to give the cloth upgrades to Paladins and Shamans, while Priests and Druids will get their tier sets. Only major competition is for rings, trinkets, etc.
---
You won't have a problem getting "good enough" epics in every slot. The best of the best items (Rejuvenating Gem) will be reserved for only a few healers per guild, though.
---
You can still spam dungeons, it just takes though and effort. You also actually use and want the items in there

Thanks for the input goodluck to you finding graveyard raiders!

Level a warrior as they suck to solo and do decent damage, tank end game
---
I can't escape BfA.
---
And it doesn't even have anything to where they took the game in the recent 5 years
---
That was a problem specific to the launch of the global pre-test. Of course an entire continent forced onto 3 realms at exactly the same time is going to cause issues. And that's exactly what they wanted to test!
---
Taste the edge of thine ax knave!
---
Really ? Thamn I guess haven't seen that. My bad then. Let's hope everyone calm down. Let's not forget the community win classic. See you in a zeroth.
---
Here's hoping it's an even ratio for some fucking epic punch ons!
---
Language barrier mostly
---
9/10. Would of been 10/10 if the night elf was dancing on a mailbox
---
Yeah, I hate to say it but I agree. It's wayyy better to launch with too few realms than too many. You don't want people to log in and it seem empty on some realms, kills the hype.
---
I really want to know what the ratio of horde and alliance is going to be
---
no thanks, i'll remain a fan of his and still troll his desperate band of followers in-game.
---
The same was true in vanilla the dropoff rate was crazy. I think WoW had 100 mil accounts made in vanilla and only like 3 mil actual subs
---
Arigato.
---
Thanks!  Yes there's an auto hide when not in group  setting there.
---
Bacon Monster Munch was the best. I think it got banned cos of all the E numbers unfortunately.
---
Gotta get that best in spot level 15 gear.
---
level 15 isn't worth much to figure out what you want to play..
---
I mean... I played vanilla and we called it dm.. because diremaul wasn't released yet so no reason to call it VC.. I'm started to just guess each server called shit differently at the time.
---
As a druid, is it easier to deal with Shaman's (as Alliance) or with Paladin's (as Horde)?
---
That’s some mental gymnastics if I’ve ever seen some. 
---
Classic WOW blew away competition in 2004, was the biggest thing on the planet in 2005 but you put your Fox News level spin on it.

---
What in the world makes you trust 2019 blizzard devs, genuinely curious
---
This is what most people don’t seem to realize. It is way better to start with too few servers with vast amounts of layers, then gauging the population drop projection and setting up new free transfer realms from each of the servers.
---
Let’s say Golemagg has 50k players 1 month into launch, with data projecting 30k after 6 months. Blizzard can set up 10 new realms with free transfers from Golemagg ONLY, allowing for 5k population with light queueing initially, then hitting a more stable almost full population after 6 months, which is ideal.
---
No Sargeras?  Archimonde ?
---
Did I technically just get gnomed?
---
As long as you named yourself BasicCampfire I'm sure they'll accept you.
---
Flag carry? Druid
---
Heal warriors? Pally.
---
It's the exact representation of the player base he would see in Classic though.
---
Ty for this. My server always used VC and now theres some proof of it existing lol
---
I get the feeling kr players are like oce players, in that they are both heavily pvp oriented. Oce's pve realm will be basically dead right away with the survey and all previous surveys showing 70%+ pvp pop, 87% on the last one. 
---
Why would they not at least poll a pvp/pve baseline if they are only giving 1 server...
---
It's not a rumor. It's confirmed from the Portuguese forums and Facebook groups.
---
No... It wouldn't.
---
Aaah, 60% of EU players will roll on 20% of the servers, gonna be fun
---
Hey! I help manage that location! I had no idea that Equinox was hosting the stress test. i wonder if the other WoW servers are there too...
---
//flashbacks of calling Time Warner Cable NOC for the inside scoop when my home internet would go down
---
What a pos you are.
---
I honestly think this streamer shit is being overblown and don’t understand what the big deal is.
---
Wouldn’t the default be one pvp server and one pve? Korea’s population is twice that of Australia and we got one of each (I don’t think that’s enough) something seems a bit off....
---
Shaman can purge Druid HoTs/buffs, while Paladin's couldn't catch a druid if they tried...
---
You're not going to reserve your name?
---
Scared the shit out of me once.  For some reason my Voidwalker went into combat when I was near a bridge to cross the water and I walked over to it and nearly fell into the water and that was when I saw it.
---
Yeah it did great, had millions of subs but still an awful retention rate of around 3% at the peak of MMO fever.
---
It would be detrimental to his job if he didn't stream
---
To give some insight, most of the real RP stuff comes out of California / the west. (Not WoW specifically) which is likely why they chose to place the server there, if they gave any thought to it.
---
Sadly, the east coast doesn’t have such a big scene. (I really wish it did, as it’s where I’m at)
---
Nope, so far no PvP server has been announced. Koreans on Inven crying really hard about it.
---
Asmon’s followers are the biggest threat.
---
LOL 
---
Ok retail classic was a failure, you got me.
---
I thought they confirmed that 8 is basically the cap and it puts you at the minimum glancing blow reduction (5%) compared to 15% at 5 skill.
---
You sound like a complete and utter tool and your 'people' sound like a bunch of petty immature children. Do us all a favor and roll on a private server.
---
East, aka Chicago.
---
Wow players then vs. now
---
He will play for a few weeks, then the population will tank....... Which is a good thing since we have too few pvp servers
---
I cant wait to use detect traps agai....
---
I hope you're right. The beta got massive interest on Twitch though, so I just feel its better to be safe and try and avoid if it isnt inconvenient.
---
That’s got to be grossly inadequate, I’m really sorry, make lots and lots of noise about it.
---
Yeah BFA UI for Classic addon buddy
---
Yeah thanks, that was it. The 2.0 patch made feral absolutely insane.
---
Layering is done by zone, so you'd still know everyone you just would not see them all at the same time across the entire planet... Which is impossible anyway
---
Just out of curiosity why do people believe streamers and their followers are going to detract from their experience?
---
Is it possible that you could open up Horde based channels and let the faction choice be a role check since you have such a great setup already? Like lfg_alliance, lfg_horde as well as guild_recruitment_alliance, guild_recruitment_horde. Perhaps members ranks can be divided by horde / alliance allegiance to make it extra apparent who belongs to what faction. 
---
Would be awesome to have the whole server on one Discord, where server wide events can be planned. Organized open world PvP, guild battles, and anything that can be fun for both factions :)
---
I'll see you see him, seeing him.
---
He could stream something else, or work a regular 9/5 job.  Nobody is forcing him to stream classic or stream at all.  If he doesn't want to play a game where half the community dislikes him then he should probably do something else with his life.
---
Hope your day gets better man.
---
1.7 was the biggest one.  I don't think they were viable then, but until that pt feral was a complete joke spec.  This was the patch they got a lot of buffs, including agility giving them 1 atk power.  But they got more buffs every single big patch until tbc.
---
It wasnt a failure, obv not. But no where near the numbers of 2004 are coming back for classic. Maybe the game breaks 1 mil for a month or so. By 6 months game’ll prob be 250-500k range
---
Did it take me like 13 years to realize that the design on the summoning stone is an eye?
---
The chance for Crushing Blows is very readily information and something private servers got right. Bosses mobs 3 levels above you have a 15% chance to Crush somebody who can't push Crushes off the hit table. We know this because Crush chance is a static thing based off of levels, meaning that boss mobs in BC had equal Crush chance to mobs in Vanilla.
---
I disagree.
---
Why not get shotm and then drop ench for eng?
---
you need to realise that in Vanilla, some servers genuinly called it VC -- it was never DM for us
---
I'm not on board with staysafe after his discord stuff.
---
This is true, especially if they have played private servers a lot. I think it will be neat for those looking to ride that wave.
---
They wouldn't harass him if him and his goon squad didn't treat this like LeBron with "The Decision". Just say the fucking server you're gonna play on and be done with it. Everybody knows Blizzard is going to bend over backwards and allow them to have their own names on whichever server they choose.
---
diabeetus
---
Well, Blizzard kind of confirmed at Chinajoy they want each realm to have up to 10k concurrent players *after* Layering is disabled. So Golemagg having 50k total players one month in might need just one overflow realm.
---
Oh man lets feed that ego.
---
What?  The shaman tier sets are quite good....
---
What the fuck is wrong with Blizzard?
---
All your comments about how you and "all your people" dislike and are *annoyed by* the west coast and all the people who live there makes you seem awfully prejudiced against millions of people for seemingly no reason.
---
Do you hate them because it's liberal country? Or do you hold some grief over west coast vs east coast mentality?
---
Either way acting prejudice against an entire group of people based on their geography makes you seem prejudiced and prejudiced people tend to be immature insecure children who never learned the concept of tolerance.
---
For me he was just extremely annoying leading up to classic about the most ridiculous #nochanges stuff. He was upset about bnet integration because of possible collusion, even asked the devs in an interview about it. Yet he and his friends hold cross faction events. Afaik he’s never played retail vanilla either just pserver.
---
Mages could
---
Can someone with knowledge of how addons work tell me if [PvPLog](https://willitclassic.com/view/fDOPrZn4FfKMbw76AigK) works? I loved this addon and miss it greatly! I hope it works come classic.
---
Mining BS Armorsmith
---
A little misleading. You're not using the default settings for classic. The shading changes when you enable dynamic shadows instead of the original blob shadows (lowest setting) 
---
Ambient occlusion also doesn't enable if using the lowest shadow setting.
---
Scholo and UBRS were the only raid instances... Rest for 5 mans and also for classic, phases are not patches. We are running 1 version, 1.12.
---
because they're all individual humans with their own agenda and desires? lol some of you guys are unhinged over mUh stream man bad
---
!remindme in 16 hours
---
Hm? I wasn't making any political statements. I was just saying that it's going to be a bunch of crazy memes. I play Starcraft 2, and all people shout all day is MAGA and other crazy stuff. I wasn't trying to be political, I was just saying that it's going to be some /pol/ level stuff.
---
Sorry if that broke the rules.
---
I played a rogue back in vanilla and had no issue ambushing and even back stabbing targets while moving. You see back in the day you actually had to get behind the target to backstab them...
---
At this point I think they want Classic to fail horrifically.
---
No type of advertising, small numbers of servers, etc. nothing here is telling me that they want it be successful.
---
It’ll fail and they’ll say, “see you didn’t want it. Come back to retail, we know what you want.”
---
I want the world to bathe in the glory that is our savior, [Grobb](https://i.imgur.com/Uwm0cBm.png).

---
Definately not enough pvp servers and awfull-bad-sht server names.
---
First, we don't hate anyone. And we're not prejudice against anyone. We just don't like the difference in culture, especially in several of the career fields most of us work in. There's nothing wrong with preferring one place over another. You're thinking about this all wrong. We see East versus West as similar to say... Alliance versus Horde. The decision is entirely personal and has no real consequence on anyone else.
---
How can I filter it to just see Alliance/Horde ratios for Oceanic servers
---
I don’t think you realize that people will be coming out of the wood works for launch day. I think only 4 of us subbed to play the stress test, while the other 26 of my friends didn’t sub or play....
---
this is incredible
---
If you know what they mean when someone says VC then it's doing its job. VC and DM are both right.
---
Put on the damn dress and heal
---
Could you tell us how you made this in After Effects?
---
Great stuff, thanks for your effort!
---
The only thing it shows is that there are more people enjoying retail right now in na but even then, alot of servers on the eu side that you linked didn't have any players recorded so there are alot of missing stats from those realms.
---
Without layering those 100 servers of yours would be almost empty in 1 month. With the dynamic of layering you don't have to merge servers down the road because there is constant "merging" of player bases because nobody is bound to a layer.
---
It wasn't in the mail. It was directly in my inventory
---
Can confirm that if you use 8.2.10 (Retail) version instead of 8.2.7 (Classic), you can keybind properly.
---
I was an extremely hated person because I started the event at 3am in the morning. Massive forums lists calling me out. I was just high.
---
&gt; We just don't like the difference in culture, especially in several of the career fields most of us work in.
---
So you don't want to be around *those people.*
---
I think they have a word for that? Oh yeah, it's called "prejudiced".
---
I was born and raised on the East coast and fly back a few times a year but I've lived on the West coast for several years.
---
There is not that big of a difference between the two or the people or the jobs for that matter.
---
cant use shadowmeld in bear.  tried it today.
---
I think it only matters for the big streamers like asmon and toolie
---
Engineering is a pretty much must for pvp and super useful in pve but you can wait til endgame. I usually go herb engineering
---
They are seriously expecting like a 99% dropout rate....
---
Yes, but not 200,000 missing stats. And there's really no argument to say that NA prefers BFA over EU. Look at the regional stats for any global mainstream game. NA always has the larger base.
---
We wouldn't get that stuff today. TBC was like the make-up expansion for Druids (and Hunters and Warlocks). "Sorry you sucked for most of the last 2 years, but now you can fly!"
---
The new ones that the overwhelming demand will necessitate! !!!（╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
---
You guys think streamers will get whitelisted through launch day queues? I can't see everyone sitting at queues on launch day in the Twitch directory.
---
My group of 4 checking in Grobmob :D
---
From what Beard pointed out and I have read shotm is for main tanks and they are basically unused for raids as MT.  Threat is more important at that point for off tank. With solid equipment I can tank any 60 dungeon without it to get my pre raid BiS.  So I might as well enjoy jumper cables and grenades while leveling.
---
I am glad that even streamers understand this issue, and because of that they are going to pick one realm where they all gonna play. 
---
I guess we are all just humans, except you. 🤷‍♀️
---
Is this open to everyone or do you have to be invited?
---
I cannot seem to find the download for it.
---
You might need to rename the folder downloaded from github to `ClassicCodex` for it to work or simply download it from curseforge.
---
For the quests you previously completed, theres nothing you can do about it for now apart from outleveling those quests. I found a WoW API function to check for completed quests and ill try to implement it before stress test ends
---
Dude I miss boy meets world
---
Na, it's just a meme
---
Also as a hybrid I will likely wind up healing anyway.
---
Time to stop cultivating and start harvesting!
---
I wasn't improving on it; just continuing the new poem :D
---
*hhhhnnnnggggg*
---
On the beta it let me switch the clock to my own time zone 🤣😂😅
---
No. We have guild members working for both parties and many that don't pay attention to national politics at all. The banter is half the fun. I obviously can't speak for everyone, but our conversations about East versus West usually have very little to do with political ideology.
---
And in any case, there's nothing wrong with disagreeing with a region's politics and preferring your own region's politics.
---
It says there are 130+ responses now and it still shows 100% Spanish. I voted English and even double checked to make sure I picked the right option so it's definitely not 100%. 
---
Am I just reading it wrong or does it take a little while for the results to update? Thanks!!
---
Yea expecting to smith your own lionheart helm is a fool's errand. I'm the guild blacksmith of a raid guild and there's a 99% chance someone else will craft mine.
---
Yay a fellow Stormreaver-er.

i've been in his guild for about 10 years now and he has always been a nice dude. whats wrong with him?

Grobbulus is where its going down you can check the subredit here.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Grobbulus/
---
Which one though?
---
So far they have seemed like they just really want a good server, and they have arranged it pretty well.
---
If they didn't so it, I or someone else would. Atm I'm just happy because I wouldn't have the time really.
---
Have. The word you're looking for is have.
---
All the gear you have equipped and has an on use effect can be used while in form

Layering till re-re-release 2030.
---
Definitely don't go Blacksmithing if your goals are to "not waste a lot while you raid and pvp".
---
I would decide how serious you are about pvp. Alchemy actually saves and makes you money. Not only are the mats for potions generally cheaper than the potions themselves, but as a warrior, you will want the arcanite transmutes without even needing to find a buyer for them. You do not need any end game rare recipes for alchemy to be a good skill.
---
Engineering on the other hand, is the opposite. It's better than alchemy. You will be a more effective character. You will not only have grenades, but you will be able to make the BOP stuff which is useful in both pve and pvp. But you will spend money doing it.
---
Honestly, I would decide how much farming you are willing to do. If you are willing to farm a LOT, take engineering, as you will be more powerful for having it. 
---
If you are not willing to farm a lot, take herb/alch as it will make and save you money doing the stuff you need to do anyways (like craft FAP/elixir of fortitude and acquire arcanite bars) and it is generally considered more profitable at endgame to herb than to mine. 
---
I would not go blacksmithing as you describe yourself. Blacksmithing is not nearly as commodified: you don't meet guys who have the gold to buy your goods outright, as much as you have a guy who barely scraped up the combination of mats and money to meet you in person to make something. And you will drink a lot more money in potions than you will save in crafting your own arcanite gear over the life of any serious raider/pvper (Which you are going to need to be anyways to craft any meaningful blacksmithed gear. Lionheart helm is not free).
---
Actually better than all the others tbh.
---
Tips the scamming d bag :)
---
female night elf boob physics.  enough said
---
I don't understand this consensus.. "Zero interaction" and "Passive" and "No abilities just seals"
---
We press buttons - our character uses seals and judgments - they hit harder. We're still using cooldowns, abilities and rotations. The only difference is that the damage applies on our auto attacks, not a backflip animation. That doesn't make it less interactive :P
---
FTH!
---
In the episode Sons of Witches there's a location there called Sentinal Hill. I don't know of any other media which uses the name and I wonder if it was inspired by WoW too. Though I admit the possibility of this being a direct WoW reference could be low
---
You better not use Discord then. And you better not be using any add-ons that weren't developed during vanilla. I want you to pretend and you want everyone else to pretend and it's 2004
---
Not disputing this, but how did incurring millions in debt move him to dedicate all his time playing wow? Shouldn’t he be trying to get a real job?
---
They get everything translated to german/french AND their tv shows are dubbed. I'd be about 10x worse in english if they did that in my country.
---
Looking at total characters ever created shows there are 6% more characters created on na than eu but does that really warrant giving english speaking eu only 2 pvp realms? Having two whole servers for french is insane and they will 100% not be able to maintain a  healthy population on those realms. But hopefully when people create characters on the 13th then blizzard can see if anything needs adapting.
---
While it is likely there will be more servers announced and launched between August 26th and whatever day Phase 2 begins, I do not think it's likely that more servers will be announced before August 26th unless some invisible super collection of players decided *not* to subscribe 4 days early for the Global Pre-test and will only subscribe for name reservation.
---
No, your just ignoring the fact it was stated they were guaranteed not to be on these two. They haven’t decided.
---
You get a server and you get a server and you get a server
---
Hey man, got some links for this? I tried googling but didnt find much.
---
Seems like your reasons are pretty asinine and childish to me and your group sounds like a bunch of tools. Best of luck to you in finding a server that wants to deal with your sort.
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/xeYzahc.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/xeYzahc.jpg)
---
Are there also addons that block it?
---
"Just don't play what you want to play 4Head " 
---
"Just get a real job 4Head" 
---
These are the same things people tell other streamers when they're playing a game where its possible to be harassed by other players but they WANT to play the game. Do you realize how unfair you sound?
---
Link don't work
---
bad player or not. waiting on someone to run from the gy sux ass.  I have even seen runs called off due to respawns.
---
DUDE not many people are interested in classic, only noobs who can't handle modern wow.
---
I doubt they'll even be anywhere near full.,
---
With that quest chain a 10 hour window is basically a 5 second window without collaboration. There were many servers in vanilla where "collaboration" happened and then the first person just did it anyway. 
---
God that whole event was such amazing drama every step of the way.
---
Also nowdays servers can hold more people.
---
A real job makes it much more difficult to dodge credit liens and wage garnishments. ;-)
---
It’s been a while but I vaguely recall this is how we did it in vanilla too.
---
Neither does your brain.
---
I have my best memories with 5 man dungeons.  As gear gets better, you can do more and more creative, fun things.  It was so incredibly fun 2 manning scholomance.
---
:) and you have my vote for warlock. I never really got Into them during retail but I rolled one on a private server and I really enjoyed it. They provide a ton of utility with your duo leveling and good dps, and become top tier with AQ gear.
---
I have everything maxed except for water.
---
Life must be hard for you.
---
You're*
---
Doesn't
---
I agree with this. We are going to have the same problem on the NA servers with the Spanish/Portuguese players on 1 of the 3 English pvp servers and the other 1 of 3 will be streamers. Not looking to great.
---
They won't remove layering until Phase 2 if I recall correctly. So I wouldn't say they're lying I would say you're not listening
---
Does not*
---
It's completely fair, and who gives a fuck if it isn't.  They chose this "career".

2? It's 4 euro PvP servers.

Good bot. Wait a minute...
---
Tbh I’m fine with this.
---
But no dutch server, language is really immersion breaking and is kinda cringy looking.

Too many role playing enthusiast trying to force people into queing for lines ; disgusting

&gt; if they decide to add more in the near future and we're forced to move, then said reservations will (for many) have been in vain.
---
Boohoo.
---
I have been nothing but respectful and civil in my conversation with you, not once choosing to attack you or insulting your home. In comparison, every one of your comments has been distasteful and full of hate. There is no question which of the two of us any community would prefer.
---
I have no interest in those names but they most likely do. I would be pretty pissed if my names were taken and so I’m not sharing them or using them on the test. Them announcing their server is the same as publishing to the world that you can become famous by stealing this name.
---
Yes! Thank you so much! I have to admit for all that writing I got on and played around and Warlock was the most fun one /facepalm. Hunter was a close second but I think you’re right, I’m going to want to get better with end game not worse like Hunters do. Also the loot competition shouldn’t be too bad for tier just weapons and trinkets. Thank you again!!!
---
NO NO NO! Stop using private servers as an example.
---
Private servers were not optimized, took TONS of steps to follow to get the client and play, faith you’re not downloading a virus, and risk that your character could be deleted at any second of any day.
---
Private servers are an AWFUL judge for how many concurrent players Classic will have.
---
The boys
---
Does anyone know where APES are rolling? I’d like to avoid those guys
---
Perfection.
---
QQ. My immersion. Next you'll cry for LFG. Go away
---
Four whom?
---
So work for $10.00 an hour, or don't work at all and play WoW and make 30k+ a month?  Real tough decision there.
---
3.5kish is the pop cap in vanilla
---
&gt;Are raid times generally based on PST time (probably most definitely...)
---
There's going to be guilds that raid at all times of the day on every server.
---
Praise be.
---
es people have a stick up there ass because they don't want to see twitch chat as their world chat "OMG DID U GUYS SEE ASMON DAB ON RAG??? HE DID IT SO EASY OMG HE WON BRE AS WELL"
---
Layering already killed classic.
---
Another post you had specifically said you "wanted nothing to do with Californians" as if California even represents the entire West Coast.
---
Either way, you sound awfully small minded and your 'reasons' seem to be completely asinine. You wont convince me otherwise. Good day.
---

#THEN WHY DO WE HAVE LAYERING
---
I got mine.
---
Eh, that's not a fair comparison at all. TipsOut's history isn't enough to outright hate him, just disrespect him a bit. He's not continuing to commit fraud against the taxpayers and has never sexually assaulted anyone.
---
Why tho?  Is it against the law or something?
---
Yea he does, he is our warchief in the horde side.
---
EST data centers are located in Chicago. I'm on the west coast and my ping on the EST stress test servers is around 70ms. Not too bad, IMO.
---
Kinda ticked that there are only 5 NA pvp servers myself. I really don't think its enough, maybe blizz knows something I dont. But taking a sub out for the final stress test/name reservation only to find that whichever server I roll on my be swamped even with layering at launch or worse layering works great and we dont see how overpopulated it is for 1-2months(in which time I already plan to be 60). **Or even worse yet overpopulated servers past 2months give blizzard excuse and cause to make layering permanent.** In any case the lack of servers now, even if they add more later really screws realm pops/guild-friend plans/ and potentially the launch server and "new server" markets.
---
Always saw plenty of Moroccans and Algerians on French servers.
---
Not toxic at all. Nice.
---
I even avoid tarnished Brazilian servers by this point haha
---
Yeah who knows, if Classic actually maintains a consistent popularity, they might go the Everquest route and release new progression servers every now and then.
---
Ye
---
Nope but neither is me calling them insufferable twats who make the games they play worse.
---
And its 3 per wow account, not 3 per bnet account? 
---
So if I have 3 subs on my bnet account, I'll have 9 reservations?
---
If only more people understood this.
---
I had access so it.
---
Out of the classes you listed Rogue would be a great duo as well as hunter. My recommendation however is roll a warrior. Pally Warrior combo OP. Best of luck to y’all and if you need a guild to raid with holler at me :)
---
3000 concurrent players across all of germany hahaha. Seems realistic... Not... Put all streamer communities together and you have far more than that already.
---
but launch is the fresh start we're looking forward to. Dont want to play launch lv to 60 only to find massive login ques and voerpopulated realm problems 2 months in and then have to decide to re roll or pay for transfer and convince my guild to do the same.
---
Pathetic.
---
I mean they played alliance so they were just wrong right off the bat anyhow.
---
Tukui has a version for classic. It’s fairly decent
---
Which part?
---
So why do they have to get over the portion of players that don't like them if they should choose to stream?  Why can't they just talk shit on them 24/7?
---
Except it does. If you find yourself on a obscenely overcrowded server and you feel forced to move then that forced feeling includes having to choose between staying and giving up on that original servers already established community that you're already a part of. I'd probably decide to stay because of that factor alone and remain invisible among the rest of the thousands upon thousands of people.
---
WHERE MY EMERALD DREAM MFERS AT
---
except que time will supposedly be very low if any due to layering. Then when layering is removed 2months in you get hit with reality.
---
Just look it up on wowhead
---
Adding more servers definitely has consequences. People are going out of their way to subscribe early to reserve names and play with big groups. Those type of people aren't just going to reroll readily. The friends of theirs that then join down the road will also want to roll on those initial servers. The initial servers end up having much much larger populations than added ones and it becomes exceptionally harder to remove layering down the road without offering free transfers off or having massive login queues. Pick your poison.
---
We have a pretty good idea. Very likely, a majority. Servers were setup for 2 months from now, not day 1.
---
Phase 3 is when it just starts getting good.
---
Alliance scum! Great poster though!
---
Dildo toys
---
That’s a good question, that I can not answer. The announcement said all that was needed was an active subscription. You’re probably right.
---
Mabye i should opem a ticket
---
It's pretty even, so you should play whichever you want. Tauren gets extra health and Nelf gets 1% dodge. Tauren will scale slightly better, but it is so minuscule that it almost doesn't matter.
---
A massive amount of BR are rolling there, 3k+...
---
That will absolutely change the entire dynamic of that server and you will for sure run into language barriers.
---
Haha, np man..didn't even realize xD
---
Prot is actually great in PvP.
---
At 21 pts, sanctuary is the deepest raid talent in prot. Kings is only 11, devo just 1-5.
---
If you can afford the internet connection and the pc you can probably also afford the monthly fee, the monthly fee just makes the game unappealing to people who want to play 1-2 hours a week and don't have a lot of money.
---
They can talk all the shit they want, but I still think they're somewhere on the level Instagram "influencers" in terms of respectability.
---
No. The quote you're referring to is:
---
&gt; Every single time we look at the in-game clock, it will be wrong. That is the ONLY reason we needed to vote against Grobbulus after expressing interest in RP-PVP, but there were plenty more. Being on the East Coast is a core part of our identity. We really want nothing to do with California.
---
I never once mentioned Californians, just the place, specifically in reference to the clock difference. And California makes up 65% of the coastline and 77% of the population, so it's completely fair to interchange West Coast and California without someone getting riled up. Though I should apologize to Seattle, they don't deserve to be lumped in there.
---
And kid, if your goal was to convince me that I should want to play with Californians, you've severely failed. I can think of nothing worse than having to deal with your attitude on even a monthly basis. But that likely has nothing to do with where you live and is just engrained in your years of shitty upbringing.
---
I was day one in vanilla.  They had dynamic re spawns going. Not at rates like you see on private servers, but they are there.
---
few
---
I think you already know that answer to that

Who, or what, is SA?
---
It's almost like there is a cloud where infra is spun up on demand, we should start a business that does just that...
---
The first time I hear that line I was scared that my demon can leave me like hunter pets do.
---
Luckily in classic you won’t be required to group with them, outside of maybe raids you don’t control (that will suck)
---
In retail, since LFD was introduced, I’d you got a BR in your party, it’s better to leave. (Though normally the group will just kick them immediately)
---
I don’t like talking about them because it sounds mean, and makes me look like a ass (when I’m actually a person that loves helping people) but I’ve not encountered a BR player that cares to learn anything, and manages to not mess up a minimum of ten times in a instance.  They will constantly pull all mobs around, by accident somehow. If they have a taunt in their spec, they’re going to use it. If they have a pet, you can bet it’s taunt will remain on for the entire dungeon. Anything else basically you can do in a dungeon, they do it, consistently.
---
I have seen Br players on this sub (and other gaming Reddit’s) that act fine, and probably actually play very well. So they are SOMEWHERE out there.  But if you group up with one in WoW, from a known Br server, assume the worst, because you’ll never be surprised sadly.
---
Toxic. Have fun playing on a server with a 2 hour queue because of the sycophantic orbiters clogging it, while contributing nothing but negativity in the community and economy. 
---
I think they know how shit and in-authentic their experience is going to be on their server and now this is their petty way of shoving it in everyone's face one last time before they can fade into the obscurity in the minds of those that actually want to enjoy the game for what it is and not have it completely tarnished by a group of 40 people spamming in /s, /y, and /1 about joining (x)'s layer.
---
Basically; the last thing you want for a server is everything twitch chat exemplifies.
---
This is the streamers and the mindless clowns that follow them
---
Our Lords will keep us in waiting it seems.
---
Vanilla =/= Classic
---
People will learn this the hard way...through many tears.
---
assuming the full playerbase subs to reserve names and they realize "oops we didn't realize classic would be bigger than retail". Do you think in 2 weeks time Blizz will discuss/approve/decide to launch more servers? will the additional servers be available by launch? with 10 NA server, 5 pvp Would they roll 1 additional out at a time or drop another 5 pvp servers at once? Will the hundreds of guilds(that represent the core audience and though may be a minority of players will have major impact on realm stability) planning to make their server choice before name reservation swap? Overpopulated realms are very detrimental to game  and server longevity, adding servers willy nilly isn't going to solve everyones problems.

---
Who said anything about rerolling?
---
1. Announce that a new server will be launching in X days for only players on ABC server to transfer to, free of charge.
---
2. Add a feature to the in-game store that allows any character to flag themselves for an instant transfer the moment X days pass.
---
3. Keep the free realm transfer open for the entirety of Phase 1.
---
No lost friends, no lost names, no lost progress. Hell most won't even notice because they only ever see a tiny percentage of the population at one time because of Layering.
---
You could even solo an elite somewhat casually as a Paladin.
---
I don't understand what any of that means.
---
Link poprosze?
---
Even though layering also brings positive things to the table, I see nothing elegant about not seeing your party members after joining the party or people vanishing in front of your eyes. We can only hope, they will turn it off before Phase 2 as promised. And in regards of leeway, nor retail, nor pservers has leeway and nobody miss it. For the sake of true feel of mmorpg and logic itself, how can you hit something with shortsword, that is distanced from you 10yards? It doesnt make sense. Since I will be rolling warrior, I dont mind that much, I cant wait to destroy helpless hunters and rogues on 1v1 and also makes me somehow happy, that mages wont be able to AoE farm.
---
ED REP REP
---
Cultural self-sufficiency. The other populations are just too irrelevant individually and forced to acculturate at a higher rate.
---
I think it's actually 1.13 because there are changes beyond the Naxx patch.
---
What do you guys think of being an OCE player on this server? I know the concensus is that you'll have people online around the clock, but will it be enough to still play functionally (ie raiding and pvping with enough people)?
---
I'd have to play on 180-200ms stable if I go through with this decision.
---
Does he even have a following? Lol.
---
What if I'm not. What if they're underestimating? They promised to remove layering right? In phase 2? What happens if there's a pop of 15k on one specific realm when phase 2 drops? Forced transfers? Because if not, then that particular realm won't stay true to Vanilla and they sure as hell won't have kept their promise. The only remaining option is to extend the layering dismantling plan to yet another phase. And another.
---
Well you jump off his spiral-like hill and he has to walk down as npcs can t jump. You can kite him all the way to Shazzrah. But I m not sure if that s intended.

Horde for Grob! Though I will have Alliance alts on Bloodsail.

feral was actually extremely good in arena at 60 with those talents. my cousin and I ran feral druid / resto shaman when they introduced arenas before TBC dropped (still level 60). Played hundreds of games and didn't lose a single one.
---
Unfortunately when we hit 70 things scaled differently and it wasn't nearly as good.
---
I find him the hardest in MC. It requires some coordonation in managing the adds. The rest are fairly faceroll.
---
If this is your first time embroidering, it looks really clean! My first project was a mess 😂
---
Once you hit 60, is it heals all day? I feel like your feral damage would be minimal in WPVP and nonexistant in a raid, right?

---
After the first few months of vanilla they introduced an exp penalty for being in raid and this stopped working.
---
Starting to seem like you're treating this subreddit as your own personal Instagram
---
Fuck off. You cant conplain that the community of a server isnt Blizzlike because the community isnt created by Blizzard.
---
Funny how we get called horrible xenophobes ruining everything for wanting to be able to speak our language. I guess European cultural diversity only goes as far as looking good on a postcard.
---
You are conveniently forgetting queues and free transfers from high pop realms.
---
I assume then that there was some honor in knowing you killed him? Otherwise just seems like a joke of a rare.
---
Server queues, open new servers, free transfers offered.
---
South America
---
Are there even any major game publishers that still own and operate their own hardware today? I doubt even 1% of Blizzard's technical employees have ever seen the actual hardware AT&amp;T leases to them, at least not from inside the data center.
---
I don’t think you understand the underlying ethos of classic. Imagine 10 manning Hogger at level 2 and that about sums it up.
---
It means I think their "career" is bullshit but they, but they're free to talk whatever shit they want.
---
Wow. Such funny.
---
Swifty’s following is small but extremely loyal.
---
15 years of standing in the same place will do that to you.
---

---
This guy is probably salty because he actually already got his reputation tarnished doing this. It's common courtesy naturally that if a system was put in place by so many people then following it seems best, otherwise you are just screwing with dozens of other people.
---
I mainly watch CSGO and Dota streams, so the streamers I watch aren't making money only for existing, but for their insane skill/talent/ maybe personality. Watching a person like Shroud (when he played CSGO) stream was like watching a God play the game.
---

---
Hell Yeah. I’ll be playing a Shadow Priest that is always alone, Fishing, cooking, and giving away freebies to passerby.
---
Should be therapeutic.
---

---
I'd say the same about French servers, but we're already « stealing » servers from the English as it is 🤐
---
Can we get a language by server breakdown?
---
How do you plan for that? You'd lose your paid reserved name on one of the two servers that exist until then.
---
Well then that's just poor money management.  Because they could be wealthy leeches if the invested that money responsibly.
---
You never did it with 10 because you couldn't complete most quests (read: all your Deadmines quests) in a raid, and there was a significant XP penalty in raids, so you didn't raid low level dungeons.
---
Yeah they're all super concerned about some angry internet guy, and thats why they decided to roll on the same server. Really nailed it
---
Yes their mentality nowadays is to put as little effort or creativity as possible but still yield the maximum amount of profit. I'm sure their bank accounts are laughing the whole way home though
---
Idk it’s pretty impossible to say. On top of having to do that incredibly long quest that does require 20-40 man raids a few times not just for instances but also to fight some quest specific world bosses, you have to rely on your server doing the war effort. So they gotta turn in random supplies en masse (I forget if it was cloth or what it was). 
---
So it could take a few healthy months to open the gates depending on server population ect.
---
You’d deal with lag just because you don’t like the server name?
---
You can also choose not to reroll. There will be plenty of people who are not connected this deep and will reroll making life on your server easier as well. This is a win/win for everybody. If it's too much work for you to reroll, just don't and still profit from the new servers.
---
Brian Birmingham interview from last Blizzcon as well as the German blue post about it
---
Don't forget that the folks behind [The Blacklist](https://redd.it/by3nd0) have yet to announce their server.
---
To other commenters (and I'm glad you made this thread, OP; I was about to do it myself), OP is not asking what cities the servers will be located in. It's obvious they'll be in Chicago and/or LA. OP is asking which servers will specifically be in Chicago and which in LA, since the data centers do not correspond with server timezones. A "Pacific" server like Grobbulus could be hosted in the Chicago data center.
---
To OP, I hope Blizzard says something about this, but I've been looking for a while tonight and haven't found any info. My best guess from a purely logistical perspective is that all American Classic servers will be located in the same data center (not knowing which one it will be on) simply for ease of maintenance.
---
yeah not looking forward to this.
---
thanks for the tips
---
We still have guilds etc. There will still be community being built. It is just that sometimes we have to take a less than ideal option in the short term to end up with a thriving long term. Short-sightedness wins us nothing.
---
Yea but classic wow hasn’t started yet, you can look it like this “retail wow made 1100k sub in 15 years, classic wow made 160k sub in couple of months”
---
Oddly I 100% agree. Adds more of a personal aspect.
---
Shazzrah is misspelled as ”shazzrag”, dead link.
---
That was before layering was an idea.
---
What? The art direction, encounter mechanics, and little bonus features have never been more creative than they are in Retail today.
---
My friend private sniper has been making mods for classic it's his first time doing so, one of which is a mod that will list the skills you can purchase or learn each level without having to go check at the trainer that way you can make the best out of leveling.
---
are you loading out of date addons, some of them aren't updated for the latest build. Field Guide, Questie, Atlasloot, Swing Timer and Better Vendor are some of the addons that are working for me right now.

---
Well you can say for yourself that you enjoy the direction the game has taken, but ime the entirety of the gaming industry has gone right down the shitter and retail is no exception
---
What explains the discrepancy with server demographics of the same type and region? 
---
Like for the PVP servers on the west coast, it's literally a coin toss when deciding between Whitemane and Fairbanks (neither have the big streamers). Why does Whitemane have 70% more players? Fairbanks also has a much higher H:A ratio for some reason. 
---
And for PVP East, why does Faerlina have way fewer people (like almost half) than the other two pvp east servers? Thalnos is confirmed non-streamers so if anything, I would have expected that to be somewhat higher than the other two.
---
he said he's probably not even streaming it, i think you're fine.
---
Merges works on retail. Won't work here. What will you merge the French servers with when they will become dead a few months after launch? And with what eu server will you merge the unnoficial non-English EU chosen server with? With the eu English server that english speaking players chose so they won't be playing with non-english speaking players?
---

---
I'll be there! Troll Shaman all the way baby!
---
Plenty of gay dudes would prefer to do the wrestling down themselves
---
One thing that I'm concerned about is that, with this few servers, there's a good chance that they will just roll characters on both PvP realms. (eg- get R14 on one server, then re-roll on the other and get R14 there as well)
---
This isn't inconceivable. Tribe, for example, (one of their warriors) has been R14 on four different private servers.
---
Blizzard didn't have much of a choice. Activision bought the shares from Vivendi.
---
You never brought just one! You brought extra hunters in case a tranq shot missed.
---
I hope you roll on Thalnos to prove everyone wrong, and then let us know if you were right.

It’s boring but it’s not hard. Got some heals and bubble that’ll save you from pretty much anything

On nostal, on darrowshire(mere?), on lightshope, I've grouped with insanely pro prot pallies, prot pallies running baron timed etc, tanking ZG etc.
---
They figured out the intemizations a long time ago, you just have to be incredibly dedicated and skilled.
---
The problem isn't FR/DE having servers, it's not having sufficient servers for everyone (including FR/DE). It's not the *players'* fault, it's *Blizzard's*. Don't shift blame away from the multi-billion dollars company.
---
We are talking about layers, not server.
---
So if JUST the subscribers to this sub play, the servers would be overwhelmed.  Thats not counting all the lurkers on the sub, or all the people on the official forums who dont come here, or all the people who don't post at all and just play.
---
"whatever server we role on we are fucking that server hard dude" 
---
this is why we don't want to play on your server...
---
when is this last time you played vanilla WoW lol.
---
See you in a battleground
---
Its not about being afraid of playing with other players and more about the average BR player on an NA server being completely unable to function with the non BR majority.
---
Don't ask me why the stereotype of terrible BR players exists, but it exists, I would assume, for a reason.
---
Can you elaborate more on this war effort? Like it requires the entire server to come together and grind? So low pop server may not even see it for several months after high pop?
---
15 years later w/ the legion graphics, and I can barely tell the difference between Vanilla and Classic. Not sure which I prefer.
---
Cheers, pal
---
Correct!
---
Thanks putting my thoughts into words. I'm at work and it's hard to get your point across when you're typing on your phone. I'm getting downvoted for the mere thought that this is going to clash with our expectations and their promises. Layering is a can of worms in and out of itself past the first few weeks at the most imo. And I really, really wished that they at least had 2-4 more pvp servers where the vast majority of us will be.
---
Christ i'm tired seeing all these streamer names being mentioned everywhere WoW related...  tiPs oUt stAysAFe esFanD aSmOn

We had 3 Scarab Lords on our server, 2 horde and one alliance. You just need a guild to do the quesr chain for ya 😅

a place to organize and talk the shit a bit across the entire realm
---
I mean, I guess that could be the case, but we also know that he repeatedly lied about his experience in WoW vanilla in order to seem more authoritative, so I think doubt is more than justified.
---
Ultimately, when someone defrauds a million dollars from tax payers, and when caught, doubles down on "racism", it's up to him to prove that he has reformed. If I were him and I would at least publicly address my past mistakes and vow to improve myself as a better person going forward.

I'm not sure I understand the context of this comment though.

I didn't mention Dire Maul or list that as a reason why people on my server used VC to reference the Deadmines.

The short answer is kinda. There are addons on curse that work with classic but I’m not sure if the twitch app will install / update apps.

Yeah these are basically  the same reasons for me to return to WoW classic. Although one you missed in the vid, but did mention below in the comments is something like an Identity and a real community on the wow classic server. Can't wait to experience that again!

Personally? I'd open more servers and merge then together and if need be. That way both realms get to keep their identities. It'd be like taking your crew across the seas into unknown territory at worst, where you find a while new thriving community.
---
Sources disagree in general, but Thalnos has consistently been named a non-streamer server.
---
It will be gone after phase 1. Its just to help with all overflooded starting areas.
---
Not at all, but fairness just isn't a meaningful term here.  If they wanted to play the game just like me they'd play the game just like me.  But they are choosing their internet fame.
---
Hell yeah matey!!!
---
Out of the 100 strangers you meet, you'll remember only 1. Just adding this first because people overblow their "social leveling aspect" by gigantic factors.
---
That being said, as soon as you have a guild you're NOT going to get layered around. You login and you'll be thrown on the layer of your guild. You'll do a dungeon, quit it and again, get on the layer of your guild. It's not always going to work 100% if layers reach their desired size, but for the majority of the time there's no reason why it wouldn't work..
---
Horde doesn't have blessing of kings which is great for druids. Alliance doesn't have grace of air, which is nice for the dodge I suppose.

Hey mate I’ve just ordered a mad pc for Metabox in Perth. Really cheap for gaming laptops although there base modes start at 1k. They have released the specs needed but anything after 2012 should be able to run in fairly decent. You could have a look at a second hand one from gumtree or if you have some cash to spend bit up Metabox. I got one for 1800 and similar models elsewhere with the same specs where like 3000.
---
I don't understand your argument at all. Instagram influencers haven't actually demonstrated to do much, even with large follower counts.
---
Streamers have a paid audience that is way more engaged with the content on a regular basis. Their audience is way more likely to actually purchase the product on display because it ties into their interests directly and is marketed straight to them instead of just something pushed on a generic feed. 
---
You're just being ignorant if you want to compare people to "worthless leeches" just because they make money producing content. 
---
Your job is probably just as insignificant in the grand scheme of things, like most people lol. lower your ego.
---
I’m forgetting what exactly we grinded. But it was a fuck ton of shit like a million copper bars hundreds of thousands of rune cloth ect. A huge ass list of shit. But yes the entire server both factions had to come together and grind. The more grinding the faster it went. And some low pop servers took a very long time. I think when tbc released some servers didn’t even have them open because there were blood elf’s and Draenei who eventually got the mount.
---
I really don't get why people care so much
---
Yes, which would give you a sense of pride for doing it, right? Thats what I said.
---
Now if German and French players would all play on French and German realms.  
---
But plenty of them will play on English realms for varying reason, especially the private server crowd that found guilds/friends on the English private servers who will obviously start on English realms.
---
The salt coming from all NA Anti-streamer players are so delicious
---
That's not how it is with retail servers. [There's no correlation between timezone and data center.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Americas_region_realm_list_by_datacenter)
---
Maybe they decide to do it differently with Classic servers, but I can't consider that true or false on the basis of stress test servers (though the fact that they used one on each data center at least undermines the notion that all Classic servers would be in one center).

Hmm I wonder why?
---
?
---
No, we don't have a rp-pvp realm.
---
welcome to being an aussie circa 2004. didnt get oceanic servers based here till 2014!
---
I've been getting downvoted all night, man. But we have to be loud. This is unacceptable and people here just aren't informed on the consequences this few amount of servers will have. Back in the day servers had 3000 concurrent player caps. Imagine we go as high as 5k concurrent players per server now for classic. EU (minus France and Germany) have 2 PVP servers (!), does Blizzard expect a couple months from now that there will be less than 10k concurrent players playing on PVP servers in this region? This is absolutely insane, that number is going to be so much higher. I'm not asking for 20 extra servers, but 2 is just far too little and anyone not realizing this is completely delusional.
---
It's main purpose is for longevity of the game. Rather than merge servers, they have opted for layering so that when population decreases after a month or two they can seamlessly get rid of layering and the population on all the servers will be at a good level.
---
DM + Wing. 
---
And also, it's 40 levels in difference.
---
Fo sho.
---
I mean, I think there will be more players than reddit subs and we will need more servers, but saying that the current servers would be overwhelmed with 160k players is just incorrect.
---
Druid can tank 4 horsemen no problem. Odd that you select that. Broken reel works in form and there are a few spell hit items that they can equip with no real survival compromise.
---
You got me there. On one of my very own arguments too. I don't know buddy. But having to leave your server due to overcrowding after a few months is something I'm sure none of us are particularly keen on doing.
---
Streamers got together and chose two servers to not join for the people who want to avoid them
---
Sure it will have a big AH, but things will be cheaper than they are suppose to be. It wll be deflation, not inflation.
---
No. A language barrier isn’t an issue. Gamers from all around the world can work together with nothing but emotes and common sense.

This doesn't necessarily mean anything though because on retail they have servers labeled as east coast that are in the LA data center and vice versa.

Yes plz for the love of god give Latin America a server.  No offense to the fine people of those countries but I dont remember most of my Spanish studies and I know 0 Portuguese.  I know EU has a similar problem but at least most of EU speaks at least some english.
---
Based on watching Asmongold, it actually seems to me that he makes fun events happen - exploration, world PvP raids, etc. I don't really understand the extreme negativity about "streamer servers." 
---
I'm somewhat more concerned about servers that are being talked about as "this is the place to be for MATURITY." That seems like something of a red flag to me.
---
I'm not sure where I want to roll at this point. I was thinking I'd go RP-PVP, but the "we're so mature" refrain makes me question that. I'm on the east coast, so I'm considering Herod and Faerlina, as well as Grobbulus (Pacific time RP-PvP).

PVE/normal:  no ganking, less world PVP, worse BG partly (less skilled), slightly nicer people   
---
- compared to PVP   
---
RP:  more mature, maybe nicer people, better names, lots of Thexual roleplay
---
Have you seen some of the groups that follow these guys? For the most popular ones there are upwards of 50 people at a time following them around. How are you just gonna casually gank them and get away with it? That's the thing, they get a following and basically become invincible which totally ruins world pvp.
---
That's just so retarded. I used to play on the same realm with my friends, we just randomly ran into each other all the time. I could be doing pre-BiS and he was dueling in OG and we would meet there and change few words, then continue our separate ways.
---
Layering = the home world / realm is GONE.
---
I rather have to put up with phasing and layering for the first 2 months than get stuck on a dead server for the rest of the servers life. There’s a reason they’re doing this. They’re not doing this to save server space or just to piss people off. It’s the best way to secure a healthy server even after the tourists leave and the population drops off.

---
There is a really easy solution to this just like sports celebrities and others do.
---
Play your stream character for your work, play your offstream character in your leisure time.
---
Nobody enforces that you have to sit on your streaming character for 20hours a day. Play 8 hours for work, play 3 hours for fun. 
---
Easy.
---

---
Thank you for reading better than I did. !
---
Plus you typically get your first blue at that point. :D
---
Oh my god, people using “of” instead of “have” hurts, thank you for your work.
---
Well fuck, you beat me
---
I'd like to see at least one more NA EST PvP server.
---
Your feelings have very little to do with the threats that druid tanks can output ;)
---
The fact that pservers had "everything wrong" can also turn the tides in druids favour. For instance the armor multiplier of thick hide.
---
So yeah. Don't use your feelings when you want to make a sound judgment.
---
The sound judgment is as follows:
---
- we can take what we know from privates servers with a grain of salt, but that is arguably our best prior information today.
---
- if we decide not to use any information from pservers, then we might as well not have any opinion at all before we learn more from classic in the fee months to come .
---
And that's about it.
---
I get the reference, however, usually, people who look like 2019th Herod are stronger than a leaner version. It may not be obvious but it's often true :)
---
Then you should say that english-speaking people that play WoW have a problem with anyone that doesn't speak english, not just brazilians. This OP comment is xenophoby in its purest form.
---
LOL he said the RP community not just “any”.

---
Just make one pvp server
---
Hello! I think your concern is completely valid, and that's why I want to give you a reply :)
---
As to your first question, Pertento is a guild with 300+ members and we've been recruiting to our guild and setting up the realm discord with other Alliance EU RP-PvP guilds for almost a year now.
---
Prior to the announcement of the realm's name, there were already 10 guilds a part of the realm discord, and we especially have been at the very front of pushing for RP-PvP realms since they announced that there would be none. There is a lot that we have tried to do behind the scenes to help make this happen, and not just working with the EU community, but with the international community and content creators. See for example the Countdown to Classic podcast about RP-PvP -- it was us who were directly responsible for that happening. 
---
On to your concern, I can completely understand where you're coming from, and you are of course free to think that way, but that is not our intentiom at all. We are just trying to create something to contribute to the community and ensure that there is open communication between everyone on the realm. Many of our key members are a part of selfless initiatives like Halwin (founder) and Roddeh (officer) who are running Vanilla Friends Finder. One of our guildmates is a long time moderator of this very subreddit, r/classicwow.
---
In short, we've been around for a while and we're just trying to help organize things and utilize our experience to make it better for everyone. We hope that you and everyone else will join us on the realm discord and that we all get to know each other better. Perhaps that will change your opinion of us. :)
---
If you'd like to chat more, you can visit me there or DM me directly.
---
Thank you for expressing your concern, and I look forward to speaking with you and everyone else; whether it's on the discord or in game!

WoD made me quit WoW for good. Never touched Legion or BFA. That whole garrison nonsense was atrocious and the heroic dungeons were already a joke in MoP and just got worse and worse.

"Hey Dave, go ahead and order a few more login servers man"
---
It also pretty much killed all the professions.
---
True, that's why I'll probably run a prot warrior NE first. 1% dodge OP
---
I've extended this to add a moon to your last target, and square to your new target. This way you can also keep track of both when fighting more than one thing.
---
```
---
/run  if not IsInGroup() then SetRaidTarget("target", 5) end
---
/targetenemy
---
/stopmacro [noharm]
---
/run  if not IsInGroup() then SetRaidTarget("target", 6) end
---
Where will this info be published?
---
I didn't notice it to be honest, other than the starter zone wasnt overly populated.
---
But they have added dynamic respawn too, so it's balanced well from my perspective. Hyped doesn't quite cut it!
---
Why not for a hardcore progressive guild? That's where they might, in fact, shine.
---
They get geared up way kicker than the 3rd prot warrior in a progression raid.
---
They output more threat than your 3rd prot warrior.
---
They have more motigation than your 3rd prot warrior.
---
Once everyone is maxed out in gear, then sure, they might not compare to the 3rd prot warrior (who would then be equivalent to the first "MT" prot warrior), but at this point progression is done.
---

Nope, they tested with 5 and then made sweeping assumptions based on numbers pulled from wiki sites over a decade ago without a supporting dataset.

Roll a gnome. The class will come when you login on the 26th.

Try opening with some sort greeting, follow it with discussing what is going on with the activity you have grouped up for, if those people were good and also spoke about what was going on add them to your friends list. Then next time you are looking for people check your friends list, that way you can group up with the same people over and over and conversation can become more varied.
---
You are not going to make deep connections in that first group situation, but still nice to actually group with people all the same.
---
Because he had 100.000 viewers doing a deadmines run. 
---
Esfand, Staysafe and the others combined will have half the views that Asmongold gets on a regular basis.
---
His server will be a shitshow and I could imagine that the other streamers might avoid him in order to have a somewhat authentic vanilla experience.
---
No problem.

Both are really fun. Id go warlock if i didnt hate souls shard farming for pvp.

They're golemagg last I heard.

on low levels when you only group for a few minutes to kill a named mob it’s mostly smal talk. As soon as you have harder quests that require strategy or traveling or multiple quests you want to do together you will automatically get more involved. It will happen naturally.

It took a bit of work, but today myself and a good friend of mine got to delve into the Karazhan crypts :) Karazhan's always had a special place in my heart (see: reddit name), so getting to actually delve into the crypts firsthand was amazing! It's every bit as creepy as you'd think, and then some. Minus the... doodads.
---
That is one sexy face.....
---
they dont have to be a majority to frustrate the population. 1/5 in dungeon group or 1 or in a raid will cause english speakers to rage atleast on occassion. but being that minority is going to be rough playing with a large population you have a hard time communicating with and will likely be treated like a sub par player by regardless of your personal skill/gear. Blzz should have designated a SA server even if it was still based in the US to avoid such unpleasent player experiences.
---
I'm looking forward to more on these! would love to see where Shaman stands, it was the one class I didn't play back in Vanilla.

I would be rolling there as horde for the instant bg queue.

That's what gets me. Ok, I can understand that you call it VC when you get the quest and don't know the name of the dungeon. But surely, when you enter and it says Deadmines under your mininap, why wouldn't you call it Deadmines?
---
isn't that supposed to be against tos?

You specifically said the white lion.... I think you're the idiot here.

You also have cross realm bgs.

we dont assume all english speakers in NA are from the UK..

Not sure how to follow the thread through mobile so if someone could do me a solid and comment on me with the answer as well 😁

honestly blizz can suck it up

if there is need for new servers just make them and provide free transfers off the servers broken by population
---
it worked in vanilla and i have 0 faith in layering , it will break day 1 and only make shit worse when servers are way over pop
---
the stress test was like 1 fps and npc's did not work for ages

Yeah I’d like to meet people and remember names, maybe even group up again at some point. But it’s hard to make a connection with someone when we’re just grouping up for 10 mins to rip an ogre’s balls off

Its the latin america server no one who knows will play there on purpose.  Well unless they are from latin america.
---
Best illustration.

So Herod=Thor?

I appreciate aspects of your sentiment, but this is such a boot licking mentality.

We should be dictating to them which servers they are allowed to play on.

All steamers should just pick one PvP and PvE server. Why? It's like a town market. Everyone knows to go there for that product.  Or a sports league, where you only watch one league.  It would be better for every single one of them in terms of $$$.  Organizing against people who would follow you around "should" just be part of the game and cost of streaming in a community.  If anything it's fucking content to get fans stirred up.
---
They need to grow the fuck up and not hold the community hostage.  I would grief someone that puts me in a position I couldn't avoid due to rolling with my guild.
---
I get that they're expecting the numbers to drop quite significantly after a while. I do. But relying on layering to counter that is simply asinine. There are so many people on here who are tacitly approving of using layering in this way but us players having to scatter eventually is unavoidable unless all servers die in a short time span which is extremely unlikely. New servers will HAVE to open. So why not open a few more now? I want to reserve my name and hop on and play, and hopefully never have to move again. I want to establish myself somewhere and immerse myself wherever I go. Just like all of you.
---
If I'm missing something then please enlighten me because the way I see it, we're in for a bumpy ride with communities disappearing and being replaced with new ones as we accept invites here and there due to layerhopping and whatnot, for months.
---
Sounds good, any source?
---
Open Source is the BEST. I can only hope I'll give back something to the community in the future. 
---
If we end up in the same wow server (I'll roll English PVP), I'd be glad to share a blackmoon festival drink with you fella :)
---
Hammers up!
---
they just shat out a server for every realm with minimal effort and started advertising them everywhere in an effort to control all the realm discords
---
"AT the white lion... go check the kodo skeleton yourself". Why do you people hate people that actually know things and have intelligent input.
---
Safe from streamers but plagued by douche
---
if they still store bindings and shit in a server name folder i assume if you change the name of the folder and make the same name character you shouod be good 
---
not played retail in like 3 years tho
---
Blizzard forces name changes for no reason at all. Just make up a story and they buy into it, it's retarded honestly.
---
I once transferred realms and renamed my character Basementlol because I was literally playing from a basement, which was my student accomodation at the time. Just poking fun at myself for having finally become a wow basementdweller.
---
So after a while i got tired of the name and reported myself from another account for offensive name, told the gm that my name was offensive because it was an alleged reference to joseph fritzl and got a free namechange out of it.
---
Too much of that fine Stormwind Brie
---
all of them?  That seems pointless.
---
Just word of mouth so far, maybe there is better proof to find but I haven't been looking.
---
I disagree, its great just to have 2 Servers! Both can be great as Nostalrius was back then and there is no fear to choose a dead wrong Server. i LOVE that choice!
---
you wont. you just wont. on pve???? lol
---
What's the deal with Herod? Why is it the "obvious" one?
---
Yeah. Personally, I wouldn't reroll even if the queue is bad. But someone else will reroll, or people will quit. Eventually server pop goes down.
---
I sat through 1-2 hour queues for vanilla for months, but eventually it dropped to 20-30 minutes. That was tolerable. I doubt it will get that bad for Classic, and even if it does, it's not that bad.
---
I'll be honest, people DO exaggerate how much interactions you have while questing. (I don't count someone randomly buffing me an interaction cuz I play private servers and I'm kinda used to it).
---
-------------------------------------------
---
Interactions with players while leveling is mostly about quests and what you need.
---
Example: you see someone standing near where Hogger spawns, you just whisper them *"Hogger ?"*, you do the quest together then you go your own way. You won't be talking about anything really.
---
Zone Chat is pretty active and real interactions happen. A common example is Stranglethorn Vale in which people work together to track gankers and such.
---
Dungeon Chat is mostly about the dungeon and the gear and wait for mana etc... no real life talk.
---
But guild chat is the best. Guild chat is like your family, you talk about everything.
---
Just remember you're playing a game and not on a date with some girl. You don't have to force chat. It just happens when it happens.
---
I saw APC live in Detroit a few months ago. Seems like a really peaceful dude.
---
????? Who cares ?? ??
---
Layering. -\_-
---
depending on how elitist your playgroup is in relation to pve spriest my work really well for you.
---
I think that's a dangerous road to head down. The debuff limit for example was a technical limitation at the time, a limitation that no longer exists, I don't think it should be removed due to how game altering it would be.
---
Also a large portion of the world began to get broadband as early as the late 90s. I know that by 2005 it was very common in my country, I've had it myself since the year 2000 but that'a anecdotal.
---
Nachdem gestern die europäischen WoW Classic server bekannt wurden, hier ein Sammelbecken für den PvP server Lucifron. Dort ist auch ein Link zum discord server deutschen WoW community (mit subchannel für Lucifron)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/lucifron/](https://www.reddit.com/r/lucifron/)
---
(after the European wow servers got announced yesterday, here's a link to the subreddit for the german PvP server Lucifron)
---
These streamers need to stop taking it so personally and getting offended.
---
I would love to play with any of these guys. It's just they come with some baggage in the form of like 30,000+ spergs filling up the realms. Half of the spergs won't even play the game and will just log in to follow the streamer around.
---
World chat would likely be unusable whenever a big streamer (Asmongold) is online. The 40+ people following the streamer around will be like a plague of death sweeping across the land wherever they go.
---
I'm a huge Asmongold fan, but fuck me I just want to play Classic.
---
So i see people saying they think blizzard expects classic not to be popular.. But what if its the opposite?  
---
What if they let the servers overflow, and have to add a ton more at launch date so the press is going to be like.  
---
"Classic super popular! not enough servers, blizzard had to expand rapidly due to popularity! Is blizzard back?"
---
MILKY MILKY WARM AND TASTY
---
MOMMY! MILKY! PLEASE BE HASTY
---
Oh yeah I agree that the server counts seem low for now. But I'm not gonna delve into the layering debate. They've decided on it and that's what we'll get. I guess we'll see what happens when launch finally hits.
---
We need more than five...
---
Predicting that by the week after name reserves that they will add some more servers based on the amount of accounts reserving names. But we will see! Very excited either way.
---
I killed it once.  Even on a 60 paladin it took a while.  A lowbie was standing by and watching when he went down.  He asked me if it dropped anything good.  Nope.  Just a couple of silver.  Both disappointed, we walked our separate ways.
---
And why not?
---
\&gt;ultra high server pop, far more than in 2004
---
\&gt;only 20 people are getting honor 
---
looks easy to me.
---
I agree that it’s nice to group up with people and help each other out if some quests can’t be done solo. Maybe I’m reading into it too much but from what a lot of people say about classic it seems like you join a party with different people a lot of the time and might even become friends with them. It just seems a bit unrealistic to me since your just chatting to someone for a small amount of time.
---
he doesn't  know.
---
Why make a Druid bank/auction alt?
---
They tend to have a natural grasp on sealing deals, and purring all the way to the bank.
---
They also have a great talent for pawning stuff.
---
And if someone chickens out of a deal they can’t bear, you can just pounce on the next one.
---
Po prostu wyszukaj world of warcraft classic polska na fb, można dołączyć do grupy. Są linki na discorda. Serwer, na który się wybieramy już wybrany.
---
Think cap will be pretty low compared to privates. Anticipate queues if you play on Herod
---
Spergs will roll Whitemane.  
---
Fairbanks will be the hardcore server.
---
If you can clear Fargodeep mine you can raid.
---
I can definitely see this happening. Even people who don't have an active subscription are able to download the classic client. So Blizzard should get an idea of what to expect in the coming weeks leading up to release.
---
Layering. The death of WoW.
---
Yes Italians are not that many also. I cant even find the Italian discord, so I must play on a random server and hope to find a guild.
---
The fuck it isn't.
---
If the addons work in the stress test they should work in the game come launch. I can't guarantee they will, but they should. As for UI/Keybindings, I would guess its unlikely those carry over.
---
Dont post anymore pls
---
Thwomp, thwack, thwoop, BOOOM!
---
Alright guys the only way to take the pvp servers we want without streamers is to make a bunch of new characters and steal the streamers names maybe that will at least deter them lol
---
That's fair but opening up a few more servers will make it so that they don't have to put all their eggs in the layering basket. It wouldn't be noticed as much and it'd rid me and a lot of people the sense of impending transfers.
---
Durotar/Barrens is going to be so rammed you'll probably be better off going to the glades
---
Yeah, Rumor is that at one point you had 45people whom was able to play the game in that inbreed country.
---
Damn, still better interaction than Legion or BFA.

I've also heard that they're on Golemagg. I also saw one of their core mages is on the Golemagg discord and not the Shazzrah one
---
Do you know what RP stands for?
---
How could they? They're putting us all in 2 baskets while hoping that those of us who remain are going to willingly leave our communities and transfer away at some point.
---
Can you make a 10 hour version?
---
Runny Poo
---
This naive guy that don't realize Blizzard isn't an indie studio, and that Classic is only made to get some easy money.
---
there wont be a safe server
---
azmon wont roll where all the horde pvpers roll
---
I mean it really depends. In theory it could work I think but all it takes is one person to raid orgrimmar to throw you’re entire grind off. 
---
Youd need a lot of collaborators. Because you will DR rather quick And you’d also need to absolutely bank on the fact that absolutely no one onneither faction will /PvP toggle themselves which is unlikely to happen.
---
Yep. If we're willing to do a 15 minute corpse run, a 30 minute queue is not going to stop us.
---
Why do you feel like you're important enough to own the discord for 3 entire servers?
---
I mainly wanna setup the old fashioned XPerl and bagnon and postal lol. A couple QoL ones. The rest of it is gonna just be me enjoying classic gameplay. Just how I had it on private servers
---
I would care a little bit if we had like 20 servers to choose from and all their names sucked. But I'm way more concerned about the actual number of servers available at the moment. Especially English PvP servers.
---
[SimpleMap](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25095-SimpleMap.html) is what you are looking for.
---
What? It was at around 8:20 that they opened new realms. And the queues took 10 or so minutes to ramp up to 15k.
---
Everything points at spinning up a server takes them a few minutes.
---
Can I sub now and play during the test, or did I need an active subscription when it started on Thursday?
---
How to win: spam moonfire. Drink for 30 seconds. Repeat.
---
&gt; Why does Whitemane have 70% more players? 
---
It's probably because of the name, everybody loves Whitemane. I mean, the servers have no people in it as of now so there isnt anything else to go by when choosing a server, we dont know the % of Horde/Alliance, streamers, etc.
---
so I think the count is 25 servers worldwide. So think about how many layers per server will be necessary to hold a total population similar to nostalrius(anywhere from 150,000 to 800,000). Then rethink that number because most wow players(previous and current)/mmo players in general have never touched a pserver. The current server count is so small its hard to imagine we wont have an absolutely massive number of layers and even if the roll out a some new server we'll end up with lasting issues or result in lasting layering which will arguably be worse than dead server/merges that the technology was developed to avoid.
---
Yes
---
You’re right. In my case I rolled a warrior and didn’t have access to anything instant making sense to use that early on. For classes with other resources I agree 100%.
---
Perfect, thanks!
---
Who hurt you?
---
Try the new version:
---
https://github.com/AeroScripts/QuestieDev/releases/tag/v4.0.9
---
Usually it does not count.
---
Clearing the content on a beta/test is not the same as live.
---
They're not, whatever server streamers go on is gonna be an absolute gaschamber and have a very artificial community that consists of their viewers following them around. It wont be an organic wow experience it'll be a fucking retardede meme festival.
---
I mean it's there, but you no longer get randomly layered/phased to another server instance.
---
There's also an internal cooldown so you cannot Layer hop on-demand (unless you've been idle for a few minutes but this needs further testing)
---
Mage if you like solo play.   
---
Warrior if you have healers and friends with you.
---
Horde doesn't get BoK but tauren gets a passive hp increase, so it offsets that. Druid stats are moreso affected by strength, so in that case the totem would be an improvement.
---
We also have NZ players and some singapore/SEA players on oce servers too, not just australia. Still a small population, but not as small as it sounds with just australia
---
I really hope thats true I dont hate the dude just his community.
---
Your opinion is anecdotal at best
---
I know a guy like that irl. He started getting a lot of followers on Instagram (like 6k, which is a lot for someone in a town with 95k ppl) and then started to act like he was a big star. Then came the usual haters/swat callers when he streamed. Guy still acts like a bigshot despite being hated by close to everyone around him.
---
That's such a horrible name for a server.
---
Ah fair enough, life is pretty hard for warriors early on :P
---
I would def get banned from that server. When some idiot keeps pulling too many mobs/wiping the group and says some dumb shit like "My power knows no bounds!" I wouldn't be able to resist telling them to stfu and stop sucking.
---
Again, absolutely flat out wrong.
---
You now that 3/4-1/2 of the EU players are OUT because of a damn realmlist, All people I know have said, no wont play, guilds are in a disaster, and Blizz-drones like you are gonna end up saying, we told you, you think I do, but you dont. ((Those numbers are just my guess and should not be taken as a fact, I just watched the reaction of my friends, and we are all german, maybe english people are happier. hahaha stop dreaming.))
---
I killed him twice while a group sat there waiting to kill him. 
---
I said something funny, and then the guy was like "oohh look it's a rogue being a dick".   I was like ok. 
---
So, I declined his group offer and killed padfoot by myself 2x.  Didn't even have the quest.
---
&gt; They're basically the best healers at end game though.
---
Single target. DA a priest and let them finish the raid.
---
Hopefully it'll be felt by far more than Blizzard.
---
Pretty much all MMOs have been following modern WoW's example and copying all the trends I've come to hate.  Dungeon Finders, Dailies, overly fast and easy leveling, flying... aside from Pantheon (which is the only thing after Classic that I'm really optimistic about), *nobody* seems to consider that there may be an audience for old-school PvE MMO gameplay.  Nobody ever tries to appeal to the players who are disappointed in the current industry, despite many of us complaining often.  Wildstar was probably the only real past attempt, and that failed horribly since they only really had the difficult 40-man raids- they didn't actually succeed in capturing the spirit of older MMOs at all.
---
If Classic is a success, it'll show that there's still a real market for this kind of MMO.  So I'm happy about Classic not just to experience it again- though I'm still looking forward to that too- but also out of hope that it'll help push the genre back towards what we love.  We'll have Classic and Pantheon regardless, but it'd be great to have more devs get on board with this and show more players how great it used to be.
---
Look at their beta server streams or even retail streams, yes I cannot statistically prove that this is true but if you have a pair of eyes and a working brain you know what it's gonna be like.
---
Ajajajaja
---
Does blizzard really think that the number of people who go for pve servers is equal or near the number of people that play on pvp?
---
In eu we gor same number of english pvp a pve servers.
---
And here it is 5 pvp to 4 pve. Where it should have been 7pvp to 2 pve. This is more about the ratio then the actual number as i still believe the overall number od realms w're getting is hardly enough. 
---
There should have been at least double. Thats the bare minimum.
---
"Alex" ensual is a nobody and playing on his server won't matter. He'll be drown out by the sheer population and probably blacklisted by anyone that knows who he is.
---

How many beta servers were there and how many servers are there going to be on launch? You're assuming everyone is going to be piled into the same server. You're also send me that every streamer is a total asshole. Honestly some of the people talking about these streamers non-stop are being assholes themselves and really selfish
---
Since I just resubbed for the first time since halfway through Legion I was running around in current WoW a bit (without owning BfA...) but its legit impossible to entertain myself with it. Any advice for something to do?
---
I was thinking of doing some twink BG style things but I think Heirlooms killed that scene?
---
Also I played on moon guard when project 60 was happening and it was not a big deal
---
26th for eastern time zone due to global release
---
Or just use Leatrix
---
/shrug
---
so blizzard is just underestimating the number of  players going to be on in each region or they are being really fucking cheap
---
It sure is. I have never taken a warrior all the way to level 60 before. I guess I’m in for a treat. Luckily I get to leech off of my warlock rolling buddy.

I actually love forsen, been watching him since 2013/early 2014. But his fans would obliterate the server for a few weeks if he streamed it.

I really want to roll on Grobbulus. I just need to convince the entire guild to roll on an RP server =/
---
druids in greens could get to the top of arena.  They were insanely broken.  All your arena rating means is you had some competent players with you.  It's not of a reflection of your personal skill.
---
I really, really hope they're being smart and doing this, and using us as an outrage advertising machine.
---
If they are, they should announce new servers (and allow name reservation) BEFORE 27th. Otherwise, they're as inept as we're calling them now.
---
You're practically saying any social aspect is ruining the game for you. If you think 1,000 fewer streamers are going to ruin your experience than your experience is already ruined
---
it's actually more like 500m, and that is only the ones within Europe. North African, Turkish and Middle Eastern countries will play there as well. We're potentially talking about wow players amongst ONE BILLION people being crammed into 2 realms. This is ridiculous, blizzard fucked up completely on this. I doubt even 10 realms will be enough.
---
But muh rp
---
For the Horde.
---
ventrilo and TeamSpeak existed back then. discord isnt anything new.
---
This is still way better than Asmongold who openly laughs at the thought of people being on his server and getting negatively impacted by it.
---
He tried to be nice, and people kept complaining. He doesn’t want to “destroy servers”. He is pissed because people keep annoying him about releasing the one they’re for sure gonna play.
---
They don’t even know yet. So they’ll announce it Monday when they know.
---
Think about if u pulled a blue weapon early off.
---
Also means finding a group for premade content becomes easier without the lfg tool
---
&gt;Most of
---
Even if 75% of them band together and do this that leaves \~7 streamers that don't, at 11 servers that takes out 2/3rds of them. That is not even considering if someone like Asmon trolls and goes on the only RP-PVP relm.
---
So glad im on EU holy shit
---
How when you are horde? :D
---
Coming from someone who’s never used Titan Panel before, what’s it mainly used for?
---
Ach ich denke im Zweifelsfall ist es besser nachher noch einen Server aufzumachen als in 1-2 Monaten 3 halb leere Server zu haben. Das wird alles schon irgendwie. :)
---
Shitposting at its finest. Your post is toxic, his post is after being harassed by all this bullshit

I'm sticking to Alliance, as I'll be playing Horde on launch.

Darkshore and Ashenvale are both fairly friendly territories and take you to the back entrance of Orgrimmar which is close to Thrall.

STV is a massive pain to get through isn't it?
---
You are so right, Rightclikc is the worst of all of them!

Nope I’d read up on it. The calculation is convoluted and if there’s not enough people getting honor it starts rounding down.

How viable is boomkin? Both leveling and end game pvp &amp; pve

the classic devs have yet to disappoint me.

Geilo! Direkt gesubbt. Gibt mittlerweile auch n Discord für den Server: http://lucifron.classicdiscord.net/
---
the boring used to get broken up by me with the pvp. We have so much utility we can use in a fight and if you're semi-geared you can really curbstomp some fuckers who think "lol paladin freekill"
---
Your first mistake is assuming they care about leveling and not getting their 5 seconds of fame on somebody's stream.
---
Of course they do. They don't care because their fanboy armies will just give them tons of gold for free so they can be leaps and bounds ahead of the average player while putting forth minimal effort.
---
Idk who this nobody is but I hope to god he and his streamer buddies aren't rolling on the server I am. And I'm not rerolling if they are I'll just make/join a guild dedicated to slaughtering them like the overrated scrubs they are.
---
It adds 1 or 2 informations bars at the top and bottom of the screen.
---
Yes, they do, you fucking imbecile. You have no idea what name I use.
---
what's wrong with having more people? Don't you want a bustling server with a thriving economy?
---
I've watched his YT clips and from watching him he is actually quite entertaining but yeah his fans are just the lowest form of twitch scum alongside asmongolds and sodapoppins chat. its quite sad really.
---
the biggest problem is that many germans, french and italians will roll on english servers aswell. me and my friends are german and we will roll on the english pvp server. (we're about 10 people)
---
Ist das der einzige deutsche Server dann?
---
It's almost like some people use the same nickname across every game they play and want to be easily found by their friends.
---
&gt; I'm still gonna play on one of these cavemen-sounding realms.
---
LOL yeah. you're not wrong!
---
&gt; they all had a large part in making all of this even happen. 
---
No they did not.
---
I think it was roughly 10k during vanilla so I'd expect it to be about the same this time around, once layering is removed obviously.
---
I hope so boy!!
---
Bis bald :) Horde ftw

I mean, she does have a certain appeal:  https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/9/98/Faerlina_TCG.jpg
---
Is there no arrow/pointer?
---
Because things can still alter between a test and live and you are not in a real server situation playing against all other players. You won the stress test, which is super, but no real world first.
---
I guess they lied about layering. Its gonna be FOEVAH !
---

GitHub is just a place for programmers to upload their code and have the ability to make it open source. So you can actually read what the code does. So if it was malicious then someone would notice and report it.

So, if he has to be online, why doesn't he just look into the trade, guild or world channel? I think I'm just too oldschool :D
---
A shame there's so few pvp servers. They'll easily be overpopulated and ont people are scared of being on same server as streamers because of the inbalance it brings.
---
I'm working on an Addon manager atm that can update through curseforge and github. Have the curseforge part working. The twitch app is shit for classic wow since it will update classic add-ons to retail versions for some reason.
---
But it’s not even classic wow. It’s a stress test.
---
Not our problem though. Complain to Blizzard.

Does anyone know if front shredding is possible in classic?
---
I've held off of beta and stress test both of  which I could have jammed on in hopes to not ruin anything when I first land back in Azeroth lol  But I may get off work this morning and jump on.
---
Sounds like they'll be too busy to bother anyone else then. Why should we worry about them?
---
As I understand it, the standard Dps classes can get the right spec and gear then cast the right spells and do good dps.
---
The cat druid has to do all of that too...

and then farm alot(!) of consumables and do a somewhat complex rotation to keep up with regular dps classes.

---
Yeah, sure, 4.3 million at launch lol. Tell me a single game in the last decade that had that many people at launch. There's no way classic is hitting that kind of numbers, with the little advertising Blizzard is doing for it.
---
Switzerland ftw
---
Your first part I agree, your second is a bit... weird.
---
First, a small math error, 250k on 500M population is 0.05%, not 0.5%.
---
Additionally, 500M is population of *EU* alone, 600M is population of *Europe*, and ~740M is population of Europe + Russia &amp; co.
---
Since the OP used 250/12, means he used 12 realms, which includes Russian ones, I see no reason not to use only EU population instead of Europe + Russia. In which case, the percentage drops to a really small 0.0034%.
---
And for the 250k number, he said "Suppose we expect the final active players number to stabilise" which to me, implies he did mean Phase 2 population numbers, and not the launch numbers.
---
However, as you said, those numbers simply aren't going to be spread evenly, with PvP having most of the population.
---
A good realistic assumption we should make is that, as they promised, realm populations should be close to their Vanilla values, as they want to keep the same sense of community. That means around 3k concurrent players, and about 12-15k active players per realm.
---
Which means, that, come Phase 2 (and the promised worst-case scenario of disabling layering), they expect a total of about 30k EN PvP players. Which is laughable really. Even 1 PvP for FR/GER is low. That's an expected 75k PvP (Europe+Russia) population. Completely unrealistic.
---
&gt; I honestly think players who primarily play ret that have never played vanilla wow will spec into ret in classic and be like “wtf is this bullshit”. Ret was boring as hell for everything save maybe dueling. That spec / class has received so many reworks and optimization that it will be unrecognizable and borderline offensive to people who aren’t familiar with with its vanilla iteration.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; But ya if you want to play ret then just do it. You’ll eventually find some group probably. Just make friends early. In vanilla wow people were loyal to their friends, so while the random meme spec who applied to a hardcore raiding guild might not get in, the random meme spec that made friends with the GM of the hardcore raid guild at level 20 when they were still forming definitely got a raid invite.
---
&gt; Your worst case scenario is you just spec holy for raids, get the judgement set from bwl, a nice twohand weapon, and then spec ret and ignore raiding. Vanilla wow raiding wasn’t even that fun. Almost every fight until naxx was some variation of spank it, tank it, spam dispel, don’t stand in shit. A lot of us only did that shit so we can duel in capital cities, stand around while people ogle our pretty outfits, and dunk on people in PvP.
---
Holy spec also has its own unique flavors like support paladin from the T1 tier set heal. half healer half dps.
---
Is there a level cap on the stresstest?
---
are there even any notable eu streamers?
---
Well I hope you have fun! I think they extended it until Monday morning!
---
I'm not a feral druid main, but it is doable. You will need to go the extra mile. You will need consumes, and more importantly you will need a lot of manual crowd pummelers. 
---
Also world bluffs will help get your dps up. Plus you have the ability to off tank if necessary. 
---
I personally think feral is better than most people give it credit, but if you want to get up in the dps meters you will need to work harder than most classes.
---
so streamers are on herod BR is on thalnos. guess for east coast boys were going faerlina to avoid both
---
Cheers to that, hour and a half left at work :) TY
---
I can’t attest to feral dps but feral druids typically did not play that role in vanilla so if you want to strictly dps I’d play something else. Despite what people will tell you many successful guilds had typically 1 feral Druid. (Of course not all of them did). This Druid filled the role of offtank. In encounters or at times during off tanking when the Druid wasn’t needed to tank then he’d go cat and dps / provide support. But most notably they where used for tanks. They were still sort of a meme spec but probably the most respected of meme specs. I never saw one do great dps though.
---
Yes it's going until Monday
---
To be honest, he might be. Without the nostalgia to pull you through, classic at launch might not be such a nice experience for a new WoW player.
---
&gt; who has been nothing but civil to you
---
You have been trolling from the very start, you are calling me delusional, you are making up fake quotes of what i said and you refuse to read what im saying in about 20 comments.. There is absolutly nothing civil about it.. 
---
Are you a christian irl or something? You are acting like an absolute idiot and still somehow see yourself as some saint doing gods work by reporting me and thinking you know better than me how to behaive.. You are literally the worst kind of person that exists.
---
Feral tank is pretty good
---
Wouldn't that be Shimmering Flats?
---
Woop 60%+ of EU player base packed onto two servers, cant wait to get home from work and wait in queue for a couple hours then go to bed!
---
Meme good, WoW good.
---
At what point does layering become sharding?
---
Everything is fine apart from only having 2 english speaking pvp servers
---
Its also going to be my first time, Im thinking either human rogue or human priest
---
&gt; they are in for a fuckin HUGE surprise at launch.
---
At launch ? No. Layering is going to take care of that no problem. Now when phase 2, that might pose a problem.
---
We already got two.
---
I wanted to show how lighting changes with max settings compared to the vanilla graphics :)
---
ironfoe isn't needed, and frankly procs like 2x too much on the pservers, so it almost certainly ain't even worth farming.
---
Finally someone says something intelligent. There been a lack of that the last day.
---
It's okay. We all got older.
---
Gonna make lfg interesting. :)
---
Golemagg will be the "streamer" server according to a tweet from MrGM.
---
Maybe he's not a paladin or shaman.
---
I enjoy running past and seeing someone who's dying, standing next to the mob and /wave.. watch the death and keep running.
---
Makes me feel warm inside.
---
That's a lot of turds..
---
You really think it’s a zero-sum game for adding servers?
---
was just your average nekrage post where he tries to turn some honest comment about his stupidity into a jealous comment about his stupidity.
---
You could at least the comment chain you're jumping into before commenting, as it clearly addressed how it relates to layering.
---
Some people have fun engaging with a community, and they don't get paid for it.
---
&gt; I suppose if you take a day and do you 5 per hour for 12 hours you'll have enough for a few weeks of raiding.
---
There's a really good alternative.  Don't waste them when you don't need to.  Instead of treating them like crack rocks in a crack den; treat them like a fine brandy in the liquor cabinet.
---
I don't. If you read the post, I won't be owning them. I'll be passing admin to a mod who best meets the above criteria.
---
I don't think it's either, I think they're afraid there's going to be dead realms if they release too many, so they're gonna slowly add more and more realms over time until it's just right, but that's make initial release hell, but I guess they're ok with that.
---
It was the Pog that never ended. These were dark times, laddies.
---
Sadly I don't have the time to invest in classic :/
---
No way to do this. 
---
I suggest you either learn you BattleNET password or launch through the client.
---
&gt;job
---
BG9 or whatever the top one was back in the day was made up of a lot of Aussie servers, it’s gonna be damn hard to get past rank 11 on the OCE server.
---
Well tbh, it’s not the actual streamer i’m concerned about, but the horde of no-life trolls that lives their life in their chat.
---
3. Blizzard have all the numbers and we largely overestimate the number of sustained players.
---
If you aren't a neet on centrelink gl.
---
Well you've won me over
---
How do they have the numbers? The game hasn’t been released.
---
Ok so how many EU players will there be at launch? How many will there be after a year. You got some raw numbers that are not pulling from your ass? Because I guarantee you that Blizzard does. You may question the motives but to think that you have answers about statistics that blizz doesn't is the only thing that is brain dead hear.
---
Inb4 you transfer from a inflated realm and your 10k gold gets valued at 1 million on the new, deflated server
---
They're very different games, yea. I'm excited to try it out with friends.
---
Eastern Plaguelands for sure
---
I am glad they gave us the servers otherwise I would not play classic. So whatever.
---
Or when you see a bunch of lowbies of the opposite faction doing one of the chicken escort quests. Do a few emotes and stealth in vision of them. Then do nothing.  
---
Psychological torment really gets me off.
---
As someone who played vanilla and TBC on Blackrock, world pvp was an absolute waste of time initially. Enjoy wasting hours of your life at a furbolg camp because stealth high levels had an entire day to gank before their raid kicked off, I'll enjoy WSG, AB and AV when they release.
---
Ahh.. this is also important. I dont wanna be stuck on server where chats are constantly flooded by non-english language.
---
As horde or alliance?
---
Very bad for pve. Balance/resto druids were great duellers back in early vanilla from my experience.
---
Blizz could easily solve this problem by making an official Streamer realm, and add a rule to the ToS or whatever that gives them the right to forcefully transfer your character to that server if you stream gameplay with it. That way streamers who want to stream Classic will automatically be unable to affect the rest of the population, thereby making playing with streamers an opt-in scenario instead of opt-out, which is what it will be at launch.
---
Nice
---
I‘ll look into bear form more. Only took a closer look at cat so far.
---
https://youtu.be/bQ__nRnO2mE
---
This should have the Warcraft lore for classic and Warcraft 1/2/3.
---
Que?
---
I think either since the quest hub is neutral
---
I'm going for male Human Rogue, but I can't decide on the hairstyle yet, I've settled for brown hair, but the style itself is something I will decide at the last moment. xD
---
Who is this guy even?
---
As a Disc Priest main on retail and a huge fan of her Hero in Heroes of the Storm, I needed to do everything I can to make sure our guild gets into the proper server.  While our officers are stressing over streamers and high speed guilds, I'm here re-learning Gimp and spreading the word.
---
Underground lol
---
emerald dreamers?
---
Ashenvale is the night elves starter area in wc3 iirc.
---
You mean rogue gang fest ?
---
Concurrent players was around 3k yes, but everyone wasn't logged in at the same time and I believe the total number of players per realm was roughly 10k.
---
And the opposite viewpoint, that streamers wouldn't ruin the game, isn't anecdotal then? What the fuck kind of point even is that?
---
Only 2 realms for 28 countries. Bahahahahahahaha
---
I'm somewhat scared of the RP-PVP queue.
---
Wait where’s rhino.
---
&gt; re-learning Gimp  
---
Username checks out I guess
---
Sometimes, I feel lucky to be OCE region.
---
Streamers more than likely going Herod so have fun with that.
---
Privat servers have lots of players because they are free.
---
grob mob
---
There were a lot of useless areas in the CATA Stormwind, it made no sense and it was bad. It became bad when in WoTLK they added a harbour.  
---
The appeal for me in Stormwind is that the only entrance is the only exit and the city is like a pocket of air inside solid, impenetrable stone. It's that old school design of things, it feels somehow "locked" and secluded that way.
---
Hey! I just ordered a ASUS fx505dt from centrecom for $1199AU for this very same purpose. Overkill, but I thought for that price its future proofing also.
---
Calm it with the digital blackface
---
Unless they're playing it safe and will open up new realms and offer free transfers to those after a while. Full servers is an easier problem to solve than empty servers after all.
---
I'm sure they'll bow to your will. Go cry some more about it. You are special after all and everyone should give you what you want
---
Yeah windfury is terrible amirite.
---
Someone ELI5 why going to a streamers server would be so bad? Wouldn’t there be many people wanting to kill them as much as group up with them? Could be fun.
---
See! Sometimes LFG tool works as intended!
---
Probably beating a dead horse with this, but this is abysmal. :\
---
I'm going Hewod, I'm going howde, I'm gonna be an undeaf chick, I'm not tewwing yuw guys my name, and I'm going to be a wawwiow, and I'm going to fowm a guiwd and I'm gonna kiww wagnawos! uwu  
---
 tag me to uwuize comments uwu
---
Wait until you find out the deserter debuff is a cat
---
that's not how RP servers work. 
---
Really annoying to see so many people on this sub who apparently have never touched an RP server act like they know everything about RP servers and as if they have these hyper-enforced rules of always being in character. There's no such thing. RP servers have as much RP as Normal or PvP servers have duels. It's all explicitly opt-in, RP rules are only enforced by GMs if you're going out of your way to constantly ruin someone else's experience, and other than that everything is the same as regilar servers.
---
Seethe paypiggy. Just another 20$ and maybe he will say your name!
---
First in line! :)
---
Yeah just like they said that it's only going to be active when it's absolutely needed. I ABSOLUTELY need to have all of Ironforge to myself in this example...
---
«Omg blizzard is so noob do they not understand I know way better everything about server scaling, population control, software architecture and devops. They are going to ruin the game they are so stupid omg they dont care about classic»
---
That's also when WoW turned to shit - when there were planets and spaceships. A once classic fantasy game turned into Star Wars.
---
Is being a trophy wife a job?
---
If you have a healer warrior is the best dps class
---
You get a server and you get a server and you get a server and you get a server
---
This sounds like a good solution but don't think it would be enough honestly. In my opinion we should send every player with a twitch account (active or otherwise) straight to gulags.
---
Can't wait to meet you guys on our new home. &lt;3
---
I hate crybabies as much as the other guy, but not playing on a streamer server is understandable.
---
There'll be a gazillion fanboys, and the market will be fucked with the streamers leeching free shit from everyone
---
Top notch
---
Good point. I guess we will see on Monday
---
I am him \^
---
A server with only 3k active players would've been considered low pop since those 3k players would never be online at the same time. For a server to consistantly have had 2k-3k players online during normal operating hours the total playerbase would've been somewhere around 10k. 
---
I saw some numbers regarding this a few days ago from but I'm afraid I didn't keep the link. 
---
Population is not the same as logged in players. A town can have a population of 20k people, it doesn't mean that 20k are at McDonalds at the same time. A bad analogy perhaps but I hope you understand anyway.
---
Please enlighten us to why you are able to plan for servers better than Blizzard?
---
Oh god I know this is a joke but please stop!!
---
5 actually. 2 English, 1 GER 1 FRA and 1 Russian
---
How is streamer influence any worse than the influence of several large groups? It seems to me like you're no better.
---
Like I list a product and the Fanboy buys it and gives it to asmongold for free? How am I losing? I only see the downside of asmongold little minions are competing with me for Herbs or mining
---
The two obvious answers were given (EPL and Ashenvale), but Swamp of Sorrows/Blasted Lands has lore regarding the demonic invasion who initially brought the Scourge depending on how deep you'd like to get.
---
Ashenvale is a 20s zone (low 20s for alliance, mid 20s for horde), Swamp of Sorrows is ~40 for both, Blasted Lands is 50+ and EPL is 53+ and will require some questing in WPL to unlock chains in EPL and vice versa.
---
I get it, I hate that too. I played Vanilla on the eng client on a german server and I met virtually no one doing the same. Basically everyone is going to use the german client I'm afraid.
---
* Cross faction
---
Very true, all the more reason for 2pvp servers and one pve. One of each isn’t enough I don’t think.
---
I'm in the same boat pretty much, minus the kids. Going to have the trinity and picking up randoms along the way.
---
2? L_?
---
You.
---
Free faction specific transfers and faction specific login queues. Playing on either side on servers like this sucks.
---
Reddit is so toxic.  The streamers have not made up their mind yet. the Brazilian players are going to go to Thalnos,  The Spanish players are talking about going to Fearlina.  The streamers have not made up their mind.  If us normaly north american WoW players don't make a move we will loose our PVP eastern time zone servers and have nowhere to play.  I am sure the streamers don't want players upset at them. this is why they are mostly going to the same realms.  
---
I speak for a group of 2000+ eastern time zone players who are anti streamer.  You can lend us your voice and spread the word, or you can get out of the way. **we are claiming Herod for the Normal Players**
---
Okay I get what you’re saying now. I just thought your original comment was that 10k players could be online on a server at once. Sorry misunderstanding.
---
Where druids armor soft capped anyways. So this should make little to no difference.
---
I really don't understand what's the problem with playing on a streamer server. Anyway I'm playing on eu and will probably never have this problem.
---
They’ll do World PvP and shit on people who cant deal with it. Thus its their fault and they should be avoided.... simply for... playing.. the ... game...
---
Nah we really don't need to divide our population more than that. Even on retail we should probably only have 1 of each realm type, everything bar frostmourne/barth is completely dead and even barth is hemorrhaging a lot of people to frostmourne
---
_??
---
"Geet In Da Server Nauw!"
---
3-3.5k was the goal after layering is removed
---
Basically organized vs unorganized. How about returning the favour? Thats the whole point of the game you know.
---
Lvl 20 has a great hammer from the pally quest that's good til about 30-32
---
The first part of that reminds me of my Uncle Trevor, may he burn in hell.
---
Omg will Blizzard maybe launch more servers? Woooaaahhh amazing. What are all these superwizards complaining about these two pvp servers going to fill their days with then. Crazy.
---
Holy shit can you link it? :O Can't find it on curse forge.
---
I don't see why you need to imply I'm being unreasonable, it would be 100% avoidable, just don't stream on a character you aren't comfortable moving to the streamer-zone...
---
Win
---
Way to ignore my point ;) but fair enough.
---
Even on pvp servers people wont be ranking high in phase 2. It's about being the best of the best. Being on top week after week. In a game full of neckbeards. Even if you trade 80 kills a day there will be people randomly getting more kills than you. Keep in mind that you get the full 1.12 pvp gear in any phase. It's like going straight to naxx. People will want it. You dont get high rank for week after week of mediorce honor and competing with the other 159 people in your killtrade also getting the same honor. You better be in most of the major pvp occurences in the capitols and world or just forget about it. Maybe you can get rank 8 to get a head start when bgs come out. But that even may be a stretch.
---
Bruh this is so extra 😂👌💯👀😩
---
People roll on RP servers without ever seeing or realizing there is RP going on. You will be fine.
---
The eastern time zone pvp players who don't want to play with the large streamers need a place to play WoW classic.  The spanish are claiming Faerlina, and a group over 3000+ players are going to take Thalnos as a south american server.    
---
Easter time zone north american players are going to get walk all over unless the streamers find a diffrent placeto play, and we are letting the streamers know thy are not welcome on herod
---
Man, I remember playing so much wow I've dreamed of it too. Maybe it's good I don't have that much time anymore 😃
---
But on launch weekend I'll definitely play a lot 😁
---
## bruh 💪😡😤😂😂
---
The same would happen if they added TOO MANY servers and you’d have to transfer. Same coordination. But I guess people would complain if they added too many servers too. Part of what destroyed the game to begin with. All this useless whining.
---
Interesting
---
I have been laughing at this for too long, my son is now doing this.
---
!good bot
---
Thanks for the breakdown!  Any other zones you'd recommend to play for good story? Doesn't have to be directly related to wc3
---
It's called Cross Realm Phasing you'll really get a kick out of it in several years.
---
because he made it up
---
Why do Germans need their own server. I feel many Germans speak perfect English and I never had problems with them. French and Italian on the other hand is very different.
---
I doubt they'll take over the Shazzrah one, it has almost 1,000 people on it already and it's really fucking active.
---
Commenting to check on desktop later, awesome art my dude
---
I'd say more along the lines of not terrible. Many better specs. To be awesome imo they'd need to be a top 3 to maybe 5 spec which they are not.
---
Tried it, it doesn't work.
---
apes won't have as big of an impact on a massive server then they could have on a "normal" server. and apes isn't the only top guild out there. I do understand and share your concern.
---
That's trading not capitalism
---
Capitalism needs the existence of capital to exist
---
a golden jewel on the internet
---
“I wonder if Zandalar Tribe RP-PVP server is a "safe bet" for a balanced community in every sense and also not hugely overpopulated at launch or in the long run?”
---
If balanced in every sense includes mentally balanced people for you, avoid RP servers.
---
Only homless and 10 year olds want free to play games? Uhm no. I heard often enough that people dont want to try classic because it isnt "free".
---
You can just copy the files in your folder. 
---
_Classic_ -&gt; WTF -&gt; Account -&gt; some weird number file (hides your acc name) -&gt; [Servername] -&gt; Copy the char name folder. Now this folder you can edit the name to whatever your name will be in classic, and make a new folder with the server name you will be joining in classic, and put it in there. That will save all your addon settings.
---
Doom say some more please
---
I think they are going to add new PvP Servers very quickly. I don't know why everyone is always so negative.
---
Haha
---
Try play the market @Jita in Eve online, then come back crying it ain't that bad.

Exactly.

a significant portion of german-speaking players will play on english realms
---
Female orc rogue is pretty badass
---
Think about why your statement is irrelevant before you post it plz.
---
You know that by "fucking that server hard" he doesn't mean that he wants to ruin the server, but just that he is gonna try his best to pvp and dominate right?
---
yeah that changes really quick when u realize sonydigital and venruki are going grobb. we're so fucked, there's not enough servers. there will be a couple of streamers per server and a few BRs. so lit
---
Damn I would feel so betrayed if I was Korean... Waiting for classic for years only to be disappointed... What a joke :DDDD  
---
Also how is pvp realm type not the default choice in a game named World of WARcraft with iconic faction hostility... What are they smoking at blizz hq...

Well that is a terrible decision

---
Best mod ever
---
The realm lists have just been announced but a lot can change in two weeks.
---
I think it would be naive to suggest blizzard won’t be prepared. They have released 7 expansions to this game, so if anyone knows what they are doing, it’s them. There has to be contingency plans for realm locking if they actually reach absurd levels of population. The stress test was exactly that. A stress test. I don’t think love realms will behave that same way. Layers won’t be infinite, so they will have no choice but to roll out more realms. If I was a betting man? I’d wager they will wait a few days and observe the data and trends before making a decision. 
---
If new realms appeared a few days after release or even a week after, would you transfer?
---
And who have no clue what they're doing as well ;)
---
Thanks.
---
Vanilla servers had a population cap of 3k while p server did not have that population cap
---
&gt;Each layer has a capacity similar to vanilla server
---
Is that an exact number what is it? Did they say those layers never change in size, this is your claim. Where did they say this? 
---
Oh they didn't. You are taking A and asserting it = B. But we don't have grounds for that.  
---
&gt;No dynamic spawning 
---
Yet now it does have this kinda. Well its not dynamic but if you read all the post it actually is a form of dynamic. But not the modern version of it.
---
So in this case not only have you made a clearly false assertion that (I MYSELF ALSO MADE, but doesn't invalidate my argument at all unless you have no reasoning capability), You also have them saying something that isn't actually true according to this very subreddit  (and in literal sense is wrong, there are dynamic respawns, but they are linearly dynamic.) 
---
And this points out what i am trying to tell you but you remain too bigoted to reason. Just because something reads or sounds a way doesn't mean it means what you THINK you hear. You have to look at what is said and NOT said to comprehend language accurately. Now assumptions can get us a long way, and we all do work off them, but its important to recognize WHEN you are assuming. 
---
In this case they say there are no dynamic respawns. And by this we know what they are saying is there isn't a linear dynamic respawn system like pservers or retail in place. However, it turns out there IS a (actually 2 of them) dynamic respawn system in place that was also in Vanilla; however, they aren't linear like retail (more of a small off or on; but that is arguably a dynamic system.)
---
Man you keep doing me a great favor. My assertion is simple they never once said that a at release we will always keep the layers at vanilla like populations (let alone a specific number). They didn't say it there, they simple described the size of a layer... but they didn't say when it would be that size or if they would ever change its size. 
---
I am not claiming they will have them be 300-500 people at release, or 3k. I am saying you cannot claim blizzard has told you what they plan to do at release for sure. Which they did not here. But you'll never understand logic i bet.

Don't worry, if they aren't there then the brazillians and other south americans will be there, so you better sharpen your brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr skills
---
for us EU players it's a nice distraction from the eventual doom that is only 2 ENG pvp servers
---
Yeah, because windfury makes up for blessings, fearward and bubble?

Libclassicdurations [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/libclassicdurations](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/libclassicdurations) together with most recent weakauras2 beta for classic ( [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2/files/2756558](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2/files/2756558) ) is a combo I just got working for tracking debuffs

A lot of people didn’t resub for the beta including me and my group that will be playing at launch. I don’t think everyone who’s going to play is sitting there searching classic related sites. Once the game releases is when everyone will be looking up guides and what not. Also I haven’t even seen any marketing for classic at all. 
---
I’m not claiming to have more information or more accurate information than blizzard. I just don’t think their info is very accurate either.
---
Short term, the forms results and numbers
---
Long term, just my opinion
---
I see this as the 3rd PvP server because the other 2 will have massive queues.
---
You only have to avoid the really big streamers honestly. I feel bad for NA players, over here in EU it's really only Forsen we have to worry about.
---
Man I wish that kept going, that was great.
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Best threat weapon is MCP with its absurd 50% haste anyway, so it doesn’t really matter.
---
Nope
---
Yeah they could also just make streaming wow illegal and ban everyone who tries to do it.
---
That's about as likely as your idea.
---
Indeed against a tiny proportion of the population. Great run, no world first.
---
That much is known but people keep joking about it
---
If you're hellbent on going prot, I won't try to stop you, but if you're looking for 5-man viability go holy. You can still slap on plate stuff and grind it out, only difference is you can consecration grind with cheaper heals.
---
As far as professions go, engi and alch are two that will always be useful, engi being the one to give slight edges in combat. Engi compliments any class, moreso stealth ones with the rez item, but you can craft spellpower head items with very good stats later on.
---
So you understand why they don’t start with 4 servers instead of 2 then.  Fixing dead realms is a lot more difficult than adding new ones.
---
It genuinely made me go and buy the game.
---
then why is mine working? try downloading again and if you want timer use it with omnicc, mine is working without any preference changes
---
This doesn't matter when literally the vast majority of the player base wants PvP over PvE.
---
Because of authenticity and simplicity. Only because a few of us who read and write on reddit can speak „fluent“ english doesn‘t mean that all germans do have the same skills. A lot of friends of myself suffer when it comes to speaking english.
---
Writing and speaking is also an entirely different thing. While my writing is pretty decent i have lots of trouble to speak english in voice chat. I have no speaking practice.
---
Yup, gets a bit lost in translation lol
---
!RemindMe 12 hours
---
What you may find is you constantly keep running into the same people over the course of levelling and grouping or maybe running dungeons with.. it’s built over time.. the slower pace of levelling and the requirement of occasionally grouping along with no x-realm fosters this.
---
Ehhh. Whatever you can get from Engineering you can also probably just buy. You can also just buy Dragon breath chili, farm crystals that give you thorns, chug potions that do more aoe, or use trinkets for more aoe. Engineering has it's bonuses but for tanking I fail to see the point. Maybe someone else can chime in
---
Where the fuck do people keep getting this 100k number from? Nobody ever answers.
---
Cmoooon lets make best classic server ever!!!!
---
Well EU is Russia West after all! :P
---
[POWDAHH'D SUGAAAAAAAAH!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Krz-dyD-UQ&amp;t=4s)
---
I got a couple of screenshots, can post them later. :-) I was the orc warlock with goggles.
---
Why not just get new ones?
---
ow you want to see enemie timers,
---
no that wont work atm, blizz changed combat log , addons cant read spell/rank atm , so no timers
---
Youtube "FTR Int. Inc." uploaded by Not Staysafe, you can probably find more
---
Thx! just one question, i cant figure out, how to make the bars smaller?
---
Ooooh ok, that solves it.
---
My view is it’s over cautious. I don’t think a range of 6-12k player capacity for all of eupvp in phase 2 will be nearly enough. I believe they will be the most proportionally popular servers on EU. I might be wrong but I have my convictions about it.
---
The problem is im not good :(. Im a newbi :(. Feral just seems like fun. No other idea what else i should. Thought about a mage but it seems extremely boring
---
Ofc, and very well remunerated indeed.
---
Top pic is from a 1.12 server and bottom is from the current stress test. First things I notice is the huge increase in FoV, can see way more in Classic, that and the water has no transparency in Classic compared to Vanilla.
---
I’m in a rural, southern, area so internet isn’t the fastest or greatest as is. Having something closer(Chicago)and not on the other side of the map(Cali)would be great.
---
 Just hang tight. A couple of weeks after classic is released at the most all the old most popular addons are going to be functional. 
---
 I tried using some addons now on the stress test and have experienced so much not working so I don't think it's worth spending time trying to set them up at the moment. It's just frustrating. 
---
 Once classic launches I will start by only using Questie and not much else pretty much. To avoid all the bugs, addons slowing down messages etc. For early leveling you don't really need any addons.
---
Be honest, you missed. World first still up for grabs boys
---
Maybe... they are waiting to see how things look just like everyone else haha. I too want to avoid their server but I dont think it's reasonable to expect them to make an exact pick and settle on it asap. Be happy they eliminated 2/5 and take it for what it is

I was under the impression that every SA man, women and child already played on the US servers to mess with the NA players. So who would play on an SA server, US players trying to escape the SA players?!
---
&gt; Chance on hit to give you another attack.
---
&gt; This attack counts as Holy damage IIRC and acts as if you struck the target again. This means it can crit and also miss, separate from your first attack.
---
Does this differ from the way Seal of Righteousness works? Im new to vanilla Paladin, and Im strongly considering one as an alt (or even a main, tbh) - but looking at the talent trees and abilities, Seal of Command never made much sense to me. Because unless you have very high weapon damage, the *chance* for 70% extra weapon damage as holy didnt really seem to outperform Righteousness per hit (as Righteousness is on every swing).
---
I mean, Im sure it is mathematically better, as I know its the go-to Seal, and this has probably been theorycrafted for the better part of 15 years by now - it just doesnt seem all that obvious from the tooltips, to me.

Still, you claim to have a better estimation than Blizzard, even if they have far more information than  you. This is very unlikely.
---
As another poster mentioned, druids need pots and things to be competitive, and optimal gear is one of them. Optimal gear will require dungeon runs, which you'll have a tough time getting into for the previously stated reason.
---
Please don't let my post discourage you from playing the class, play whatever you want! I rolled a druid recently somewhere and had a blast on it, and like you, I found mage to be extremely boring (press spell button, drink, press spell button, load up Youtube video, repeat.) If you're looking for excitement, warrior is an extremely busy character as you progress.
---
New is something you only get to be once at something. Experience it the way you'll enjoy, even if it isn't optimal.
---
As someone on Aman'thul (we didn't get connected to another realm so we're a low pop backwater) I completely agree :)
---
Vanilla warrior: terrible early game, grueling solo game of "who dies first, me or the two mobs I'm fighting?", flourishes in groups, especially once you start to understand pulling and tanking rotations. A good warrior who pays attention to mana and health bars, who doesn't wipe the group with charge will be preferable to the guy with full epic/blue that doesn't know anything if your guild is intelligent. At 60 with gear they're a terror.
---
Vanilla rogue: Not good until MC, mediocre until all of the AQ candy drops and they get some weapons. Sap broke stealth (I'll roll one when I get home to see if it still does.) Its one claim to fame is doing more damage than the druid and trolling people in pvp.
---
Correct
---
Me too :)
---
Suck it Perth!
---
Naw the OP wants to play PvP realms but wants to avoid any serious PvPers. Hilarious really.
---
Another generation, another adventure :)
---
I suspect after name reservation day  we will see more servers.
---
The whole purpose of it is not to get your name, it's them to attain data on population forecasting.
---
The big flaw? There's more people out there coming back to classic that don't give one fuck about giving Blizzard an extra month to participate on the stress test and name reserve. Anecdotal of course but of my group of gamers, 5 friends are 100% coming in hot day one with real hype and haven't subscribed and won't until they have to.
---
You're watching a slow moving train wreck occur before your eyes.
---
South America is already unofficially clamining Thalnos. This is actually awesome, it's extremely frustrating to not be able to always communicate with your team because of something as primal as language.
---
2 PvP eastern servers for the entirety of central / eastern North America? I don't care how "unpopular" you think classic is, that's just a clear miss.
---
Oh boy :-/ it seems my friends are split... some prefer the english servers, but with only 2 of them for the entirety of europe it seems like it will be a queue extravaganza.
---
And some only want to play on the german server because apparently some of the mentality of the eastern europe people are not great, whatever that means.
---
\^ This is the type of mongoloid hes talking about in the clip and lets be real, you'll have no chance against their zerg and end up crying off to the server he announced streamers won't be
---
Low number of servers? How so?

Well you can always learn a new name.

There are 3 items that really matter in PvE for tanks; [Force Reactive Disk](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18168) is amazing threat item that scales with the number of mobs hitting you, [Thorium Grenade](https://classicdb.ch/?item=15993) to give a ranged item to pull with and finally [Goblin Sapper Charge](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10646) for on demand AoE burst.
---
The biggest of them are Grenades for paladin tanks, you really don't want to face pull packs and paladins lack ranged abilities. The only real item that you miss skipping Blacksmithing is [Glimmering Mithril Insignia](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10418), everything else that matters is BoE and don't have Blacksmithing requirements to equip.

Oil workers get critized, loggers get critized. When people feel your work is detrimental for the community (in this case streamers), they are free to critize you.

Every time there is a beta or stress test the World first resets.

---
Why does no one trust Blizzard?
---
They aren’t guessing, they’ve got numbers to back up the amount of servers, whereas we do not.
---
Would be nice to have a "world" lfg for dungeons.
---
&gt; If you don't want it, don't use it
---
This is the correct answer. It's not hurting you if they do, you can always scream in /1 for groups like everyone else anyway.
---
According to Blozz PvE is the normal way to play. Since its listed as a normal server?
---
Expanding the realmlist is always a possibility.
---
Number 2 ding ding fucking ding.
---
Enjoy layering for the entirety of your vanilla experience. Oh world bosses though? Layering of a continent except for the zones the bosses are in, enjoy.
---
Horde?
---
Looks like you speak about Russian players Atm.
---
Fwiw until phase 3 at the earliest, bear tanks will perform better than warriors.  Gear pushes warriors ahead after that point, but then you can switch to healing if you don't find groups...  Although I fully expect bear tanks in classic to be viable through naxx.
---
Horde!
---
 Question, regarding server transfers. How have server transfers been done in retail? Have they given players the opportunity to transfer every single character they have on a server, even level 1:s? Or have they used some sort off restrictions, character having to be a certain level, can only transfer a certain amount of characters etc?
---
 I would hope they have the understanding to allow you to transfer all your characters. Many players, myself included, will likely have several level 1 bank alts. No chance I would transfer if I couldn't get all my toon with me.
---
Amen.
---
Forsen is going NA servers
---
What do you have against it?       
---
It seems just like; if not the same as vQueue(widely used in vanilla and on pservers), parsing the chat and makes people looking for group more visible.
---
Did you ever play retail back in the day? Legit question. Blizzard have always given free transfers to realms when population has been an issue so why would that change? Silvermoon EU has a population of over 20k. Not sure what the concurrent figures are though.
---
How is your character going to cast spells if they took an oath of silence?
---
Yeah Lucifron is the shit
---
How does Blizzard have my number? Unsubscribed and playing day one, same with 5 of my friends. Anecdotal of course but you're telling me my story isn't going to be common? I literally have people coming out of the wood works 14 years ago that I played with asking to play and they haven't been subscribed either.
---
Merge may be a hell of a process. It totally fcks up economy and like you said guild identity as well as players integration. At this point I'm fine with just two servers, just "LET MEE IIIIN" I guess :)
---
Come on, fam......
---
What are you, an NPC?
---
It's almost as they want it to not succeed too much because Retail is monetized three times as much.
---
Many (including me tbh) expected a lot more realms, particularly in Europe. Due to language-specific servers, there are only 2 english-speaking PvP realms, which seems to be too few to many players. Consider that every PvP aficionado who does not speak German, French or Russian will basically have to play on one of these two.
---
Thex?
---
This doesn't work properly.  The map size changes but the actual mouse hover mechanism still assumes the map is its original size.  Zoom out to the continent map and try to hover over some zones and you will see what I mean.  The zones won't highlight unless the pointer is to the right of the map because the game still thinks you're using a fullscreen map.
---
What's right with Asmongold? Some of use would like to play classic WoW instead of Twitch Plays Classic WoW
---
This guy is trolling or probably some sort of obsessive mental health disorder. The first few hours were awesome, tons of people and the dynamic respawns held up fine.
---
Indeed, and these fanboys will eat this up and pay them 25 dollars en masse for an artificially created problem by Blizzard - just to be able to milk the people even more a few months down the line.
---
You already got beat to it. 
---
https://discord.gg/s5THCw
---
Yea, I was thinking the same about name reservations, although they probably got part if that data during the last/current stress test.
---
But, as you are saying, it is not like everyone is paying half a month just to name their Shaman Thex or something.
---
Probably Myzrael. According to that survey floating around it will be the lowest population as well
---
I'm sorry this has upset you so much. I crossed out a word in my completely wrong comment to make it clearer that the mechanic is a soft PPM.
---
So which server is APES going to play on so I know where not to play since I actually want to play the game
---
Smart gold farmers live in instances, good luck camping us

Grobb Mobb. Slide thru.
---
Friends and decent precent of the guild are back together! We disbanded at 10/15 in naxx... finally get another shot and all that awesome BS leading up to it. Hopefully Blizz can give the game legit meaning after naxx
---
When you open up a group with the Addon and people apply for it or whisper you with invite they will show up in the UI. If they are on your friend list or from your guild, they will show up as a different color.   
---
If you are looking for a group there is no difference made between the leaders of the group. What I could do is give groups a different color in which some of your friends are. (maybe even sort them so groups with your friends and guilds are on top of the list). This is not implemented yet tho. Good Idea!
---
That's where I'm at. Want EST/PVP but one might be Streamers and another is SA so I have to wait to pick the one left over.
---
O_O
---
[OBEY WHITEMANE](https://i.imgur.com/AgquWMg.png)
---
I mean I don't think there's really that much difference between 30ms and 70-80ms personally, but I'm not super hardcore so idk.
---
Also them: we fully expect you to pay us 25 dollars to transfer to a new server because we created artificial scarcity on the servers we provide.
---
thanks for not even listing EU servers PepeHands
---
All the old employees left. There's only a handful of them left.
---
Yeah but at that point its really too late. People want to coordinate and reserve names and start on the same server, they dont want to reroll: migrate and lose their name potentially.
---
I highly doubt anyone who does actual work on Classic has any say in amount of servers, grunts don't usually make decisions on how much money to spend on something. If we see more servers it's more likely that one of the devs went begging to the people higher on the chain of command in the company on behalf of the players.
---
What do you mean with merging groups?
---
Rl friends ? Must be nice
---
Well there is no dual spec..
---
Idk, it might be pretty hard when half the server will be Brazilian and speaking Portuguese or spanish
---
You can PvP casually. You just que up for a bg and have fun. The only thing you need is the gear. Getting the blue PvP set is extremely easy and can be done extremely casually. The only set that requires any dedication is the epic set and only gets truly hard during the last 3 ranks. 
---
Your best bet to casually PvP is to join a raid guild. Casually raid and slowly gear so you can casually PvP whenever you want.
---
This is the thing that makes me wonder who is calling the shots at Blizzard. Basically every single person i've ever talked to wants to play Classic on a PvP server. Like 75%+. Why are they still making the same amount of PvE and PvP realms? Why aren't they giving Korea a PvP realm?
---
On a popular private server the PvP realm had like 13k, and constantly capped, the PvE one had like 3k. 
---
So they either don't know whats going on or they have access to some crazy data that they're just keeping quiet about.
---
They just don't give a fuck, that's the sad truth. The current Blizzard team is entirely out of touch with all of their games, hence why key-figures leave the company all the time.
---
Ayeee
---
A way for two partially formed groups to form a full party together
---
If I were a smaller streamer, I’d want to be able to clickbait my title and go to streamer events/etc. I’m really hoping they all gravitate together for the sake of making better content (and so I don’t have to play with any of them).
---
I guess fair enough if it's for nostalgia's sake or if you don't speak english at all.
---
Personally i just can't get behind translating everything. I have the same issue with dubbed movies or translated books. Especially if they also translate the names of places and people, like for example with asoiaf and John Schnee und Königslandung.
---
Like if a person is called John Miller from Nova Scotia and he goes to life in germany, he's not automatically he's not suddenly Hans Müller from Neu Schottland.
---
Super cool picture
---
That is very well possible. I really hope Blizzard's estimations work out and we get a healthy population on each realm once the initial hype dies down.
---
the best part is him acting like APES are bad people because they're good at the game lol
---
oops I guess
---
crap
---
I don't really care if they are good people. If this is whats gonna happened on his server then that server will suck: https://youtu.be/3_vSUaMW84g?t=433
---
For the Classic hype they wont give us more server after the first month the player base will be 10%.
---
The thing is, more population is just better than even risking dead servers. Especially for classic. 40 man raids hamper things a lot
---
This is true. My biggest complain is sharding, but hopefullt it'll be turned off soon enough, so I can just wait or do unimportant things meanwhile, so not a big deal in the end. I'm playing stress test and I can't wait release. This game is so awesome. Retail WoW really lost important qualities for players like me over the time.
---
Yup You’re right that fixing dead realms is much more difficult than adding new ones. 
---
I’m not arguing that they shouldn’t play it safe. I just think they’re playing it so safe that it’s going to end up with a lot more people having to reroot to a new server than was necessary. 
---
I don’t claim to know more than Blizz. And yes I could be wrong. It’s just one man’s humble opinion and clearly some disagree with me and that’s perfectly okay.
---
Begin downloading the retail trial then Cancel it. Classic should appear in your drop down menu.
---
Nice! I'm looking forward to it. :-) keep us updated.
---
I subscribed just to try the stress test and reserve names when that's available. The big majority of players however are not going to subscribe just to do that. There are going to be a huge amount of players starting their subs when classic launches. Seems very hard to make predictions based on the name reserve. I guess that's why Blizzard is starting conservatively with just 2 PvP servers here on EU.
---
#GrobbGang
---
Only people who get 15 HKs in a week are included in the ranking calculations, not the population as a whole.
---
i like how shes not over sexualized
---
I'm with you, but we started it german and know everything that way. I understand english very well, but it would be the other way around and we would have to translate everything (even if it's easy). And yes, nostalgia !
---
I am currently working on a feature that allows groups to join other groups with that have the addon too, but its a bit more complicated and will come later down the road.
---
Powdered shugahhhh!
---
yeah they don't play on west coast servers because it's worse ping then east coast ones.
---
World pvp is a disaster as the streamer has like 50+ people following them around, their fans are generally just terrible to talk to or play with, you'll have almost no chance at scarab lord, and twitch emotes will be slammed on all chats and discussions on chats will be centered around the streamer.
---
Lmao at nerds rushing to start realm discords so they can wield some semblance of power.
---
There's already 10+ discords per realm, the only one that people will care about at all will be the one where the top players end up, and you won't know that until September.
---
You are on a different layer than them most likely. Have someone invite you to a party and you might merge onto their layer. It's like phasing it sucks but we have to deal with it for now.
---
&gt;Just looked at the code and it seems like that feature is still present. Have you tried shift+clicking the little "markers / dots" on the map and/ord minimap?
---
I did try without anything happening and also ran a reset, but it still kept the marker there.
---
But it worked just fine now that I retried it. No idea. Thanks for the quick response and the awesome addon!
---
The population WILL drop. Even in a normal MMO release the population drops off massively after a few months, let alone in a 15 year old MMO re-release that a lot of people have already played. They're not just guessing, they're looking at historical numbers. They may be underestimating Classic's long term numbers (in fact I'd bet they are) but a lot of fans are massively OVERestimating them too. 
---
Underpopulated realms are a lot bigger threat to the game in the long run than overpopulated servers at launch. With the server hardware they have now and layering, a single server can handle a much bigger population than vanilla launch servers or private servers ever could. It's a way better idea for them to have slightly too few servers at launch than have people end up on dead servers in 6 months. A lot of people won't wait around to deal with server transfers and mergers, they'll leave the game from having no one to play with way before that's even offered and they won't come back.
---
Can we at least get nicer realm names?
---
Is this for EU players as well?
---
I think you may have misunderstood my point, I'm not disagreeing with you - merely confirming your points with different numbers.
---
If you're asking me for a link to a Blizzard official post or anything similar where they have stated those numbers, no I don't have that. It's a general consensus (as you can also see in myriad other comments in this thread even) that 3k online and 12k active numbers are used as 'vanilla' numbers.
---
Nostalrius never was a good indicator of vanilla populations, and even long before classic was announced (and now), Nost's population was generally considered to be much larger than an average vanilla was - but it was a private server experience and not an officially promised authentic one.
---
Nost was a source for popularity and viability of official vanilla servers, not population numbers.
---
That doesn't affect your ability to play a class instead of a specific spec!
---
They should probably disable layering in major cities tbh. I've been an advocate for layering this whole time but I went to ironforge and there was not a soul in sight. :(
---
I really don't think there will be millions of people playing classic wow, especially not on launch.
---
Asmongold and Soda will probably have hundreds of thousands of people watching their stream (if soda streams) which is just an immense amount of advertisement and the ability to say that WoW is at the top of twitch.
---
It's not, but it all builds the foundation for retail; as demonstrated by retail.
---
What is so wrong with people having some fun?
---
Unlike Asmongold no other streamer is actively trying to disrupt the fun for others, they just keep themselves and their fanboys relatively isolated to the event they are planning to do.
---
Meanwhile the balding, withered husk of a man that is Asmongold will have his rabid fanboys pull world bosses into Stormwind just to fuck with people not involved in his stream.
---
"Chance on hit: Stuns target for 8 sec." THIS IS CRAZY
---
Well, fair enough. See you on the 27th i guess!
---
Theres th RP-PvP server then. Still fuck blizzard though.
---
I live in Thailand, so any server closer than australia is a possibility. For me, oceanic server is 350 ms.
---
I saw a group of people doing an english guild in the chinese server where I would get about 80 ms.
---
Ideally I'd like to be in a Singapore server as there should be many English speakers.
---
do we really know what they expect? maybe they have data that has them assume otherwise.
---
they will add new servers according to the interest anyway. german bc servers had like 5 full servers, 5 mediocre filled servers and 40 which were basically empty. there's no way they will create servers scarcely. they just don't know how many people are going to keep playing after two weeks.
---
I want a sub I can browse at work, not some r34 shit.
---
i've played classic back in the day, but even with the nostalgia it doesn't have the same feel to it now, at least for me. i'm not saying that bfa is good, and i like that they're bringing back classic, but i think most people are overestimating the joy they'll get out of the classic server by a lot.
---
Read his description; his pictures are abnormal stats that you will never get.
---
Yeah I have a week off and will hopefully play a lot during that time. But I'm not a hardcore nerd anymore. I just want enjoy the ride and meet some awesome people along the way.
---
You can only have ranged or melee now, not both.
---
That's not going to happen. I think one more server per category a few months after launch makes sense though, for that F R E S H experience.
---
That's quite the fantasy - but no, I've only ever seen a single line in all my time playing since they're so rare.
---
I'm going to be honest with you here and say that the people who'd ignore others for not following a made-up line policy, are probably not people I'd care about later in the game.
---
Wasn't Overwatch on release even bigger than League of Legends in PC Bangs? And if I remember  correctly a Korean team won the last Overwatch League Season. Where do you take your facts from?
---
You sound way more toxic and entitled than either of these people.
---
The world in WoW is big enough to make it possible to avoid streamers on your realm entirely, especially if it isn't half an army of popular streamers like in NA. It's just forsen basically, he will be off at bumfuck-nowhere doing random stuff and you most likely won't see him or even be in his layer.
---
Your nostalgic Vanilla experience will be ruined by Blizzard and Blizzard alone because if you believe that Layering (which is incompatible with Vanilla) is going away any time soon, you haven't been paying attention.
---
Discord can just query the windows api for a process' execution path, which is different for retail and classic. I'd assume mac/linux have similar kludges available.
---
Not forcibly merged characters but they have merged auction houses.
---
Nagrand-Caelestrasz as an example.
---
I dont understand why there is equal number of pvp and pve servers, it should be 2/3rds pvp.
---
Dwarf got that fear ward though
---
I never said it was likely, I just said it would easily solve the problem
---
And I don't see how Blizzard having a policy of containing streamers to their own realm, while still playing the same exact game, is equivalent to making streamking illegal and bannable.
---
Not if you're spending all this time in the queues. And thats the whole point. Obviously those who have made progress aren't going to switch unless there are free server transfers. But those haven't will switch and therefore also make life easier for those who choose to stay.

Layering does not affect the queue that will be if there's only two servers. It's just a server that's cut like a cake, everyone is still on the same server.
---
Thanks that’s exactly what I was hoping for. So pumped for classic
---
Pretty sure you’re thinking of the BC pre patch 2.0 which made feral druids much stronger. It was technically vanilla but the start of BC balancing we won’t be getting that
---
Point is that OSRS almost died because of players burning out due to lack of content.
---
P1 is pretty barebones, so if people don't know what to expect - the same thing might happen.

do you have alliance only one?

Wrong thread? This thread is for druids.
---
That works. Then we just use the friends list to 'whitelist' people we enjoyed playing with, as it was.
---
Did people forget that layering is still only a "cakecut" server? It wont affect the massive queue. Would be the same queue without layering.
---
Hurt your feelings? Lmao
---
The popular private servers had 10k+ players at peak times and while it was a bit too many in terms of server identity there were no queues or layering...
---
Layering is only intended to fix crowded areas. All players on X server will still be on X server, it's just split into pieces.
---
I think either Onebag or Bangnon has the option to show item rarity borders. Not exactly what you're looking for but close.
---
Don't forget the twitch emotes that will dominate all the chats
---
What you're saying is that reddit should teach this guy programming!
---
 One thing I haven't seen many people mention about launching with these few servers is the economy. It's not going to be an original experience in any way shape or form. If they have like 30 k people on a single server( wouldn't surprise me if it's going to be like 50 k) layering will solve the mob and resource situation but the economy will be an abomination because of of the huge amount of players. The AH will be flooded. Combined with people undercutting each other, which is unavoidable, prices will be crazy low. 
---
 I really enjoy the economic game, earning money through the AH, finding bargains and resell etc. All that is messed up with gigantic servers.
---
Sounds like a personal problem....
---
Nope, not really. There could setup a server for spanish speaking people and the portuguese join them. but the demand for an italien server is not there at all. "the boon" to the rest of us. you are just pathetic and mad. thats all. we didnt call a dips on server cap. the german community would just gone on an english speaking and just spoke german in the /2 /1. i played on an private server and had not speaking english at all. so i couldnt give a shit either. but you are just stupid if u dont see the problem with those 2 communites and not with blizzard. 
---
and when you awake at your international server and see all the german, french, italian, spanish etc speaking people speak in their own language, you will have a rude awakening. because not every old folk can speak english.
---
it's better if we don't get rid of layering
---
No one ever called Deadmines VC, ever

Oh definitely!
---
I smiled when I read the bonus because I knew most of the comments were gonna be about the abbreviation.
---
The abbreviation being DM for Deadmines, which is the correct abbreviation.
---
That doesn't really make any sense - the role of capitalism doesn't change the logical fallacy. It simply means that they do what they *think* is best for business.
---
Your argument is that Blizzard must be right, because of their position as a successful business, without any underlying argument supporting it. Clear-cut case of appeal to authority.
---
Are you on the spectrum or something?
---
Whoah hold up, rank 10 is not easy and casually obtained, you shouldnt be misleading people.
---
One gigantic streamer getting affected is hardly proof of anything.
---
From what I've seen it seems to change from server to server. I played on Argent Dawn EU and I don't recall ever once seeing VC used. It was DM for Deadmines and DM North, DM West etc for Dire Maul. If there was any confusion (as in Trade) people would just shift click the recruiter and check the level.
---
Oh look someone with half a brain in this thread.
---
I mean, I tried making a name with 'bitch' in it on stress test server and bliz shot me down, pretty sure their naming constraints were in full effect. Couldn't use numbers or more than two of the same letter in a row. Not sure what you think will change on live.
---
That’s why I’m trying to plan ahead, as I can be rather indecisive. Since posting this, I’ve already changed the tauren’s face and fur color (one of the faces has blue eyes with white fur, but purple eyes with all other fur colors), and the dwarf’s earrings.
---
More servers doesn't help a healthy population after launch fatigue.
---
A few hours a day pvping isn't casual by casual standards lol....
---
I am sure the groups you wont be in will be impressed by your moral stance. :)
---
yeah, i agree with korean servers, that's a very weird decision. i mean i guess doubts about blizzard's intentions are valid, i just don't panic about it because i know it's gonna get fixed. also, i have very little faith in blizzard in the first place lol. they'll probably see the reactions online and react before launch already.
---
Motivation to pay rent with paychecks, instead of fucking up my retirement is good enough motivation to pull out.
---
Besides, I’m kinda secretly hoping to burn myself out. This game will kill me, but I’ll die with a smile on my face, and a heart full of Cringe. I should burn myself out and be done with this game (for a cool minute)
---
this is a really nice screenshot, it looks very organic, like it's an actual troop of adventurers chilling at night
---
Oh.... well In that case disregard.
---
It's the one you feel lax playing, people are going to meme that pet classes are lax but they're just efficient levelers where most classes are quite lax in classic.
---
10% of the population is 10% too many.
---
While casting, mana does not regen (or if it does, it is very little).  Stop casting FOR 5 seconds and mana regen resumes whether you are in combat or not. 
---
When raiding (on long fights), to utilize mana, one or two healers would "rotate out" to regen mana (stop casting and "rest") while others continued to heal. Then those players would rotate back in, and one or two more would rotate out. 
---
Does that make sense (I tried to say it another way)?
---
To be fair, Glimmering Mithril Insignia (from a PvP perspective) can be insanely game breaking given how long the fear immunity lasts.
---
You can flag for PvP on a PvE realm. The opposite isn’t true. That’s what the guy above you was saying.
---
All of them in one album
---
This is a really interesting pvp system. Does open world pvp count towards your rank at all? And thanks for link!
---
The global one was supposed to end yesterday. The stress test started in the early evening in Europe. My guess is not many people have played. One thing I did not account for was downloads. Downloads is another way to gauge player enthusiasm.
---
Gave eastern NA one pvp realm unless you like BRBRBRBRBRBR and PogU
---
Nice, buenos aires? Un from Uruguay. Do you have a guild? We are like 20 yoruguas that are going to play

---
They don't want Classic to be more popular than retail.
---
Dead wrong
---
Does anyone know how to keep track of where some communities are playing in europe pvp ? Like i heard spanish are going for golemagg
---
Thats not what you said but i guess it makes a bit of sense if you dont follow the development a ton, because a lot of the things theyve fixed are bad decisions that the fan base you claim to not trust convinces them to fix. The only 2 things they havent budged on is loot trading windows and layering as a whole
---
Uh whitemane isnt one of the four horsemen
---
Education sucked here and still does so. There is more focus on useless political-focused stuff (whether to keep religion as a must or not, or adding mindwashing subjects or using a local language -i.e. Basque, Catalan- for such purpose) than anything else in school-time education. The laws affecting it change significantly once every new government.  The overall level is lowering a bit as well.   
---
The lack of English is mostly carelessness. There's some that learnt a different foreign language (back in time the default foreign language at school used to be French in here, it changed around 1980s) but many don't feel the need for it. The level shown by many public authorities (like the "relaxing cup of *café con leche"* by Ana Botella, which was back then mayor of Madrid, or Rajoy's lack of English-speaking skill) doesn't help either.
---
See ya
---
Well, almost everyone that played the Classic Beta who thought that the game would not be as good as they remembered it because nostalgia was the main drive behind it admitted they were wrong. They all agreed that Classic is so much more than nostalgia.
---
And even though Classic is a lot harder leveling wise, it's a lot more noob-friendly than Retail imo. You are slowly but surely introduced to new aspects of your class, and a lot of the quests are so difficult that a certain degree of mastery is required. In retail you just get a ton of abilities that you don't really need until end-game, so by the time you reach max level you have no idea how to play your class lol.

Thats why im in the grobby gang. no worries.
---
Leveling pally in vanilla is not hard at all. You can solo a lot of group quests and you only typically die when you are careless. It might not be fast but it’s not bad at all.
---
I'm fairly sure no class quests (except for the priest ones) are race specific, they're just exclusive. So if you take the one in Elwynn you won't be able to take the one in Dun Morogh etc.

Can confirm Koreans win almost everything in Overwatch and the game is still [one of the most popular](https://mobile.twitter.com/overwatchnaeri/status/1154156624258322432) in PC Bangs.
---
Should be asmond, esfand, and all the other ally streamers in one package. Pretty sure the horde streamers will be on the same server for stream content
---
I imagine it’d be a month or two until people are there. I don’t know much about the challenge level of raids other than MC being a ‘number gate’ though. But I think it would be cool if they did some sort of modifiers like extra talent points, maybe faster movement speed. Random buffs that apply to everyone on the server to give it some extra flavor but aren’t strong enough to make it trivial
---
Look at you couple of fucking Debby downers.
---
Unfortunately, Blizzard will absolutely oppose this. Classic has always been presented as a "server option" for World of Warcraft, and with very good reason. They want to bring more attention back to retail, where there are far, far more monetization.
---
I like the casual look. xD
---
She is in current WoW. (Death Knight story in Legion).
---
I would like to join the original author of this post and thank classic team. You guys are doing great job and I’m looking forward to enjoy the game.
---
I’m sure it’s hard to overcome criticism and still pour your heart into it.
---
For those of you who think people behind classic don’t deserved appreciation because blizzard is a big company, you can’t be more wrong. Anyone who ever participated on creating and delivering something in a digital world knows how important it is and that it can make a big difference. Blizzard employees are still humans, they are passionate about their work and I’m sure most of them do their best to make the greatest product possible. 
---
If you don’t like the final product and therefore don’t feel the need to appreciate anyone, that’s ok. But if the only reason for denying credit is “Blizzard is a big company and they make a lot of money”, then you should really give it a second thought.
---
Probably fair. I’m not subscribed yet either.
---
No, if they made too many servers they would merge them, not the same
---
We have the right to complain, all they said is they aren’t going on Thalnos, the fucking Brazilian server. And here we are still waiting to pick a server to play on because we don’t know if they are going to be on Herod or Faerlina. At this point their fucking over everyone else, I’m trying to run a guild here without having to worry about randomly running into 300v300 streamer battles on my way to collect ores or going to raid
---
It will also be the unofficial Brazilian realm. Most of the major Brazilian guilds voted to move to Thalnos. There's a thread about it in the Brazilian Portuguese forums.
---
I'm starting to think I'm the only one that loved vanilla for its one cohesive world.
---
That responded to the survey
---
I'm not about having a 3 hour time difference tbh.
---
Yes any kills on the opposite faction counted. Killing faction champions such as thrall ect would give you a nice fat chunk of honor as well. A bit more then killing a rank 14. 
---
This happened to be an inefficient means to ranking up after bg’s were introduced. Prior to bg’s people would do one of a few things to farm honor: roam in small hunting parties for skirmishes / easy ganks to camp, grief people in black rock mountain all night long, or start some petty 4 hour long bullshit between south shore and tarren mill. 
---
This stuff still sort of happened after bg’s were introduced but people grinding ranks just stuck to bg’s.
---
Oh didnt know that, in classic shes not part of the gang for sure
---
no u
---
People don't seem to understand that this might be the case. I'm as hyped for classic as the next person so I sure hope this isn't the case BUT blizzard might be right about this. I doubt it but still.
---
No you both
---
yeah am i right? It's probably more like 200k
---
How bout' Violent Noise?
---
A hunter for sure. Just send in your pet and you can just auto attack to finish of your target fast. + you get a 30% increased movement speed aspect at lvl 20.
---
Warlocks are a good second choice but they kill targets slower and dont get a movement speed ability.
---
Geilo, Danke für die Info!
---
Paladin, it’s made for optimizing porn knowledge during leveling

A large majority of classic wow players do not like this system but blizzard has made it clear it is here to stay for the first few weeks or months. I'm skeptical that they'll remo e it. But only time will tell

Druid having a taunt is the gamechanger. I wouldn't want to tell anyone with ambitions to become a main tank to roll Druid, but if you have a strong desire to be special for whatever reason, go Druid if you must. 
---
I tanked on all three classes during the leveling phase and endgame, and Prot-Paladin was the biggest dud easily. For early game dungeons (Deadmines etc.) it's enough to slap on a shield as Ret, for mid dungeons you will be holy because you need consecration and lategame it will simply be an unconvenient mess because the DPS classes come online (and you don't have a taunt).
---
It really makes that much of a difference.
---
Seriously, go level a warrior tank from 1-60. And while you do it, count how many times you had to use taunt (and then imagine what would have happened without it).
---
The only fun niche the prot-paladin had was in *fantastic* gear (T2,5 AQ, some T2) tanking dungeons for freshly dinged 60's.
---
Yeah shes definitely not in Classic, just became one in Legion.

As /u/Shadow__Panther pointed out in his comment, they are not exclusive on the stress test.

And when layering goes away for phase 2? What then? HOPE 90% are tourists?
---
Your post is the only post that some thought process put into it, so I will reply and let you know how an analyst may think of the situation.
---
You have most points correct but didn't cover off on risk.
---
Your final post offers solutions which is really what Blizzard's decision boils down to. Essentially, they have the option of clogged servers on release, but high retention rate (high activity, high retention) or numerous servers, but low retention rate (people spread over numerous servers hence lower pop each, hence less activity).
---
Now notably I have not mentioned server transfers, because this is a variable that affects all scenarios. A busy server can transfer off, just like a quiet server can transfer to a busy server. The difference however is that someone on a quiet server *may* quit instead of transferring to a busy server. You could argue the same for a busy server though I personally suspect the despair from excess activity outweighs the despair from no activity.
---
Merging servers forces people to make decisions they otherwise could make on their own, probably not a great idea.
---
In any case, Blizzard has seen the data on player interest via beta invites, time spent, stress tests, google searches, forum activity, website access, twitch streams etc. A multi-billion dollar listed company cannot afford to just "wing" decisions, we can sure as shit bet whoever made the decision made it on evidence and not emotion.
---
I don't think this would be possible the way Discord currently works. Since Classic is using the same client.
---
Report the bug. Im sure the creator of the addon would look into it.
---
Thanks for the reply, but damn, does that mean I’ll be up for a new computer?

Naw, it's just having erotic imagery on a sub I frequent is kinda lame. There are plenty of places to post that kind of content, but not here. It's not like I'm some prude either, but I like WoW for what it is, not someones hentai twist on it.
---
They were literally not fine, ive played on them, the economy is messed up and there is barely any materials to gather. No, blizzlike is 3500 cap per server like it was back in vanilla and what the world was designed for. Every single aspect of the world, every mob, every material etc is calculated based on having a certain ammount of players.
---
Aren’t the crypts available on retail since Legion?
---
tbf they have not claimed they will be on Herod, I was only making conjecture. Sorry for the confusion.
---
IDk I saw them indicate that theyre going bigger than vanilla realms since Birmingham said "only reason we had 2.5-3k back then was hardware limitations" but yea.. noway they do 10k. 
---
Agree in general.. just too low estimations with 2 realms
---
It's not going to be as big a deal as people make it out to be. Most of the horde will be rolling undead. I wouldnt stress over it

It's been unofficially designated via discord and reddit

---
I genuinely feel sorry for you. I just stood as the best man for my best friend at this wedding not to long ago. We met in darkshire 15 years ago while levelling because we kept bumping into each other.
---
That's most likely gone with layering. The levelling process is a fundamental piece of the community building and friendship process. I think what I'm seeing is people that never played vanilla and have no clue what they're talking about more and more on this subreddit.
---
Layering is going to systematically alter the journey in classic in a negative way. Anyone saying otherwise is a troll or didn't even play vanilla.
---
With the announcement of so few servers its essentially guaranteed layering isn't going away, potentially ever. I suspect a Frankenstein layering / sharding for zones with world bosses is being worked on.
---
Ty! I just moved here, and I’m trying to figure it out. The ping on NA servers is a bit too high
---
I always assumed wow classic ran through the same client as retail
---
Was it petty? Yes. 
---
Was it fun? Hell yes!
---
No fucking shit sherlock
---
Completely ruins the classic experience we all want. Streaming is a new thing. Its aids. Keep it away from me. My group wants to enjoy our levelling experience, die to dumb shit, fuck up talents, etc; and play a real RPG. This streamer shit needs to NOT be anywhere near us.
---
My guess is that a majority wont get a sub to pre-reg a name. So even that isnta a great indicator. Unless SO many register a name that they realize.
---
I was playing yesterday on my 2017 macbook Air. You can probably find a laptop with better spec for half the price.
---
Get off your high horse, will you. They don't owe you anything. The streamers get shit here all the time - they're doing this for a living mind you - and they get back at ungrateful bastards like you with an announcement that they'll all play on the same server AND that they'll announce it in advance.
---
Warsong server was a shit show back in the day. HUEHUEHUHUEHUEHUEHUEHUE GIBBE MONEY PLOZ, I’LL REPORT U
---
&gt; That was very sneaky! Kinda like Pearl Harbor, okay, that was sneaky too, huh. Pearl Harbor kinda sneaky I think we can all be alittle sneaky sometimes, mmhm?
---
I love my autistic brothers and sisters, so don't get me wrong here, but you know that a population is generally a bit further along the spectrum when they're heavily invested in a 15 year old argument over which acronym to use for something.

If you put LFG DM in my general chat I'll probably accept the invite so I can grief you btw.

Gouges are incapacitated so you don’t have to worry about that; I personally don’t think it’s gonna be a massive deal. The majority of orcs are gonna be warriors/shamans, but a lot of horde players you’ll see out in the open world are gonna be UD, so I wouldn’t stress over it.
---
I was doing Faerlina regardless just hoping Herod is their server
---
Swifty is so cringey. He's a weird middle aged "highschool champion ring" kind of person. He's a nobody in terms of numbers and it's kind of pathetic he's trying to be edgy.
---
That doesn't pre-fill out your username/password.
---
I think the worst part, above all these issues, is that a natural community has no chance to grow.
---
It won't be about the players, the relationship between guilds, the achievements of the community etc. - it'll always center around the streamer, with everyone else being background characters.
---
No real way of me learning it (it's keepass encrypted) so I guess I'm stuck with the client.
---
God damn Kotick, you're looking good today. Is that a fat stack of bills in your pocket or you just happy to see me?
---
My concern is going to be player count. I guess they have never mentioned will servers have player cap and what it will be. Sure layering will be thing at launch so we can expect smoother launch than with some expansions. But after layering is gone will servers cap at 3k? or 10k? Or what.
---
I am afraid they allow like 10k player/server. Of course it's great to have a lot of company but things like farming resources (herbs + ores) will be really hard with high player counts.
---
Those frags are a quest reward. You need engi for the iron grenades
---
Dual boot to get pain free experince down The road. Use win 10 for Wow and everything else for Linux
---
Yes you can have fun in bgs
---
It’s sickening. Sometimes I’ll watch twitch. Usually never read the chat. The chats is so depressing.
---
I'm not sure why you chose to feel sorry for me, but whatever.
---
We will see if people stop being social in classic wow because of layering
---
Make a call before you open “Can I win this fight with ambush/garrote into evis/rupture?” If you can, don’t go with the stun. Stun if you know you will lose without it and accept the chance of losing to hardiness.
---
Its not much a choice but it's still our choice to make I suppose.
---
What’s the ping from East Coast to that server, though...?

I think WIldstar was actually a really good MMO but it had a terrible launch which immediately turned people off + a lot of people hated the art style + the difficulty may have been a wall for some. However, I have had some of the most fun running those dungeons with friends because they are a challenge tactically and mechanically, I  think Wildstar was great.
---
Great question! As an Orc player myself I would love to give some insight on the best course of action for someone in your situation!
---
Basically, you have to assess the problem and ask yourself how you want it to end. You have a few different ways to approach it, head on, or more subtlety. 
---
The first thing I would say is your proximity. The best thing you can do is get up close without being seen.
---
Next, you'll want to focus on your appearance. Disregard what other alliance members may be doing nearby and be sure to unequip your weapons. 
---
This is when you then unstealth, in visible range of the superior Horde player, and promptly get on your knees and beg for mercy.
---
If you are lucky, you will be spared. But more often then not you shall be struck down like the weak Alliance filth you are.
---
Considering there are no Arenas I wouldn't worry too much about it
---
Yeah, in this case it was him but it has been others.
---
The system isn't exploited and works perfect if they make sure a human reviews it but it is automatic until you talk to a GM, its been proven multiple times.  This needs to change or it will be an issue, even if it only effects 1 person, it shouldn't be a possibility for anyone.
---
No. Play what you want. If you're forced to play a character you don't like you will be resentful.
---
Then just add more us est pvp servers
---
 2 pvp realms for EU...
---
Is that what you tell yourself?
---
I wish random people who have no idea what they're talking about would just stop. You're a complete moron. Blizzard is wrong sometimes because BfA? What kind of stupid logic is that? You think their game design is poor, that's fair, but it has nothing to do with the technical aspect of running the game. It's not even closely related. Please just shut the fuck up already. Blizzard knows how many servers they need to deploy, it's a huge company that employs thousands of people who know their shit better than you. They have the estimates. They have a million more data points than you. They have people who actually know how to infer predictions from those data points. They have multiple plans for multiple scenarios. This is basic shit. No one fucks up because "oops sorry guys we didn't release as many servers as we should have so now the game is fucked and will be fucked forever lol our bad" in 2019. It's been done over and over and over again, Blizzard has been using servers to host their games for over 15 years. Please just shut your face and stop being such a damn idiot.
---
100 :/
---
but they didn't really grief, Azshira and the rest were just unapologetically good at PVP, thats why there were treated as an outdoor raid boss.
---
Of course it’s useful. It’s also hard to train when leveling because of of the time and gold sink that it will be. If you’ll take leveling really slow, go ahead, but your time is better spent getting those levels because of how much easier grinding gold is at 60 rather than 20, 30, 40, etc.
---
Does Blizzard have any say in how Twitch sorts their game categories? It makes alot of sense to separate Retail from Classic, since they are basically different games.
---
It is a slight advantage being a gnome of course. But you will still have just as much fun I bet playing a human mage. Just get engineering and you’re set 👍🏽
---
If by curbstomp you mean slowly widdle down over 5 minutes then sure.
---
What people have neglected to mention too, is that SoC is holy damage. Targets generally don't have any mitigation for this type of damage. So the higher level you get, it shouldn't be that uncommon to see your SoC hit for more than  white hits. 
---
SoR and SoCru have their niches. 
---
There are two trains of though, You essentially want to pick your seals based on the wep speed that you're using.  Or pick your wep speeds based on the seals you *want* to use.
---
For me, I like SoC, so I try and hit that 3.5-4.0 swing timer so I can get the 38-45% chance for SoC to proc. But, there is a point in the like mid 2s ( I think) where SoCru is preferred because it beefs up your auto swing speed and raw attack power so well. It's super boring, but very consistent. Same with SoR (but SoR does variable damage per hit based on wep speed)
---
Who?...
---
Consider Dominos. I hadn’t actually heard of it before the stress test, but configuration is a breeze and adds an XP and cast bar as well: https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24918-DominosClassic.html
---
Poll from a very specific minority of the population isn't predictive of anything.
---
Wildstar had awful action combat and a 1 weapon type per class system. It just didn’t feel good.
---
Every old mmo except wow (until classic) has done a legacy type server already so companies know that this gameplay does draw folks. Everquests first one was over a decade ago. Just a matter of if classic can draw enough for a long enough period of time. Judging by the server count blizzard is expecting most folks to quit in a few months which isn’t unreasonable.
---
It makes *a* difference. It does not make *the* difference. If you are asking this question and you prefer humans aesthetically, you should roll Human and not look back.

---
The problem is not the streamers, i like them and their content. I'm a fan of asmon. The problem is the legion of spergs that follows the streamer everywhere. The chat will always be filled with twitch memes about the streamer every time hes on. Any zone he is in will be borderline unplayable because there will be so many people there you will either lag or not be able to farm/complete quests because his spergs are tagging everything. The faction balance of the server will likely lean heavily in his factions favor. And he will certainly get scarab lord faster than anyone else on the server. Theres probably even more cons but thats just what i could think of.
---
Not sure where you're conclusion is from? If anything 4 mil is precisely my estimate. My point is that 10 servers for a million ppl is absurd.
---
I’ve been saying this exact thing for months, this sub will disagree with you because it’s been invaded by blizzdrones but I’m sure by the time they add tokens a solid private server will be around and kicking with Blizzard values instead of nostalrius values.
---
Was able to do the class test twice as shaman (durotar to mulgore) but could not finish it because I already had totem. When I cancelled it became unavailable. Looks like they are just bugged
---
Ad company can predict whether your wife is pregnant or not just by compiling data. Blizzard can totally predict the gross number of players interested by classic
---
And you're posting on a forum dedicated to the game. I'm assuming you also visited the official forums for Classic. You think in 2019 companies aren't tracking social media presence?
---
Eastvale logging camp here I come
---
For most, avoiding streamer servers will help keep the vanilla feel intact. For instance, Asmon will essentially be a “king/ruler” figure in the server with thousands of players pledging their gold, time, and resources to him. This means that one streamer could have significant impact over the economy, player base, and world PVP activities.
---
However, streamer servers will likely see battles and events on a scale never before seen on WoW. Sure all the streamer sick ridding May befome tiresome, but it’s the only way you’ll get to participate in some 1k vs 1k world PvP.
---
As a new player, I think you’d enjoy either server.
---
There are only 2 huge streamers in classic wow asmongold and sodapoppin. Their fanbase is considered childish and toxic. 
---
There will also be a huge  faction imbalance on those servers cause they all wanna play on the side of their favorite streamer. 
---
This doesnt have to be a bad thing but i understand why people wanna avoid these servers.
---
Don’t play gnome if you’ll hate the character
---
Yeah, and for all I know nobody can tell us how layering works in context to server capacity. So we will just have to see.
---
Yeah ur right papa corporate just wants whats best for us i bet.
---
A niche market that has existed, independently of actual official support, for over a decade. People, a whole lot of them, want a genuine MMO. 10 servers are not gonna be near enough.
---
Raiding is usually 2-3 Days depending on if it’s progress or farm raids, 2-4h per raid. Most time is spent outside the raid getting consums, world buffs, pre raid and whatnot.
---

Yes,gnomes are somewhere between a lich king and Illidan,they are equall to god and Harambe so you better play them to pay respect or gnome rouges will camp your corpses till the end of your adventure with wow

You can set them up on the stress test now - usual interface &gt; add-ons folder , but you need to make sure you're downloading classic versions of the add-ons, and not all are working right now. You can check out wowinterface.com, or there are plenty of other sites (willitclassic.com) and spreadsheets if you search this sub. 
---
Once you've got stuff configured to your liking on stress test, take a copy of your add-ons folder and Dave it somewhere handy. I think you can also copy your WTF folder to save wow settings too. 
---
When game is released, simply copy your folders back into the classic folder as you would normally place add-ons. 
---
Add-ons I'm currently running:
---
- dominos classic for bars and keybinds
---
- Luna unit frames (all others I have found are not working)
---
- better vendor price 
---
- details (I'm finding some bugs with this)
---
- swing timer
---
- enemy cast bars
---
- questie
---
Can confirm the above are working to a level that I'm comfortable using them - although haven't tested party frames with Luna yet. 
---
I'm still in need of a raid frames add-on like Grid, however haven't had time to get a raid together to test any classic ones yet.
---
Except the hunters, shamans and warriors which will most likely make up a large part of the population
---
It is indeed fixed. I am guessing the people are not used to seeing the critical hits still appearing sharp.
---
With the old version the critical hits basically appeared like a regular hit but zoomed in, so it it looked different.
---
The one we have now is the same as in vanilla but with the only difference being that the critical hit font style scales properly.
---
Wishful thinking, but only a small handful will by that point.
---
It's called sunk cost fallacy. If you are in too deep and spent months on your character and the game, most people will certainly feel shitty and complain constantly but not quit.
---
Did they announce which server they will choose?
---
If you like streamer organized events that usually disrupts normal play (let's raid major cities/zones for days on end), join up with a streamer. If you want to be apart of your favorite streamer's community, join them. It'll just be a bunch of crowd ganking, zone camping, and general chaos so they can get views. I'd prefer the "celebrities" of the server be outstanding players and notorious trolls. I'd like it if everyone that gets a following does so by their actions in game rather than bringing in a clown car of twitch chat.
---
Link to the horde only please !!!
---
Who do you mean by "our"?
---
Get the fuck off my server, racist piece of shit.
---
I was getting ticks of 21 on the stress test as well, and I hadn't learned parry yet.
---
Who is talking about pre-order?
---
Blizzard have access to marketing data, which means all Google search related, all trafic to website related to classic, etc.
---
I don't say they will have to correct estimate, but I'm pretty sure that we have no right to claim that we know better
---
I was using the sress test yesterday to set up my addons for launch day and I came to the conclusion that Curse (or twitch since I guess they own them now) really need to split up the addons for WoW in a retail and a Classic category. 
---
The 'sort by version' where you can select classic leave a lot to be desired.
---
Yes it matters. But if you're gonna hate looking at a gnome all day then it's probably better to play human.
---
I'm more bothered by streamers who are just annoying. For instance, I would not mind playing around staysafe or Madseason but when Soda or Asmon forms a raid to go force what's supposed to be a server event, it's now a stream event.
---
Faerlina is the unnoffical spanish speaking LA server, Thalnos being the unoffical BR Portugese server. Streamers will probably pick Herod for the great name. Cant win them all, boys, pick your poison.
---
lmao good one
---
I don't say they will have to correct estimate, but I'm pretty sure that we have no right to claim that we know better because we have mathematically less information
---
Its marked not safe for work...
---
Undead tend to make up the large bulk of the horde with orcs being second. Might see a different meta from private servers with legit classic.
---
Hah go figure. There are some americans i enjoy a lot, and then... a lot of amerimorons ;P
---
You can click on the clock to show your local time instead.
---
Huh? I did not have that experience. Stress test worked very well for me. NPCs worked perfectly, I had very high fps consistently (300-800) and there was just a slight bit of lag at the beginning in the starting zone (maybe 100-150ms).
---
&gt;I'm not a prude, but this NSFW-tagged safe image with a slightly suggestive feel **that I chose to click on** is too much for me to bear
---
 You're a prude. Deal with it, son.
---
Well in PvP especially it's for sure better to be gnome. In PvE I'd go human and never look back. Imo.
---
Here is a macro i have had since classic. it makes all spells right click self cast (as long as you turn self cast in the setting menu)
---
/script MainMenuBarArtFrame:SetAttribute("unit2", "player");MultiBarBottomLeft:SetAttribute("unit2", "player");MultiBarBottomRight:SetAttribute("unit2" , "player");MultiBarLeft:SetAttribute("unit2", "player");MultiBarRight:SetAttribute("unit2", "player");
---
Paste it
---
Please give an south america server !!.... so they dont ruin EST
---
Causing a wipe in classic is not as bad as in retail.
---
Problem with this is the big feature of Vanilla, which was communities and reputations people get over time, that's why changing names and merging realms is such a problem, because all of the community you get is skewed and ruined in an instant, which is what they're trying to avoid (afaik) as much as possible, making too many realms poses that exact problem, but making new ones doesn't cause any of those problems, since a new community to made alongside them, no pre-existing ones.
---
Zandalar tribe is the ZG rep faction. Zandalari empire is the one in bfa.
---
Xperl is just a backported retail addon, nothing like the original.
---
The server time doesn't change your time lol! There isn't an actual time difference. People roll on east coast or west coast servers from other parts of the country.
---
If asmon says he's going online and even 20% of his 20k viewers decides to login at the same time... There's gonna be a significant queue. It makes sense. If you watch some of the guys stream there's a lot of followers who just follow him around
---
Twitch relies on a third party site called Giantbomb for their games directory. Only the owner or representative of a game can do things like add box art, and Blizzard has a very close relationship with Twitch in general.
---
So yes, definitely have a say. How much exactly is just speculation but if they want their game under World of Warcraft it'll absolutely be there.
---
I think you are overreacting. Up until this point Blizzard have shown surprising attention to the communities' desires and I find it hard to believe they will drop the ball now. Maybe they will launch more servers on the day, just as they did in this stress test?
---
 I think they anticipate a fairly large hardcore crowd at launch and then an even bigger pack during the first days, and this is why they are limiting server choice at first - so the hardcore crowd gets the chaotic experience, and the less hardcore the less chaotic experience
---
Frost mage is pretty chill.
---
Looks ARE better than min maxing! Good for you.

Wishing you good drops during launch
---
Soda said Faerlina, but I am under the impression the screenie was faked or it was a misdirection. I can’t actually see them going with anything but herod
---
So is Herod going to be 90% alliance since that’s where most of the streamers will probably end up?
---
If I want to raid I can't make raids at 2 AM and on Pacific servers it's more likely to have players from that region therefor I have fewer guild options on the server.
---
This is likely the case. When the dust settles and the layering removed if the servers are still vastly overpopulated I reckon they will add more as needed. 
---
I agree, I think they're just playing very safe and want to have real data before making any decisions.
---
TIL, I didn't actually know how that worked. From my experience thus far it's really annoying having to skim through the directory and mentally separate the Classic vs Retail streams, so I really hope they'll be separate when Classic launches.
---
Killing the tanaris chicken right before the escort is done is possibly the most evil thing a man can do.
---
Is the reason they’ll have a big impact due to what faction they’ll roll? Isn’t Asmon alliance and Soda horde? I thought that might help even it out
---

Fuck off race baiter. Nobody should have to play with non-english speaking people if they don't want to. We don't live in Brazil and so we don't want to play with Brazilians. In the blizzard forum thread the Brazilians state that they don't want to play with Americans. It's not xenophoby, it's common sense. Go back to your hole in r/politics if you can't participate outside of your "safe space"
---
Get ready for downvotes. This sub thinks 10+ million are playing classic for the next 2 years.
---
Server capacity for these servers is way larger than people think they are.
---
They will probably have to add an additional server or two. But the reality is if they make too many realms. A month or two from now you're going to see a lot of dead realms. The fewer the servers to begin with the better. I don't want to end up on a dead realm because they went gung ho on the servers at launch. And neither do many other players.
---
&gt; Does this differ from the way Seal of Righteousness works? 
---
Slightly. SoR, on private servers, was simply added holy damage on each attack. However, in classic, it turns out that each SoR proc was also an attack of its own: it can interrupt spells, proc enchants, et cetera. Therefore, the only difference is that SoR happens on every hit, for less damage, and SoC happens ~7 times per minute, regardless of attack speed.
---
Which one is better depends on your setup. A spelldamage-heavy paladin with a fast proc weapon will want to go for SoR, while a strength/AP-heavy paladin will want to get the slowest twohander they can find and slap SoC on it.

---
Firstly its well within my rights to point out blizz has misunderstood and missed estimates very often.
---
Secondly what % of players are actively googling articles/watching youtube videos/using this sub? I do all of the above and frequent a talent calculator atlleast once a day but I'm one person and i know atleast 10 that plan to play classic through and through but don't participate in such activity. 
---
Thirdly it not like we consumers are blind. conveniently Blizz-acti released their Q2 earning on the 8th there little information about potential sub number but useful information in operating costs and guidances. We have numbers from pservers and we know a large group of people interested in classic didn't use those. We know blizzard ran a closed beta meaning it did not provide accurate interest numbers, and there is no generic metric by which they can measure interest(current subs, pre-orders). Use this information and interviews with classic developers and it paint a picture that they intend to have realm population settled at near original server capacities, which with 25 servers leaves us under 100k expected players after 2months onward. That seems drasticly low looking at public information like this sub pop/nost pop/twitch views/you tube content views/original sub numbers.
---
Fourth its not like us debby downers have anything to gain from overcriticizing server numbers, as a player I want classic to succeed, and as an investor I want classic to succeed. I fear launching vastly unprepared will be very detrimental to game and server longevity.
---
I was thinking about it but with my work schedule pacific time isn't gonna work.
---
I’d bet on Herod and Faerlina
---
You can purge BoP.. which makes you immune to physical... maybe this is what you’re thinking of
---
Lookin like a snacc
---
No, I pretty much want to avoid Asmongold specifically.
---
I know there is a difference, but it seems to be in marginal levels.
---
plus int seems to give you a marginal higher dps. and escape artist, how useful it is?
---
The question would be, playing a human makes a difference to not lvling ujp to 60? how able is he to do PvP without Escape Artist and marginal less dps?
---
You forget about the honeymoon players that'll quit within a few months. That's the main point of layering during launch.
---
Uhm no we won't.
---
Salt plaint true

Even Benelux has more inhabitants than Australia, if you think Aus needs 2 pvp servers EU needs 6 English speaking pvp servers.

Isn't Nobbel87 German? The story/lore dude? Though I dunno if he will even play nor does he seem like he has fanboys or is toxic himself.

Same. Senior year of HS I got a laptop for graduation and instantly joined my bros in WoW. We have all been addicted ever since, playing off and on. We are going HARD on release.
---
&gt; it was not in vanilla back then and it shouldnt be now.
---
It was not for a lack of trying on my part. Regularly bumped posts in the old suggestion forum (though on EU, probably had close to no effect), suggesting the very thing of a barbershop.
---
I've had many poor experiences with Brazilians across many games. Does anyone have any insight as to why they are so toxic?

Ok. Current WoW servers where I used to live in MST and moved to EST but maintained the same WoW server where I went from mostly early raid times to acceptable raid times. I don't think I need statistics to say that people from a region mostly play in their designated region. What's next, gotta have hard evidence the german servers aren't being played on by mostly Canadians because it's only a server time difference.

The links on that page open only blank pages, tried two different browsers.

Haha perfect description
---
As it should be.
---
Why pay $15 a month for an non-authentic NuBlizzard version of Classic WoW when we could just go back to the free private servers which are a closer representation of the old game?
---
As long as this scenario exists, Blizzard should try their absolute best to avoid this from happening but it seems like they’re trying their best to fuck it up, we shall see.
---
Because in 1 month the population will disappear like a thanos snap and all will be well
---
2.4? 
---
Dayum son, he's hung.
---
He makes some good points but I still have a few questions. Aren’t most streamers gonna go to the same server? And aren’t the streamers pretty evenly divided between alliance and horde? It would be cool to go to a server with lots of character that had massive wars all the time.
---
Don't play a race if you dont like. You will regret it. I'm sure some people here can speak from experience.
---
ahahahahaahhahaha okay you said it first.
---
Brazilian gamers dude. wtf is up with that? It’s.... like every single time..... they just.... you know.
---
Could you upload this to streamable please? Reddit link won't work for me.
---
Why does that effect anything tho
---
this is illusion of choice... 95% of server will not toggle it so it will be a pve server...
---
Yeah but the total population is half of  Thalnos and Herod : /
---
Also if Faerlina had a population size like Thalnos and Herod I would definitely play on Alliance because I like Alliance, but i might have to roll horde if i want to participate in a healthy population server : /
---
Melee Priest.
---
I found orc warlocks to be the most frustrating.
---
The stress test was meant for population forecasting, the name reservation is a moneygrab. Especially if they will add more servers later on.

Regrowth isn't awful efficiency compared to HT, and having both hots rolling will get you more regen ticks outside 5s, which will more than make up for it. It's very easy to get 5s ticks in everything up to at least mara.
---
Love the art style! Would be amazing if a future version of the game went full cellshade style. I think it would create such amaxing vibrance in the world!
---
It's not even that. I have a bosslady that doesn't mind if I browse reddit as long as I get my work done. She is also some sort of equality crusader that if she happens to see the image as I'm half paying attention clicking through the sub that I'd catch shit for it. My only real point is that if you guys like the r34 stuff it's fine, but being the de facto official classic wow sub should have a standard for what type of content is posted here. Besides, it's not even OC, the OP one-handedly found this pic on someones deviantart and linked it here.
---
This is my realm and I'm gonna so that for sure!
---
Posting so I can remember later
---
I love you. (No homo though. Sorry.) Thank you.
---
The only reason most of them want Classic has always been to provide better content for their streams.
---
Sharding and cross-realm shenanigans on Retail make it next to impossible for them to get huge crowds to produce questionable (disruptive) 'content' and they aren't legally allowed to stream private servers without their accounts getting banned from Twitch or YouTube or getting C&amp;D's from Blizzard.
---
I love you both

It's not a big problem to get more servers these days

It's a very big problem to deal with dead or dying servers
---
gibe gold or i repot u huehueuhue
---
The system is bullshit, I had a level 1 bank toon and I would try and buy raw mats in trade on retail in bulk. I had several macros I would use each one once per minute. Got a 3hr ban because people had addons that auto blocked level 1s in chat to ignore them. But what the add-on actually did was auto right click level 1s in chat and reported them for spamming. So being on a high pop realm, I got mass reported within a click or two, and Bam 3hr ban, which I had to open a ticket and get it lifted like an hour later.... The system is trash. Def automated
---
The fact u think most of the player base will be on classic is just hilariously dumb. As someone who will take a break from retail for classic, retail won’t die and will always maintain a bigger player base. Hell, most of the people going to play classic wow never even played vanilla wow. According to reddit every single person in this sub has played vanilla. Your reaching with this thread to be honest.
---
I reported this as well
---
They don't wanna pay good money for actual ads. Letting streamers do their dirty work for free or for relatively cheap is preferred. Use your brain.
---
In beta, Paladins had a crusader strike/holy strike system where they debuffed you with crusader strike (sunder armor for holy damage basically) and then smacked you with holy strike. 
---
This was replaced last minute by the seal/judgment system. Which IMO was lame and boring and ret/prot paladins werent terribly fun to play until Wrath, when they actually had a decent number of buttons to press (DIVINE STORM)
---
This didn't stop me from maining Paladin throughout vanilla and TBC though. I was just grumpy about it, as is paladin tradition.
---
Yea, that is definitely the case and I think layering is a necessary evil. I am less worried about the first few weeks, I think Blizzard will handle that well after these stress tests and the data they have collected. They said they would drop layering after phase 1, though, and that is where the server population will really show.
---
A sense of pride and accomplishment!
---
Sorry to hear that bro
---
In 6 months time Blizzard will finally get their shit together and add 15+ servers without layering to Classic... They should just do it right now. Avoid the pain Blizzard you always put us through
---
A lot of NA players will come to RP-PvP in EU for the sole reason of there not being more than 1 in each region and to avoid streamers entirely.
---
I'm pretty sure even in the water in vanilla emotes didn't work
---
It's queue
---
The entire meme is scientifically correct.
---
Singaporean here - I'll be rolling on Grobbulus.
---
I’m with you there don. Something about it. It’s just different. I really hope that they incorporate classic attributes to maybe next expansion or something. They need to make the game feel like...idk...a game lol
---
It makes sense from their perspective. If you're only going to give them ONE server, the PvE one is the best choice. You can always turn PvP on if you play on a PvE server, but you can never turn it off if you play on a PvP server. Which doesn't make not having both server types less of a shame - but you can see the reasoning behind the choice.
---
I’ve heard lots of nightmare stories about him overriding loot council etc. At least now his guild will know this is happening from the start!

Thanks for the welcome! I cant wait!

If there is a “streamer server”, is it expected they will all roll the same faction?  It could be a balanced server if they split sides.

---

---
Can someone explain to me why the Spanish and BR players would pick East coast servers? Wouldn't west coast make more sense?
---
I'm not grasping at straws,  I'm being hyperbolic because I honestly don't know how to make you understand that people typically play in their same region. Hell, I don't even know if you have played on NA servers but from my experience there is 100% a correlation on activity based on server location. If you don't trust me, I don't care, if you want more evidence, I don't care. I will not be picking a Pacific server because it can potentially be midnight raiders for me and I don't deem that acceptable. You're soggy rhetoric isn't changing that perspective unless you've got a crystal ball that can tell me exactly how all the servers will play out and we simply don't know that, we can only play the odds.
---
And the way their quarterly reports look worse and worse each quarter, we will be laughing right back at them when Bobby Kotick gets shit from his superiors (investors and shareholders) and he takes out his anger on his subordinates i.e. Ion and his clown posse.

No doubt about that. But there are a lot of addicts. Think Asmongold. Will complain all day and get a mid-life crisis because the game he wasted his entire life on sucks now and yet he doesn't really stop.

No offense but I totally disagree - druid/paladin duels can definitely be won, just a battle of attrition. Druid v Shaman is more difficult due to purge - say goodbye to your hots and hello to some bursty damage!

This is literally what I have expected for the last year and a half.  I am not sure why the community has convinced themselves that 11 million players will be returning with 120+ realms.  
---
My guess based on the actions of Blizz players is that week 6 population will be ~20% of week 1.  They hype will die, tourists will leave, the vacation crew will go back to work, streamers will drop for other games taking their viewers with them, people will remember that while fun it's just not as engaging as it was 15 years ago.
---
People need to chill out on this realm list thing.  If on the off hand it really isn't enough they will open more.  Your precious game isn't ruined.
---
That I can get behind. Tho it would be nice to get something, at least an achievement would be nice so you can prove you did it. But I'll settle for pride.

Until someone inevitably tries to take it away from me of course by reminding me that my accomplishments in a video game have no bearing on real life.

Do not drink energy drinks, that shit is horrible for you. My advice would be to pack up on Carbs the day before and get a very long rest in and then once you start feeling tired go get some ice cold water and splash your face with it.
---
Idk I would just not subscribe if there was no pvp realm because toggling it is an illusion of choice when 99% of playerbase won't be bothered to... And to me world pvp adds a whole new dimension to this game, a sense of danger and rivalry... Meanwhile someone interested only in pve could easily suck it up and still be successful even if they are inconvenienced by a ganker from time to time...
---
Thank you!!
---
I can see that being a thing, however, layering makes this a non-issue. 8k on 1 server with sharding, I can see that being a pain in the ass, but layering would be that big of a deal.
---
IMO that boils down to how much time you have to play. If you have lots of time, play warrior because they are very gear dependent. If not, play rogue cause you can still have a ton of fun in blues.
---
We plan to drink a crap ton! But when I get drunk I tend to get reaaaaaal sleepy.
---
Interesting, thanks for the info!
---
Apex legends had 50 million in like the first two weeks. Twitch is a powerful platform.....
---
Thanks for the answer. This is my line of thought, it just doesn't seem...good enough against an orc warrior for example. I guess classic really promotes teamwork, even within rogues :P
---
have you considered leveling to 2?
---
Three months? Lol. That is what it will probably take me to get to level 60 and _maybe_ get some gear, endgame won't even have really started by then!
---
It probably wont be very challenging. The reason it was so difficult back then was because nobody knew what they were doing, the mechanics for Classic raids are really straightforward.
---
He's also making massive bank from streaming but I see your point, I'm sure a lot of his viewership are the same minus the income.

Energy drinks/caffeine help. Energizing music like hard rock/metal/dubstep. Also if you’re somewhere where you can have the lights on in the room that actually helps a lot too. A bright room with a bright computer screen will keep you awake.
---
You will have spots because you will make friends on you path to 60.  Plus you'll have a great time in pvp as a gnome warrior

The consolidated them all to Chicago and LA four or five years ago. The last holdouts were MT servers in Phoenix and ET servers in New York.

No, we can't communicate with Brazilians, they don't give a shit about communication.

There is no ranged weapon slot on retail ;D ?
---
Dynamic respawns were in vanilla, genius. Would you rather have the entire server on one layer and have everyone fighting for mobs at 5 FPS, taking hours just to get out of the starter zone? or maybe the “real” vanilla experience where the servers just randomly go down and stay off for days at a time. I understand you’re autistic, but that’s not a great excuse for wanting a shitty game for the sake of having a “real vanilla” experience.
---
Yeah, I can appreciate that.

In 3 months 75% of the player base will be gone and half of the realms will be dead. So don't worry too much about it.

Yeah, that one which used a loophole in european law to continue to exist. A loophole not available the day classic launches.

###No, it doesn't matter.
---
Lets assume you have reached the very tail end of Classic WoW, and are decked out in the best possible gear, reaching around +500 intellect.
---
* 5% bonus equals to +25 intellect.
---
* That is +0.4% crit, and +300 mana.
---
And again: This is only in the absolute **TOP END** gear. Everything below that, and it becomes even worse. So, unless you think a bonus which, for 99% of your total time played, will be so minuscule, a single missed GCD in a 5min fight will wipe it out, is worth it, the Gnome Racial is meaningless.
---
Or to put it in simpler terms:  
---
You will get more benefit from being a Gnome by your ability to run through the window-slits of Dwarfen bunkers (something male Humans can't), thus cutting a few seconds off your leveling route, than you will from this "bonus".
---
Meanwhile, as a Human you won't look derp, and any experience grind will be 10% faster, which will benefit you from the moment you hand in your first quest.
---
The raid will be cleared by PUGs in the first month.
---
With only 2 english pvp servers means that layering will be here to stay because the numbers will be too high to merge the layers together by the end of phase 1.
---
based on what do you expect answer? there are no servers available (final, not test), so how do we judge which server is better?
---
There’s over 150k people in this sub, I think that’s a lot of people ;)
---
O7
---
ELI5 why it's a bad thing having "too many" servers to begin with and then do the cross-realm merge thing they have going in retail if the population declines heavily? I can't quite wrap my brain around these things.
---
To be fair though, it's the minority you DO notice that do all the damage.
---
Which streamers are going on faer?
---
Also husband/wife combo here!  I started in MoP my husband started in vanilla.  I, too, am not great at wanting to talk to people in the game same as your wife (even though I’m not new vanilla feels like a whole new game experience to me).  This is due to the fact that starting in MoP the gaming community was not as welcoming.
---
We are playing the stress test and honestly just based off the time I’ve been in there people already seem to be genuinely nice more so than any of the more current expansions.  I was hesitant to just be throwing out invites but my husband urged me to do so (we won’t be starting in same area but have a plan to be meet up in same zone by level 5).  My suggestion to you would be just throw out group invites in starting zones to get help getting through the starting zones.  Chit chat while in the party and go from there.  The more you do that the more comfortable you will get and maybe make a few friend to begin with.  While in parties throw out your buffs on them and trade items that may be useful to them if you don’t need them.  Small things like this really seem to make a difference in making friends in vanilla.
---
What sort of additional latency should someone on the east coast expect when playing on a west coast server?
---
a 1k strawpoll can't be considered an accurate representation of the Brazilian community.
---
Raids will have the exact stats/mechanics as they did in 1.12.
---
a suggestion, shagu had a way to choose if you wanted to manually track stuff on the map, if you're able to select what to view from the quests you're tracking that would be amazing
---
Esfand is actually my favorite and the only person on twitch I sub (prime), but he seems less chill then stay safe to me. I've only watched a very little bit of stay safe though.
---
Bartender4 seems to work, I installed that one from the Twitch client (but haven't really configured/tested it yet), just make sure you get a release with -classic in the filename, not the latest which is the regular BFA version
---
Jesus i just lost all respect for him. “I hope you are on that server so i can fuck your virtual ass” they ruled out the brazilian unofficial server thanks.... these fucking assholes are dictating where we play and its trash. Ive seen streamer mobs on eso LITERALLY LAGGING the game following around in a deathball for 8 hours on cyrodiil its all artificial the experience and the fact he can be such a dick about it and they basically get whatever server they want because people literally dont want to play with them. This is so sad
---
...by adding more layers?
---
awesome!!!

This is the classic we all wanted!!!! /s
---
Im gona Play ret pally. I have no issue with healing in dungeons or raids, but I want to roll for ret gear.

On the flip side, if all the Spanish and Portuguese speaking players take over a server and make it their, it’s good for everyone.
---
Found the warlock
---
yeah it's pretty fucking shitty that they'd not announce before name reservation. just a big middle finger to the entire community.
---
Alright, thanks!
---
As long as layering doesnt last any longer than 1 month.
---
NO NO NO...! They need more servers AND THE OBVIOUS SOLUTION IS TOO PUT ALL THE RAID BOSSES IN TELDRASSIL hidden on one of the layers. That way no night elves can leave the starting zone and therefore nasa can confirm the earth is actually flat.

When it comes to RP-PvP it's often a balancing battle between the non-RPers and the RPers, and that balance is just as important as the Alliance to Horde ratio. Going too far in either direction can spell disaster for a server. 
---
If you get a server with too many "pvp bros" who don't respect RP and openly mock it, the true beauty of an RP-PvP server wont come to fruition. What a lot of people fail to realize is that the **RP**-PvPers are the people who make this server type one of a kind, and they need a space they can grow and do their thing.
---
At the same time you also need a lot PvPers who like to get out in the world and do their thing. If everyone is sitting in town RPing all day then what's the point of that PvP behind the RP.
---
I played on Emerald Dream from MoP until the end of Legion and if *was* a beautiful thing. I met some of the best PvPers while out there in the world, while also being a part of some really special events created by some amazing storytellers. 
---
I really hope all the people coming to Grobb have an open mind towards RP and even try it out a bit themselves, at the very least respect it. I'm a little worried too be honest that the "RP" in the server type will be forgotten but only time will tell I guess. 
---
Seeing the amount of servers we are getting I'm 100% positive that every one of them will have a thriving raiding/pvp guild scene. You should be able to find a guild that works for you no problem. Overall population should be fine too for the long term, especially if the RPers build a home there.
---
Just wait till our multiboxers can right click report with 40 people at once!

I think most streamers will either be able to join a decent raiding guild  or make their own of followers depending on how big their following is, especially bigger streamers like Asmon or soda(can't remember if he's streaming it or not).

Well said. It’s my hope they will go this way rather than extending layering. Am choosing to believe what blizz said here.

Or Blizzard could require disclosure of a streamer's primary server in advance of name reservation if they're actually pre-reserving Asmongold as alleged.
---
Good one
---
I remember playing a PvE realm in vanilla.
---
When we wanted to do any world PvP, we basically had to kill low level questgivers to lure 60s into fight us. It was a struggle, and probably not fun for the dudes trying to level.
---
Is there a central place to check for this kind of info? I know there is the avoid streamers site but it's be nice to know about other communities planning to focus a server so we people can join /avoid as needed
---
You know there are not really more private servers too. And they were even not regional. they worked without layering too. I dont know what you guys expect its gonna be a lot less ppl than you guys expect. Mmos are dead especially wow. We will have some trouble with a lot ppl maybe the first two months. And then it will be pretty much dead i doubt we can even fill the servers we have all over the world.
---
As a New Yorker and tauren, I concur!
---
&gt; Why does no one trust Blizzard? 
---
How many shitty expansion launches will it take for you to stop trusting Blizzard? How many day 1 expansions have gone well? I remember Legion going smoothly, and that's about it. 
---
BFA was absolute ass at launch so it's not unreasonable to worry about Classic.
---
Females is slightly larger than standard, male is slightly larger again. It's almost never an advantage for a druid though.
---
Like the other guy said, the Quebec WoW community really doesn’t have that strong of an impact on a server. Mostly because we’re a way smaller community than spanish or portuguese speakers and we don’t have a problem communicating in english outside of guild chat.
---
If you read my comment I never said that, but the version Blizzard just created (1.13) does exist and will be used for private servers in the future with no layer or potential future changes made by *Activision* Blizzard.
---
People are going to try and snipe their names on every potential server anyway so I don't see that as a reasonable excuse other than them wanting to piss the rest of us off. 
---
Pick your server, I'll stay away and fuck off but I swear to god if I pick a server because you waited to let me know I will go out of my way to be a problem for you because you went out of your way to be a problem to me.
---
I see the original damage text.
---
It's amazing how little people really remember of those days but think they're right.
---
Druids, even resto druids, farm surprisingly well. Pull a few mobs with your two dots, pop barkskin into hurricane - if needed hot up, swap to bear, and swipe down the remaining mobs.
---
There are a multitude of viable healing specs for raids, most of which do fine in PVP.
---
Thing is, with full realms and hours of queue time, that will kill many players too. Getting home after work and waiting for long and getting behind will make people very frustrated.
---
It’s mostly a vocal minority who have the bad feelings. Makes me really happy that someone could make a living playing wow classic. Good luck to you all.
---
You're not meant to talk cross faction but there's no stopping it, can always bring another guild to rid them if the problem was them ganking anyone else except each other. Most guilds that pvp as a guild (see a certain Outland EU alliance guild as an example) are usually pretty shit and just use numbers to win. So bring numbers yourself and win back.
---
Look up abandonware. Maybe that way you'll understand why official classic servers will make private vanilla servers even more illegal.

Same. Friends and I are super hyped but haven't touched or even downloaded the game yet.
---
Yes, you can make discord say you're playing PoopiePants Princess Adventure if you want... You can make it say anything.
---
Cool, you know private servers still exist to this day right? Always have, always will.
---
I meant it as in if I had to choose between BRs or Streamers, I'd rather play with the streamers on Herod. I don't know of any streamers that will be on Faerlina.
---
Growing up in that shithole would turn anyone miserable
---
Druid and Shaman buddies!
---
I didn't say it was hard. I said being forced to auto attack because you don't even have mana to judge on cooldown is horrible. Suuuuuuuch a boring feeling class to level up.
---
Can someone explain to me what’s the issue is with putting 50 servers out and then just merge them when the need arises?
---
Go in greens.  Have a 'green night' where your party only wears greens -- and you'll have some very good fights on hard mode.
---
Stress test doesn't count imo.
---
Oh, that does actually make a lot of sense, I didn't consider them using classic wow to improve private servers. But their existance is gonna be pretty questionable in most places with IP laws, same reason you don't really see private servers of current content.
---
The problem is not just that the system is automated, its that blizzard says that humans do review it when they dont.
---
Do many bad memories from bf3 when Brazilian players would just be utter trash on my team.
---
Plus: stupid sexy Tier2-set
---
Oh ok makes sense
---
Gold this man!
---
Would it be beneficial to have both the pet and the hunter tank?
---
Good job! I was curious about that as well during the stress test.
---
Definition not the only one. The lack of a cohesive world has been my number one complaint with WoW for the last decade, and is the biggest reason I wanted legacy realms.
---
You can edit discord to say you're playing any games you want. You can make it say you're busy taking a shit. Why would Discord staff need to implement?
---
I wanna see what Dire Maul looks like before it opens!
---
Shamans are a pretty hard counter due to purges, among other things. Paladins are just long AF fights.
---
Nah, he wants to force his view onto others
---
Uhh just not the Brazilians please.....I hope that’s not a bad thing to say...
---
You would be surprised how few germans people actually speak proper english. Every movie game and TV-show is translated to german so many don't care.
---
I provided a clip where it did do harm. Sure its asmongold and whatever and it got lifted after he contacted the GM, but tiuckets can take like 24h now, good luck if you are silenced and want to join some dungeon groups but cant because they dont let you talk
---
Keep your filthy achievements away from Classic
---
Read my comment again. I have been part of the management of a very large (still running) private server. The existence of official vanilla realms are gonna make it a lot harder for vanilla private servers to exist. Have you ever wondered why you barely see any current content private servers?
---
And Stress Test 3 was ridiculous the First 3 Hours or so, every single mob spawn was camped by 3-20 players
---
I'm not an IT specialist, but wouldn't merging a dead server with an alive one be equally easy? Just copy paste all characters over and delete the dead server, though as mentioned I'm not sure how this works in practice for all I know it could be very difficult.
---
The whistling is therapeutic.
---
Why is it so important?
---
you can already do that ingame
---
Yeah the Oceanic server just took a shit a few mins ago. Could talk and move but everything else lagged out. I have the same black screen as you.
---
You take it off. Is only damaged when you use le a spirit healer
---
- blessings only have a 5min duration
---
Mom's on the phone
---
Ya, i'm getting the same thing at the moment too. US servers are working as normal, but Oceanic is crashed hard right now. =s
---
The Whitemane name is cool, but will be the server's demise. High chance that Streamers will go for it.
---
I love AV especially the old pre-nerfed classic AV.  The one with landmines, re-enforcements, dungeon level bosses at objectives, quests, etc.
---
&gt; One per time zone, which means we will be on the servers with a lot of people who speak Spanish since we don't get foreign language servers like the EU. 
---
You really have no idea what you are talking about if you honestly think that by adding German, French and Russian realms English EU realms won't have any other languages on them.
---
With layering during the early phases that wont be as big of an issue as the past. A 2.5k queue for me on the stress test was a 10 minute wait. I'll gladly wait that time out now to lower the risk of being on a dead server in 3 months.
---
&gt;If Jagex can stay alive on the back of OSRS
---
thats a pretty biased narrative considering rs3 mtx
---
Humar the pridelord?
---
There's less problems with opening new servers than there is closing dead ones. I can bet there's a good number of people who 2 months in will be super excited for another fresh just cause leveling is their favourite part.
---
Difference is in "glow" effect it seems
---
So you’re a part of a “very large” private server but two comments ago you said you never considered that they’d use the 1.13 client for private servers? Cmon dude
---
Some crazy EUs somewhere out there will get servers up and running eventually idk how you can just neglect that fact but hey man if you’re right then I hope Blizzard gets it all right for our sake.
---
Layering, sharding is what retail has
---
This comment is a little indirect towards you but, Does anyone know the best place to hear updates from Blizzard.   
---
EI: The Oceanic server crashing and estimation on fix time?
---
Honestly I'm surprised not a single MMO has picked up their whole interrupt armor concept, it's so simple but makes boss fights feel more engaging IMO but also makes interrupts more commonplace &amp; team-oriented in PVE rather than just having an interrupt rotation.
---
Vuhdo is an old fav of mine from my days healing ICC

Hi, /u/Celonius
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cohx3w/is_there_any_addon_for_the_stresstest_for_hunters/). 
---
I may have found what may be causing the error, but it remains to be seen...   
---
I think I may have the basic installation wrong. For some reason I'm actually only getting the Blizzard launcher to run if I run it launch it with "Run EXE inside Wine prefix".   
---
I tried relocating the executable location in settings and using the same exe, but for some reason I'm getting an error after logging in...  
---
I'll link a video, showing what I mean instead. Much easier.
---
Thanks so much!
---
how? classic wow does not come out till the 27th, all you did was something during a stress test?
---
Same thing here. I am in the US but I'm pretty sure I was on the Oceanic server (Swamp of Sorrows) Not sure why it worked out that way. I don't think I can change it?
---
Either this is bait or your first time on this sub lol
---
The server is the sandwich.  The first 1000 people are the first slice of bread.  They next 1000 are the lettuce.  Then the ham.  Then mustard.  Then pickles.  Then bread again.
---
In phase 2 there's only one huge slice of bread.
---
Now I want a fucking sandwich...
---
Did it move?
---
Where did you download a functional Luna ?
---
Check the link in the spreadsheet to the raw data, mods added all realms.
---
Deviluar Mafia pre planning is already happening on the new classic realm discords. Alliance and horde forming factions for farming but the main thing is that it’s all tenuous til we hit 60 which everyone in the coalition vows to do by week 2.
---
Lol what a joke
---
Ahh I see
---
check ou the survey the other person posted.  or u can just believe ur own ideas and not look at what the majority says...  stubborn people gonna be stubborn.
---
ps.  plz play horde, no need for that attitude on alliance.
---
33k concurrent at any given time. 120k total.
---
As a BR player, I say no. The route and the ping are higher on west. 
---
The GMs from our guilds did a discord talk and decided to go to Thalnos
---
No, it's correct
---
The addons I have set:
---
Auctionator - AH but better
---
Bartender- Move my action bars yo
---
BlueShamans- I like that shit being blue not pink ok
---
ClassicCastbars- See what people are casting 
---
Details- Damage and healing meter
---
Leatrix Plus- Automation the addong
---
MonkeyQuest- Where's mankirk's wife
---
OmniCC- The numbers mason, what do they mean?
---
RealMobHealth- Get that % crap out of here
---
Spy- "I can smell you" morgan freeman 2016
---
Weaponswingtimer- Don't clip your auto's, man.
---
Yeah, Azeroth isn't big enough to hold 10k level 60s all farming end game areas.  It's going to be a nightmare if that's what ends up happening.  That is a very likely scenario given what we're looking at here.  The biggest servers will easily have 50k people on them at launch and if even 1 in 5 make it to 60 you've got an overcrowded server.
---
Werte Damen, werte Herren, es wird mir eine Ehre sein, Seite an Seite mit Euch zu kämpfen.
---
Sure, I fully agree! :)
---
As said, only taking the data point of „amount of stress test players“ will surely not be enough... There are prediction models, of course... :)
---
except its absolutely not true.
---
good geared warriors with a good healer behind him fucks everyone up.
---
good geared warrior in 1v1 situations without a healer loses to every single class except rogues who dont know how to play against warriors
---
their spirit stat increase is even worse than the 5% int
---
Ppl did MC back in vanilla with 0 spell power, old talents, 8 slot debuffs and shit gear stats, in classic 350 spell power on MC using blues and greens, 1.12 talents, 16 slot debuffs, 1.12 gear stats, MC will be a total joke
---
It’s Blizzards fault mostly, they gave beta access to streamers 3 months early as a marketing scheme and they became the only focal point of discussion on this subreddit for the last 3 months while genuine problems like sharding, and not to mention the Hunter class is still broken and come release it will blow up right in their face PR-wise.
---
He was always a douchebag. He had a discord that was had an 8chan level of white supremacist influence. He deleted everything after he started gaining traction as a streamer. The guy is an asshole wearing a mask.
---
Very true! Most of us don't speak english at all!
---
Thanks for the reply. Hopefully they end up doing it like that.
---
Don't forget stoneform. It's very nice in pvp. Feedback is beyond useless. Although it did give your weapon a sweet purple glow back in the day, atleast before 1.10 when they made it into a short duration cooldown. 
---
Either way, it'll be nice to see not every priest being a dwarf. I almost fear like it'll be the opposite of how it was in vanilla. Felt like 40% humans 40% nelfs 20% dwarfs, but expecting 95% dwarf 5% human/nelf come classic. So bringing fear ward to the raid might not be a huge factor when you already have 3-4 other people that have it.
---
I played mostly horde and pve in vanilla, but my friends are pushing for alliance and PvP. I'm not totally decided yet, but a couple of questions for druids:
---
- how does Moonglade work on a PvP server? Is it a no PvP zone or is there a difference instance of it for horde and alliance?
---
- are the quest lines for the shapeshift forms different for horde and alliance, or is everyone competing in the same spots?
---
If the option is there, don't go for a laptop.
---
Pc masterrace
---
Majority of people dont want to invest time on a private server, mainly because the server might die any day.
---
I'm looking forward to classic regardless but I wouldnt mind if raggy hit the gym for a few weeks before launch
---
It won't be hard more time consuming for example rep grinding for mc zg and later on naxx, and yes I know there will be people who will no life it but I'm talking about the average player.
---
There will be a large influx of pservers players that will prolly clear everything very fast but this is a small monority.
---
I keep seeing stuff about info that wasn't available and so on this is not entirely true, unless you were in say method or so the path before you has already been paved, even back in 2005 we did have Internet (shock) and places like tankspot and so on were readily available.
---
Tldr if you have a reliable raid it will not be hard at all just time consuming.
---
There are a few other posts on this sub about this exact question, search “addons” in this subreddit and you should be able to find plenty of info. 
---
Last night I downloaded my addons. They are:
---
Questie - (a basic quest helper)
---
OmniCC - (shows ability cooldowns on the ability itself) 
---
OneBag3 - (makes all your bags one frame instead of multiple, easier to manage)
---
VendorPrice - (shows the sell values of items when you scroll over them)
---
If you’re playing a warrior/hunter you should get a swing timer addon too. 
---
I don’t like too many addons tho so I am avoiding recount, DBM and the UI modification ones such as Bartender or VuhDo
---
YES. i know and use discord, but fuck using it for something that can be done in game,
---
Agility is best.  Crit, dodge, and atk power all in one.   Also the horde has a Strength of earth totem.
---
I see people spamming trade chat as early as level 40 when they want their mounts.
---
Yet still closer to a good game than live is.
---
No, Rag's players will go to Faerlina
---
And you guys call streamers entitled.
---
I turned off that feature because I don’t want people stalking my games.
---
dont do caffeine or only do very little here and there later on.     once you start feeling tiredness, stop eating and only do super low carb stuff like protein shake + cottage cheese + some raw nuts or blandly cooked unseasoned meat etc anything that doesnt really taste good and isnt processed and doesnt have carbs,  and only when you really feel getting brainfog / hunger headache that messes with your play.      without carbs the body wont go into sleep mode because food is more important than sleep for it, it wont let you sleep, this works especially if youre fat or have a shitty diet because the body is too used to having carbs and isnt comfortable with sleeping  on protein and its own fat storages only
---
The group of streamers who will omegafuck a server are all sticking together from the sounds of it, so it is very important to be able to avoid them. Their concern about their names being sniped is silly as hell. They're getting sniped on every server right away no matter what.  They've all but made it certain that it will happen with the way they're acting as well.  If they would have just come out on Friday and said hey we're all talking and we'll let you know where we're rolling tomorrow so you can make your decision on server, no one would have given a shit and there wouldn't be a riot. Them drawing this out is why this is such a big problem. I get their frustration, but they need to realize they're amplifying the frustration of thousands of others due to their decision to be coy about this.  They chose to stream, and should know what comes along with that, getting sniped included. I'm sure the dumb amount of money in donations they're getting day one of classic will make up for any sadness that they didn't get their names.
---
You've won me over

Funny here I am playing city of heroes chatting with my sg about wow launching... the same exact thing I did 15 years ago...

We used DM for deadmines and Dire Maul.

Just /who it.
---
I even got myself a new mmo mouse, so now i only need to figure out what my binds should be, and stick with it! You better hide! ;*
---
Ill see what I can do with the little time left
---
Because I can spam my shit in trade chat with my discord name and then when I get pinged on discord I can just reply and say I'm at work I'll be home in 3 hrs,
---
Or I can start organizing a group as I'm leaving work and be ready to go by the time I get home.
---
which ones? is there any rule hure to not say addons names and the url where they can be downloaded?
---
2 is just not enough. I don't think anyone is realistically expecting 10 more servers, player retention and all that. But come on, having 3 or 4 English PvP servers makes such a huge difference compared to just  2 servers...
---
YAHT off Will it classic

Is Oceania really its own region, or are those realms in reality just a part of the Americas region?

Do you know how many people currently play Everquest?  100k.
---
Do you know how many people played Nostalrius? 150k.

This is an official launch from Blizzard.  It will EASILY hit 500k at launch.  IF ONLY 20% of them stick around the servers will still be crowded and some servers will be fucking overpopulated to the point of being unplayable.  In Vanilla, server pops were low because Azeroth simply wasn't that big of a world.  We're talking 5k on a healthy server.  We're easily looking at 10k to 20k on the biggest servers.

99% certain mp5 works constantly, even while casting. Haven't done any research in healers for classic, but did play a shaman until early naxx in classic.

If you were around in original classic release, you would know they did exactly the same back in the day. Low amounts of servers at Launch, then add more when needed. I guess they will do the same
---
I think he took it from a Scarlet after executing them.
---
Blizzard is giving them their streamer names if they have enough clout.
---
Entitled would be to demand they not play on my server, I am fully willing to move around them, that's if anything being reasonable. I'd love to hear how me wanting to work with streamers to not be a problem to the other is entitlement. Plus I'm one dude, what can I really do to stop them?
---
In terms of total mana availability over a lengthy boss fight (ie real fight), human is stronger.
---
But the int is ever so slightly higher dps.

There's an option in Luna for an empty bar. See if that's checked.

Don’t waste your breath, op is an idiot if he can’t figure out that the only NA RP PVP server will constantly be full at all normal NA times....as it’s the ONLY RP PVP server.
---
I'm a total newb playing a druid with my friend and his gf, he's a vet rolling paladin and she is new going hunter. I've picked druid for the versatility of the class so I can still solo as we're not always going to play together. It's going to be a PVE server. 
---
I've read some guides on wowhead. I'm interested in dungeons, professions and questing. I have too many commitments irl to get into hardcore raiding so that won't be an issue for me.
---
What tips do you guys have for a casual druid like me?
---
to be honest, you should probably just try to reserve a name on all of them just in case
---
Luna just works though? you might be confused (as I was) that when you first load in it looks like a jumbled mess. But that's only in the configuration state. If you lock the frames it's all good.
---
OP, I don’t watch twitch streams. I dont even have a twitch account. But I do play on the same server as Asmongold,who is apparently a prominent streamer. I’ve played on the same faction as him since WoD and I’ve encountered him and his streamer base twice. 
---
The first time we were in the same raid. Raid chat was crazy with star struck fans. But this is hardly an open world issue. The second time I ran across him and a big group at dmf working on the wolf boss (who’s name I can’t remember..drops moon moon), he and his group ruthlessly farmed any horde that tried to get in in the kill.
---
Anyway, that is the sum total of my experience playing on the same server, same faction and same content for years. I’m not sure if this is typical but for me playing on a streamer server has been a non-issue. This doesn’t mean it won’t be an issue, I just have not experienced it.
---
It's gimping two of your better abilities in cheap and kidney shot. I was an undead rogue in vanilla and hated dueling orcs. I wouldn't roll a class so heavily reliant on stuns if I was planning to pvp on Alliance.
---
Happiness in AV - Turtling a R14 level Premade at Frostwolf and forcing them all to rage quit simultaneously after 2 hours.  Then going on to win the game.
---
1. I did in vanilla. 
---
2. Paladin.
---
3. Cities.
---
4. Onyxia attunement quest. 
---
5. AV bridge camping.
---
4... still way too few
---
For real bartender is one of my favorites even in retail, it'd be solid to have in classic.
---
We need to get some east coast refugees over there so we have guilds
---
The thing about that is that it is retardedly conservative.  Everquest has over 100k people playing TODAY.  
---
WoW is so much bigger than EQ.  There are going to be more than double the people actively playing Classic. 150k-200k is the LEAST amount of people that could possibly play.  But it is entirely within the realm of possibility that up to 500k to even a million players resubscribe and get to 60 just because of how big WoW is and how many people want to relive it.
---
This looks awesome so far.  About to try it out and will try to give some feedback!  Quick question, you mention a lot of features you are implementing.  Which features do you believe will be implemented by launch day?  Thanks for your work!
---
Strength.
---
Weapon swingtimer, weapontimer... and so on
---
She’s definitely thicc. What you’re probably used to is referred to as Morbidly Obese, and no it’s not attractive.
---
The best ones survived solely off donations that didn't have any in game incentives
---
I think its supposed to be like that.
---
People said this would happen the moment Blizzard said they weren't going to have servers designated for certain regions months ago.  More servers are needed, period.
---
My favorite is LunaUnitFrames, I found that on private servers it made the most sense to me and the updated version worked well for me in the current stress test.
---

You are forgetting that PServer players are mostly min/maxers. You have to think that 90% of the player base probably won't even know the value of Devilsaur leather.

---
&gt; THEY WILL BUY LOW LEVEL MATS TO LEVEL ENCHANTING!! 
---
Yes, they will, but they will not

While leveling.

 Guys i need help please. Ive been always horde but im interested in Alliance lore and leveling zones. However I feel more at home at horde side... I play Shazzrah. Do i roll horde or alliange mage ?
---
Facts
---
Mind shooting me a link to where you got it from? Maybe I had an old version installed. My biggest complaint with the default frames is how hard it is to see debuffs to dispell as a healer.
---
Oh hey, that just happened to me
---
What is the name of the realm, and what does it mean in English?
---
The way you're inquiring about your question seem's a bit doomy and gloomy.    I think the majority of people probably don't want to have to start there class just to have it deleted before the actual release.     
---
let's hope that classic will re-ignite the spark for Oldschool players and New players alike. I feel although there would a lot of people who have passed away (RIP),  And a lot of people with too much responsibility now, or physically/mentally unable to play anymore, as the average age group for Wow back in the day was surprisingly high when put into comparison of other games around its era.
---
I probably made a mistake in the formula it’s using to calculate. I’ll check it into in a bit.
---
I mean, I'd say it's very unlikely that the streamers are gonna wanna roll PvE, so...yeah. Basically.
---
But it's a lot easier to open a new server to ease overpopulation than salvage low population servers.  Server merges piss people off due to a few factors (largely overlapping names I think) so downsizing from more servers to less is always a worse more than upsizing to more servers.
---
Ditto that.
---
Exercise, espresso, willpower, save a Netflix series to plow through on the second screen.
---
Did they recycle naxx content or because its the legion blizz thought they needed 4 horsemen again?
---
wow is wow classic as far as the twitch app is concerned. Go to wow, and in the top right, you want to choose the correct directory where your wow classic game is saved. If it shows you have no addons, or doesn't show all the addons you have it's because not all addons are added to Twitch's directory. A lot of the classic addons are being pulled from Github currently. If you go to the Get More Addons tab you can search for addons, but you'll need to dig for ones that actually work with classic.
---
Holy fuck I can imagine. He would have a counter guild for sure, and I feel like the only place he'd be remotely safe is inside instances, but even then tons of people would need his shit just for laughs.
---
I was making a statement.
---
Pretty sure this was only for games that weren't "Verified", unless I've been doing it wrong.
---
Again. Where specifically are you getting this "supposed to" from. Show me any kind of official thing which said 12:00 yesterday.
---
You saying ret pallies suck is only true for pve.  Print/holy as a pally and you will be a fucking cockroach healer.  It's super fun. 1v1 is for duels mostly.  Rarely will you find yourself 1v1ing in a real pvp situation.
---
Only one RP server. Welp, I guess I don't have to worry about choosing.
---
We gotta rally for Blizzard to fix it.
---
Sodapoppin has said that they will be on Faerlina so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
For people claiming the damage text is correct, here is a quick comparison from a private server (Yeah yeah, it's a private server, but the low res damage text is correct there) compared to classic stress test
---
https://imgur.com/a/dKCFBdp
---
The damage text in retail WoW was changed to HD I think in MoP, and that's the damage text we have in Classic, so it's not the correct low res one from vanilla.
---
Ret paladin is so chill you can literally fall asleep while waiting to press your one button.
---
I really do appreciate your optimism and I hope you're right. Blizzard has actual data (beta opt-ins, stress testers, current subs &amp; forum activity).  We don't have anything to go off of except our hopes and dreams. 
---
I'm gonna trust the people who have actual data for now. They'll have even more after name reservations on Monday, so I think they'll do what they need to do for the Classic community.

In fact you can make nades (not the M73 though), however they are made from solid blasting powder, which is the most expensive of all blasting powders, because it's used in goblin sapper charges.
---
It gets expensive quickly, some crappy copper bomb is preferable.
---
That's like asking why did god make them retarded.
---
People are very worried about streamer communities ruining the "vanilla" experience.
---
Or go to the starting zone as a rogue with a mechanic sheep
---
jajajajajajaja
---
huehuehuehuehue
---
Let me clarify. While retail might be very noob friendly leveling wise, the experience is not immersive at all, and it is completely void of fulfilling progression, not to mention how unchallenging it is. It's straight up boring, which is why blizz has such a hard time recruiting new players to the game.
---
So in a sense it IS more friendly for new players, because Classic rewards effort, something retail hasn't done the right way since Cata imo.
---
Just have world-tolerable names (Hiro is fine, Bbqpwn probably not) and be able to tolerate when others RP and you should be good to go.
---
I hope this goes well for you but I'm concerned it won't.
---
I didn't pick the wrong faction... but all of my friends did and I had to make a choice between playing alone or playing with them. R.I.P. me being a Shaman.
---
So they either have 10 more servers ready to instantly open, or they plan on making layering permanent.
---
Nice. Does anyone else’s Battle.net status show them as just online and not playing Wow Classic when classic is running?
---
not checked. Target of Party is also not working
---
You sound retarded. Ping is important to a lot of people and the guy is describing a raid environment where he has to stay up super late because the guild is based off west coast time and he lives in east. YOU make zero sense and should stfu being a dick about something that you obviously don’t understand.  Can’t believe you tried to argue that server location isn’t important. Lmao

All horde, no englando
---
I mean he's a shitbag but this is pretty dumb, even as a joke.
---
Git Gud.
---
But seriously, pick what you like the look of. You gotta stare at this character for months or maybe even years. You might as well enjoy it. Who gives a shit if WotF is in the game or not. If lock sounds like a blast to you, play lock! Don't forget that like, 50% of the people on PvP realms suck anyway, so just by being a good player (git gud, remember) you'll be able to take 'em down no problem. Same with rogue; if you wanna play ally rogue just do it. Who cares that orcs have that stun resist? Go out in the world and gank ye some trolls or something. You're the one who gets to pick your fights as a rogue anyway.
---
You can't let numbers tell you what to do when those numbers mattering assumes equal skill level \*at least\* in fights, plus RNG winning out in many cases. Just roll what sounds \*fun\* to you and think about the ways in which you'll kick ass and then play with that in mind.
---
the truth is that streams will go wherever the people are because that's how they get to make content
---
I have my original naga. But I wouldn’t say that play style is outdated.
---
Just gank some other races, as a rogue you can basically choose what you are fighting.
---
where's my daddy server :(
---
Much of South America is further east than eastern US. Would'nt make any sense to go Pacific.
---
From my understanding tips said soda, himself most of the modern pvpers will be rollong horde on that server.
---
This seems like the ideal raid setup for the main tank group,
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/raid-composition#0gFtvB](https://classic.wowhead.com/raid-composition#0gFtvB)
---
So, why is this not the norm?   Why did this not become the meta on the pirated servers on the horde?
---
Trouble communicating with ESL players or players that only know how to fake speaking your language is hard.  
---
You will need to communicate with your party often. So thats why its rough.
---
You get some increased range in cat/bear form as tauren, with Male being more range
---
They weren't on the stress test
---
Yeah sure the majority of private server players are broke and don't want to spend 13 Deutch mark or freedom bucks a month
---
Fuck that give then their own server. 
---
They killed Warsong back in the day with their toxicity, not wanting that again
---
I mean I don't see a reason to bind forward to s unless it's more comfortable for you personally than w.  I keep s bound to back for some niche things but I absolutely rebind a and d to strafe.
---
no hablo ingles
---
I would rather not play at all... Anyways I'm European so I have 2 pvp servers to choose from... I just feel sorry for Koreans
---
That sounds a bit more reasonable, I will try that next
---
But you realize it's likely a defensive measure, not against someone stealing his name, but against the group of rabid streamer-haters trying to organize gank squads on, mostly, Soda and Asmon? I would say it isn't that unreasonable for them to wait a little longer- which they might not even do. Neither of them streamed since serverlist announcement, and Soda mentioned being busy and unable to before the servers were announced. It's not even been a full day, and everyone assumes they aren't going to say anything. I hate coming in to defend them so much, because really the two big boys are not blameless in their actions, but this subreddit is just off their rocker sometimes.
---
oh good lord dude.
---
Every single stress test was 24 hours
---
They announced they were #extending it
---
#EXTENDING
---
Do you know what that means. 
---
Im done with you
---
Sounds delicious!
---
Streamer Server tho sooo....
---
the wolf ruined the shot
---
This sub to you:  fuck off.  It is marked NSFW, dont click on it.
---
I'm a #nochanges guy, but the only change i'd be okay with is if they added a small shrine somewhere off the beaten path in the game world where we can go to worship Omar and the classic team.
---
&gt;Buy a mmo mouse 
---
Or
---
&gt;stop listening to outdated advice
---
Pick 1
---
Merging is not a bad solution, names are the only downside, the community feeling would not be broken like with layers.
---
Eliminating movement keys for spells is certainly outdated if you are playing with an mmo mouse and making smart binds. On retail for instance all my binds are comfortable and I have enough free binds to keep 1-3 as arena targeting with full WASD+QE for movement.
---
48 hours extra for "no reason" with maybe 1-5 hours played each week...
---
I'll pass.
---
It's still on retail as well. Ran after me on a LVL 20 as I crossed a bridge.
---
Yeah sure, you can point mistakes Blizzard did, that don't give you a better estimation.
---
&gt;Secondly what % of players are actively googling articles/watching youtube videos/using this sub? I do all of the above and frequent a talent calculator atlleast once a day but I'm one person and i know atleast 10 that plan to play classic through and through but don't participate in such activity.
---
Yeah, data marketing is specially made to estimate those numbers, far more precisely than you do.
---
&gt;Thirdly it not like we consumers are blind. conveniently Blizz-acti released their Q2 earning on the 8th there little information about potential sub number but useful information in operating costs and guidances. We have numbers from pservers and we know a large group of people interested in classic didn't use those. We know blizzard ran a closed beta meaning it did not provide accurate interest numbers, and there is no generic metric by which they can measure interest(current subs, pre-orders). Use this information and interviews with classic developers and it paint a picture that they intend to have realm population settled at near original server capacities, which with 25 servers leaves us under 100k expected players after 2months onward. That seems drasticly low looking at public information like this sub pop/nost pop/twitch views/you tube content views/original sub numbers.
---
Blizzard also have twitch / nost / sub / vanilla number. There is litteraly no data you have that they don't. The main difference is that they have to size server correctly and Its a matter of potentially millions of dollar, and your estimation is purely hype-builded.
---
Blizzard can do mistake, but we're talking about a company betting tons of money on a game launch. I'm pretty sure they are thinking about this far far far more seriously than you.
---
&gt;Fourth its not like us debby downers have anything to gain from overcriticizing server numbers, as a player I want classic to succeed, and as an investor I want classic to succeed. I fear launching vastly unprepared will be very detrimental to game and server longevity.
---
They also fear the same thing.
---
Don’t forget to write your weekly quota of “they listened guys” posts and comments. After all they totally listened and gave us language servers!!! And rp-pvp servers!!! Those weren’t no brainers that should never have been in question, no, they were a gift to us from our loving corporate emperors.
---
That's the current established meta in pre-1.12 AVs, but okay.
---
First you need to check your drivers to be sure your up to date and using the nVidia provided drivers, not the GNU drivers.  Look up some guides on how to make sure Optimus is working correctly in linux.  Otherwise the game will not work correctly.
---
Be sure you have a Wine client installed on your computer.  You can grab this in the software center, or build it yourself, or use PPA.
---
Please pay attention to these three pages I have linked you for information on your install.  Each has steps required to properly run the game in Lutris.  Also there may be specific instructions for you as your on a laptop that likely has (2) GPUs for power saving.

Lmao its the only server for rppvp. There is no other choice. I guess the rp server will only have east coast players.
---
What makes you think the hype will die fast? It certainly didnt die 15 years ago, nor on any good pserver
---
How can I ate you?
---
VuhDo is the best tbh. I've been using it since Wrath and I can't do without it! :) It's nice even for some dps because it shows who has threat and you can bind decurse/etc to it too! :D
---
Instead of flying they should have added gliding or sailing or whatever. Something which involves playerinteraction.
---
True. I meant equipped.
---
Never.
---
Why would you not want this? Instead of screaming in /1 you look at this gui? Its not like its the normal automatic lfg tool in retail.
---
No lie, I would definitely need all his shit. I know he's going to quit anyway, I will farm those emotes.
---
Saving this comment for when we know Blizzard fucked up
---
God, you were doing so well OP.
---
mmos for me have to have a cool world that I can really get into. Space rabbits were just such a weird concept I couldn’t even make it to level cap.
---
Nah, they will get their own fan boys on it. And plus Herod is a popular choice regardless of streamers. We should all riot and claim Faerlina
---
Just as I expected. Can't do something as simple as linking a post supporting your own claim.
---
Polar opposite in my mind.
---
You don’t need to sacrifice movement binds, just use shift and control to bind keys or use a multi button mouse, they’re cheap now so it’s easier to get one
---
No sound on my troll hunter as well
---
No one wants merges, as past experience has shown.
---
Is there a guide on cat dps somewhere? Have been looking, but mostly found BiS lists.
---
&gt;I don't know about toxic
---
no. toxic. one of my many jobs growing up was a call center for a major hotel. because this hotel had a toll free number to call, and was a popular international chain. we would get hundreds of calls a day from brazillian kids just talking shit, cursing at us, trying to prank by making fake reservations for Albuquerque and shit.
---
LOL
---
I also have another PM with you where you say you are Golemaggs. Golemaggs deleted the discordserver after promising a merge from your side. how the fuck do you explain that?
---
I just realized basically all of SA is East of Chicago. Wow!
---
Is it possible to be an acceptable dungeon and/or raid offtank as well as being a world pvp'ing cat-bear-emergency-medic, all in one spec/gearset?
---
UPDATE: When called out, he rage-deleted all channels in his own server, and is now pretending ike it was somebody else. 
---
What a twat. What a joke of a man. Just avoid this loser.
---
gieb gold
---
That’s a fair point to be sure. Can’t recall a single friend getting into WoW after cata happened now that I think about it. Huh +1
---
The Death knight campaign actually involves them resurrecting them and they follow the Death Knight so they're technically not completely evil atm.
---
Thalnos* Snap ;D
---
I would also like to know where you got your luna unit frames. I can't get mine working.
---
Now we just need the streamers to settle there as well.
---
are you?
---
What do you think how many people plays this game? 200.000 or what?
---
You forgot to mention that the admin of the other "better organized and more popular Server" wrote this last night, but somehow still remained an admin.
---
https://i.imgur.com/ppWn5FI.png
---
Is it that the scorpid doesn't have a swim animation?
---
I hope the last part it true. We need to be vocal about our concerns, which will be hard trough all this idionoise the drones are putting out.
---
Pretty much the same character-arc as me.
---
Can you click on the name and screenshot that it's the same discord id as the steaks of the othrr one( screenshot that, too). 
---
Not that i dont believe but anyone can say 'im steaks' if it aint the same tag and the shot on its own doesnt prove it wasnt that.
---
But classic exists because retail is failing anyway.
---
Plus classic doesn't need new content being developed, so once all phases are out some resources can be put back into the trash heap.
---
Boooo!!!
---
No, but you're being incredibly lazy.
---
Yes, the boar also doesnt
---
Wow "tokens" will always exist, its just that this way they will be regulated and legal, stop being so fucking ignorant. Haven't paid for expansion/gametime with real money since MoP
---
You could raid... you just had to be really good at predicting things well in advance, haha
---
For general shit? I don’t need the free keybinds so it’s more convenient to have them than not. I’d rather keyboard turn while casually playing. In battle I tend to hybrid mouse/keyboard turn but keyboard also allows you to focus on your spells in your mouse hand when doing that.
---
I'm pretty sure most players will enjoy the launch chaos, but I could easily see someone not enjoying it as much as well.
---
You could do exactly what you 'want' to, and just....not worry about it. If they're around for the long haul, it's actually good for server health because the population will not evaporate, and you can filter out the good spergs from the bad. If they're tourists, The community will heal as the lemmings disappear. But you only see the 'worst possible scenario'. But sure, they're entitled for wanting to....do their job as entertainers.
---
Why waste money on additional servers when you can layer the fuck out of two of them making you play with different people every single time you log. They have investors to please after all.
---
As far as I know if you delete a character the name doesn't stay reserved anymore and for the longest time didn't. That said, I remember getting notifications that my name would be 'reserved' on the server after a server transfer; I imagine it was a measure taken to avoid people immediately impersonating you when you left.
---
If you make a character in WoW and delete it to recreate it later, someone else WILL be able to steal that name. I'm pretty sure that's the way it's gonna go. So my plan is to sort of memorize the looks I want and/or don't 'recreate' until after launch hype is over (when the chance of someone stealing the name in the 1min it takes me to create a character has passed).
---
In addition to the two add-ons suggested, I also recommend practicing the timing without one. You can quickly get a feel for it, and it removes the ui clutter.
---
But that's more of a personal preference thing. I just find the swing timers distracting.
---
Guessing you are trolling. Of course they are not going to forget about retail. The obvious path for them to take financially is to try and get classic players into retail. With retail they have people paying for new content and microtransactions. Classic on the other hand is just subscription money. Microtransactions is a huge cash cow.
---
 I have no doubt they will try and promote retail hard among the classic players. We are going to see stuff like "this week play BFA and get x free". They are going to want to get people hooked and into retail. Of course they want Classic to succeed but it makes sense they would try and get people over into retail. Use classic as a way to do that.
---
In Grob we trust.
---
Beautiful. Thank you!!!!
---
There is an event working as those days back in time on Ironforge Airport with Troll' squad running on the lake and invading the airport. Guards on ram chase them and deffend. 
---
It is stupid, but simple stuff like this is what I am looking forward in Classic :D
---
Normally I'd agree, but there being only one RP-PVP server means many time zones will have a presence on it. This poll from r/Grobbulus for a small example https://www.strawpoll.me/18452229/r
---
I understand some friends will stick to normal PVP though. Good luck either way 👍
---
“Pirated” “they” the people you distain so very much proved to blizzard there was big interest in vanilla servers. Not sure why you are so salty about them.
---
Merges can be accomplished much more smoothly without all the problems they had back in 2005.
---
Yeah but it’s just a normal croc
---
That the Test was extended?
---
Are you that stupid?
---
&gt;Kaivax
---
&gt;Hello!
---
&gt;Our global pre-launch test of WoW Classic will begin on Last Thursday at 11:00 AM and is scheduled to end on Friday, August 9. This test will be available to all World of Warcraft players with a current subscription or active game time in all regions. The maximum character level will be 15.
---
Dont be fucking lazy
---
Tell that to the players that were layered away while pvping with their friend on the stress test server.
---
I reported this when beta started.
---
I would provide counter arguments to your points, but you really just need to accept the strengths and weaknesses of whatever class and race you pick, or choose to not care.
---
That's a necessity in Classic.
---
The weight of choice is actually relevant. You're focusing on the wrong thing, the flaws. Look at which good things you want, or you'll never be happy
---
I'd say me favoring the alliance has its roots in other fantasy I've played or read. Orcs and trolls are always the other and bad. I would be lying if I claimed I could take wow fantasy lore as it's own. My brains will mix in other fantasy I've come across.
---
Also the architechture and zones. Human and dwarven starting zones are great and the cities and villages feel believable. I dont much care for nelf zones, save Ashenvale but the human starting zones up to Duskwood are amazing(nice story going there). Also enjoy the dwarven locations till Wetlands. (After 30 I think you start jumping around the world very much and somewhat lose the sense of story in your progression. Not that there arent great things to find and enjoy! Same for horde)
---
Compare the alliance zones to horde. Tauren:grass fields and tents on a hill. Orcs: plains that can hardly be called habitable with rough stone and stick buildings. Undead: actually nice villages and a city, also the quests deal with remnants of the mindless undead and threats coming from scarlets. Can't really get behind some of the poison mixing of the UD faction but the action in their own zones is good.
---
Although I might like playing nelfs I feel they were not fully realized from WC3 as they were called perfect warriors but are now more nature hippies with /dance. Also their cities feel wrong somehow. I'd like to see more temple of Elune and DM stuff and less something akin to chinese temples. Almost feels like they dont have a functioning society. So I always go for the "nelf who went to human lands" route.
---
Lastly alliance races seem to be more individual. As horde you are part of the horde(ok UDs have a sense of self and dont want to lose it again I think). Alliance on the other hand is made out of individuals with especially humans being easy to corrupt.
---
Oh boy, we are on an explosive start, it’s going to be a dooozy!
---
Making too many and merging = would seem like the game is unpopular leading to more loss of players
---
Making to few does the opposite without risk. No business people in this sub apparently.
---
It is interesting that they are launching so few servers. Hopefully they are underestimating the draw it has, even though opening new servers to compensate isn't really an ideal solution.
---
I was only talking about the actual launch mate. Never said anything about the game not being good for beginners. I am hyped as fuck and will enjoy every second of this, which I am sure most other players will too, both old and new. I was just trying to make the point that a server launch might not be everyones idea of a good time and some might be a bit surprised by it.

The vast majority of Brazilians understand spanish quite well, in text it is even more simple. However spanish-speakers don't understand brazilian portuguese, which makes it a bit more tricky. English though is a whole other ball game. I have a hard time seeing the difference between spanish and portuguese causing such rift.
---
You’re full of it. Your post history is just a bunch of link spamming even in threads that are irrelevant to your discord.
---
damn i am rolling hunter and this hits me hard.  the fucking dead cat rofl
---
Then I honestly don't know which bar it would be. Best bet would be to just turn things off till you find it. Maybe restore to defaults? As far as I'm aware it shouldn't be in the default layout.
---
Oh no, you might not be able to avoid every single culture/group you want.
---
Welcome to life.
---
I wouldn’t call it an event considering it never stops. But yea there are many of these locations. These hidden treasures for whatever reason ended up getting removed. Makes me sad.
---
Simple, you should be able to choose your layer when you create your character.
---
The PvE servers will all be safe, friendo :)
---
I just checked, both my version and the version in OP equip greys if you arent at a vendor
---
Fuck yeah it's tough. Have you watched soda have to open fan mail and packages while his maids are cleaning his room? It's hard for him to enjoy the cool gifts people send him and that just makes it less enjoyable for everyone. 
---
Also having to live in a house with other streamers. If one of those people interrupt him while hes streaming he might miss my donation and not read my name on stream. It's hard streaming.
---
Faerlina is looking like the safe one atm.
---
People on reddit thinking there will be millions pouring into classic is pretty bad as well. How do people think they have better data than blizzard themselves.
---
Ofc. It’s unfair that you can’t be fully epic’d as a guildless keyboardturner just because you pay the same subscription fee......
---
Unfortunately you cant change the name of verified games:(
---
people fighting with others on who gets to be the lead janitor of a video game discord lol
---
Fair enough, that’s not what I recall but you seem to have paid more attention to it than I did.
---
While leveling skinning/herb. Vendor skins, bank herbs. Not much point in selling them on the ah since no one will have gold. At 40, drop skimming and pick up alchemy. Use your banked herbs. The pots are really helpful for a warrior and you’ll be able to sell both pots and herbs on the ah now. At 60 you have to decide what you want to do. You can drop herb for engi and buy the mats to level it and keep alchemy for gold. You can just park yourself in a city and sell your transmute cooldown as a simple, passive gold maker. It depends on what you want to do. 
---
If you think going bs is a fun idea go for it. It’s not “the best” option if you are a min-maxer but fun rarely comes in to those calculations.
---
Indeed
---
Not on verified games you cant:(
---
That’ll never happen it only takes a few spergs to reserve streamer names on the 3 est pvp realms, so it’s stupid to believe it won’t be reserved in every single server just in case
---
Yes, there you go:
---
https://pastebin.com/haHVXTFN

Regardless of how strong the RP is enforced, I think you're bound to get less twitch chat on an RP Realm than a pure PVP realm.
---
You’re right, I’m going to go learn Portuguese now so I can be more cultured! Thank you!!!
---
Basics are perfect in modern standards are they? I should have know back when they charged for the first beta, and definitely when they did it again for the second one lol. You’re “perfect” used to be the bare minimum, my friend.
---
Better to have gold spammers that Tokens. Just because you're poor and can't afford to play with $$$ doesn't mean we should care about you wanting the game dumbed down.
---
&gt;They have not wavered
---
Yes they have, numerous times already. When the inevitably announce "Layering will be removed after Naxx" I'm sure you'll believe it too.
---
Thanks a lot for the in depth reply! Do you know about macros? Do they stay on the account, or should I do them when the game launches?
---
exactly
---
You having a stroke?
---
I don't follow any of the streamers... Which factions do the big guys play?
---
For Logitech GHub it detects it as the same game. I actually like that though as it makes it so I can keep the same assignments without having to make them for each one.
---
Mo’ money mo’ problems. I’ve been to rich and poor parts of Guatemala, Costa Rica, México, and Belize, and everybody I met was super chill, super friendly, and extremely welcoming and generous.
---
Poverty is the great equalizer. It knows no color, no language, no gender. Everyone can be poor. So if you are poor, it’s very easy to like everybody since it’s not uncommon to be surrounded by many different kinds of people.
---
It is causing me to resent the streamers immensely tbh.
---
Horse shit.  The primary reason we are getting classic is because Blizzard is some serious trouble, and they have nothing else.    Not only do they nothing new, they're lacking talented devs to even make something new.   What's more, WoW is hemorrhaging subs.  They're T-totally fucked right now.
---
You still can’t blame other people for not wanting to play the game the way that suits you the most. 
---
Tbh retail wow is filled with the sort of players you describe and I sincerely miss the days when things where more like APES. All the whining and casualness is what ruined the game. If you are unable to play enough or well enough to raid, you wear blues. It’s simple.
---
Bullshit, why not just fucking forget layers and make small realms?
---
&gt;Be edgy
---
or
---
&gt;Be smart
---
Are names that are removed available for grabs after? Could someone report my name and then take it after? Or do they make them unavailable forever on that server after?
---
People will always buy gold regardless of blizzard selling it or not. The only thing that changes is people dont get scammed.
---
Hello, I am mushroom.
---
I'm honestly scared of them going from server to server every week fucking people over. "Oh my server crashed, time to play on this one."
---
Hah. That fkin guy dude. What is it about video games that attract the worst of corporate filth
---
Referring staff member is ‘GM’
---

---
Devils Advocate for 39...
---
Problem:  Toons can max out professions at 35.  This creates an easy PvP Twink opportunity with your bank/profession alts at 39, giving them a fun use with just 4 more levels... Instead of 14 more to hit 49. 
---
Problem: Everyone gets a mount for 49 PvP.  The level 39 mobility superiority of Druids, shamans, hunters and others (with lesser run speed boosters) is significantly reduced. 
---
160% &gt; 130% &gt; 100%
---
This is why I'm not joining any Discord servers set up for the realms. It  just depends on who sets them up first, and as the people accountable within the ingame community (as it doesn't exist yet), it's just going to lead to this sort of drama I feel.
---
Personally not too bothered either, since I bet there will be an addon out there to turn it into the old one. But I guess it's also one of those things that it's supposed to be a recreation of how it was, and having the HD font in there is wrong in that sense.
---
Yeah, if game gets hugely popular they might not. It would be better alternative than unsustainably large megaservers.
---
Or a lot of porn
---
An 11k queue and while the first 8k went fast the last bit took a good half hour plus. Was an hour+z 
---
Either way, layering this extremely - which they are clearly planning to - will seriously mess with the games best aspect: spontaneous friendships and communities.
---
And why would someone frame him even before the merge was officially told to discord members?
---
And way WAY before the deleting of channels even happened?
---
With this server population, layering is permanent.
---
lol no
---
I don't have the answer to that. If you're worried about RP naming conventions, from my understanding as long as your name isn't offensive or meme-ish then it should be accepted.
---
Imagine comparing a USeast server (which is one of a total of 3 USeast PvP servers) to that of ragnaros, which is a DESIGNATED SOUTH AMERICAN SERVER, in a world with over 100 US servers.
---
.....
---
A better question is why anyone would trust blizzard after the past 5 or so years. Without even considering the activision influence, blizzard isn’t even close to what they were 10+ years ago
---
There's a site called WillItClassic which has so far been a decent resource for finding one's that either work or are in development for Classic.
---
As for installing, you simply extract the downloaded Zip folder into the Interface/Addons/ folder of your /_classic_/ location. The Twitch app wasn't working initially for me as it wasn't finding the add-ons. Then I closed Bnet and loaded WoW classic from Twitch and it found the add-ons it recognized from CurseForge. Still had to update the non-CurseForge ones manually though.
---
Is it actually up and running? I downloaded it and it shows me a couple available servers
---
no
---
Isn't whitemane going to be a streamer server?
---
Casual isn't "binge heavy gameplay on the weekends"
---
The Brazilians gave us Sepultura. 
---
They are all right in my book.
---
So you think by "Gank the crap out of any big streamer" will solve your issue?
---
 I hope you realize that some streamers will as well not stream to enjoy the game and feel the nostalgia. 
---
They want to enjoy their Classic experience(yes that includes not having any fans following them too) as much as we do, so I won't go shit talking them.
---
Could be the guy who actually did it. If he pissed off a mod on his server over something else and that guy just went all out or something.
---
Honestly havent seen any real proof it was the same steaks which is weird given how easy it is to show it.
---
I just gotta say. Had some of our best guild members on Burning Legion that were BR. Everyone seems to say avoid them, but there are just as much dedicated, if not more, than any people I've played with.
---
They're going EST because they're an hour or two ahead of EST. But our BR guys would still raid until 2am with us and PvP all night.
---
Find the good ones and you'll be happy you did. Still talk a lot of those guys today.
---
It may have been a unique crocolisk color in vanilla but I can't recall. Neat tame for hunters.
---
&gt; (which is complete unacceptable to begin with) 
---
To who? Why? What is it hurting?
---
The issue with this is that guilds are coordinating people onto these few servers. Do you seriously think it’ll be easy to talk 40+ people into changing servers after they’ve hit past level 20?
---
These 5 NA PvP realms are going to be so packed.
---
&gt; They want to bring more attention back to retail, where there is far, far more monetization. 
---
Exactly why I can't wait for the pitiful retail game to die. Classic all the way
---
Shit. So Faerlina is the only option then?
---
Ragnaros was a regular US server in Classic and TBC which was unofficially declared the Brazil server the same way Thalnos is now.  Blizzard didn't create specific South American region servers until much later into WoW's life.
---
The only counter to this is they want me money... they’re bleeding subscribers and only caved into this for money. They.want.money. But they aren’t creative enough anymore to make something new so they will rehash this and WC3 and pray it keeps them afloat. Their stock is in the shitter and they need MAU at all costs they do not actually want to piss you off. They just want the most people playing at the most cost effective
---
It'll probably be very easy to enable the new character models in the classic client, since it runs on a legion base. For now it's just the world itself looking better, with an optional "classic setting" that gives you something closer to the vanilla graphics if you so desire.
---
Honestly, same. That's really annoying. Doesn't give anyone the chance to take that into account when picking servers with their friends, and its not like there are a few dozen servers. There are 5 PvP servers, the risk of picking the same one as him is (relatively) pretty high.
---
Honestly, I couldn’t care if a single other one of you fuckers showed up for the first two months. 
---
Leveling alone, or nearly is more enjoyable. 
---
Going into Jaedenar in Felwood with no one else, having to fight your way through it all with unrelenting 5 min respawns is 100x more enjoyable than looping through Jangolode mine looking for kobolds.
---
so the last time you played... was 2008?
---
Well duh, there's been sharding on retail servers for years. In classic, if Asmongold is in Westfall, and you're in Westfall, you're gonna be seeing each other unless one of you goes to another zone. And that goes for his harem of starstruck little followers as well.
---
so old and irrelevant they're useless? is that better?
---
Shazzrah https://discord.gg/hHaAgMB
---
Calm down, Chicken Little.
---
It is literally impossible to keep enough people away from Thalnos in a world with such a tiny amount of servers to make it into Ragnaros 2.0.
---
Stop.
---
jajajajajaja
---
Very interesting site, Thanks!
---
CensusPlus is an addon that will do that - they've released a version for Classic.
---
Layering is the band aid. More servers is the cure.
---
Blizzard have announced a number of servers they feel sure will maintain a healthy population after the initial hype dies down. If they see too much activity on too many realms, they can open more.
---
I think many people are being way too dramatic over this.
---
There's a decent chunk of 40 year olds who don't use reddit tho lol
---
$800,000 dollars baby
---
The rogues and fury wars in your group will love you.
---
&gt; If too many people are competing for mobs and resources on a past-layering server, it will still kill some of the fun though.
---
People sometimes forget how small Vanilla Wow is because they haven't been constrained to it for so long. They also forget that just because there's somewhere around 40ish zones, doesn't mean the population will be equally spread across them. A level 60 has no reason to really go back to Westfall, the game's progression design is a road with a parking lot at the end and no way to get back out of said parking lot until you decide to abandon your car.
---
Shit is gonna get packed really damn fast once sharding is turned off.
---
Of course it's not the same and you can't force anybody to flag. But if you're going to give a region only ONE server type at all, it simply makes sense to make it PvE where you have an *option* to flag yourself, rather than PvP which does not have a reverse option, popularity of the realm type aside. I hope the KR playerbase will prove Blizzard wrong with population numbers that will require them to spin up new servers accordingly.
---
Seeing the same person multiple times is an underrated experience. You end up making friends that way. With layering that is impossible. 
---
I play ffxiv and it was refreshing to actually bump into the same person a few times. I’ve actually made a few friends that way.
---
maximum safety would be the RP-PVE realm Bloodsail Buccaneers. 
---
only issue is that RP servers tend to be further behind in the progression side. this won't be a problem likely until AQ40 / Naxx, but there's the possibility Naxx is never even cleared.
---
I don't see how spanish would be the common language , its a huge country with a huge population and as such they generate a lot of their own content , such as youtubers  tv shows and so on, so they keep it to themselves.  
---
Spain has the same "problem" huge numbers own content  = no hablo ingles .You go to Portugal and they all speak english. Small country nothing is translated lots of english exposure.
---
Can Blizzard be that out of touch to think the fucking stress test is a good gauge?
---
Who gives a flying fuck about leveling characters that will be wiped in like a day?
---
1. Racials 
---
2. Aestethics 
---
3. Superior questing 
---
4. Ironforge
---
While I agree with what you said for the most part
---
&gt; They want to enjoy their Classic experience
---
turn the stream off and enjoy it like they did back then. The community will be negatively affected by their presence, it's undeniable.
---
I've posted in a few different places looking for old guildmates and miraculously found one so far. I haven't considered reaching out to my old real life friends I got into WoW in high school. They started in BC but I am curious whether they're planning to play Classic, come to think of it.
---
Holy shit that's much better than I expected.
---
Faerlina is the only one left for US east coast boys. Thalnos is the unofficial brazillian server now, and herod is streamer aids
---
See you there.
---
Don't think so, yet.
---
But in the mean time it's pretty easy.  All those stats are percentages so just add them up.  It gets a bit harder when you start dealing with weapon skills, but for defense, every 8 defense equals about 1% block, dodge, and parry.
---
'Sadly he was killed in a mugging maybe 5-6 years ago.'
---
This is the most Brazilian thing I've ever read.
---
So this paste bin profile will delete all my progress? Or looking at the menu you listed will allow me to fix it?
---
Whoever wrote that thread has some really strange ideas about Brazil and Latin America
---
The latency is honestly a non issue playing on Pacific. It’s the server/raid times. However considering there aren’t many choices, I’m sure there will be plenty of EST timeslot raiders across the realms regardless of server time.
---
But anyways I think Herod is still a popular choice for EST PvP.
---
*get back in these battlegrounds right meow*
---
Twitch changed the WoW icon to the Classic Ragnaros key art.
---
Lots of water and make sure to do some squats and stretches on flightpoints or longer travel, getting blood flowing through your legs helps a lot.  
---
Be sure to turn your monitor brightness down a bit since getting an eye-strain headache sucks ass, or even worse a migraine.  
---
An energy drink or two won't make or break it really, they tend to last like 4 hours so it's a decent idea towards the end of the stream, just make sure you don't skimp on water.  
---
Oh and a snack is a good idea.
---
This photo should be captioned “Me in 2010” “Me 1 year after classic release”
---
Yeh in op's shots you even see him talking about being on a different account soo vey likely some impersonation bs.
---
Till raid loads of classes can tank. Hell, I remember using eyes of the beast and tanking Sunken Temple on my hunter in Vanilla.
---
Definitely mage, they have so many spells that chill enemies
---
There will be no real tanks besides warriors. A few druids will get to tank lower content and some raid trash.
---
If your goal is to tank you are wasting your time trying anything else.
---
Cannot confirm that. I'm not prepare to play a game that was built in 2004 to the standards of 1999. Poor and outdated graphics, tons of bugs officially acknowledged as "features", bland, boring and imbalanced classes, endless grinds to get anywhere, simplistic raids and dungeons where the main challenge lies in assembling your group, and PVP that is 100% dependent on picking one of the few classes that don't suck and having superior gear.
---
Neat assumption friend, I don't pay them a dime.
---
I'm not playing anything down, I do not agree with your assertion that it is 'entitled' to want to do your job- even if your job affects some people negatively.
---
You're also still overstating how big an impact this will really have on you. Hopefully you will realize you are literally making it matter more to you than it would if you had just picked the server you liked and not worried about it. Have a good day, both of you. I enjoy civil disagreement.
---
Nice. I’m sure since you are fantastically well informed though, that you will know that prior to shutting down Nost, Blizzard did not give any indication that they cared at all about private servers. THEIVES, PIRATES! Those people are evil and immoral!!!
---
What exactly makes you so mad about people playing on private servers? Grow up. Stop being so upset about people that have no impact on your life.
---
This is not a normal game though. I don’t care about betas because this game isn’t anything new. Stress tests are meh, and who the fuck still goes on the forums?
---
Blizzard missed the boat on this one and day one is going to be fucking hell.
---
No, I mean in pvp. Warr + healer is the best.
---
I think streamers are going for an Easter server, most likely Herod
---
1.12 means weapon normalization too, which many people seem to forget allowed characters who leaned on weapons for dps to have far higher dps than they will now. You could use a Barman Shanker on a rogue and not be far behind someone with a Gutgore Ripper, if at all. This lasted until after ZG when the world dragon patch came in 1.8.
---
Not saying stuff still won't die fast or easily but its worth noting.
---
Anything goes in Dungeons.
---
Druids are used for certain raid fights. I think they could do more but it brings an element of unpredictability people would rather not deal with.
---
Classic WoW is a Warrior's game. You get to be the best at 66% of roles.
---
I’ll be shooting for r13 for sure.
---
&gt;It's kind of disheartening that Blizzard released so few PvP/PvE servers for Classic for EU.
---
You mean so few servers in general I hope?
---
on Vanilla back in 2004 it took me 38 days to reach level 60 on my UD Warlock. #nolife And that was with zero min/maxing. No youtube, no thottbot, no wowhead. Nowadays it's completely different. Even casuals will reach 60 in a reasonable amount of time just by the shear amount of volumetric information that's available. You'll be seeing Hand of Ragnaros in Warsong Gulch within 45 days
---
Unless you're min-maxing in a world first guild, every class and even every spec can do all the content in the game. It seems that warriors are often the better choice, but for a large part of the game it really doesn't matter.
---
Lmaooo so true tho.
---
Druids are a lot of fun plus travel form at 30 makes it less of a necessity to save for your mount at 40. If you are willing to heal pugs will be easy to find. Druids can OT or Heal but the rest they just arent that good at. Feral leveling is some of the most fun I've had though
---
World can always use more locks!
---
And layering is going to become permanent if classic isn’t a failure, due to them not making enough servers. If they were transparent with a plan to merge dangerously low pop servers or do optional free migration off high pops after some time that would be way preferred over this layering approach. I guarantee even with too few servers there will still be a few that end up underpopulated and a few that either have permanent layering or obscene queues possibly topping those of “full” servers of yesteryear
---
I dont have an issue with streamers themselves, it's their fanboiz that I'm worried about.
---
I dont care which server they play on while not streaming, but if they are streaming they will have an army following them everywhere they go.
---
Call me toxic or w/e but I dont like the idea of public chat channels turning into twitch spam
---
Maybe it was because I played on Blackrock but people were far from friendly in the game, kill stealing, node stealing, watching you die and jumping around while you slowly lose. Only time people came together was to group for dungeons. With this people get a better shot at resources and spawns. I'd take that over waiting a half hour to kill 12 boars.
---
I've always played Horde and know it well. Time to go in blind and try Alliance. I also always found that Horde seemed to be a bit better at PvP so I'm also looking forward to that challenge.
---
We need more heroes like you. Could you check spanish people in eu as well?
---
95% Warriors, 5% Druids. Paladins can tank dungeons just fine.
---
Until tomorrow yes
---
My guild was planning on rolling thalnos to avoid streamers. Might need to reconsider now. Blizzard please add more realms PLEASE
---
Yeah, 10k active population IS NOT A HEALTHY SERVER! It just becomes retail at that point with mass people running around everywhere and everyone being expendable.
---
br br?
---
My eyes cant tell the difference
---
OCE is down atm it seems
---
I'm EST and almost 100% going grob mob. When there's only one of a certain type of server I think you'll have way more variance in guild raid times.
---
Blizzard has literally said sharding is antithetical to Vanilla. It’s unacceptable even by their own standards.
---
I’m not going into a discussion about *why* sharding is bad for the game. It’s been explained 101 times over. At this point you’re just willfully blind.
---
But hey I’m critical of Blizzard so I must be a ‘truther’. Great argument.
---
what would the macro be if you were in a group?
---
Do you have any metrics to back that up?
---
"...but PvP is going to be useless until phase 2." - some forum twat
---
They have terrible ping and the brazilians can be pretty aggressive trolls.
---
Goldshire E-Thots
---
Play on Thalnos.
---
Eat well (no snacks) every 2-3 hours or so, just like during daytime. 
---
Only drink water. 
---
You will get tired, but that is just your braim trying to trick you! After a while, you will hit a second wind and can go for a few more hours.
---
Honestly, my guild is already having people talking about rolling on rp-pvp to get away from the zerg, and I *do not* want to be stuck on a backwater realm because blizzard fucked up.
---
This is some bullshit.
---
It’s always been months. It was always going to be a thing til phase 2. They’ve also said they’re going to monitor things at launch and adjust as necessary. 
---
Im not freaking out and it’s not because I love retail or am just a blind fanboy defending blizzard. I’m not freaking out because so far every catastrophe that this community has assured us would be the end of WoW Classic hasn’t come to fruition. I’m tired of everyone assuming the worst from blizzard on this when, in reality, blizzard has time and time again proven that they’re going about Classic the right way.
---
Then they take it down until official launch?
---
Right and where in that does it say 12:00?
---
It's not me being lazy. The burden of proof lies with the claimant. That's you.
---
"Nice assumption, now excuse me while I assume" Bruh.
---
Why?  Where do they expect them to go?  They have a right to play too, and they're trying to be nice by telling us where they're going.
---
You saying you think I have a problem with it? Or Blizz has a problem with it? Cause if number one, then you missed the point of my comment. 
---
Another huge reason that I just remembered, and probably the biggest possible pull we could see for Blizz to include tokens in classic, it being one of the primary reasons that they implemented the token system in retail, and thats to try to counteract the illicit selling of wow gold. The token system theoretically should also help counteract the number of bots that were and likely will be going around by lowering demand for illicit wow gold. If tokens arent included in classic, I guarantee we'll see a rampant return of bots as well as a resurgence in the illicit wow gold market.
---
All I care that I can finally enter the true Azeroth again.
---
So is this going to be the streamer server?
---
gibe moni pls
---
You should take a break from the internet
---
Why didnt you just die and ress at the spirit ress in the mountain? Cant you do that?
---
Should I be worried about the message "You are attempting to run a custom script. Running scripts could compromise your character causing the loss of items or gold" when using this?
---
They're all going Herod?
---
God, I hope not. That's where I'm going.
---
Ah, I suppose that does give it some value then, I didnt think about taming.
---
How is this false information???
---
K? We were all doing that during Vanilla when we were the appropriate age to play.
---
Now the stakes are higher. Jobs may suffer, vacation time will be taken. Spouses will either fall in line and join, or be exiled.
---
Sucks. My server was the complete opposite. Awesome tight knit community.
---
&gt; It’s been explained 101 times over. At this point you’re just willfully blind.
---
Really making a great case for yourself, considering I've never seen this brought up before. Remove head from ass and get back to me.
---
For macros, keybinds, and Addons just double check that you aren't on "Character Specific" and it'll transfer over fine. Even if you messed up and did character specific you can manually modify those files in the WTF folder mentioned above.
---
I second that!
---
I think the correct way to do it is make a number that probably isn’t sustainable and state publicly that after a bit when pops are starting to suffer they will do mergers or free migrations from high to low to try to maintain adequate pops on all servers.
---
From what I've seen it was a lot smoother and balanced compared to the last stress test.  If you're one of the first people in, and you are anything but tauren and nightelf, then you might see some pretty large crowds.
---
Not a long time.  Like days at an absolute max imo.  Just make a conscious effort to think about it while playing and you'll get uses to it in no time.
---
 it's almost as if the sub isn't one entity and is a congregation of people with different opinions but one common interest
---
As a priest, I had a terrible time trying to heal paladins. As soon as I heal once (which was very early in a fight), I'd become the target and with no taunt, I had to suffer through while the paladin scrambled to get threat under control. (Fade only works so much/often)
---
I ended up exclusively running dungeons with warrior tanks. Much smoother.
---
I thought this too.
---
Yeah sounds like an outsider trying to be way smarter than they actually are. Not that I have a clue, I’ve visited but I’m European.
---
This is one of the things that rub me wrong about him. He is like one of these people desperately trying to surround themselves with well known individuals to be a part of it.
---
You assumed I am a sub of one of these people. What am I assuming about you after I dispelled that? That you're overstating how much it will matter to you? That you are making it matter more than it really needs to by worrying about it so much? If you aren't actually worrying about it at all, then sure, you're right, my bad.
---
Take your prognostication to r/mycrystalball
---
Why on earth name the RP-PVP server, or any server for that matter, Zandalar Tribe? That's extremely biased towards the Horde. Smh!
---
The best way to approach this problem imo is to make “hard layers”. 
---
Make duplicates of all realms and name them Mankrik I, Mankrik II, Mankrik III, and so on. Each of the duplicates would share things like player names, guild names and so on. Meaning if someone created a character named Thex on Mankrik I, you can’t create a character with that name on Mankrik II or III.
---
Then they could easily merge these realms without having to mess up names.
---
Dwarf rogue is the best race for alliance pvp
---
I'd enjoy both retail and classic being the best they can really. Even if I do prefer Classic.
---
even after 15 years the vast majority of players (the ones on this forum are less casual than your average player even, imagine that) are so bad that they think 14 year old advice from my mom is relevant and useful for classic wow.
---
Golemagg link is broken, can you link this one instead:
---
https://discord.gg/vPCZwsE
---
Rumor is that's the streamer realm, though.
---
Nope, the damage text. Check them in full size if you have to. You can also check the other link I posted here somewhere, it has some screenshots too.
---
What the fuck lol
---
thankfully i will be on waifumaine
---
What? I'm guessing by the username you're just trolling here because I see no other way to go from "Hey, there is a community doing something" to: "Streamers shouldn't exist and are complete assholes for not trying to work with other players"
---
I didn't say anything edgy tho? I'm of the opinion that mmo mice are garbage but even if you don't agree it's not really edgy lol....
---
Druids can tank every boss save for a few late game, patchwerk and one from aq40 if i remember correctly.
---
Reading more about this, it seems he was likely framed but idk. 
---
Sucks either way as now we'll have no reliable info from discord data by monday for picking realms.
---
Your opinion is wrong.
---
The problem comes when you have to argue with priests about why you deserve it just as much.
---
11 million? That’s ridiculous, but 2-3 million at release are in the realm of belief.
---
Even if 20% of those stick around these servers will be cancer....
---
We are the master race of gamers and you are just jealous of how superior we are 
---
Hueuheuheuhuehuehuheuheuhehue
---
Blame marco polo
---
Yeah they're essentially doing the multi-server thing in the form of layering. It's a good compromise.
---
Also with how modern server tech works today the physical location of the server no longer matters as much.
---
just a normal day on 4chan
---
Herod doesn't sound like a great name, but I am not good at picking out what's cool.   So, can you rank the pve servers by the coolest name?
---
 Atiesh Normal Pacific
---
Mankrik Normal Eastern
---
Myzrae lNorma lPacific
---
Pagle Normal Eastern
---
They said it would be removed in phase 2. and i don't think they are going to release phases monthly? wouldn't be surprised if phase 2 will take 3-4 months to come
---
Because it's a long tedious quest chain and on a fresh server start you won't get it too early unless you have help from guildies or get a group of 5 Warriors that have all the elementals items ready to go.
---
the game won't get very popular with layering/sharding/phasing active
---
Nothing is confirmed other than it won’t be thalnos. Possibility of faerlina but most people think Herod.
---
Layering appears to be the lower risk version of multiple servers.
---
Idk there's almost no chance you're better than me at wow so...
---
By Classic numbers there is 2 full servers just logged into Reddit right now.
---
Imagine being blacklisted before the game has even been released. Good job steaks
---
"I have a t2 Holy Paladin on Mark Kern"
---
3 k is better than 6k, and far far better than 10k+ that Alot of private servers had. A smaller server population will make the community alot better. Since the bg is x-realm, a smaller population should not affect instanced PvP. World PvP is also better on smaller pop servers as you will actually recognize the players you are fighting.
---
Thalnos is br apparently. Faerlina is Latin America now too apparently. Herod is supposedly where the streamers are going. Personally, i think the English speakers should easily outweigh any others.
---
TITTIES ARE CRINGE HAHA AMIRITE I AM SO STRAIGHT
---
Will all the progress get wiped? Or will the characters created remain?
---
Does the fact that I proved it was intended to end on Friday somehow be negated by the fact that a specific time was not listed?
---
Because your original statement was 
---
&gt;Given that EU didn't even get a stress test at all until the global one which isn't even finished, I'm not sure how you managed to come up with that conclusion.
---
To that I responded 
---
&gt;lol It was supposed to end yesterday at 12:00
---
They extended it through the weekend.
---
Does the time really matter in the grand scope of things considering it was supposed to end yesterday and didnt? So when they made the server decisions it was with the data they had collected on hand.
---
You're arguing semantics when the fact is, you implied it was going to last all weekend via your first post  
---
&gt;Given that EU didn't even get a stress test at all until the global one which isn't even finished
---
I used deductive reasoning to draw the conclusion that when they said it would end friday, it would follow the same pattern as previous stress tests. 
---
At this stage, it would be best to just shut the fuck up.
---
I'm referring to Brazilian culture, people from Brazil, regardless of race or ethnicity.
---

Stress test

Im not getting the litle swords next to the nameplates. anybody else have the same problem?

It's made mainly by navak and egregious

yikes, i’m against censorship so i wouldn’t mind if it was used, but the way he said it made him sound like a twat
---
I'm dutch and im looking for an Horde PVE server. I don't know which one i should join.. or maybe go Shazzrah PVP instead and deal with corpsecampers / gankers
---
I think you’re in the wrong sub. Retail is a dumpster fire.
---
I tried telling my buddies this and they just didn’t comprehend.
---
I remember playing on a medium pop server back in the day and could name all big guilds on Alliance and horde side. With these mega servers It’ll probably be 80 some odd guilds clearing shit in record time.
---
I’m not crying, but as a casual player the lack of servers pretty much completely fucked me over in this game.
---
updated
---
Says the random Reddit user who can’t wrap his brain around multitasking with his right hand
---
Rogues are easy to play, you put sinister strike on your hotbar and stand behind things. Sap broke stealth (unsure on if that'll be the same) As for the dark model with red eyes, yeah, it's the Dark Iron dwarves and their brethren north in Searing Gorge.
---
Well they don't have a better data but what they do have, well at least most of them, is a common sense. I think it's not unrealistic to expect 100k player base in each major region, with the majority of this player base on PvP servers.
---
I'm not sure about the US, maybe they can fit on those 5 PvP servers once the populations dies down and we get rid of layring. But I'm pretty confident that these 2 english PvP servers cannot accommodate all these people from UK, Ireland, Netherlands, Sweden, Slovakia, Croatia, Spain, Italy, Greece, Czech republic, Denmark, Poland, Romania, Belgium, Montenegro, Finland, Bulgaria, Latvia and so on.  Some germans and french are going to want to roll on an english realm too and I'm not even counting people from outside of Europe like northern africa.
---
You don't really need much data to figure out that these servers probably count hold this many people, unless you expect 95% of players to quit by the start of phase 2.
---
*Like fucking hell, why do some people have to question everything.*
---
I watch a lot of mma and some of the best fighters come from brazil.  The athletes themselves are great but their fans are rude and violent.
---
Although I think Faerlina is less confirmed as latin america than brazil is for thalnos
---
Enjoy being a retarded edgy pleb
---
I’m brazilian and have a good grasp in english (my grammar kinda sucks,tho). In the subject of toxicity, well, it’s pretty much the same level as english and spanish speakers.
---
Of course there’s the language barrier when you want to say “look dude, why are you acting this way?” or whatever, but we’re mostly chill.
---
See you guys around. Peace.
---
even with 25% stun resist orcs?
---
completely agree, nobody i knew that is hyped for classic played private servers since they aren't official. Blizzard thinks the population will drop they just never said it would be because of their own servers.
---
Streamers say not Thalnos, so I pick Thalnos. BR say they are going Thalnos, now i'm back to waiting for streamers to pick. Looks like I'll probably lose my name. Thanks Blizzard for the tiny amount of servers and thanks streamers for giving people basically no time to pick their realm. GG WP

Why would you use eye of the beast?  That makes no sense
---
I don't believe this, Bfa must be WoW's lowest sub count aside from end of WoD, just this subreddit alone has different posts because so many intense players are gone. I think Classic will retain a lot more players than people expect
---
Interrupt armor was my favorite innovative advancement wildstar brought to the table. Action combat was enjoyable but clearly becoming the minimum standard.   
---
I genuinely think the next big mmorpg will be something that has action combat like wildstar and classic world of warcraft's world coherency. World coherency is in my opinion the most important philosophy to deliver as a product, but archaic tab-targeting will only be sustainable for so long.

I prefer healing too, but the higher responsibility makes it less chill than dpsing in a dungeon

"prefer"

You’re throwing hypotheticals now
---
Yep and yet you can bet a lot will be on the English server
---
Well it doesn't answer the question then does it numpty?
---
Less people go to 3rd parties then they do to legit source.
---
However having a big market for the cheating gold farmers/sellers is worse imo.  I'd rather big daddy blizzard get the money then exploitative companies.
---
I wanted to be horde and rejoin my kin, but all my irl friends are going alliance. I am forced to fight my own now, and I’ll have to bring swift death in STV.
---
A subtle troll, but you got a few.

Thanks, got to level abit now to test.

Really happy with this so far.

Golemagg EU's invite says it's invalid or expired? Can you recheck that please?

Yes, i don't need ragnaros players invading my classic experience too.

it's called Fight Club

Can't wait to see which European servers will be primarily polish/hungarian/italian/etc.
---
Legion launch was perfectly fine imo
---
Do they mostly play one faction perchance?
---
I actually played a dwarf rogue not long ago. It's alright. The orc's are annoying as fuck to deal with though that is correct, but stoneform does have pretty decent perks. Removing devouring plague bleeds and such, it's also pretty decent in rogue vs rogue because you can activate stoneform WHILE blinded. In PvE it's no big deal. Sure you aren't as good as humans, but you are just as good as gnomes and NE's. Dwarf is pretty strong but IMO not quite as strong as gnomes, but man do dwarfs look sick.

In Classic I mained a Priest and currently I'm looking forward to levelling a Druid this time. One of the things that I never figured out was why (I as priest) always got innervate priority? Surely there is a valid reason.
---
Druids also have the meditation/reflection talents. Shouldn't they benefit just as much from from Innervate seeing as they are a spirit based healer with lots of it on their gear?
---
Yeah make a Latin America server. I actually learned to speak with the community on Gurubashi back in the day. They you opened a Latin America serve and it died.
---
This is my sad story and some testimony to the fact I do think their is a community that warrants their own server.
---
Considering orcs are horde, yes
---
Ok.  Well throwing hunters and druids into the melee groups means that you need more shaman to cover the entire raid.
---
Probably because I was like 12 and I could manage my pet's target and focus better that way? I'm fairly certain that makes at least a little sense.
---
If you're referencing the recent post from Skarms Twitter that was fake.

I know, I look at the guy on the left and think he spends a lot of time flexing at the gym, while the guy on the right breaks people in half for a living.  I know which one I'd rather not get into a brawl with...

How so?
---
Steaks was framed.
---
Yes, you can style a dark iron dwarf with the two shades if grey and red/black hair. 
---
Typically open with garrote on orcs, if warrior I use rupture quickly after and peel out of range before they realise I've set upon them. Re engage with cs while they're a third health down.
---
Or risk it for the proverbial biscotti and role the damn dice. There is no real con for dwarves, aside from breathing so heavy a hunter could shoot you in the dark.
---
My buddy was a lot more desdset on his character than me, a human warrior, and I also have mostly mained paladin anyway, so I'm going alliance as my main faction to play with him. My Warlock may or may not be alliance, I'll decide for sure on Monday
---
German servers holds 5M chars on retail , English servers(incl. Italian and Spanish) holds 12M chars, so more than twice the amount of players, be happy your not as fucked the rest of Europe. France is the luckiest with 2,7M chars, so they have less then half the amount of people per server as the rest of us.
---
Good question and I don't know on that one sorry! You could test it somehow I'm sure, they will be stored somewhere maybe! In all honesty though, I'd just sort them once we launch :) unlikely we'll need too many macros at lvl 1 :) write them down somewhere so they're ready to copy paste when we get in!
---
At least take a vanilla screenshot not with a draenei character.
---
How bad exactly was it dealing with orcs. Thats my main worry.
---
WeakAura active subs are 1.7 million, excluding China.
---
That’s 1.7 mill we know for sure.
---
How many are playing, but not using WeakAuras?  Very hard to pinpoint such things when Blizz aren’t giving out numbers anymore.
---
I was able to get it to work after multiple different clique downloads on sites, I’m not 100% what site actually worked for me. If someone doesn’t respond with a URL I think I still got the zip file for the addon I can share.

As a brazilian that actively avoids the brazilian community in all games, so do I...
---
Ignoring the hyperbole of "millions pouring in".. the 2 ENG PvP realms for EU is still horrendous. 
---
- 1 argument in favor of this is the **"layering allows for far more than just 3-5k like back in the day"** but thats not really a feasible one considering layering is temporary and mainly a launch crutch. SO what about after layering when phase 2 hits?
---
- **"They can just add more later on and allow free migration or merge that then"** is another argument. But its also a really poor one since migrating later on when youve put in a lot of effort and time to develop your current community and social circle (which is a big deal in this version of WoW). Mergeing is also a community disaster and economy mess.
---
- **"They can just add more if the current 2 ones get too full"**. Yes this is a possibility and what seems like what theyre doing however even this brings problems because these 2 current ones are gonna be probably overpopulated before the new one(s) come online and also be a bit ahead of the other servers. 
---
Remember that its unlikely that we're gonna have a server cap, POST LAYERING, that is 10k or w/e. But lets be generous and say they will have 10k server pop-caps post layering. That still means only 20k English PvP players at a time can play in the whole of EU as it stands now. Thats insanely low calculations considering thats supposed to house scandinavia, spain, BeNeLux, baltics, balkans, decent amount of french and german speakers who still prefers eng servers etc.
---
Its just not feasible or practical. Adding 1 or 2 more EU EN PVP realms at launch seems less of a risk of having a "dead realm" than current situation risks a fuckton if population messes and overloads.
---
Can’t divide potential population like that, most people want to play in pvp servers not pve or rppvp..
---
Yeah, that bothered me too. Even still, steaks was so freaking annoying even before he went full rage mode that I'm just gonna stick with the better server.
---
Can you explain for classic noobs?
---
&gt; 2 is just not enough. 
---
And you're basing that on what exactly?
---
Evening (5pm-8pm) is right after most people typically get home from work, so you tend to see less players on around this time since they have other obligations to tend to.  There will be more people on later after they finished all their other stuff.
---
That being said, there will be plenty of people with similar schedule so it might take a bit more work, but you shouldn't have too much trouble find a guild with a raid schedule that fits yours.
---
I’m debating between Druid, hunter and rogue. I’ve played at high end of pvp and pve over the years. I really enjoy world pvp. Outplaying. 1v1s and 1v2s open world and duels on occasion. I’ve looked into all three roles and rotations. Just having a hard time
---
So true
---
I think so. Just before he deleted his server he said he would merge it.

Dude, they are a corporation and we are its customers. Don’t fucking get lost here that they are your knight in shining armor, they are charging you $15 a month ($180 a year) for this game.

You don’t see me saying, “Thanks Apple for taking the time and installing that new camera in my iPhone.” No, I give them my money for their product and go on my fucking way. I vote with my wallet for their corporation.

This fanboism is where I get tired of this shit. They are a corporation that reports to the stock holders about their earnings, and we are about to make them a TON of money.

&gt; I think it would be naive to suggest blizzard won’t be prepared. They have released 7 expansions to this game, so if anyone knows what they are doing, it’s them.

This is probably true, though there haven't been a single smooth launch to this day in my experience, unless you've been playing on low-pop servers.

Some one linked that to me as well.  But it's easy to see how shoddy the work in it is (skarm and tips both have the same profile pic).  Also a 2min search on twitter confirmed that not only did tips never send out such a tweet, but the "SkarmTank" account was made yesterday, and has 0 tweets.

It was a good bait, I'll give it that.

I will try a different site. I was using curseforge.

Energy drinks will fuck you if you use them too early. Do exercise the day before and sleep for a long period of time prior to release. Have your meals preprepared and ready to cook. Make sure you have no junk food in this duration. Drink fruit juice instead of soda. You’ll start fading, but until around the 18 hour mark do not touch energy drinks. Shotgun the energy drinks at the end preferably after not eating for a bit so you get instant system shock. Eat after. Continue shotgunning and eating and you’ll make it.
---
Classic team members (primarily grunts), great job!
---
Blizzard Corporate, you can go fuck yourself as usual.
---
People don't realize what a Realm even means. Its not 2004 anymore where you have a hardcap on a Realm. 1 Realm |= 1 Server. All Servers are connected anyways. 
---
But most people here overestimate the Playercounts. Yes, early on everyone and their mother will play Classic but I bet at least 75% won't make it past Level20! So its better to have less Servers and if needed expand later than have too many Servers and after the Tourists are gone, most Servers end up being pretty much dead.

Spider Silva and Machida are both very respectful guys but yeah the BR fans are brutal, it's a culture thing probably, you grow up in that life and you become it.  You watch all these vids of people in BR getting robbed or murdered while pumping gas or something normal, and it's like every day life, shits crazy
---
Clearly that’s a bug.  Doesn’t mean layering as a concept is flawed.
---
I see more people talking shit about the people who enjoy BFA than vice versa.

I do however find it funny how many you tubers said classic would never happen and how it sucks that are now streaming it full time lol

Classic wow drama before classic even released &lt;3

Hence why I wrote layering needs to get FIXED before release.

If this thread is evident of the kind of community Classic WoW is attracting, count me the fuck out.  Haven't cringed this hard in a while.
---
Idk how it is in NA, but minorities in EU English servers are usually making guilds in their own languages, but interacts with the rest in English.
---
I’ve seen Polish, Dutch/Flemish, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian (Scandis also like to make Scandinavian guilds) guilds advertising in English and interacting with the rest of the world in English.
---
On the other side you have stories about Portuguese players taking over servers (they got their own, Aggra, in EU Eng in BFA servers. I’ve seen an Italian one (Pozzodel’Eternita or something) too.
---
Bottom line is that it probably depends on how well they speak English.
---
I think it’s been deemed the unofficial Spanish and Portuguese realm
---
Broodlord is doable, and the extra hp and armor a bear has actually help a ton vs the mortal strike.
---
Bears have trouble with Nefarian for sure, due to the fear and class call.
---
I think Princess Huhuran is hard for them too
---
And Four Horsemen too, obviously
---
Other than that, I think a bear can tank jut about anything.  Warriors may still be better suited to certain fights, but bears are preferred on others (such as Vael)

Under a million from what i have heard. Where is the rest 11 million people?
---
the ratio of retail hate to classic hate on this sub is 47 trillion to 1.
---
this is pure hypocrisy
---
your argument basically boils down to blizzard knows best because they're blizz and we should just accept what the overlords give us cause they know better. But if that was true we wouldn't be getting classic at all.
---
We are maximum 500 French canadians players divided by 2 factions and half of that should be able to speak English properly
---
Play on Pservers and see how toxic EU is. Get on a topic of the US and it's nothing but flame wars. It's pretty sad and disappointing to say the least.
---
Devilsaur leather will mean nothing. Layering prevents it from being controlled and people will farm a shitton while layering is active.

Ah I understand, I was asking for the European Spanish, should've clarified :p looks like it's Golemagg

Why don’t you simply go over to a Pacific server discord or subreddit and look at the guild recruitment threads? You’ll find tons of EST raid slot guilds for the exact reason of this thread.

Thanks man. Does it scale with intelligence on gear?

Bullshit thoses streamer should be picking a crappy name server. They know for a fact that like herod is going to be the pick for most. They are gonna screw over so many people who don't follow all this and just choose herod as it's eastern, Pvp and a good name. Most these streamers are from west coost they should pick a west coost realm.
---
Portuguese here, but I contacted with Brazilians both offline and online for many years, and mantain some online friendships that have lasted for over a decade. From moderating Brazilian community forums and playing on official and unofficial Brazilian servers for all sorts of games, I think I'm in position to answer that:
---
1- Your average Brazilian can't speak English, or any other language besides Portuguese. As such, they won't really make an effort to learn or adapt and will be actively searching for other Brazilians to interact with, since...
---
2- ... they're SO many. Brazil is the 5th most populated country on Earth, compared to the US being 3rd. Why blend in when your compatriots are everywhere? We also need to keep in mind that, culturally, Brazilians game preferences are probably closer to the US and the western world compared to China or Indonesia, other countries that make the top 5. Thus, statiscally, not only you're bound to run into Brazilians quite often, it's also natural that, aside from toxic Americans, you'll find quite a handful of toxic Brazilians.
---
3- Despite all their domestic issues, Brazilians are fiercely proud of their identity, with an almost tribal-like sense of community. While the majority of 1st and 2nd world countries are heavy consumers of American and other anglo-saxon cultural trends compared to their domestic ones, Brazilians still heavily cling to their own. This is why when Brazilians players congregate by chance in a space, they will begin to proclamate themselves in a loud and obnoxious way, most often saying stuff like "Where are my fellow Brazilians?!" "This is under Brazilian rule now!" and spewing Brazilian memes like the infamous "HUEHUEHUEHUE". This is also explained by the fact that...
---
4- ... it is simply part of their culture. Brazilians are known everywhere for being extremely extroverted, lively, loud, and charismatic, compared to the public stoicism that is common to most western cultures. You can notice this in their everyday interactions, in the way they speak, in their music, in their media, and, of course, in online communities. Here in Portugal, where there's a lot of Brazilian immigrants, the cultural shock they most often find is how we're all so much quieter, polite, and straight to the point. Inversely, in my experience, it's somewhat uncomfortable having someone you just met promoting so much physical contact and hugging you good-bye. I also often find it difficult to have group calls with my Brazilians friends because it's hard to keep up with them talking so loud and all over each other. As such, you can see why they get all riled up around each other because, frankly, that's just who they are.
---
5- You may have already heard of something called the "Jeitinho Brasileiro", which roughly translates to "Brazilian way of getting away with it". It's something closely akin to opportunism and street smarts, and it's also very ingrained culturally, which basically means that "anything is acceptable as long as you can get away with it." In online games this translates into using cheap, non-honourable tactics, like camping on FPS's, ganging up on other players, verbally abusing your opponents, scamming trades, or sometimes blatant cheating. Combined with their extrovertness, this also makes Brazilians jestful by nature, and they will start to behave and act in such way that is mostly harmless in their perspective, but annoying for other cultures.
---
6- Combining all these characteristics I've described before, the more people complain and accuse Brazilians of being toxic, the more they'll act that way. Probably a combination of having fun pissing people off, or feeling that their identity is being attacked and then lash out in return.
---
While this explains some of their toxic behaviour, these same reasons also make a lot of Brazilians incredibly nice people when you get to know them more closely. It's just that the toxic ones are more vocal and have more impact on others, so people get the tendency to lump them all together. But make no mistake, most Brazilians are incredibly good people.
---
Thank you! and all it takes is an active subscription right? No invite necessary?
---
Most of the streamers will quit. They will follow the money. 
---
Once classic WoW becomes old news they will leave. Watch what will happen if retail WoW gets exciting again - they will walk away and focus on that game. 
---
Streamers only go to whatever game gets them the most viewers. So many of them came back to WoW because they lost viewers. It will be no different.
---
Oh gotchya, lol. Glad you got your answer.
---
Yes and all those people coming from twitch will be tourists who will visit the game for the first 20 lvls, quit and keep watching their streamer play it. What, apex is a fast action shooter in the most popular game mode/ genre rn. You honestly believe 12 yo will have the attention span to collect 10 boar hide?
---
Also how hard did the classic section drop on twitch after the first day? And that is literally viewers only. Classic streams started even dying down.
---
This sub is honestly so funny. Blizz has a better idea on how the population will look like then all of you reddit game designers. But lets add 10 servers to let it be dead after literally 1 week.

Handsome fellow. His hair is on fire.
---
I am very aware that servers can hold tens of thousands but that is not very vanilla and part of the community experience is a small population where you actually recognize other players. It seemed like in summer interviews with streamers they wanted preserve that small realm culture. Perhaps that was canned which will be a damn shame.
---
This is why horde is considered the edgy virgin faction.
---
Lighten up
---
Homie you can play on west coast servers just fine even as east coast =p Spell batching makes the latency not noticible at all, and we all played on EU private servers just fine. Play west coast you wont notice the lag one bit
---
There isn't one, it's pure BS.
---
It's a low res texture that's slightly transparent. This is exactly how it looked in vanilla.
---
/e wtf is up n00bs
---
everyone I know wants to be Horde because "kids play alliance".... Someone should let them know those kids are know late 20's and 30s.
---
Yeah I play those three classes the most over the years
---
Staysafe implied yesterday that the streamers had decided to all go to the same (unannounced) server, so there will likely still be a non-BR, non-streamer, PVP USEast server.
---
You could also always just roll on another region. I'm moving to the West Coast during launch, but I'm thinking about rolling on an East Coast server anyway, just so I can raid "later" relative to EST, without actually having to routinely go to bed right after raids.

Where is the bad dragon dildo?

Yeah pretty much. Stay alert for name reservations tomorrow as well.

---
It's not an issue of them trying to be viable; they ARE viable.

I think it just boils down to some people not wanting them to be viable, so that warriors can continue their tank monopoly.  Then you get misinformation like this thrown around.

They smelled money

Kind of sucks if he was indeed framed and the admins of your server cord are willing to do that. You can do a lot by owning the server discord if you have little morals.

I do hope it's not the case and they are just incompetent but I kind of doubt it and think the admins were behind it and framed him :/

Grow up.

Nope! What's that?

Nothing strikes more fear in me than lapping a three+ namer lol

Going to run a cowardly warrior called Thex who is terrified of dungeons so will spend his time fishing
---
&gt; why (I as priest) always got innervate priority?
---
1. Priests tops healing meters a lot of times;
---
2. Priests have higher spirit;
---
3. Other Druids can Innervate themselves if needed;
---
4. Paladins have shit spirit;
---
These are the reasons I Innervated Priests most of the times.
---
Thanks! Much appreciated!
---
Rag was never a Brasilian server, you clearly dont know the difference between port and spanish.
---
Also Brasilians dont usually play with other latin americans
---
Its vice versa on r/wow. 
---
You say anything about classic there then the hivemind downvoted you, ironically the Classic announcement is the top voted post on that sub.
---
It had a lot of technical issues with performance as well. Lots of players quit before really getting into the game simply due to that.
---
God, I see everything so much more clearly now...
---
Atleast its people from same server. And it will be gone after phase one, when zones wont be as crowded.

Haha, had you on follow the whole time.   
---
was a lot of fun.
---
I think a lot of that sort of talk was trolls
---
One vowel away from being totally on point.
---
I can tell just by reading through this thread that grob is going to be a lot of fun. I hope we can attain the faction balance of ED (I was not around in ye olden days so idk if that balance can be attributed to TBC adding belves). And if you don't RP and just want to be on RP-PVP for the community, that's great; as an RPer I always take it as a compliment when people say they prefer our servers.
---
Over analyzing, warriors are the tanks ppl. Maybe others can get by in dungeons but really it's just annoying. Raid specific yes only warriors and warrior off tanks. The game was all about unbalance, deal with it and know your role ;)
---
Yes! This sub needs more Virgin vs Chads 😂

similar shit happened in the warframe community. I've watched server ownership and head administration positions change many times with an improvement for server health only once. i know the newest server owner is a good guy and see a positive future for the warframe discord.
---
Hey, any way to fix the bank window for elvui?

I didn’t mean that you had a problem with it, just that people in general do and I don’t understand it. My entire comment was agreeing with you.

Huehue
---
There was an imgur where soda was thinking faerlina. However many of the other streamers he wants to play with have said they are rolling herod
---
I'm Brazilian,  but god damn the BR community is really toxic and I would really like to avoid it.
---
we can't talk portuguese, trust me.
---
Then they should make language specific servers or in general more servers!!
---
Auto shot/Aimed shot shouldn’t put you into combat until the moment of impact. 
---
If that’s not currently happening then it needs to be added to the list of important things to fix before people start hitting 60, as a lot of hunter related pull methods involve niche trap or gear changes as you pull.

unbind your turn keys and just get used to it
---
They do it FOR FREE
---
Once layering is gone they can balance out the overpopulated servers with free transfers to underpopulated ones. People will take the transfer to avoid the queues. If they are all still overpopulated they can spin up a new one and open transfers there to avoid the queue.
---
But it’s been stated many times.
---
"We're MC raiders..."
---
They have all managed to get a reputation of being really bad at playing retail, what could go wrong?
---
Made it through Elwynn.  Looks good so far.  Will there be options to not include professions, such as tailoring or is there a specific leveling  purpose for them besides just for the gear. I was confused as when it was asking me to buy thread.  Thanks!
---
Thanks for sharing---once I quit Discord, it started working.
---
Ok thanks bye
---
Despite the language player - they are unbelievably rude and awful players.
---
It’s nothing racial or bigoted but I would much rather play with random Chinese players I can’t understand than Br players. Everyone that’s played with people from SA servers know the average person there just sucks balls at the game. All the good players from South America go to NA servers because they know the stigma and likely realize how bad the rest of the players are, which makes it even worse because the chances of running into players that can do basic mechanics becomes even more rare. I know that there are a lot of BR players that are great, I’m just saying the average player is well known to be something to avoid. Nothing personal or xenophobic.
---
Those were probably all 40 active druids playing on that server, haha.
---
So easier in the case that you have to hope free transfers open up and then convince everyone to leave the server they've hopefully established themselves on because Blizzard couldn't be arsed to be reasonable?
---
With what appears to be 30k+ servers you have to hope the players drop off by almost 90% active players to be able to remove the promised end of sharding (assuming no lies this time), then hope the economy's not busted by having a massively inflated player pop for a few months and then down to normal size, then hope the community can settle itself and return to normal after this mess. Don't forget about hoping Blizz offers free transfers (money they won't get so who knows) to less populated new servers where you then have to convince your guild to follow suit leaving their established servers (or so we hope they have otherwise shit's bad) for a new one giving them a reverse dead server experience where you lose large chunks of your established community and hope more people flock to your server. Then someone saying "they chose to change server" while ignoring they wouldn't have to if Blizz didn't try to cram dozens of servers down into one.
---
I don't see how merging two servers are worse than what we're getting if Blizz are attentive to not let them fester for months. The better option still would've been to just have server shards like Grobbolus 1/2/3/4/... where they'll be merged when the population dropped to allow it with a shared naming list. Not perfect but better than what the hell's going on with this. Dead servers isn't just a quick answer and shouldn't just be thrown around for anything that's not this weird server solution they cooked up.
---
I was withdrawing from kratom and phenibut at the same time a few years ago, didn't sleep for 9 days, AT all. Had to go to ER. I felt retarded. Couldn't do simple tasks.
---
have fun with ur poorly designed questing zones, i'll be over here with my rep gain bonus and stoneform
---
It scales with EVERYTHING, but I assume it's additive along with things like blessings, Spirit of Zandalar, Darkmoon etc, and not multiplicative.
---
Moar dots!
---
&gt;I tried practicing on a target dummy and the rotation was absolutely weightless button mashing. 
---
oh boy do I have some bad news about classic for you
---
Look at a map dude. Most of South America (especially Brazil) is closer to the Eastern servers. Mexico and Central America are closer to West.
---
That it is a better game has nothing to do with how many players will  play it. Believe it or not, the game is not for everyone and the playerbase will go down from release and remain at a certain point. Literally 99% of the playerbase will be vets, the game has no potential to grow.
---
You have just described the same exact experience I had.
---
Kinda. All BRs are Brazilians, but not every Brazilian is a BR. 
---
The same way not every North American is a 'Murican. 
---
But most Brazilian avoid speaking portuguese/speaking at all because we can't get rid of the stygma.
---
Thanks for this post! I’m still working on the kinks and waiting on art for the Atiesh discord, but most of the Chat Channels are set up.

Though my phone won’t let me organize the PvP channels how I want. D:

It's EXTREMELYL flawed.

Hi, /u/BossyNightmare

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cojlbb/so_which_na_server_is_the_chill_antihardcore_realm/). 
---
Holy shit I may regret joining this realm...
---
the reason for not wanting to merge servers has nothing to do with what you just wrote. the biggest reason (which has also been mentioned by industry veterans and even blizzard employees) is that merging servers is basically a declaration of dwindling player numbers, which is no good for PR.
---
It's notably harder these days (requiring a 3rd party tool), and finally Blizzard cracked down on it a few months ago when banning hackers, they banned people who were model swapping for non-advantageous reasons and then unbanned them with a warning. Model swapping is effectively dead in WoW these days.
---
Didn't make it to a capital city to test. Might update later if I decide to make the run.
---
you must have been dropped on your head.  the only way to play world of warcraft is with pvp in contested zone son
---
Not my problem
---
&gt;most of them, common sense
---
Implying the ones making the decisions actually care more about the game than profits.
---
I'd like to vager (just a guess still but...) the decision with few servers and sharding is probably the costs. Could be due to easy to management etc. not overly sure how their infrastructure is set up, but that might be a likely reason.
---
But one thing is for sure, the person making that decision in the end, is really high up in the ladder and that's generally the people more disconnected about the game itself and more connected to how to make money for shareholders.
---
They are also assuming entire playerbase will be online 100% of the time.
---
I screamed HELP like 4x right before 4 deaths inside Jasperlode Mines to the unhelpful who stood feet away.
---
I have a side mouse button where my thumb goes that I use to toggle autorun. On my rogue I click it very fast twice to just move a tiny bit. Works pretty well
---
The last one made me laugh, i remember thinking the same back in the days so i tried.. was a bad idea x)
---
Played hunter during Vanilla - my cousin played a warrior. 
---
Levelling and PVP was easier for me but he carried me into many a raid group. 
---
Big up Vinadiel!
---
It's so wide and bright
---
I mean, the feedback from the beta seemed to finally convince them of making enemies actually deal damage for the first time in a while, if anything. I believe classic’s reception can definitely influence the decision making of the devs
---
They did fine guys. It's easy for us to nitpick at small details like this but facts are Blizzard did hire externally to try and recreate it well. 
---
If THIS is the biggest complaint we can find about Classic in a day, I'm happy with it
---
cool story bro, tell me more
---
Masque Apathy!
---
Grobbulous
---
Well, Legion as it is now is not even close to what it was when launched, because of level scaling and the no artifact weapon abilities. 
---
It's a shame cause IMO legion was the best expansion since wrath... Idk what you intend to find in Classic, or what you are even looking for in an mmo.
---
And as we talk now it’s #6 for streaming on twitch.....at 11 AM EST during a stress test....
---
Look up on YouTube Tim and Eric Poop Tube. It's perfect for this situation. Just aim it at the wall or out of a window.
---
They had like 200 full servers at launch. And mostly empty servers half a year later.
---
MC and Ony are loot piñatas. 
---
The first two bosses of BWL is a massive wake up call and you instantly figure out which raiders were just sliding by / getting carried because there are actual mechanics involved. 
---
ZG and AQ20 are also loot piñatas. 
---
AQ40 and Naxx become a combination of mechanics, hard work, long hours, and generally just a war of attrition. 
---
World bosses become more of a PvP fest and are usually farmed by the top guilds and mostly untouchable by everyone else.
---
Wuuuut. This can't be true!
---
Are you using the same character? I found things saved per character but not per account
---
begone zoomer
---
I find this a really petty distinction that people seem to want to draw.  "Don't think i'm supporting them on their new shit!  I'm about that OLD SCHOOL game only!"
---
Both are correct, just one is PvP the other PvE.
---
I super curious what the level of wow classic hype is for gamers in korea.  Are they expecting people that have not played since tbc/wrath to come back for this launch and play for a month or two?  Are they expecting low turn out to stay on classic servers and maybe have some defectors trying classic move over to modern wow?
---
the actual moonkin form is mediocre in PvP. Balance itself though is probably the best PvP spec, usually as a hybrid with Feral or Resto. In PvE it's mediocre but there's a lot of theorycraft that has gone into the spec recently that makes it \*okay\*. Check out keftenk's balance druid guide, he does a good job with gear, rotation, etc. Lots of downranking involved. Contrary to popular belief, boomkins don't actually go OOM easily. Mana is a non-issue to the well-prepared raider. The issue is DPS output.
---
"official" discord servers made by players. Ok.
---
Pretty sure that's not the case, but if you have reason to believe that it is please share :)
---
Who is hating on them? I've been out of the loop for a couple weeks, and I'm just excited the game is right around the corner.
---
I use MobInfo2 for this
---
Even on 10k+ pop private servers I regularly saw familiar faces. The reality is those players may be diluted but you’ll still notice people all the time.
---
Thanks for clarification. My Spanish is non-existing, so thought they had decided for one singular Realm!
---
hmm i guess I didn't think of all that. I generally prefer high pop servers though so I'm hoping they won't just be the streamer ones then.
---
&gt; Now we can make the public chat channels in Classic just like Twitch chat.
---
Please don't.
---
Do we have any info on whether LA and BR guilds are predominantly horde or alliance?
---
Yeah same. Cant get wow to register Kui at all.
---
Ok, I hope you enjoy dealing with personal armies of streamers
---
Yeah super weird, but it's good players like yourself that notice these things and become a better paladin in the long run from all the other OOMadins running around using rank 2 instead of rank 1
---
Granted!
---
Lol what? Maybe that’s your preference, but warlocks are very much loved in vanilla dungeon groups. Soulstone? Extra health pots for everyone? Stam and fire buff for tank? Someone has to hearth and repair, summon them right back. And in vanilla +spell damage and +healing were separate so they wouldn’t be competing with healers for everything - just you.
---
&gt;To explain a little more, Horde don't have access to Salvation (threat reduction buff from pallies) plus they get Windfury buff (big DPS and therefore threat gain), so their warriors have a relatively harder time maintaining a threat lead. This can lead to DPS having to slow down so as not to pull threat, which sucks because they can't maximize their DPS. Feral druids excel at gaining tonnes of threat, so they ameliorate this issue nicely.
---
If you go Alliance you'll have access to blessing of wisdom, which makes feral dps spec have essentially infinite mana. You don't get that hordeside. If you care about ever doing feral dps at a serious level (full powershifting rotation/MCP's etc) then consider alliance. Feral Tank works perfectly well on either side, so just pick your faction.
---
I've noticed my priest seems to hit with her stave with regularity. No idea if they made it easier for the test or not.
---
Lol @ people who play on Pvp realms.
---
Type /wst and there are boxes for width and height. I'm gonna change the default values because after actually using it, they are way too big
---
Generaal Kenobi!
---
you are right tho
---
And murlocs.
---
Hahaha ah well, it did came to my attention the bitterness people have in them. It’s sad. 
---
But hey, In 16ish days we’re going home! Which is the most important!
---
He did get layered while he was in the group.
---
If you wish to outplay your opponents I'd say rule out druids. Their dps is so low they normally outlast people, and that's harder 1v2.
---
With druid/hunter you can cc the other and burst the other at least if you get the jump on them.
---
Blizz really are dumb as fuck
---
can someone tldr these nerd drama posts?  I'm not 12 anymore
---
As a brazilian, this was a very interesting read. I certainly agree with many points.
---
&gt; Combined with their extrovertness, this also makes Brazilians jestful by  nature, and they will start to behave and act in such way *that is  mostly harmless in their perspective*, but annoying for other cultures. 
---
This part... well... not really. I am sure the ones doing that are completely aware they are being dicks. I don't act like that and absolutely hate this kind of behavior. I imagined Thalnos would be the "chosen" server, and I am definitely getting away from it.
---
I think it all really stems from impunity. "Jeitinho Brasileiro" is only a thing because it's actually hard to get in trouble for pretty much anything. If there was a way to enforce good behavior on WoW, they would adapt instead of abandoning the game.
---
I couldn't stop laughing whenIi entered the Shimmering Flats and realized that I was standing on a racing track the whole time!
---
Is the dwarf the self-proclaimed mouthpiece of the people Barley Mcfrothbeard?
---
No fun allowed
---
Considering that the servers ran like ass at release (remember getting stuck in the loot animation due to database lag?), I'm heavily leaning towards technical reasons.
---

Great post. I think the elephant in the room is that Brazilian men are generally assholes. They act online just like they do in person. They’re loud, rude and have little regard for the well-being of others. It has nothing to do with race, it’s just their culture and it’s not very compatible with people outside of Brazil, even accounting for language barriers.
---
Finally got it to work. Now i'm having problems with getting any of the raid frames addons lol

Because there still fun.

Maybe I'm just a crusty old internet man, but I would much rather use a realm forum than a realm discord.

Personally what I'm tired of is this american propaganda shit that has you lot defending anything a corporation does simply because their a corporation or because of money. It's obnoxious, asinine and just bugger off geez. It is perfectly possible to have some damn integrity and sense of self as a company, blizzard certainly used to have it - used to.
---
Pretty much this. I'm expecting the Mafia to be a heavy presence on most servers and will just buy Devilsaur mats off of AH, have a guildie craft, and be done with it.
---
yea blizzard should just listen to you and the rest of this sub.
---
I didn't say it was I was just explaining to you the cost of turning off their stream and why they probably won't.
---
I actually think Warlocks will be overrepresented according the polls I’ve seen
---
I think everyone wants to be the loved underdog and Warlock fits the bill
---
Brazil is not one of them. I’ve been there. I generally agree with you though.
---
Leave it to 2019 Blizzard to tarnish what made Classic great.
---
Just avoid the streamer server -&gt; problem solved..
---
Btw. Laughing in EU
---
Because warriors look dope. They have swords and shields. They get to wear plate. And when you get to 60 you’re a beast.
---
Care to elaborate? How is your target not flying away better?
---
I'd wager that the majority of classic players will be former pserver players. But there's no real way to tell beforehand.
---
I came to post I ain't reading all that
---
Used to be blizzard had some sense of self and integrity towards making a good game with gameplay first. Those days are definitely done and over and things are pretty much as you describe them yeah. Classic is currently the only and hopefully not last stand those of us who want better are making.
---
Warrior with pocket healer can run through a lot of players in pvp, they take forever for most people to kill and if you focus the healer they'll tear you up. The pain is worth it usually because they're always short on supply at high levels.
---
Most vanilla players never reached 60.  Classic will have a drop off in pop when the bfa or lookilue players bail.
---
Some people love the class. Tanks are also high demand and can be done in any spec for most dungeons so you dont spend as much time searching for a group.
---
I agree for first timers, I've already done this before so now I wanna try go faster 😅
---
This is true, I'm in the video as explained in an above comment. Us in Serenity would get random tells from low level people who just made a toon to ask questions about the raid or Az's user interface with the char models
---
To avoid server merges. This is functionally a bunch of launch servers rolled into each layered server, but when the interest dies down they merge the layers and at the end of phase 1 shoot for a vanilla server population, one layer's worth. (2500-3k concurrent)
---
This guy right here actually. 
---
I'm extremely photosensitive, but I can adjust my brightness settings to be comfortable for things that are uniformly bright. But when I use darkmode, I always run the risk of something extremely bright popping up that just ruins me because all my settings are adjusted to dark mode.
---
Yes, one that guarantees a serious negative impact on the games community aspect.
---
so basically Faerlina might be the safest choice as of right now?
---
I don't either, though even before tokens, I remember gold inflation climbing wildly. Retail's made some choices that remove venues for gold to be taken out of the economy like class trainers and mount prices, while adding more ways to get gold, which is essentially adding more counterfeit machines while removing trash bins to throw excess bills into. But it's true tokens have been nothing but throwing napalm onto gold inflation issues, by encouraging more aggressive "money printing."
---
&gt; the better option still would've been to just have server shards like Grobbolus 1/2/3/4/... where they'll be merged when the population dropped to allow it with a shared naming list.
---
This is literally what layering is except dynamic instead of static.  Layering just creates Grobbolus 2/3/4/5 as more people log in and lets you swap between them so friends aren't separated until the merge.
---
They’re rude, obnoxious assholes in real life too. Their gaming culture is just a glimpse of that.
---
"cries in spanish"
---
More like "acceptable racist comment LUL 4head"
---
Ayy I'm on ED right now. Cant telling the server is still active or fighting to stay alive.
---
Rotate tranquil totem and wf? Likely going to cost a shitload of mana though, should work for burst phases.
---
because when you play with other people warriors are gods.
---
So can I.
---
Replace "Brazilian" with "black" and all of a sudden the comment is racist.  The current state of racism.
---
I trust Blizzard to fuck it up since they've had a good record of that lately
---
Bye dweeb.
---
Wake up, they're never removing it.
---
You really have no clue how feral tanking works lol...
---
best in slot item for feral is the manual crowd pummeler, by far. When you're not using the MCP, you're using something with a crap ton of armor like the Warden Staff or the mace from DM. That's about it.
---
Reminds of the time MSN Messenger had that plugin that showed what song you were listening to on Winamp.
---
Can someone tell me what I am looking at? And why this is bad? Is this some streamer bs?
---
"No thunderbluff on fire?" Sylvanas doesnt like this pic. Even classic Sylvanas doesnt like It.
---
I was 11 when I started playing WoW in 2004, so maybe. But the gaming landscape is different now so you might be right - I'm not sure
---
CmonBruh
---
Says loser that only posts something stupid and pathetic every few weeks to months.
---
no it doesnt
---
&gt;warlocks are very much loved in vanilla dungeon groups.
---
Yeah, if you need dps and have nobody else, that's an option.
---
&gt;Soulstone? Extra health pots for everyone?
---
Yeah, just only when they felt like doing those things.
---
&gt;Stam and fire buff for tank?
---
I hope that's not the best aspect you'd go advertise about the warlock class?
---
&gt;Someone has to hearth and repair, summon them right back.
---
Every other hunter had engi for creating ammunition, so in the end game that means they carry repair bots / jumper cables negating whatever advantage warlock would have as a feature over hunters apart the dmg.
---
&gt; And in vanilla +spell damage and +healing were separate so they wouldn’t be competing with healers for everything - just you.
---
Yeah, sure, as if nobody would be interested in pure int / sta gear.
---
I highly doubt it. You are looking at a population in Classic of 1m+ once the "tourists" leave. The PServer population is well under 100k. And people who make a character for 10 levels and stop on PServers don't count.
---
You also will have the PServer purists that would rather not play on an official server.
---
This, warriors with pocket healers in R11+ gear can really roll.
---
Who says Warriors can't 1v1?
---
Oh no we're gonna miss you lol
---
Since I'm brazilian, I think I can offer a good advice on this matter. 
---
The problem with BR players in online games is that most of them (16-17 old kids) aren't used to REAL grinding and working your way up to be the best player you can be. P2W games are very popular around here, so the majority of the player base is used to spend a lot of money and progress easily (but Classic is not like this). People tend to like power, to be the "server kings", abusing others and being toxic. Also, when they see someone better than them, instead of grinding to be on the same level of play or joining teams, they harass and get envy.
---
I know this kind of thing exists, I know about the BR reputation in online games, but I can firmly say that there are good players out there. IMO, if you play NA realms, you NEED to speak english, like, it's a pre-requisite. Any player who join a realm like that and does not speak english is, indeed, a problem. Anyway, WoW is not one of the top popular games here, much less is Classic, so it's not like EVERYBODY is going to play it.
---
If you happen to encounter a toxic player like that, simply ignore it and move on. They want attention, they want you to be mad. Don't give in.
---
Yep. Honestly I also loved the fact that as I was leveling my alt, I would run into the same horde person in BGs from level 19-49 and he would shit on me in almost every different leveling bracket. But that was such.a cool experience to move to the next bracket and recognize his name
---
Is it available on Wallpaper Engine ?
---
Idk about your age comment.  12 year olds spend tons of time on arbitrary shit like minecraft.  Slowly beating up 25 boars is right down that alley.
---
Plus I was committed as fuck to WoW since closed beta when I was 12
---
It's 7 ppm, not % chance.  If it was % chance then all paladins would be running around with fast as fuck weapons.
---
Yeah I can't wait to start leveling my paladin to 60 stress test is fun an all but id rather have a reason to keep questing lol
---
Don't you feel kinda bad for him with the whole missing a finger yet still playing games.
---
WE GOT A MEMER
---
theres already a huge push back on how most current games are designed. Loot Boxes, pay to win, achievements. All antithetical to how games are truly enjoyable. From the most hardcore to the most casual. We all know true enjoyment comes from games void of those mechanics (speak in generalities). Companies that foster active communities and don't capitulate to those care-bears which has changed Retail into what it is today. Short term money grabs don't create lasting communities.
---
I downloaded it and have yet to see an emote. Either people don’t know about it or I need to fix it
---
which you would have to do anyway if there was to many servers at launch and you picked the wrong one which is dead in 3 weeks. there is no perfect solution to any of this, but for some reason this sub thinks there is.
---
yes, but their modern implementation kind of ruined the charm for me. i like the feeling of achievement associated with making your way to secret places in a way that’s not necessarily intended lol
---
Yes, my inactivity on reddit totally invalidates my opinion. Shut your putrid fucking hole, i can smell the stench of your rotting mountain dew infested teeth from here.
---
I made a comment a while back about fixing Layering.
---
Make Layer Switching only happen in a few places.
---
1.) When you are on a flight path. (This is the easiest place to do it.)
---
2.) When you graveyard Rez.
---
3.) When you hearth.
---
4.) When you log back into the game and the layer you were on is no longer available.
---
5.) When you transition zones.
---
Then pull layering off the game as fast as fucking possible.
---
People also just like to play on high-pop servers, and making x-realm servers later is a declaration of failure. So it just doesn't make sense to have a lot of realms at any point, and that was a mistake in Retail that they have long-since learned from.
---
Most people don't know about it yet, just type Kappa or PogChamp and you'll see if it works
---
Honestly, I've had good experiences with Brazilians. I have a group of Brazilian friends I've played with since 2008, they're some of the best players I have ever played with (high level gladiators, high level Dota players, etc). But... outside of that group and a few others, most Brazilians have been a pretty bad experience.  My group of BR friends used to hate playing with other random Brazilians. There is definitely some truth to what people are saying here.
---
The only thing I noticed about Warrior was how fast my HP regens out of combat. Even at 15.
---
I think in todays times the construct of a server is just a social one and not a technical. I think a wow-realm nowaday consists of dynamically spawned server-instances and every server-instance is layer. I think its possible to host an even larger number of players on a single realm and there is no real technilcal restriction. 
---
What do you think are the gameplay restriction of a realm with a huge number of players... say like 100k of players on a single realm spread on multiple different layers?
---
Haven't been able to get this working. I read /yaht would help, but that isn't a recognized command for me.
---
Make sure you log out after changing settings/bindings. If you don’t do a proper logout your changes won’t save.
---
I think pointing out that only 2 eu-pvp realms means they are absurdly okay with an estimate of only &lt;20,000 eu pvpers is the best argument in there.
---
I'd like to point out that BR are unbearable to play with in all online games, not just MMOs.
---
Former Gurubashi player from Vanilla to Cata. Server transferred because it felt like most of the raiding guilds were BR or SP as all the top English speaking guilds had abandoned the server.
---
Herod though
---
It's a great compromise, but the private server autists don't react well to any change. Which is why you always see the same few names totally fixated on that and that alone.
---
Two datapoints they have now, that they didn't have in Vanilla, are that ***everyone likes playing on high-pop servers*** and ***no one likes x-realm nonsense or combining low-pop servers later***.
---

Multi-billion companies make way bigger catastrophic fuck ups every year so that’s not really an argument.
---
Both kinds of Feral Druids are objectively better on Alliance side, because they get both Kings and Might as a Bear, while on horde they get... AGI totem? Idk if this even happen, I never play horde. Also, only ally Druids are true master shapeshifters, since they get both Furbolg Form (a.k.a healer form) and Wisp Form. Also, horde cat form is ugly af.
---
dude how are you gonna ask someone to identify a UI without giving a pic or even a vid of the ui.  like orcbit on YT uses it?  you think I'm gonna google that for you?
---
/golfclap mr pedantic.
---
&gt; They just open a couple more servers and give free transfers there to get out of the queue
---
If they do that it defeats the reasons they gave to have layering in the first place.
---
You’d be surprised how much a ravange can crit for on a cloth or leather wearer. 
---
Sometimes I like to open with a pounce to make a mage blow a cooldown on blink and possibly frost nova. Which will enable you to charge and then bash after 4s. This is all of course if you get an opener. If you don’t then you’re far more reliant on bear form, stunning for heals and building a good amount of rage for frenzied regeneration. 
---
Whenever you pop out, you apply your hots to yourself as well as moonfire and insects to them. 
---
It might feel like you’re not doing enough damage BUT your class will outlast all others if you play it smart. 
---
As far as In a raid you need to consider going deep into the Resto and some into balance and Resto for furor and natural weapons. I believe shedo the Druid (look his YouTube up) has an excellent guide on this. But HOTW for feral dps is minimal lol. You’re missing out on a Lot of dps without leader of the pack/ natural weapons.
---
Flying really killed World PvP.
---
Flying made the world on the ground feel empty after it was implemented and the interactions between factions on the roads/paths diminished quickly.
---
My favorite part of every expansion is that time before Flying is allowed. The interest falls fast once flying is unlocked
---
This whole project seems like it’s been treated with disdain from the beginning. For years they acted like nobody actually wants a classic server, “you think you do but you don’t”. Now they release a tiny server list as if they’re expecting tiny demand, like the whole concept of a classic server implies that they’ve FUCKED the game up through updates (which is universally agreed to, but that’s like admitting defeat at a corporate level which they’re trying hard not to do).
---
crusader is only useful for leveling weapon skill.
---
./thanks
---
I guess there is not a real need to worry considering we have layers this time. It most likely won't get to Warsong or Gurubashi levels of BR dominance.
---
I'll try to avoid Thalnos anyway... but avoiding streamers is still a bigger priority.
---
Because it's obvious that this number of servers isn't anticipating the demand for classic WoW, but meant to accommodate every possible scenario with permanent layering.
---
As a pacific player I play on eastern servers so my raid times are 5-8 instead of 8-11. Its great since I normally go to bed around 9 and wake up at 5:30am.
---
This is bullshit lmao, like mayb 1% cares about their stupid name. People want to play the game and have fun. Making the game unplayable just so people can hold onto their precious names is beyond stupid.
---
Nice casual discrimination
---
seriously why the fuck are there no LA or SA servers.. why do ours have to get invaded
---
Well it's not, Kevin Jordan said it. You can listen to him say it on Classiccast for yourself
---
Thank you!
---
so you're saying you're ok with sharding and server caps of 50.000... sure is a authentic vanilla feeling
---
They’re just being armchair idiots. Racism and ethnic discrimination are colloquial synonyms.
---
And they've never had easier targets.
---
lol. So instead of just doing it the easy way. Your 12yo self did it the extreme hard way lol
---
Tldr: yes Brazilians are toxic
---
Will of the Forsaken
---
Working as intended
---
people hoping for 20-30 servers pretty much tells you everything you need to realize that, perhaps, just perhaps blizzard shouldnt be listening to everything this community says. industry veterans have told us that being forced to merge or close servers because of them being dead and void of any players is the worst kind of solution, particularly for PR reasons. No MMO wants this.
---
I've been vote kicked from dungeons on retail by Brazilians for not speaking Portuguese... That's pretty much my only interaction with them in-game
---
It's possible soda will play on faerlina and not even play with the other streamers.
---
Yea financially they seem to be ok with numbers we all consider crazy low haha
---
If character control and keybinds were on a spectrum, you just pointed to autism.
---
Do you have a link?
---
I thought layering would be cool... OMG I was wrong. .Org straight up looks dead. Hell I even had to invite this Mage who was making bags in Org to group just so I could seem him in this dead city. It’s awful and I hope it gets better at launch...
---
In vanilla that I had that same point of view and was a druid. 
---
There is a high skill ceiling on druid and you can pretty much outplay any matchup outside of warlock, which was just impossible if they were decent.  For example, I dueled a well known rogue on my server for 100g and won.  He thought he had a sure thing.
---
You are definitely a worse ganking class than a rogue though, the burst damage simply isn't there, which also limits your 1v2.  
---
I used to set up shop in the back lines of AV for my ganking people as they ran to the zerg.  Just let the warlocks keep going and you should kill everyone else and if you get in trouble, you can bail fairly easily.
---
Druid is incredibly fun when you master it.
---
So I think it's correct that they will need a few more servers. A TON more? No.
---
But I think they are really smart to play it this way, honestly. It's wayyy better to start with too few servers than too many, for the obvious reason that you want the servers to feel alive months after release and you don't want to have to merge servers. Especially since they have said they will spin up new servers very quickly if needed. 
---
Also it's kind of good publicity if they have to make new servers. Think of all the headlines on the various youtube videos that will inevitably be made from big creators. "WoW Classic Launch Too Popular! Blizzard has to create more servers!" etc. It's really good press for the game.
---
I have already concluded that I won't be using the MCPs while cat 95% of the time.   It's just not worth it to waste that on farm content.
---
Still good
---
Man did they really? 
---
I never remember a time playing that game when it didn’t feel empty
---
as long as you're not staring at the balls, it's not gay
---
Duke it out with naked lvl 1s 1v1 fist fight tournament. Winner picks
---
It´s really stupid that you´re merging south americans with BR. We dont want them neither.
---
What the fuck is wrong with you?  Do you really call anyone who plays a game differently to you autistic?
---
We'll* have to eat the crow on release :(

add the oceanic realms

There were two Golemagg discords, both of them merged and then some shit went down and the one they merged into got messed with. Steak got the blame and banned - weither it was him or not remains to be seen.
---
The Shazzrah team are not effected and don't want to get involved.
---
Or we could speak english
---
classic will be a lot bigger than pservers. I know a lot of what we see before release is hype, but just look at the size of the discord/reddit/twitch communities, they are more active than retail communities (and 20x as active as any pserver community), it's surprises me how many people are trying it out.
---
A discord with fair mods? Thats crazy.
---
I am here to chew ass and kick bubblegum
---
I'll see you on Whitemane.

All hail her royal thighness!

this but unironically

The entire PvP system is launched in P2, and P3 introduces BGs. That's a major part of gameplay.

Also that's not how it workss. It doesn't mater how many they are, they are only 1 country, everyone else speaks spanish. "Common language" is about comunication ammong different communities, in this case different countries.

What do you think progression will be like on Grobb based on progression of other RP-PvP realms from vanilla? I want to at least clear BWL
---
BR be more like kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
---
Launch servers are a 1 million dollards math problem to solve. 
---
The technology you're talking about is layering which players don't want. If they do too little servers, server population, even after the drop of players, will still be too high to remove layering after phase 1 as planned. If they do too many servers, we will end up with a bunch of dead servers as you said. It's a big dillema.
---
But right now why i personally think this is too little servers is because i don't believe that even after the hype is gone servers will have a low enough population to remove layering. You have to take into account that some servers will have more players than others too. 
---
I think blizzard is smart enough to realise this too which indicates to me that blizzard does not intend to remove layers in the future.
---
I feel like Europeans will be more likely to stick with the game because they're used to misery
---
Best comment in this subreddit
---
Blizz: You underestimate my knowledge of the Layering!
---
Ever occur to you that they’re not toxic, *they just don’t understand you?*
---
How so? Layering is to avoid dead servers. This way they have fewer servers, and merge the layers as population declines. If they still have too many people at the end when they remove layering, they can open another server or two to take the extra people. 
---
If they had more to start with and spread the population too much, then they would have had to merge servers when the population drops. They have never merged servers, they won't start now.
---
has anyone made a chart?
---
I thought herod was streamers
---
Thalnos or w/e was BR
---
Faerlina i thought was the choice for the rest of us. 
---
did i miss something?
---
Oh okay, so what should I pickup with tailoring? Like what would make the most gold?
---
A separate entry on the launcher would be great too.
---
You can walk up to a mob, and never have it activate or activate once. 
---
You can walk up to a second mob and have it activate twice on two normal melee swings, and obliterate it in the process. 
---
Basically the damage can be burst which isn’t always great for leveling.
---
not really, battleground spam is only fun for a bit for most people
---
Honestly, roll with the streamers if everyone rolls together. There will be full pops on both factions
---
Babe, turn on sunshine
---
How is it negative impact? Does layering split trade channels or something?
---
I know at least multiple servers completely prohibit grouping together.
---
How?
---
What's stopping them from rolling on any server they want?
---
Hasn’t tips said they were going to a east coast pvp server?
---
i remember when i used to get mad when people dont wanted to play wtih me, ofcourse iwas  on kinder garden
---
Faer is the unofficial Spanish server now.
---
I'm sure its as simple as that.
---
Some controls are objectively bad, but there are a few awkward folk who can make it work.
---
you're talking about 10's of milliseconds in difference here.  This game was damn playable with pings near half a second.  It doesn't matter choose whichever one has the coolest name I guess.
---
&gt;third most spoken language in the world
---
Because of South America. In the EU it's nothing special.
---
Completely wrong. Most of the south americans guys are able to communicate in English. BR cannot (or dont want to). And, even if can communicate better with BR than US people, it´s certainly far from optimal. We dont want to play with them neither.
---
God forbid they have to get a real job like the rest of us
---
Fuck
---
They're ran by the same people, just avoid them at all costs
---
Herod is most likely going to be the streamer server since the other servers they were considering are getting populated with latin-america players.
---
So it'll likely have the longest queue times, given that the streamers do in fact roll there.
---
MMOs bring something extra over games like DOTA or League. Because the world is persistent, holding grudges, camping and griefing certain groups becomes much more viable.
---
Not necessarily. Things like weather were not implemented on illicit servers as it was in actual Vanilla because it was server-side programming.
---
Get a fucking mustache you animal.
---
Literally the only difference between yours and mine is that I realised I never use W, so I bound it to one of many abilities...

You do realise that wasd makes absolutely no sense whatsoever to a left handed person?

---
Herod is the only Classic realm capable of pushing anywhere near that pop though. It's looking like realms like Bloodsail Buccaneers, Atiesha, and Myzrael might have like 3000 people total (they're each around 100 to 180 in the Reddit survey, or less than 1/10th of Herod's population).
---
Launching with few server is a very smart decision.  Nobody can predict where the game will be in a year, two years, or five years.  Sure they can launch with 30 servers per region, but what happens after then?  Populations settle, people stop playing, and then the player base is spread too thin and you end up with dead servers.  And NOBODY like server mergers  This is the worst case scenario.
---
With only a few servers, they guarantee that each realm with have a VERY healthy population.  If it's TOO healthy, then new servers can be spun up very quickly.  It's much easier to spin up new servers on the fly as demand calls for it, than to overestimate population size and end up with half the servers being dead in a year or so.
---
It astounds me that more people don't understand this.
---
So half of the continent speaks a language. and the other half speaks variatons of another but since they are divided they are the common tongue.
---
Well I hope you are right, because if you're not, we just might get layering for longer than we thought
---
Never played WoW and same for my friends but we're intending to join now. I suppose that's +10 or so to the count. Now I doubt we are the only doing this. How would they have calculated if we'
---
re going to be there for example? 2 PVP servers seem very low.
---
They are also the company who said "you think you do, but you dont" in case your memory failed you.
---
Yeah, I was hoping someone would bring up Ragnarok Online.
---
I played a fair amount with american guilds and I can earnestly tell you that Brazilians (or BRs) effectively closed pserver single handedly.
---
Even small groups of 5-10 were so dedicated they could lock out most other players on the said server from getting valuable loot and progressing. 
---
It was brutal and i wish I was making this up.
---
Not only that but the high levels of toxicity/harassment caused by BRs is real.
---
Before anyone tries to tell me otherwise, in our group we had an ex GM who ran a pserver further validating my points.
---
4 and 5 basically boil down to:
---
"Yeah, we're a bunch of assholes."
---
There's no need to stay up grinding.  Get 6-8 hours of sleep a day.  You will feel really stupid when you reach 60 in a week and then have to wait 2 weeks for other players to catch up so you can raid.
---
Fearing the mob someone stole your tag on... that's Good Shit
---
There’s nothing pro about Ret leveling. There’s no secret ingredient. There’s no skill in applying a deal and auto attacking. 
---
What really matters is weapon upgrades and route.
---
Ahhh can't decide between female Nightelf and male Dwarf for my Hunter (played an Orc Hunter in Vanilla)
---
Imagine only playing half the game
---
43 minutes no response. I feel that doesn't bode well
---
Easier to add servers than delete them.
---
you're actually pretty wrong
---
This needs more exposure
---
What's the benefit of RP-PVP over PVP?
---
Haven't been on this round of stress tests, I'd say 1 hour at most should be the case. Outside of typos, can't imagine why. I would make sure to report the bug on the official forums.
---
ask stupid questions, get stupid answers
---
That´s straight up bullshit. As im from Argentina, ive almost always played in the same servers than BR in a lot on games. And you´re the most toxic community, period. Almost never fucking ever ive had a good experience with you guys.
---
Because there's no risk to travelling the land when you can just fly from point to point. World PvP was limited to around quests givers/objectives.
---
They were ran by the same mod team, but Golemagg was never owned by Shazzrah - I am the current owner of Shazzrah and my entire team will be leaving Golemagg.
---
Ironically, this is exactly the situation I did not want to create. But EU always has Drama.
---
Is that why hunters insta roll need on everything?
---
People tend to gravitate towards established communities. While it's true that it's not guaranteed, if 100+ Brazilians are playing on one server, most new ones will probably create characters there.

I'm out of the loop, what was Defias Brotherhood?
---
What addons website do you use, if you don't mind me asking? Thanks
---
They are not claiming it any more than advertising to the community where they will congregate. It is just so people know where to go to meet other people who will speak their language. Nothing more.
---
Yea there's some really bad ones..
---
To be clear, my stance on this is that Blizzard is just trying to provide the best experience it can in general, and WoW Classic isn't a huge IP for them.
---
Thank you Nostradamus

And the brazillians

Now that one is real. Here you can clearly see how I lost my shit after we got raided by hundreds of bots, the other pic makes it seem like I just casually dropped the N bomb in a normal conversation

Doesn't that just confirm the other one as photoshopped though?

How can I anchor the bars together so that I can move the entire group, rather than moving them individually?

You are wrong. You will always be rezzed at the spirit healer who was the nearest on your position of dead.
---
my guild has found alot of ways to abuse layering during the stresstest. all relatively minor but since the general community decided that its a necessary evil for a smooth launch thats just how it will be sadly.
---
we can just hope that blizzard deactivates it as soon as possible.
---
ever gone bowling with bumpers?  same thing.  some people have lots of fun bowling with bumpers
---
PVE servers tend to progress through content a bit faster due to less time engaged in WPvP.
---
That's about it.
---
Hunters Loot
---
I'm sure we will just be piggybacking on us servers as usual. World PvP is going to be way better.
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/staysafewarlock/status/1159914246026612736
---
I’m pretty sure streamers will go Herod. Although it’s always guessing.
---
Hunters were actually supposed to be the only class that could need roll
---
This is aids. Why the hell are there so few servers. I don't want streamers but I definitely don't want BR.
---
I would imagine people would prefer to play on the servers that have the highest population of people that speak a similar language. Googling video game questions usual has a reddit post as the top results. So it would be safe to assume if the sub made multiple posts declaring a server to be best for a specific language group then it will probably happen.
---
Are you an archaeologist? This is a nearly 20 year old meme.
---
Kargoz needs to see this. He's a horde streamer that loves Hunter but switched to Warlock for classic.
---
thats the joke boss
---
Yes, High pop is always easier to solve than low pop. It's like none of these have played Wow.
---
Instead of spreading out people who speak Portuguese between 6 servers, it makes a ton of sense to try to congregate on one, since the vast majority of the playerbase does not speak Portuguese.  Makes finding a group or guild much easier.
---
You think you do but you don’t.
---
Hunter was the last classes added to the game and they almost didn’t make it in.
---
You dropped the N bomb. End fo the story.
---
At least Japan isn't infamous for its off-duty cops, jail riots, rape, slums and open sewers.
---
&gt; gave us language servers
---
*Cries in east coast NA.*
---
What about PvE? Any PvE server they're targeting?
---
wtf
---
I remember not being able to see through the water in Vanilla, most likely due to my shitty computer, so its the vanilla experience for me either way.
---
Dude have you ever been with a BR player in any game?? We the discriminators??
---
Warlock's worst match up is rogue. There will be lots of locks to gank.
---
Layering can go fuck itself, but, how did you manage to switch back? I need to know for launch incase it happens to me
---
Changing skins does nothin on my end. Tried reinstalling and reloading ui, but it stays glowing green.
---
Could be, or they could be hoping TBC goes live after x years and Warlocks get a wee stronger.
---
Who’s skeleton is that at the base of the tree?
---
That will happen anyway. Like I said most people aren’t reading posts about WoW. They just play the game.
---
I don't know where you work, but in most corporate professional environments having an image like this up on your screen would not be OK. 
---
It's NSFW.
---
There's a lot more to it than that. There is a reason for DevOps because change is simpler on the development side, but the operation side likes consistency. DB mergers can be a huge pain I the ass.
---
Hi there
---
Lmao
---
Gib thicc Brazilian wow gf
---
You're missing out on being camped by no-lifers while you try to level up. That's about it. Maturity on WoW is a good joke though.
---
To clarify: Hunters were supposed only to be able to need roll.
---
Was having the same issue but only in the oceanic realm, NA was fine for me.
---
He was at least twice on classic cast and each is about 2-3 hours. 
---
Furthermore, I don't take everything KJ says as gospel. He was a class/spell designer and might not have been privy to everything going on in that large team. He also seems to enjoy retroactively attributing a lot of the things people enjoyed about that game to conscious, foresightful design decisions and I'm not sure I'm entirely buying it.
---
I'd rather this than too many realms. They can always add, they can't always take away.
---
The only thing about ranking and the doing it with Brazilians, is they are huge douchers, and most likely wouldn't respect the caps, and there will always be that language barrier, so have BRs on your server would be a nightmare if they wanted to rank.
---
You can't just call a character screen black.
---
Cmon man.
---
Ah the Groceries that acted suspiciously around the bot attack. Of course.
---
Well they better offer free character exchanges then. Because I have seen the likely hood of a streamer server and a BR/Latin server on the NA ones. This is creating a bullshit choice for actual NA players. Do you want toxic fucks with language barriers or to play with drones of spammy sheep with streamers. Fucking sucks.
---
How do you have so much hp

SPAM CLASSIC FORUMS FOR A FUCKING SOUTH AMERICA SERVER. BETWEEN BEING FORCED TO PLAY WITH EITHER STREAMERS OR BRAZILIANS ITS LIKE ASKING YOURSELF WHAT WOULD YOU RATHER EAT? SHIT OR DOG SHIT? FFS BLIZZARD THESE 'OFFICIAL' CLASSIC SERVERS ARE GOING TO FEEL MORE LIKE A PRIVATE SERVER HELL HOLE COMMUNITY THAN ACTUAL PRIVATE SERVERS ARE

Ioio

You also miss out on EPIC ~100vs~100 world pvp raiding like we had yesterday.
---
First we are talking about latin america not south amercia so they are not "half the continent", they are 1/3 of the population. Second, what langueage do you think people from mexico, uruguay, argentina, chile, honduras, cuba, etc talk when they communicate, portuguese? Lol, you are delusional.
---
I stayed up for 24, 36 and even 48 hours since I was 16 and out of school (self employed as dev) for a decade like no big thing. Loved it to bits. Now in 30s every time I end up doing it, it feels fucking terrible. I love the idea of it, but the reality nowadays is the opposite. It's a shame, but also probably for the best.
---
It’s not about censorship it’s about calling people out for their shitty behaviour.

Yeah this is bullshit. They need more servers. We should not have to choose between shittier ping, streamers or toxic BR and SP players....

Hi - just added EU PvE (Normal) and RP-PvP as seperate tabs!
---
Hey thanks for the info! However I am struggling with finding the optimal settings for Classic. When I compare the image to the WOTLK client I have installed and playin on pserver, image is almost the same. However with Classic launched and playin fan on graphics goes crazy and sometimes even cause whole system laggy coz of the game. What would be the optimal settings for lowest demand on graphic card while still maintaining almost same picture as WOTLK im used to? Pictures for refference: [https://imgur.com/a/f1y14ux](https://imgur.com/a/f1y14ux) 
---
Is the core problem in game engine between Wotlk and Classic? Thanks!
---
Real good for getting initial distance from a shaman who gets an early frost shock on you when blink is on cooldown.
---
Can win you fights against Hunters since Concussive shot has a lower cooldown than blink - you will have an easier time deadzoning a hunter as gnome.
---
Rogue cheap shots you and gouges your blink. That means hes getting 70% crippling on you and blink is now on cooldown. Gnome can save you from blowing your ice block early, so it can be used on blind. Can help you defeat rogues.
---
Dont really need it vs warriors but it makes the fight even more trivial for a mage.
---
Running flags in WSG and a Lock gets Curse of Ex on you and blink is on cooldown? Gnome can get you the flag cap where you otherwise would have been killed.
---
Vs other Mages you will have an advantage because you can negate their shatters with EA... and you will still have blink for the next shatter. Gives you the edge vs non-gnome mages in a duel.
---
TLDR: it is amazing for Mages and wins you fights vs many classes if you use it right. Great little 1 min cooldown. The intellect racial is just icing on the cake. Being small and harder to target is the cherry on top.
---
I'm going to wait for Twitch Classic addons until way after launch. The Titan bar one caused my client to bug out bad yesterday. I couldn't click anything on my toolbar and could only use hotkeys which sucked since I couldn't remember the hotkey to open the spell book. Once I deleted it it worked again.
---
Also with Twitch you have to toggle to Classic on the top right or else it defaults to current version of WoW to place the addon.
---
HAVE FUN RELOGGING WITH 20K QUEUE ON EU PVP SERVERS
---
Did the guy report this?  If not, well then he has no one to blame but himself if layering goes live like this.
---
Whoops, they somehow slipped out of my excel sheet. They're in, thanks
---
&gt;Ragnaros
---
Not the Brazilian realm. Always dude, it's **always** Ragnaros that gets brought up in regards to this "Brazilian toxicity". No one knows what the fuck they're talking about in these threads.
---
If the engine can handle it, do we need more servers?
---
Thanks, added

i dont give a shit
---
With so few servers all servers will be streamer servers.  It's that nasty bit of hell we have to live with.
---
I can use Jesus Christ in a way that conveys exasperation with bonus points that it’s not blasphemy.
---
Dope! What class and do you have a guild?
---
 Don't you guys want to see a new Drakedog or Laintime? It doesn't make sense at all. 
---
ROFL
---
They took our serveeeers!
---
Yea, that's false.
---
Looks like I struck a cord. Did I hit too close to home? Damn man, sorry, didn’t mean to hurt your feelings. It’s going to be ok. Maybe try having an original thought instead of just repeating what I’m saying and trying to be double edgy lol.
---
Everyone was trying in world pvp, and using consumables. Screw Ret because he was too?
---
https://i.imgur.com/2JWJW58.gif
---
Yeah it's fucking bullshit. They need to get more servers.
---
My only experience with LATAM players is Smite. You’re spot on- they’re almost all bad, toxic, and cocky. 
---
I rarely get in games with them though, I wonder why you were put in matches with them so often?
---
“It’s not flawed guys, only bugged. Blizzard will fix instantly, long time to go before launch”
---
“Don’t worry, they still have a few days to fix the system before launch, don’t complain!”
---
“Classic just launched a few days ago, a few bugs is to be expected but don’t worry blizzard will fix soon”
---
When will you people realize that the issue is the system ITSELF?
---
NOrmally I dont trust blizz but with how adamant theyve been this time around and the specific wording from Ion himself etc.. Im chosing to believe them one last time.
---
Sweet I guess, weird how users had to ask for this feature
---
Easier to fail than succeed, too.  
---
   
---
Historically it's been an epic struggle to move people from where they initially decided to settle. Opening new servers doesn't mean much, the people whose guilds have settled on a server already aren't going anywhere.
---
Thats literally in classic
---
Call me toxic, petty, or w/e, I don't care.
---
If you like the idea of playing on a server with a major streamer, or at least don't care about it, then great! You're gonna have a fine time playing classic and I'm truly happy for you.
---
But not everyone feels the same way about them. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that most people would probably prefer to not have a big streamer on their server. So how do we ensure that our server stays streamer-free? We cant. If you don't like streamers, you're pretty much fucked.
---
Yeah sure, some of them are conscious enough about their impact on server communities and have agreed to roll on the same server. That's very kind of them and i appreciate that, but not everyone will agree to that. Even those who do roll on that server, there's nothing stopping them from migrating to a different server the moment things don't work out for them on the streamer server.
---
So if you've been enjoying the game on a streamer-free server and one of them decides to to move there with their crazy fanbase, what are you supped to do?
---
They're not doing anything against the rules, they have every right to be there, but if they have big enough fanbase, it will absolutly impact the server community in a negative way.
---
So yeah, fuck me and everyone else for not liking streamers I guess.
---
My solution might be childish, but that's all I can think off. If you have a better, more civil way to solve this issue, please let me know. Because honestly, I do not want to waste my time streamsniping and ganking these people, but if that's what I have to do to keep the server from going to shit, than that's what I'll do and I will try to rally everyone else to do the same.
---
I sorry for not enjoying streamers and their fans...
---
I mean, during the stress test it took them 1 hour to add 2 more realms. But then again, your name might be taken if you swap.
---
What a beautiful dwarf, he must get all the ladies
---
They have their own servers yet for some reason decide to play on ours and ruin it for everyone they are with.   I don’t know why.
---
It's a difference of mentality.  More kids on PvP.  But worse are the awful and sensitive kids on PvE.  Toxicity on both but just different brands of insanity.  I prefer a more dynamic game and PvP allows for that.
---
lol it happens many times in EU servers, lots of countries on NA realms speak different languages, are you that dense?
---
this shouldnt even be a fucking 'choice'. think of wtf you just said. our ONLY choice is to choose between shit or different colored shit. how does this make sense? and why does the community accept it. ridiculous
---
Where is the source for the Latin American thing? Missed that one
---
ITT: Gamers racist towards Brazilian gamers.
---
....and based on my own experiences, honestly I can't find a fault here. Sue me, I guess.
---
and when layering still isn't fixed on release people will move to the excuse that the game was only JUST released, give them time to fix it guys!
---
Brasil took thalnos, latin america maybe goes faerlina
---
the dmg from the seal scales up with your level, but only for the next few levels, once you reach the level for the next rank, the previous ranks stop scaling
---
where did you find that?
---
What are those fast compared to? Do you have a speedrun chart for every class?
---
Ret paladins are above average. Little to no downtime for food/mana required, with an on-demand stun and lots of utility. It is definitely faster than holy or prot, so I don't see why it would be ranked at poo level like those two.
---
It seems like the blizzard culture is egotistical and unable to admit wrongdoing. Even the concept of classic is an admission that the current game hasn’t taken the right direction. So low and behold, rather than aiming to profit off of something good it seems they’re setting it up for failure for nothing more than pride. (Through the lack of promotion, advertising, servers)
---
Nah man it's easy to roll human than get to dwarf lands. Will take maybe 5 minutes out of your game to get to dun morogh
---
No, just make sure you pick a female with black hair, and name yourself Snowwhite
---
Have you actually played WoW before ? There were multiple realms with the majority of the population being Italian/Polish/Brazilia/Hungarian/etc.
---
it wouldn't take much time to go to SW then catch the tram then go to their starting area.  Maybe 5-10 minutes?
---
You can meetup with them at level 5 easy
---
&gt;66% of roles.
---
Pffft. Watch me be the best Warrior healer in the game. Gonna do WAY more HPS with my bandages than your silly Holy power.
---
Rejuvenation? Nah, I'mma hit you with that Heavy Runecloth. Never catch me going OOM
---
blizzard should just force transfers if the need arises tbh, but only serverwide transfers not indiviual players
---
don't you guys have a translator in your phones? :-D
---
Have you ever played in EU servers my friend? Russians, Spanish, French, Germans and English all together! Sounds like fun :)
---
Because you actually have to fight back? How dumb is it that someone attacks you, you just fly higher and soar off? Plus, it puts players at a disadvantage who didn't grind out flying. They have no choice but to be ganked. But some nerd who played throughout the entire xpac has flying and can just soar away.
---
NA servers: We're all ruined due to streamers lol.
---
I'm basically stuck with 3 choices: Toxic streamer community, toxic BR community, or toxic raiding schedule (if I decide to go PT server)
---
Then theyre even nicer because you band together out of desperation to survive and make friends saving people from dirty allaince
---
feels good to be an australian
---
There will be plenty of east coast players on the server. You will have no problem finding a guild to raid with or people to do dungeons with.
---
Holland is the Netherlands
---
Couldnt the same be applied to 40 mounts vs 60 mounts?
---
\*feels guilty in warlock\*
---
Need more servers.
---
Players don't need to put in 30 hours a week to meaningfully progress. Hell, you can get away with playing 2 to 3 hours a day and come out satisfied in Classic because leveling is a big part of the experience.
---
Yea, I'm sure Internet armhair gaming network admins have a much better grasp on what's going to happen than the guys who have been running it for 15+ years.
---
You just want more *names* to appear in the realmlist, which is fine, I completely understand. But don't pretend you have any idea what's going on at infrastructure.
---
It doesn’t matter if they’re literal Angels - if I can’t communicate with them nor they with me then it’s a problem. How do you coordinate CC or loot through a language barrier?
---
&gt;Could always just merge servers. 
---
No, they really can’t. If they haven’t merged servers after 15 years of retail, then they definitely won’t for this pet project of theirs. Besides, there’s a lot of questions that have no good answers. 
---
1) Which server keeps the name? Can you imagine telling the Grob Mob they’re gonna the Faerlina Friends now? *Fuck that.*
---
2) I’m named Thex, and you’re named Thex. Who stays Thex?
---
3) Can a server have more than one guild with the same name? Same question as above, but now it will displace potentially hundreds of people. 
---
Of course they could choose the worst option that they chose to do on retail of that quasi-merge and fuck over ***everyone’s*** name. I’d rather they have layering than that.
---
I kind of remember there being a bitchin macro for this, weaving abilities between auto shots. Could of been on BC but it's been soo long I can't quite remember lmao
---
Thanks a lot. I thought in combat mana regen was a lot less than out of combat. Even when not casting.
---
I've watched Prot Pallies tank dungeons and they can be really good.
---
Also AoE Prot Pally tank and Affliction lock is THE BEST Duo leveling comp. At lvl 20 with consecration they delete groups of mobs. Its like the warlock can't run out of spells to cast. they can stop mobs from running the pally can bring aggro off the lock. They have wipe prevention abilities. Lock can Soul Stone the Pally and Pally can cast DI on lock and rez himself. The both get free mount.
---
The synergy between them is amazing.
---
You're clearly just biased against warlocks. Actually try to form a good argument next time.
---
What is "Chad" ?
---
I mean, I don't like the guy but this post sounds pathetic. How to get someone banned because you don't like him and he makes fun of your favorite streamers? If he does something ban worthy it should take care of itself. Honestly, it sounds as if you are obsessed with this fellow. By checking out his stream and posting something like this you are only fueling his notoriety. Ignore it and move on.
---
Just go to one of your 'good guy' servers if you don't want to deal with someone you don't like, its truly that simple.
---
As for money, I will never understand how anyone would want to donate huge amounts of money to any streamer, but its their money so they can burn it however they wish.
---
It's impossible though man. If there's only 2 EU pvp realms and they don't launch more realms layering is going to be a permanent feature. Same thing with NA, since Spanish speakers will take over 1 realm. The entire thing is a giant clusterfuck and the irony of private servers being more blizzlike than classic just goes to show this has truly gone full circle
---
&gt; What would you honestly do if you were in their shoes?
---
What would I do if I made money by playing games all day?
---
geez, you're right, that does sound horrible, better go donate $20 to them for their service...
---
I agree, this does not seem possible.
---
Id say almost everyone can manage to comunicate in english
---
Because the mobs hit for less dmg than on pservers I could Level my warrior to 8 so far chain pulling. I didnt eat food a Single Time.
---
Im pretty sure this is false
---
Yeah, it's not.
---
I remember some point in vanilla between accounts was minimized to maybe 10 minutes, don't remember instant until BC/Wrath myself.
---
Solution= Play on a private server after Classic ends up being a total disappointment
---
It's not even a meme. Peruvians actively ruin USE in dota 2.
---
ew that dwarf
---
But, I'm already THEX THE TROLL SHAMAN!
---
My guild will 100 percent leave a server if another choice opens up with out streamers and BR/LA folks.
---
You can white knight all you want but I’ve actually been to Brazil, and the nice Brazilians I met were the first to admit that the young men in their country are generally shitty towards foreigners and other Brazilians alike. Since gamers are predominantly younger males, it makes sense that behavior magnifies itself in their online gaming communities. 
---
There are rude and shitty gamers from all over, but certain areas are certainly better known for it than others, and they’re often an amplified reflection of their non gaming culture.
---
A massive part of the game for me was the community feeling you had on medium/low pop servers. You had a few top guilds that seemed "unaccessible" in terms of talking to the members but usually most people would have one or two friends who either were in those guilds or knew someone who knew someone.
---
You'd have the same old faces that you saw around town, and to an extent everyone (who wanted to be part of the community) knew everyone. You'd have friendly discussions with people your faction about how their guild was doing, and you'd gank the shit out of allies out in the world, before having friendly discussions with them on the realm forums.
---
Of course there's a fine line between community feeling, and the server being underpopulated, but to me the social aspect of the entire realm kind of being like your small town neighborhood, and the other faction was the kids from the next town over was probably the most important aspect in terms of keeping me playing. 
---
I've been on many big servers after and it simply doesn't happen there, your social sphere seems to end at your guild and a few random people you meet in dungeons etc. 
---
This is all without mentioning the technical side of having so many people on one server.

Nothing is, and nothing will. Streaming is a business that thrives off of attention and interaction with other streamers. Most streamers will consolidate to one server to get more viewers from other streamers via interactions in wpvp, tourneys, etc
---
I mean if retail is any indication....no
---
I had a stroke reading this comment.

A community of 800 is far less intrusive than the collective communities of all the other streamers. I wouldn't worry about it.

We're there actually people asking for LFG and LFR and such? If so: Jesus are they in for a surprise when they find out you have to rep for most epic gear, lol.

They better add more servers because with the current amount there is no way you're putting that many people on them.
---
The 7 stages of grief, in reverse.
---
Exactly this, well said. I'm surprised more people are not picking up on this. It's obvious that blizzard knows how big Classic is, the company isn't stupid. Classic is perfect advertising for their next expansion like you said, and with the que times, why not play some BFA?   :\^)

---
What if the other faction doesn't flag?
---
They really need to convert a us pve server to pvp. I literally haven't heard of a single person looking to play on over and everyone wants pvp
---
Sorry but the Grob Mob has spoken. RP is dead, long live RP-PVP.
---
Honestly, unless they make drastic changes (like adding more realms for example A LOT more) your best bet is going to be a private server for the authentic vanilla experience. I would rather play with overtuned mobs and what not than have to deal with fucking a massive realm pop with layering. That shit is pure cancer and the total opposite of what vanilla is.
---
It'll be the dutch server
---
Thats just the pve community, very few spaniards will actually play pve.
---
I am going to give blizzard the benefit of the doubt and propose that the number of servers they chose is metric driven... I don’t think they just picked a number out of a hat and went with it. I am sure it is based on metrics from google (YouTube) searches, activity on there websites, number of players logged during stress tests.... this is 2019, if you aren’t doing this type of analysis for large business decisions you are doing it wrong, so I believe these numbers are generated from something like that! We will just need to wait and see how the roll out goes!
---
You purists will destroy the community more than anything.
---
Champagne tanking advice
---
&gt; First we were promised just two weeks of sharding.
---
At best, this is a misunderstanding of what Ion actually said at Blizzcon. At worst, it is a blatant lie. Ion only had one hard limit and that's Kazzak spawning. He deliberately avoided narrowing it down further by using vague words like "a few weeks", "time-limited", "initial" and "in the long run". Blizzard did not promise you "two weeks".
---
Here is the full quote:
---
&gt; "We understand and I understand completely that sharding is anti-thetical to the concept of a cohesive classic community where you are competing over limited resources. When Lord Kazzak is up and guilds are racing to defeat him, there needs to only be one Lord Kazzak. If you are trying get, you know, if you're trying to lock down the thorium veins that spawn in limited sections of the world, you should be competing over limited resources. That said, the first few weeks, when everybody is packed into Valley of Trials and everybody is packed into Elwynn, we think we can use sharding there in a limited, time-limited way to solve the initial launch-day-load problems, while making sure that in the long run as server communities solidify, there's a healthy population and a single world for everyone to live in." - Ion Hazzikostas at Blizzcon.
---
You're allowed to dislike and criticize other cultures, that doesn't make you racist.
---
Take the tram...
---
No it doesn’t at all. They will open a couple more servers if the pop is insanely high after phase 1. With free xfers
---
Im confused by the curse/twitch thing. all of them see mto only work for retail ?
---
Classic isn't a brand new game.  A sizable percentage of the playerbase knows what they're getting into and has already proven that they love the game before it even releases.  I don't think even Vanilla had a 90% attrition rate, and that was with random people trying it out.
---
Classic is going to have abnormally high player retention.
---
if you're you're a God, if not I'll still use it because I prefer pfquest icons! thanks brother
---
Streamers are leaning towards herod as far as I can tell.
---
Is this working for you? Unfortunately not for me...
---
Yes. Layering is going to be removed by phase 2. So unless they add new servers expect hours and hours of queues.
---
They are 100% going to need to add extra servers. So why not do that from the start?
---
If a waist size that’s biologically impossibly small is “thicc”, I don’t want to know what your definition of average is

I'll probably make a post on here. I have a version that works with curseforge fully now... Problem is I don't have a gui it's all through the command line which I don't think people want to use. Working on a ui atm.
---
She really craves a big tiddy gf /s
---
Does anyone have proof of this?
---
I think it’s good they started with few servers. I’d love to see packed servers with tons of players, gives it that true MMO experience. If worse comes to worse they can always add servers. I wouldn’t mind waiting in a queue if need be.
---
what's your average ping to NA?
---
If EU gets language specific servers, youd think an entire continent plus Mexico should get one.
---
Interesting, I'll look into Taiwan
---
Dude English speakers will easily outnumber spanish speakers. Why don’t they go to thalnos too anyways? If we all just go to that server anyways there’s nothing they can do about it.
---
I haven’t had to enable auto loot or instant quest text.
---
Action bars though.
---
And if you look out the window to your left, you'll find a classic example of belittling those who don't hold the same opinions!
---
high chance of streamers i think.
---
RP always ends up dying on RPvP servers. They are two incompatible playstyles. I look forward to living in peace on BB.
---
omg
---
Layering as a concept is just fucking bad game design and it's been obvious since its implementation on retail. You are just new.
---
troll
---
Because using raw population numbers is silly. Use warcraftrealms to track actual player counts for the last decade.
---
That's fair I think. I mean, I used to play on Illidan back in the day, so it's not like I'm not used to my classic experience being a cluster. And I would rather have enemy capital raids and a bunch of pvp madness and some queues than a dead realm after a month.
---
I think the most amusing thing that I see about wanting to avoid streamers is that they'll dirty up the chat with their followers paying f and whatnot. As if general chat has EVER not been a mess. Are twitch chat memes really that worse than anal [rupture]? Not really.
---
A bunch friends from work and I will likely be going Pagle. Maybe Mankrik
---
Any preview on what the Horde population might end up like on this server?
---
Exactly! 
---
The point of MASSIVE multiplayer is the masses.
---
It emobides the beauty of classic that is the community, and that every little bit made a difference &lt;3
---
If the streamers intend to use their existing character names, it's going to be pretty simple to establish which server they're on once the name reservations go live.
---
You don't need to taunt and your mana bar refills 3 times as fast as your healers.  On nost I had healers say they preferred me to warriors.
---
Peruvians single handily ruined dota for Americans. One of the reasons why I quit the game. And most of the time it just comes down to language barrier. I can't even imagine how bad it's going to be for Euros with only 2 pvp eng realms.
---
I haven't experienced this at all in private servers or my brief time in the beta. Pretty much everyone playing seems to be loving/embracing classic.
---
Lvl to 6 then run over to them
---
Well said, Sir!
---
Surprising to hear this in 2019. Glad I did though.
---
With layering they can add essentially as many servers as they want under one name. If the game dies off they don't want to end up with dead servers like retail had. It's looks better for them when the game needs more servers not mergers because the launch hype died off.
---
She have big tiddy bf tho
---
I just don't want organized RP events to get 'griefed' by the opposite faction. It's cool in theory that the other faction exists in a more realistically dangerous state out in the world, but if I'm sitting down to RP, I both don't want to suddenly change gears and start WPvPing, nor contend with non-canonical character deaths during events.
---
Google Killerduki, successfully raid tanked several bosses as a Pally on private servers.
---
Still not as bad as the people RPing that it’s 2004 telling Chuck Norris jokes
---
They will probably closer to phase 2. It is a lot easier and lower risk to add more servers down the line and offer free transfers from high pop than to have to merge many low pop servers.
---
Layering kind of temporarily solves the issue of being over crowded until they can collect some numbers
---
They might need to reconsider their choice because they might have to deal with russians.
---
How is it prejudice if he is making that statement after interacting with them. Its the opposite of pre judice, it’s post judice.
---
Vegemite.. get some Marmite up ya
---
You called him a truther which isn't exactly asking for an explanation.
---
we didn't have to, blizzard intentionally decided it to be this way to favor streamers.

So basically both EU and NA are both fucked. Forced to either play with Peruvians or streamers while getting layered. This ain't it chief. I truly wonder if this is clever marketing to cause outrage to get more servers= more hype. Or they are intentionally screwing over Classic for more advertising for BFA and their next expansion.
---
I honestly don’t remember with wow vanilla. I met tons of people in EQ that way though.
---
I played a resto druid from launch on K3 and rolled a shaman alt about halfway through the server's lifespan, so I have raid experience on both. I feel that healing as a druid in raid is infinitely more interesting than healing as a shaman, because you actually get to use your full range of spells. As a shaman I would typically drop totems then spam chainheal (or max rank HW once I had 8/8 T1). Sometimes I'd need to totem twist which definitely kept me occupied, but I wouldn't say it was fun.
---
I never had any issues topping meters as a druid. For the majority of raids the top three positions on the healing meters would be held by one of each healing class. You'll find that some classes excel at healing some encounters while other classes excel at others. Like Vael, for example. No class can challenge a properly specced resto druid on Vael and if you took that fight in isolation, you'd think that resto druids were far better than the other healing classes, but that's obviously not the case. Overall I'd say that all the healing classes are remarkably balanced in vanilla, but I would add that druids require a little more strategy. If you don't know what you're going to be doing in a fight ahead of time, you may find yourself lagging behind the other classes on the meters. However once you've built up a good amount of hands-on knowledge, you should have as good a shot as anyone at reaching the top of the meters.
---
As for 5 mans, I'd recommend just running with your guild. I had the luxury of respeccing between raids on K3 so I'd tank 5s most of the time, but my guildies wouldn't have minded if I chose to run them as resto. The 'no rez' thing isn't as much of an issue as 'no windfury'. Horde is dominated by melee who cry if they don't get windfury. So maybe you could adopt a young enhancement shaman with stars in his eyes and ride his windfury/rez to geartown.
---
Locks are key!
---
It's wrath right? Looks like wrath to me
---
aka BG spam
---
Yes and no, imo.
---
First, every major game launch see a huge surge of players.  Classic will be no exception.  Since we have no idea how many "tourists" there will be, I won't talk about them much, but they will be a good chunk of players that stop playing after the first couple of months.  After a couple of weeks, the amount of people concurrently playing (IE: at the same time) will have dropped, due to everyone that took time off having gone back to work, and resumed their normal lives.
---
Again, this is only CONCURRENT players.  The total active amount may still be much higher, but to think that 100's of thousands of players will be active at the same time on any given realm after the first week or so is asinine.
---
No it’s not. Most younger people in my country speak english. We’re taught english from a young age in school. It’s the world’s most popular language and not a particularly difficult one to learn.
---
Argent Dawn is better tho &gt;:)
---
I’ll take your word for it
---
Remember when Sewer beast used to be HUGE?
---
SUUUUURE it wont.

You can move it with the default ui. Just right click and unlock frame, then you can drag it wherever you want. You can do this with your target frame too.
---
There's 5 PvP servers in NA...
---
Jajajaja
---
That’s exactly why RPvP doesn’t work. Nobody who is serious about RP would play on a PvP server due to the restriction of RPing in-world, which severely limits the types of stories you can tell with the constant threat of PvP.

dont listen to him its until monday

I don't feel like the one time usage of a racist word in europe disqualifies you from being an Admin of a fan made discord channel.

I swear, "are we keeping our character progress in the stress test?" Gets asked in general chat like every 5 min.

Oh boy, we are going to see a lot more of that place - and that zone - with heaps of people doing Ony attunement.

LF2M BRD IRONFOE RESERVED
---
yes, but it ends up beeing the classleaders decision if he/they will accept that specc or not.
---
But way better.
---
Yet you insta downvote my responses while providing no evidence to support your claims. Meanwhile Jagex themselves discussed this when they released OSRS bonds and MTX is their profit center. You are clueless.
---
Tyvm for this it's now my live wallpaper ❤️
---
Lol common sense. Why didn't Blizzard add German or French servers until public outcry on their forums? Isn't it common sense to have language specific EU realms? What about the public outcry on layering and how exploitable it is?
---
What about having only 2 EU PVP realms? Where's the common sense in that?
---
I was planning on playing what my friends and girlfriend wanted but fuck em. I'm the only one who really wants to play WoW so why even bother pleasing them for the first month and then they'll probably quit.
---
It's a shame I really want to have LAN parties and discussions with my friends but it probably won't happen. If it does I hope they soften up to the alliance
---
Why are they called the Warglaives of Azeroth if Illidan is in Draenor?!
---
Is Metroid's gun attached to his suit or his arm?
---
Inevitable "it's Samus and she's a girl."
---
No...Samus is the princess that Zelda has to save from Gamondorf.
---
Curious about this as well as I will be rolling a priest. Wont it be viable for everyone?
---
Dude. Stop acting like this is how the game is designed and intended to work. 
---
Stop acting like it’s an everyday occurrence where you invite someone to your party and they don’t show up next to you. 
---
But hey you quit the game over this. So you must have multiple clips showing this right?
---
Homogeneity of language. Yo hablo Los dos asi que me da lo mismo
---
Remember the part earlier when I said enjoying the challenge of camping? Enjoy getting camped there by raids if you want.

Seems like basically all the EST Alliance PvEers are going pagle. Survey shows mankrik will be mostly horde.
---
I know it looks like a good thing to you right? Oh no he is with a group of scary other people. what ever shall he do! Oh thank god Blizz made them disappear. I almost had to talk to someone!
---
It's 7 Proc Per Minute, so it's overall pretty consistent.
---
I've always found it hilarious how people are so desperate to have some form of power or control over people, they rush in desperation to create "the first" Discord server for people to join. This guy sounds like a fucking virgin.
---
Wait... do we know that thalnos has been decided on as the unofficial BR server?
---
I think layering might make more sense as instancing like EVE does. Each zone has its own server, and having too many people on one server causes time dilation.
---
Probably too late to change, though.
---
Viable =/= optimal
---
EVERYTHING is viable.  Melee firestone warlocks are viable.  But that does not mean they will be better then the tried and true "meta" specs.
---
It's so weird that in your mind, this changes everything. That's more telling than anything else so far.
---
* I have a reddit account
---
* I have subscribed to this sub
---
* I don't know if I will continue past l40, reach 60, stop playing after 3 months.
---
If I'm on the fence, then there are most likely others who are on the fence who also share the above points. Private servers are free, Classic is not. People played on private servers long before TBC released. People also quit the game back in vanilla. You can't speak for the entire sub based on personal bias or attacking people who don't share your point of view.
---
&gt; And what playerbase they have is substantially smaller then that of OSRS.
---
If all that mattered was # of players, all the cookie-cutter MMOs that PerfectWorld shits out wouldn't be profitable. But they are massively successful because you only need a couple dozen whales to make your game much more profitable than one where the "average" player goes.
---
What happens if you break character, are you shun by the community and excommunicated by your guild?
---
Thanks for looking into it! Ya that’s what I did so far
---
If anyone from Brazil tries to talk crap, just bring up 7-1. A lot of them still act like that game happened yesterday.
---
I used to know three or four different ways to break into the Crypt, because they kept patching them over the years. 
---
Noggenfogger to height clip and then blind jump through the void at the entrance was fun, but my favorite was getting out of bounds in the overworld version of ZG by mammoth clipping into a pyramid, and flying through a gap in the ground, hugging the ceiling all the way to the Crypt.
---
Arugal good size, not bhed.
---
Ok. Now you’re double commenting? That’s a yikes from me. You’re taking this way too seriously.
---
I'm not going to defend your point for you. Had enough of the lazy retail plebs
---
It all depends on your guild/who your roleplaying with if they are strict on what should be inchar or not
---
Hours and hours of queues just like the good ol days. #Nochanges
---
Ok :)
---
I have some bad news about Windfury then.
---
There are plenty of out-of-character moments, areas, situations etc. where people are out-of-character.
---
You are free to whisper other people asking if they'd like to team up for a quest or dungeon. Usually on RP realms specific areas develop as "RP hubs", like Stormwind's Cathedral District is almost always the main central hub for RP, and the Trade District is usually an OOC zone.
---
I'd say avoid being OOC in /s when around other people unless you're sure it's not a RP area, and you'll be perfectly fine!
---
Joking, I love Spanish speakers ♥ I was just referencing a Trump quote.
---
Brazil was mainly talking about going Thalnos. Spanish speaking players were talking about going Faerlina.
---
They're going to RIP two PvP servers on us.
---
I've already explained how that won't be the case: https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/coe7ue/they_promised_to_remove_layering/ewhqj5m/
---
not even close 200 spirit makes that bonus 10 spirit, 10 spirit regeneration reduced to 30% of its normal rate so equal to 3 spirit at 100% regen rate. Do I have to keep going?
---
I know it sounds logical but it would probably take hours to equal the int bonus.
---
Doubt that.
---
You truly are the lowest common denominator.
---
The amount of times I had to read "DO WE GET TO KEEP THESE CHARACTERS FOR LAUNCH? NO? WHAT'S THE POINT?" was staggering...
---
Zandalar Tribe! Plenty of people from AD seem to be going there.
---
I am actually incredibly happy about this clip.
---
See, this is the only clip circulating about layering issues during the stress test.  Out of how many 10's of thousands of players, this was the only one that had a layering issue?  I'd take those odds ANY day.
---
Sure, bugs exist in any system.  To me that shows that things are going well.
---
I mean considering you took the time to type that out you could have googled it with fewer words than what you typed. But sure dont help and just be a dick on the internet that's way better.
---
And just about every non-foreign born person in the US speaks English and only English.  And again nobody is going to "just learn English" to play WoW, even if you do think it's fairly easy.

Dude posted it earlier.
---
Spainards  will be playing on eu servers I guess.now Latin American players won't be on thlalnos they want to avoid BRs
---
I think such things could work with open betas. But honnestly the paywall for testing make predictions verry blury , dont you think ?
---
I love playing with rag players it's fun to lag
---
Only the free aspect of private servers doesn't add up to the negatives: having to figure out how, the uncertainty of their quality and longevity.
---
My first character will absolutely be a Warlock, just for the free mounts. 
---
Then after I have my first level 60 with the Warlock, money won't be an issue for mounts on subsequent characters.
---

---
For me it's a draw between Dun Morogh and Mulgore, such beautiful zones
---
The good players stick to their own groups.  Definitely some good players and guilds from BR, but the random teenagers playing are pretty bad.  I think it has to do with the later availability of tech, so you get gaming etiquette that is like 15-20 years outdated but that can affect a larger group of people.  If most people were to join a BRA guild' heroic progression run it is similar to any regular raiding guild on US/EU.
---
How is it anywhere near impactful?  
---
Most Discord users don't play WoW. And even the experience of those who do is not going to be impacted by reading a different string of text below a username.
---
No
---
You realize that server merges are the WORST thing that can happen, right?  Not just for names, but for EVERYONE on each server involved.
---
I was surprised i never saw any outcry over language server lacking on NA. Maybe i just missed it. Prob 2 late now, my sympathies lol.
---
I’ve played on some pservers for practice and the multiple languages, usually, are fun. Except when they type something and it shows up blank because I don’t have the font.

I took the time to explain the reality of the situation to him.  What I've told him is why no one bothered to even reply to his post except me and you.
---
Give a man a fish vs teach a man to fish.

no that's wrong, removing layers while realms are still overpopulated is much worse than merging.

Man I swear my mind changes every couple of days from priest, lock, druid, hunter and mage.

I’ll probably roll healer because I’m playing classic for the social fun this time.

No out of combat Rez is bugging me way to much as a druid, I wish I could get past my search for a perfect class lol.

---
I'm not expert on "mainstream global games" in general, but LoL certainly qualifies as one and EU servers contain MUCH more players than NA servers there.
---
In fact, this is first time I see somebody claiming NA has bigger playerbase. Usually its the opposite way. I also heard that Americans still love their consoles and PC titles are not very popular.

---
A priest might have more spirit than me, but it doesn't mean that they're going to put the additional mana to better use than I would. It's really hard to talk about this stuff theoretically, because you really need to know a bunch of things about a player before you go ahead an innervate them. I've known priests in BiS gear who output half the healing of priests with half their gear.
---
Innervate is nice, but it's not as if it's the only way to gain mana in a fight. If a player isn't popping mana pots/runes on cooldown then I don't feel that they should be entitled to an innervate, because they're already phoning it in. It's also not possible to say that priests will have more spirit than druids. I haven't done the math myself on the amount of spirit on druid tier gear versus priest tier gear, but I can't imagine it's that big of a difference. If I go out and get the 25 spirit grog from DM Trib and the 50 stam/spirit zanza from ZG island, I probably already have more spirit on my gear than an equally geared priest who didn't bother to go and get those consumables. There's just too many variable to work it out ahead of time.
---
what on earth would give you that idea? No you'd just keep spawning on the same one until you make enough progress to get to the next one. This isn't some fps where you get 2 spawn choose ;P
---
hosting companies? you have no idea what you’re talking about.
---
 "The people who get MC gear first are going to have a ball in PvP, before everyone catches up."
---
That is why I think Phase 1 should last a long time. So other players have time to catch up before phase 2.
---
that misery of having healthcare and good education for everyone and not just the rich? that sounds more like retail to me.
---
How so?  Layering only affects one server.  Merging affects 2 or more.
---
Are you trying to argue that disrupting 2 or more entire server populations with a merger is worse than having an over-populated server on phase 2?
---
It's not. I'm brazilian and will be avoiding "them" as well. Can't stand the toxicity and people who don't even try to communicate in english.
---
I think most of them are joking haha, at least I was :)
---
cuz only a dick would try to make a rshaman twist totem.

Im doing the reverse, played ally for years and now rolling horde. Horde might be good at world pvp but in battlegrounds its rough going.
---
Ragnaros is a spanish speaking server. Not BR

Where are these surveys you speak of?
---
BR is not Latin America (Spanish)
---
They very heavily lean horde since original release, on Pservers and live.  Almost all play troll or undead as well for some reason.

It's the opposite. The majority of young males act online in the same manner they wish they could act in real life. Just like the huge "chan" or "incel" cultures in the US.

Are you really interested in a discussion, though, when the first, second and third post is you calling the other parts names?
---
Right here, homie
---
That's assuming they move forward with opening additional servers right off the bat the second they realise what they've got is not enough. And they ought to already know that unless they expect 1&amp;2 to only retain a mindfuckingly low amount of people.
---
It's real shazz
---
This. They can choose to be on Faerlina as well, but if that's the server we want, we just take it.
---
Although there are some talents that work similarly.
---
Early levels it’ll be slower but not awful. Once you get to 40 you’ll severely be gimping yourself though. Giving up Bloodthirst or Mortal Strike is back breaking.
---
Also, do you remember what level your character was when you went up past 75?
---
I mean, this wouldn’t be a problem if streamers weren’t so irritating.
---
Depends.
---
If you are planning on healing dungeons or what not, start downranking asap.  Having a big and a small heal at your disposal will make your mana last a lot longer.  It will also get you into the habit of knowing when to downrank and when to cast a bigger heal.
---
Can anyone give a quick rundown of which servers are affected by stuff like this?
---
You can tank leveling dungeons perfectly fine with a dps spec so no point of leveling as protection
---
Yes, and you don't gain enough survivability to make up for lost damage.
---
You will be able to tank dungeons just fine as arms/fury
---
Don't level as prot unless you hate yourself

This may be a stupid question but I've never downloaded from github before. Do I need an account or something to properly download this? I downloaded the ZIP and extracted to my classic addon folder but the addon doesnt show up. The current folder in my AddOns folder is "LunaUnitFrames-master". Am I missing some step to get this to work?

I dunno, I feel like some of them are serious lol. You never know with this community. I'm just happy we have classic, I'm really not worried about what people on discord think about what kind of games I play :P
---
The day is going, grob slobs
---
To be clear, I am really grateful that someone made the call to bring back Classic WoW. It's not exactly up to every individual's expectations, but I think they did an amazing job keeping the core game intact. I was watching The Cable Guy and this scene just really reminded me of the ongoing discussions re: inclusions/exclusions from WoW Classic.
---
a merger only happens when a realm is dead.  it hardly affects anyone, both for the dead realm and the realm it gets merged to.
---
when you remove layers and they're still overpopulated you get a super queue.  that affects thousands of players, more than any merge has ever affected anyone.  now maybe you have to offer them free transfers to other servers.  if there's a low-pop realm and they allow transfers to it, that affects everyone there.  if they open new realms  and allow transfers to them you're still shaking up the community of the overpopulated realm, and there's no guarantee the realm will stop being overpopulated or that the new realms won't be dead.

aka: You didn't think of it.
---
A few talents allowed a certain percentage of mana regen to continue while casting, such as the priest Meditation talent from the Discipline tree, but without such talent you definitely have to stop casting to regain any amount of mana. I can confirm that it is still the case on the stress test realms. And according this [this article](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Five_second_rule), the 5 second rule was only removed in patch 4.0.1.

Thank you. Looks really good.
---
"haha I'll make my character bald it looks funny"
---
Whenever I'm high level I would probably like to change it because it looks stupid
---
Two pvp realms are really not enough... not even close.
---
And and top of that the economy will go the SHIT with that amount of players, just imagine how flooded the ah will get... Please Blizzard give us some more pvp servers.
---
Tbh Phasing is pretty garbage and its the reason why servers like ED and Argent Dawn dont do big world pvp events anymore which caused many to quit back in legion until blizz slowly realized phasing on crZ on RP realms ruins the game. By then the game was already too fucked. Same with normal realm. So yes. Phasing and Crz has caused people to quit. 
---
So you can stop undermining it by  “reaaallyy xD you quit cuz of thaaat xD” like it wasnt the biggest reasons for ruining the community aspect of the game.
---
Yes, you need to delete the "-master" part and make sure the "LunaUnitFrames" folder immediately contains "LunaUnitFrames.toc" and all the other files and not just another folder in-between.
---
Not in America my man

People really dont wanna play with garbage

I'd rather less account hacking problems for the community
---
Thank you for this! Now I can feel somewhat more content about my friends' decision to go alliance!
---
Trailer Park Boys
---
&gt; And if that's the case then why not open one or two more now? 
---
Because too many servers is a risk with consequences. Using the ~2 months of phase 1 to get the server count perfect has no risks or consequences.
---
I didnt even try, I made a troll and didnt even pick up the first quest. Went hidden path&gt;rather to dr to CT to TB and hear the back, turning in the first quest before the board dinged me to 2. Had an easier time from there

It's how I farmed in Vanilla on my Warrior. It's how I'll play again this time round. A few downvotes means nothing when it's common sense so much so that Skarm, Swifty and pretty much most Warrior leveling guides all recommend it or have it listed in a tips section.
---
Enjoy Classic!
---
Please find a purpose in life other than complaining about classic wow
---
Can sor also proc them?
---
I like all the people thinking that layering would be fine. And that it wasn't going to be like phasing or sharding. On a technical level they are different, but on a practical level they're all terrible game design choices for an MMO.
---
And *now* they're realizing the reality of it.
---
Killing Afkers is never really fun.

There is no getting through to the living breathing human fleshlites that are the blind Blizzard fanboys. They ruin every game they play because they can't possibly imagine a world where they tell Blizzard, "No."
---
Widespread discord use will accelerate the forming of cliques and drama, I worry for its effect on fledgling guilds and public chat channels in classic. Joining guilds in the live game where nobody ever talks in guild chat and it's always the usual suspects sitting in discord channels is extremely sad. Much like social media, making external (voice) chat "free" and ubiquitous made people a lot less social, in my experience.
---
What do we know about streamers and pro-guilds? Where are they going to land?

I like to rematch Star Trek TNG, DS9 and Voyager. Lots of conversations that you don’t have to watch mixed with action here and there.
---
Are Austin streamers rolling east or west coast?
---
Moonkin, Shaman (enhance, bc of TTwist macro), both only spam 1 button for raids.
---
Spriest, for the most part is just mindflay and only mindblast if mana permits (which is rare because of mana hog). SW:P rarely gets used bc of debuff slot.
---
No, what I'm saying is that Blizzard have more information than us. They still can make mistakes, but our estimates are less informed then their. You're vastly overreacting
---
Killing Roleplayers in Elwynn Forest is gonna be hilarious
---
Rp servers are the same as pvp in the sense that, you don’t have to pvp but you’re going to run into it a lot, you’ll also have more fun if you take part. Same with role play.
---
Technically they can do whatever the fuck they want with their game, and you can do nothing about it.

I have tailoring at my orc at around 80 something right now. I just went to the expert tailoring trainer in org and learned journeyman tailoring no problem whatsoever.

Wow people are saying BR are toxic but have you guys seen the amount of xenofobia in this topic?.
---
Months ago i made a topic at the official wow forums asking for a server where people wouldn't mind me being a brazilian, and i recived a lot of positive feedback, mostly from RP servers.
---
 Fast forward now, doesn't even seen the same community, yes, a lot of BR players are toxic, but in my experience is the same as NA players, mainly kids that say stupid things or refuse to cooperate.
---
For people thinking that BR players are going to play in the server and are going to be an annoyance, trolling everyone, you're quite wrong.
---
The majority of people going to play classic are in fact adults, and we're doing the most organizated way possible. The BR community has been talking for months now because we too want to play in a healthy server with as low toxicity as possible.
---
As for the language barrier, yes it is a problem, but there isn't much we can do about that since there is no official portuguese language server.
---
Anyways, i hope classic wow can change the BR stigma a little bit, in the end we're just a huge community of people very passionate about games, and sometimes that can leave the wrong impression.
---
To the people who still want to play on this server, i will talk to the BR guild leaders and see if we can organize the community a little bit more, so we can avoid toxic behaviours.
---
Literally why I don't want to be in a discord, kills community and social interactions ingame
---
&gt; It's the EXACT same thing.
---
Bad faith arguments means this discussion is over.
---
Everyone interested in PVP needs to be interested in PVE. For 99% of players, that's where the good gear comes from. And for the 1%, they still need PVE because it's where some of the only good gear for that slot comes from.
---
Yeah their regular chant at any UFC in Brazil I believe translates to "You will die"
---
If not better imo, seems like the people who do exceptionally well in PvP tend to also do very well in PvE
---
My expectation was classic wow by the old design. Not classic wow by the dog shit new age blizzard design.
---
I honestly did not start down ranking heals until I started raiding and even then it wasn’t until I got enough good healing gear to really make that matter. For dungeons I don’t think you need to worry about that too much. Maybe Dire Maul, I never went through that place honestly.
---
&gt;How would they have calculated if we' re going to be there for example? 2 PVP servers seem very low.
---
Let's say 20k players participated in the beta, and in their experience, 5% of players participate in the beta. Based on that estimate, they think they will have 400k. They have many of such estimates. They analyze them, and make a guess based off that.
---
This is called market research and it's something that is used in literally every industry.
---
Are you just bias because BR has the better football team?
---
Mods on this sub are literally illogical. 
---
There was a highly detailed post here on a compilation of layering events and how often it happens and how it actually works. 
---
It got up to 200 comments. Then guess what

There never was a discussion, you never presented an argument.
---
Alright buddy. Well good luck with your strategies in Classic. Maybe we'll talk again when you've had a go at raiding in vanilla.
---
I believe that the new macro system is in place isn’t it?
---
Ye, shamans can purge your HoTs and shit, but this is not such a problem when you are spec'd into NS/Swiftmend build, which is the best support PVP build. You just learn how to deal with purges.
---
Now, in tearms of CC, Druids are way better on Ally side I believe. Paladins can remove your Roots, while Shamans can only watch his character stuck for 20+ long seconds when rooted. And ofc, you can ocasionally Hibernate Shamans when they are in ghost wolf form.
---
That’s how you get ignored quickly then now it’s harder to find groups for them
---
No, they've said Layering will be removed by Phase 2. Which Ion said is ~2 months after launch.
---
That gives them 2 months to get the realm list perfect by responding to player population data with new free-transfer realms, which is exactly what Blizzard said they're prepared to do.
---
You HAVE to assume they have at least one data scientist modeling server launch populations and decay/growth over time and that those forecasts heavily influenced the initial build out.
---
The servers will definitely not grow. They will die much faster than we think.
---
Brazilian here. I have meet with a lot of spanish speaking people. Easiest to understand was colombian (really nice people) and galician (which is closer to portuguese than spanish). Worst is porteño (fucking argentinian don't even tried to be understood) and barcelonan (that accent is thicc)...

ITT: omg everything is racist someone escort me to to my safe space /s

Yes there will absolutely be tryhards on pvp servers.

You can see distant mountains on a plain in real life. Stand east of Denver and look west on a clear day. You’re going to see some mountains in silhouette. I think it adds to the world to see them vs empty air.

Only thing they gotta add is Arenas. Other than that, keep it as is.

OP said he wanted to PVP mostly. Escape artist is definitely better than perception.
---
There’s an addon to fix it.

I was merely trolling. For gaming I always prefer English, sounds way better then in my native language. But glad you took the bate so eagerly. /cackle
---
If you are only worrying about the people who stream classic now, Asomon and co., you might have a surprise coming. Wait till Shroud or Ninja want to play, and stream. You got no way of telling what server they will pick, and with only 11 NA (if you play NA), you are going to run into a streamer, "popular guy", well known troll with followers....etcetc. 
---
TLDR. Give it up with avoiding em, you can't. Play instead.
---
Thats more on blizzard for not having a dedicated SA server.
---
Ouch dude, that was really unnecessary (but true)
---
I didn’t pick up baron longdouche’s head bc of that and had to run back lol
---
Preference =/= discrimination
---
I’d go CA, but no matter what you guys pick no one is gonna know the difference, the latency is so low from CA to Jersey that you wouldn’t know what server you were playing on unless you actually checked. Also they reimplemented spell batching at 200ms windows so it makes even less a difference. My guess is NJ to CA is like 50ms max
---
Not so much looking for early progression (I'm not planning on rushing 60 at all), just a healthy PvE community down the line.

Wish we did. But then the silver lining is that no albino raptor helped put me 100% into the Druid camp
---
In response to your second question, at minimum you have to get your BiS dungeon gear before starting the rank grind. Once you begin the grind to rank 10 for the full blue PvP set, you have to commit to 2 months of non-stop PvP for at least 5 hours a day. Doing anything other than PvP during this time period will set you back because of the way the rank grind works in vanilla. The last few ranks are particularly brutal.
---
I mained druid in vanilla. Pretty much you used rank 4 healing touch which was like a flash of light. You gained more mana back then you spent which was wild. Never had mana issues as a druid. So innervate was a waste. Never rejuvenate  as well if you had shit spell power among the other druids.
---
Are you using auto-loot? If so, get Speedy Autoloot, it helps alleviate some of the problems with the artificial spell batching being on every action in the game.
---
I just can't justify spent the $20 for a day or 2 of beta access. The sub will run out shortly after release so I am just going to wait
---
Me too i was on the fence, I like hunter but I don’t want to roll lock cause I’m maining a mage and don’t want my two characters to be caster/cloth!
---
Later on it'll balance out, but there will be more gankers.
---
You seriously think this is racist? Oh you special little snowflake you.

I remember accidentally rolling on Illidan and Warsong. Waste of time right there
---
INV to Asmon layer plz
---
Shit I never really even thought about it that way.  I feel like leveling and random encounters with other faction would be neat in RPPvP but any kind of organized event could get griefed incredibly easy
---
Dude! We are looking for a druid! Play with us?
---
You got some real hate for them there, jeez some people.
---
Can't wait to do some PvP on Grob as Horde. Going to be fabulous. 
---
It will be endless war.
---
Please do so.
---
Interesting that most players than want to go Alliance go PVE/RP vs PVP/RPPVP according to your chart.
---
Most people on RP servers don't actually RP. I have never seen anyone RPing inside dungeons, raids or battlegrounds on retail RP servers. Most people just play on them for the more mature/less toxic atmosphere.
---
Yes prot will still be slower than the other 2 specs.  You do significantly less damage specc'd that way.  Now if you level exclusively in groups on the otherhand you'll be fine.
---
red pills kicking in?
---
better late than never
---
As someone else pointed out, this sounds like 100% bias. Most of your counterpoints don’t even make sense. Like “yeah, just only when they felt like doing those things” has it ever occurred to you that a hunter might not want to trap either? Not to mention the even more ridiculous points such as bringing up engineering in the endgame but also mentioning gear with just int and stam. What kind of lock would farm gear with just int and stam in endgame?
---
Are there any mods to remove the red ability spam? "Not enough Energy!" etc. Roguespam was my goto mod on other servers.
---
I mean sure its still a job, but it is one of the most simple jobs on the planet, and pays a ton.
---
Because my main in current wow is on argent Dawn us I frequently encounter players from azralon "the only notable Brazil realm" from my experience thier no worse then American players. Language barriers are still bad. 
---
Thier definitely better to play with then Spanish speakers, because thier more likely to understand me.
---
Yes 100%
---
&gt; You quit retail over layering? Hahah ok buddy.
---
Layering was never in Retail LMAO,
---
This isn’t my opinion and I don’t agree with op, I’m just correcting you on your stupidity.

Uhh layering isn’t going away anytime soon. It’s going away when phase 2 hits. Are you trolling?

There was an error in the cell formula, it has been fixed.

You'll be fine for the time being, but you are going to have a bad time if you decide to Raid or do mass WPVP/AV.

Even on the lowest settings, an integrated graphics chip won't be able to keep up with all the spells flying around.

On a separate note, have you experienced some difficulty trying to move some of the frames around on your HUD. For example, the party frames and raid frames pulling other frames along with them when trying to move them around etc... ?

A group announcing their own realm Discord servers is not "monopolistic practices". Are they doing anything to prevent players from joining other realm Discord servers? No.

High pop realms do cause issues. It becomes very much like retail where there are millions of people and everyone is expendable. But we’re not talking about Illidan packed, but possibly Illidan on steroids x10....

Yea, it was so cool to run into the same people on different levels. I vividly remember a Deadmines run where I, a hunter, was trying to form a party. Only found two guys, ine of which disconnected soon after. This warrior called Ming and I went in anyway and made it to the first boss with me bandage healing. It was so awesome for me that we managed to get this far - i think we eventually found a full party and finished the dungeon. Months later, at level 60, I found out my brother was now in the same guild as him when he wrote something in their guild channel. I still remember his name because it was the middle of mine -Domingo.
---
And I would PvP and meet the guys that had helped me out on some quest... Good memories.

I don't think it will.  Blizzard are saying that as they assume the population will decrease, it won't significantly enough.
---
They all understand it but it’s popular to just downvote and ignore reality on Reddit.
---
There's nothing wrong with DDR3.
---
It's a stress test, they are intentionally spawning new layers to test the tech. I imagine (sincerely hope) that there will be far fewer layers at launch.
---
Brazilian isn't a race anyway, it's a nationality.  This would be "prejudiced" except its true and its not a preconception.  Basically every gamer has experienced what is being discussed here first hand.

Me and my old wow buddies are making a guild and going to be grouping up in super excited :)
---
Layering ends at the start of phase 2.
---
Honest question, what's so bad about being in a server with popular streamers?
---
"At your side! M'lady"
---
Because they saw how successful private servers were without any region/language support outside of english and figured they probably didn't need to either in order to save money. They're probably trying to keep things as cheap as possible so that none of the suits axe it due to overreaching costs.
---
I see thanks . Should I take the google spreadsheets that are being passed around with a grain of salt ?
---
“Blizzard tried to fuck”
---
Listen to yourself. It had nothing to do with “Blizzard trying to fuck” your region. I’m almost certain that I had everything to do with how many subscribers they anticipated.
---
Do you even read Blue Posts? More servers are coming as demand rises.
---
Most people's problems are not with streamers themselves (unless they personally dislike the streamer), but rather with their hordes of mindless followers looking for attention.  Have a big streamer on a server means that there will be hundreds or thousands of people following them around begging for their senpai to notice them, or actively trying to hinder said streamer's progress.
---
This breaks immersion and creates a chaotic environment wherever the streamer goes.
---
Ur answer took longer than a google search. Based on that, you don’t want to expand your knowledge, but only wanna argue. Have fun in your little bubble. Bye !
---
I don't care about the finer details of where it is illegal.  It's just an analogy let it go.  Why would it bother you that asmon or any other streamer gets their name anyways?  Complain if they add more than that to a restricted list but these people help the game bottom line.  Do you want the name esfand or something?  Let it go seriously and complain about something that matters.  Like who will sell Thex for too much.
---
NA east coast is fucked.
---
NA west coast will be fine.
---
Yeah, welcome to CLASSIC.
---
IS there a  quest helper that works, other than aap ofcourse since thats just a linear guide
---
Pally tanks are actually pretty good in 5 mans.
---
It's not a "false start". Games can and should adapt to the needs of their players.
---
This is also what I found most annoying about the beta! I don't understand the delay either
---
&gt; Nothing minor about that tweak.
---
This doesn't make any sense. 
---
&gt; And IF they decide on changes I'd rather see them find a way to make Paladins viable tanks despite the lack of Taunt. 
---
So, an ability that has a 5 second cool down that causes a lot of threat to one target? 🤔
---
Guess you’re just a troll, waste of time talking to you
---
I agree. Arenas would be amazing, and they're external to the rest of wow, I think as long as the rewards from arenas were regulated well it wouldn't be a terrible thing to add! 
---
Though I understand that they didn't come out til BC and aren't very vanilla-esk...
---
So you were trained from birth to speak a second language? Not many are so lucky. You spent literal years to learn the language.

lol how is that relevant to the thread

---
just swim.
---
Even if there are countless someone will always need a healer.
---
But there are plenty of places in NA that have different first languages than English...
---
Also, when you start to lvl an alt, giving the greens and bags you find to random people than are only wearing greys
---
It is true there is much more information available nowadays, there are guides and optimised levelling routes. I don't expect to be levelling very fast due to various obligations and a (in retrospect somewhat poorly planned) holiday, but I might very well be wrong and things could go fast (WoW tends to make its way into my evenings and to stay for some time...).
---
Also, I am planning on levelling two chars more or less in the same timeframe - one for when my brother is online and one for when I am on my own :)
---
How is that trolling? People on this very sub act like streamers are subhuman. And you literally said its a community forcing streamers off servers, well if they are forced off every server, where do they go?

Exactly!

Ah yea, the ol gaming media has been proven to be a reliable indicator of what players want. /s
---
I like that you think Brazilians and Spaniards aren't normal lol.
---
Yes. If you look deep enough, there are rumors for every server on why that server should be avoided. And surveying a tiny portion of the playerbase on their probable server choice has too large a margin of error to determine something like faction balance.
---
seriously. someone types “where’s the heirloom vendor?” in general on the stress test and about 50 nerds clench their fists and scream at them. If you guys don’t want to see constant trolling, figure it out and stop feeding them.
---
They don't want the playerbase to be a big community, they don't want large friendgroups, their aim is still to make this an impersonal pugfest, as it's the current retail boost model + token system that makes them the most money and is straight out of Koticks playbook.
---
Ever wondered why games don't really have public servers etc where you meet the same people anymore, but impersonal 'matchmaking' or queue systems? Competing vs the infinite pool of random players and never feeling 'on top of the world' vs playing against a well known community causes people to spend more cash on MTX.
---
What they want is PUGS and solo players, hence the intense sharding + extremely low number of realms. It's set up so more players bring in the money because they will buy boosts etc.
---
Only 2 realms means overcrowded realms making it easy for all the current boosting companies to be set up and be normalized as a proper option to gear/raid.  Blizzard will then 100% release WoW tokens for gold before/during DireMaul release as people then have already become accustomed to the retail-boosting fests again.
---
It's all part of their grand design.
---
You buy off me that will coast  9000000000000  vietnamese dongs
---
People who think layering will be gone in phase 2, how in the world will they do that? There's no way only 3000 people are playing on each of the 2 EU PVP servers for example.
---
They can add more servers, you know. It's not like they're all that expensive for Blizzard.
---
I like how Blizzard thinks NA and SA doesn’t have a language barrier either /s
---
Not birth, elementary school. That and english cartoons. What outcast corner of the world are you from that they don’t teach english in school?
---
Well feel free not to play until Phase 2.
---
&gt; don't use regrowth
---
This is not a good advise. Regrowth has a lot of uses, it's just not a main heal.
---
If Classic does change the Stigma, it would have been the first game in the history of Online Gaming to do so.
---
Good luck with that. Not saying it won’t happen, but good luck.
---
It’s not Xenophobia (at least in my case), it’s experience. I’ve played with so many Korean, Chinese, Spanish-Speaking, Russian-Speaking, French, Japanese, and Thai players.  
---
Brazilian-Portuguese speakers and Russian-Speakers have been BY FAR the most toxic to game with. As in 90%+ of my experiences.
---
thats what it says.  3 characters across up to 3 servers.
---
&gt; So, an ability that has a 5 second cool down that causes a lot of threat to one target?
---
Yeah. But, like, not Taunt.
---
I remember once I was about to die cause a mob respawned behind me and an enemy mage polymorphed me to regen my life
---
 **Please do not discriminate the Brazilian, we do not want another server, we want to play with you!**
---
Oh! I did not know they were planning on doing patches to Classic! Have they announced this anywhere?
---
You think US got it bad? EU only got 2 English speaking  PvP and PvE realms and the PvE ones have horrendous names up to boot.
---
They’re only doing it cause it works. i’ve never seen so many internet inept troll feeder near-boomers in one place.
---
Shroud and Ninja will only play for a short Period.
---
Their fans won't want to watch them level

OMEGALUL

I intend to but I'm not holding my breath that they will remove layering at all. When the game is as designed by the original competent game designers is when I'll pay their money grubbing little fee.

---
The majority of the problems with this iteration of the game are tied to layering. It seems like Blizz has been sneaky &amp; shady AF, with a plan to keep layering the entire time despite blatantly stating otherwise. Layering on a fundamental level kills the basic principle of what a MMORPG is. If layering isn’t removed, I’m out for life on anything Blizz does for the remainder of whatever existence they have left.
---
Nah
---
You're if you think they wont open more servers the very first day or soon after. They did so for the stress test.
---
Q fucking Q
---
They will add more servers after release. I am sure of it.
---
Addon plans perhaps further down the road, but there will be WASD and arrow key support in the short term for easy alt-tabbing between the game and browser.
---
Do you mean sharding?
---
 We don't speak retail. GTFO
---
I am rolling a troll... I am just going to hike over there  lvl 1 and start from Mulgor
---
Gonna be part of the Grob Squad! Me and my friends are already making guild plans!

You're right. Analysts have no idea what they're talking about and Wildstar has proven to be successful beyond measure.
---
Great point, mate.
---
Community events are nice. Sadly I'll play on the EU servers so I can't partake.
---
Spoken like a true retail player
---
I'm showing that it took you years to cultivate enough English to comfortably use it online. 
---
No human wants to spend years of study for something they don't see a benefit in. If you were going to take the time to learn a 2ed language it probably wouldn't be Portuguese so that you could group with Brazilians online.
---
should've used the stacy model for the succubus but nonetheless great meme
---
A billion dollar company can afford some extra servers? get fucking real man. If that's really true and they are just being cheap, they can go straight to hell
---
During legion the ebon blade decides that to survive the demon apocalypse they would need thier own 4 horsemen "nazgrim, thoras trollbane, Whitemane, and Tirion fordring
---
It’s a very clear indicator. Even the big streamers got bored of it so quickly.

Why ban him, when you can just get a lvl 17 hunter to take care of the problem
---
u/Novercalis ClassicCastbars recieved an update and appears to be working.
---
It's almost like they're....testing layering, on the stress test.
---
No, no. That'd make too much sense.
---
I mean I'm just going to play on the non Streamer/BR/Spanish server. It seems like an easy choice even if you live on the East coast.  That said, given only the three choices, the Spanish server is the obvious choice.
---
I'll likely be making a character on the RPPvP server as well.
---
obviously was a mistake chill out there kiddo.
---
Speak for yourself, bud!
---
&gt;&gt; Nothing minor about that tweak.
---
&gt; This doesn't make any sense.
---
Giving Taunt to Paladins is not a "minor tweak". It's a huge change.
---
You're being needlessly obtuse.
---
Except they dont. Once you have your manapearl gear from the starter quest, its already irrelevant. Naz mobs are even irrelevant to my 370 alt.
---
Maybe the very first quest, but not all of naz does.
---
Ive played wow since vanilla and Ive always been under the impression that starterzone quests are race/reputation locked? Am I wrong? Id fking love to go there as an undead rogue otherwise lol. No rogue trainers tho
---
&gt;so that means each server will have approximately 9000 active players on it.
---
the biggest problem is this.  people do not spread out evenly, they group up.  if a realm is full then that becomes a higher priority pick than a realm that might be dead or dying, and as the gap widens the problem builds on itself and gets worse.
---
it won't be that every realm is full, but even if there's only 1 full realm, breaking it up affects thousands and thousands of players, even people that weren't on the realm if their dead realms get opened to transfers.
---
CC was commonly used and deemed necessary during vanilla wow dungeons.
---
we, as a community, could have handled it the same way we handled language specific server. an adamant: "we need it". (in case of layering: "we don't want it")
---
with layering tough, it seems for every person that thinks it shouldn't be in the game there is one that says it should. blizzard just saw both sides about equally represented and went with the safest option.
---
ie: keep venues for adjustments as open as possible and then decide what to do as time progresses.
---
it makes perfect sense. nobody wants their vacation time wasted in ques, serverdowns and unable to level due to overpopulation.
---
whether or not its worth the price is very personal and sadly not as simple as saying "we need language servers for eu".
---
That’s what happens when blizz releases the realms with only 3 days to reservations.
---
Yeah in early Vanilla it was required but in Classic not really you can just nuke everything down. That’s how it was in the beta anyway.
---
Do it right away. Saving mana will help you be more efficient will leveling. Also serves as good practice for raiding and learning down rank keybinds. Its gonna be a lot to take in if you leave it all for when you hit 60
---
Kinda seems like maybe they know more about their own business and historical data than you, no?
---

---
Of course, this was all speculation.  But even if the numbers are off, I can't see things being as bad as everyone is saying it will be.
---
Were you able to transfer from pvp to pvp in vanilla?
---
Thanks! Took some time, it was rough, but I pushed through the struggle and made it to the peak
---
Reddit moderators are really some of the most pathetic humans in existence. Imagine being given the smallest, most minuscule amount of power imaginable and STILL letting it go to your head. It would be hilarious if it wasn’t so deeply sad.

What?

---
Where do you get that idea? It will prevent some launch day queues, but overall it just allows for an expansion and then contraction of servers due to what will be likely population trends. The servers will be full day one, and then within a month they will lose a huge number of players. They need to allow for the large numbers while knowing they will go away.
---
In the two hours that I played Thursday night, the conversation was utterly dominated by politics. With a shocking amount of Trump support. 
---
It was pretty gross.
---
Let's start with the 28th and see what kinda a shitshow we have to deal with then we can talk about months later.
---
Throlling..
---
Finally, some logic.
---
It's like they don't want to understand that a setver community is what defined classic. At least for me. Layer, Xrealm, whatever you may call it = no server community.
---
sure, because the servers don't need to be hosted right? The companies that provide hosting will shut them off as soon as the law no longer protects them. If they try hosting in their basements they will simply be sued out of existence by blizzard and not have a house to host out of.
---
Seems like he summoned a big bulge too.
---
That realm already has its own subreddit?
---
I didn't say they couldn't afford it, I said they didn't think they'd need to, obviously. This isn't some major release, its literally a side project, and every expense needs to be approved by management. The people in charge of planning the budget for this were most assuredly told to do this as cheaply as possible because I doubt many of the upper management have much faith that rereleasing a 15 year old version of their game is going to net serious profit (which is literally all they care about).
---
Yes this is going to be the posts that strikes up an engaging conversation, where the 50 or so odd posts since announcement failed!
---
Yeah you must be new to Blizzard. I'm old enough to know I'm justified when you compare the old true Blizzard to the dogshit is has become today. Classic wow has a 50/50 chance of being a complete dumpster fire with these clowns at the helm.

What happens when the layer phase is finished and 1 realm still has 50,000 active players on it? Even if 1 layer could handle all of them at once world spawns etc will still be a nightmare, good luck mining copper lol.

Although I hope they have a threshold in their mind where when X layers spin up they will fire up a new realm.

People are making really big case out of those streamers, people were scared of streamers that they would ruin population because originally there was thought that cap/pop would be 2.5-3k, but considering now you get like 10-15k per realm I dont think that effect of streamers will be that visible.
---
If streamers are going to be dicks about blacklist etc, community will just turn against them after while.
---
Yeah scruffnuk ! You tell em good !
---
People have no problem with the streamers themself, they have a problem with (usually) their toxic followers.
---
It’s not so much the streamers themselves as much as it is the communities that come with them.
---
Can't wait for the shitshow about layering after release.
---
It's their following that's the problem. 30-100 characters following them everywhere, turning all chats into twitch chat
---
I couldn't get it to work. It just didn't show up in my addon list I changed the -master or left it on but nothing seemed to work. Other people have been complaining about it not working also but it does for some it's really odd.
---
Seriously. At what point did *literally everyone* become okay with layering? Get this shit out of my game.
---
I've been really surprised how well I can tolerate the look of the game, given how insanely low poly and old it is. There are times when I catch myself getting caught up in the atmosphere, which is funny because whenever I've played modern WOW and gone back to old zones I can't stop thinking how crude and ugly everything looks. I feel like when you have detailed stuff next to cartoony low poly stuff it makes the low poly stuff look horrible, but when literally everything is low poly and cartoony your brain stops caring as much.
---
I love it.  The random events are fun.  World pvp 4 life!
---
Care for some juueeeece?
---
Yeah, I was disappointed by this. Also, if my memory serves me correctly, the late patches like 1.12 were considered WoW easy mode.
---
Yeah I guess a PvE player can not understand it.
---
Sounds to me like, "lets all roll on Herod and streamer shame anyone who displays actions associated with streamers and their followers."
---
And by kids I assume you refer to 25-40 year-olds who make the majority of Classic's playerbase.
---
He's not saying it is. You've missed the point.
---
Not a waste of time for me tho because the experiment was succesful. You see, when retards make stupid claims, it’s a nice idea to do a reverse question. Learning a second language is only normal for some people in the world based on the need. You don’t decide where you are born or if the country you are born in, is teaching you a second language, and if that language happens to be English. Some parts of the world its normal to get a sports car when you turn 18. You understand that you are not born into a rich family and therefor didn’t get a sports car, yet you don’t understand the same case for language. I’d rank you below troll, for not even giving me any challenge. You jumped right into it with both legs. I win you lose. Bye bye !
---
Yea I’ll playing grobbass all day fuck my boss.
---
Hmm... I haven't been following the news to a T, but isn't this server a pretty accurate recreation of Vanilla?
---
What level dungeons were things being nuked down in beta? Just the low level ones, or all the way up to the lv 60 dungeons?
---
Problem isn't the streamer by himself. The community is the problem. It's not funny to play on a server with thousends of players who seek for the attention of the streamer.
---
OnLy PhAsE oNe
---
This sounds familiar...
---
"Oh its just a concept guys it will change"
---
"Oh its just alpha it will change"
---
"Oh its just beta it will change"
---
"Oh its just first week of expansion it will change"
---
"Oh its just 1st patch it will change"
---
"They will change it eventually..."
---
"What this shit is still in the game? Well why weren't you complaining earlier? Its too late to change anything now."
---
This caveman-level logic is what plagued retail since at least 10 years.
---
Please stfu.
---
Thank you, I'll add them to the list.
---
Have any advice how to go about this then. I’m gonna do the save name thing on 3 servers . I’m sure the streamers will announce at some point what servers they’ll go on
---
Lol. Run off with your lil bubble then
---
No. Beasts do that.
---
You are underestimating the drop off we will see. Prob a huge number week 1 then another huge group once they hit 60 and realize how long it takes to gear up. we will probably see 80% drop off by the time the dust settles.
---
Can you imagine? Grinding consumables for a raid? Mad lad.
---
You were a mistake
---
&gt; now you get like 10-15k per realm
---
Where are you getting these numbers and for how long will it stay that high?
---
&gt; community will just turn against them
---
That's the issue, server communities don't matter when these streamers have their own loyal communities to protect them, some of which could be even bigger than the server itself.
---
I'd love to hear confirmation on this theory if anyone hears anything, I'd appreciate it
---
Dont mean to sound rude but this is one account and hearsay so far, I'm operating on treating Thalnos as Brazilian but I'd just love some confirmation so I can check it off my list
---
I honestly was hoping for like 40 servers. We arent gonna get that sense of community if there are super full servers with many layers
---
The problem with hunters is that you place the trap at your feet and the tank has to try have the mobs run over it as he pulls.  More often or not, the mobs run right past the trap without triggering it.
---
Rogues sap also takes them out of stealth, and even if there is a talent to reduce the change, there is still a 10% that it breaks.
---
Most groups will make due with what they have available, but you should still know the limitations of your class.
---

---
Collective dropping of the ball by Blizzard
---
I've always wondered... when I stated WoW on Dalaran I joined a New player server thinking I had to. What is the point of those servers anyways?
---
Mostly just jelly
---
This is my view as well. Unless we get more info, I plan on claiming a name on Faerlina first. I encourage everyone else to do the same. If there's a small Spanish-speaking community on Faer, that won't be a huge deal. Better than streamers or Brazilians.
---
Layering is the new feature they are testing, not the same as sharding that we have now
---
Comparing polling data for Mirage and Pyrewood the only real difference I see is that Pyrewood is Alliance biased (+60%) while Mirage is more even. No that it matters enormously on a PvE server.
---
Gotta find those upsides with this server situation..
---
i did that. thanks. how do i make the party window pop up ?
---
Esc &gt; Elvui &gt; Unitframes &gt; Party &gt; Enable doesnt do anything   
---
Esc &gt; Elvui &gt; Toggle Anchors &gt; Doesnt show party/raid windows on your profile. 
---
Any idea what else to do ?
---
Honestly it was probably because, like myself, the people who want them are the ones who had forgotten about the BR menace and now that we're reminded the BR community exists we're terrified of having to deal with that toxic bullshit again so language servers are now a priority lol.
---
+5 Sword Skill and Rep bonus duh
---
Quality post. +1 for Linux!
---
I knew Killerduki. Didn't like him, but he was a good tank.
---
Yes, I agree, and I hope their estimates based on community feedback, stresstests, maybe even private server estimations (if they take these into account at all) are good.
---
Naming issues are a problem of merges, that much is certain - but in a way, you get these anyway with big realms, don't you? Names are unique, so people will quickly get to a point where their preferred name and its variations are already taken, so you get weird constructs like "Gnowarlomeck" or something.
---
I really should replay WC3 before launch...I was more so wondering how their is Skele of him there but he is still the last boss in Hyjal? And Ty
---
There'll be plenty of toxic folks from ED I'm sure. The rest of the old RPPVP server folks seem pretty chill.
---
&gt; One of the stress test servers is pacific and I’m at 75ms
---
Which one? I live in Los Angeles and have a very good internet connection, and I was at 62ms in the stress test. Blizzard HQ is an hour drive from me... So I'm guessing I wasn't on the pacific stress test realm.
---
To be fair, I'm not sure a subreddit that mostly posts memes and complains about streamers is an area where RPers would congregate.

No they are all playing on the same server according to other comments in this thread.  Even the top comment from tipsout says he wont confirm a server (after that BS about transparency).
---
I agree with this, Almost all of the current guilds that are recruiting have gone to this other discord server.
---
Imagine having friends
---
SEE YA THERE
---
Grobbelus already has several East Coast guilds, trust me, you'll be fine finding a reasonable raid spot at a reasonable hour.
---
Pump the brakes, turbo. They need to farm some soul shards. That's one small thing among many things you need to do to prepare for raids. Also other classes need to prepare for raids in unique ways as well. For example, mages need to make food and water.
---
Don't be so hyperbolic.
---
Layering is this thing everyone has agreed to not like, but know nothing about. 
---
Basically Blizzard’s way to deal with overpopulation at launch.
---
Lol imagine having to waste emotional and physical energy on other people in 2019

In the Vanilla shot, the grey on the building is noticably brighter and there is a reddish glow to the beard. The dwarf himself and his clothing is darker.
---
Overall I'd say there's more contrast on the Vanilla shot. The bright colours are brighter and the dark colours darker.
---
I think I slightly prefer the Vanilla look, but it's nothing game-breaking.

This community is already so tight on reddit and discord that there will always been good rp going on. Others may join just for PvP but trust me there will be a loooot of RP going on :)
---
I posted a discussion about where specifically the servers are located, because people in the middle of the country might want to know. There were some informative replies, saying things like east coast is in Chicago, which is good to know for someone in Texas. After about 10 people replied with various bits of useful information, it got locked. Why stop a useful discussion in progress? It's relevant to the upcoming release, more relevant than some meme. Is that what they want here? A bunch of meme posts?
---
No, I wasn't trolled. I didn't believe them to be honest in their support about Trump, it was obvious they were trolling.
---
I'm also not "still talking about it". This is literally the first I've talked about it since then.
---
It doesn't matter what form the trolling takes, it's all gross and incredibly stupid.
---
On stress test 50% of the comments in general are morons talking about how retail sucks and why Blizzard is incompetent. They’re not joking.
---
Oh yeah, that'd be just fine then.
---
its gonna be cross-layer BGs, each layer having 5-6k Players
---
Completely a fucking fraud.  One time I called the fool a mediocre con-artist, and then another poster told me that was not the case.  That poster then described that while TIPS doesn't know a whole lot he speaks well...

So... like a con-artist?

"Just wait for release"
---
"Just wait for hotfix"
---
"Just wait for BC"
---
Simply no big enough for the entire east coast lmao. Streamers need their server for their followers, and entire country and gaming community can fit in another. That leaves the entire east coast to one PvP server. And that’s not mentioning no central servers either...where are they going to play?
---
You got a source on that or just spewing BS?
---
It hasn't 'worked' on the tests because it's being actively fucked with.
---
Why is that a hard concept for you to grasp?
---
I was in dusk wood yesterday, and did a /who, there were 12 people, this was probably around 7 pst, so basically primetime, it can be pretty bad imo.
---
Yeah I guess I was thinking the internet lines had to be on land, I forgot they run through the ocean!
---
So you want the city to be packed with level 5-10's instead of them going out questing?
---
Are you confused about how things work?

I hate how right you probably are :(

It wasn't brought up out of no where. It's another example of a concept that a lot of Americans don't actually understand. He could have brought up literally anything that fits that bill, and it would be relevant for his point.
---
&gt; Pump the brakes, turbo. They need to farm some soul shards. That's one small thing among many things you need to do to prepare for raids.
---
Which is double the work compared to other classes, which means that they are going to be under-represented because no one will want to deal with that garbage. 
---
It's almost as if you didn't really read the post I made? 
---
&gt; Also other classes need to prepare for raids in unique ways as well. For example, mages need to make food and water.
---
It's not even the same thing.

&gt; Don't be so hyperbolic.

Low quality troll. Yawn.

"Warlock fanboy spotted"
---
&gt;Most of your counterpoints don’t even make sense.
---
Because you don't seem to understand them doesn't make them any less valid, and that's a direct consequence for why you can't give any explanations, and instead, you just blurt out "doesn't even make sense".
---
&gt;Like “yeah, just only when they felt like doing those things” has it ever occurred to you that a hunter might not want to trap either?
---
That's follows the same logic as "what if the tank doesn't want to taunt?" Well, in that case we have an l2p issue. Learn the difference.
---
&gt;Not to mention the even more ridiculous points such as bringing up engineering in the endgame but also mentioning gear with just int and stam.
---
Well, waddayouknow, I didn't even bother to compare warlock shittyness to any of the other possible classes that could dps as well or the pvp viability through different patches. Warlocks were practically free kills for ud rogues before wotf nerf. Tbh I could have started talking shit about any of the classes really, but I didn't create this thread about class roasting so Idc.
---
&gt;What kind of lock would farm gear with just int and stam in endgame?
---
A better question would be: why would anyone even want to play lock in the endgame? ;)
---
At least the opposing faction will have shorter BG qs !
---
wrote it from the phone while on the bus.. pretty shitty grammar, but i think the idea is understandable
---
So you’re basically saying people who criticize the game’s clearly imperfect are features are crybabies and should be censored?

Yeah that mentality isn’t gonna get you places.

**&lt;Get Some&gt; NA | PVP | Progression Raiding | DKP**
---
Faction: Alliance
---
Server: TBD
---
Server Type: PVP
---
Guild Type: Progression Raiding
---
Raid Schedule: Tuesday / Wednesday - 8pm to midnight
---
 
---
**About us.**
---
Get Some is a semi-hardcore casual guild. What does this mean? We have a casual approach to the number of raid nights, the length of raids, the time it takes to get to 60, and simply don't care for min/maxing. However, we expect that when we do play, we play with a high level of focus and we play well. 
---
It's more than that though. Here, we think that rushing to 60 and grinding endless hours kills the best part of the game. We're not aiming for World Firsts, so why pretend. We will compete for Server Firsts in future phases, but that is a ways down the road.
---
In our opinion, half of the game is the leveling experience. That's when you meet people and learn your own in-game strengths and weaknesses. Most importantly, that's when you build friendships with your guildmates. Sure, we are stoked to raid and plan on fielding a full 40-man team. But we're also realistic. This game isn't going anywhere and neither are we. 
---
If this laid back environment sounds right for you, please join us. We don't believe in apps--if you still like us after we get to 60, that's good enough for us. We will be fielding several dungeon teams at launch for those that are interested in pushing hard out of the gate, but we do not have any required timeframe for getting to 60. 
---
**What we offer.**
---
A progression oriented state of mind
---
Scheduled guild raid nights
---
A laid back focused environment
---
Experienced players 
---
**What we expect.**
---
We are looking for people with good attitudes that enjoy the game. We want team players, people that enjoy actively participating in a community, 
---
We do expect people to act their age. To that end, we are also an 18+ only guild.

Ive asked this like 30 times and always get at least one whisper of someone calling me a moron. I don't know why I do it tho
---
This is my fear actuary without significantly more severs layering here to stay for a while without a catastrophic drop off in player count.
---
the original is about brazillians ruining a server.

Friend
---
Correct me if I’m wrong, but didn’t blizzard say that layering would only be in starting zones and would only last a couple weeks to a month? I really don’t think it’s gonna be a huge issue but I don’t really know everything about it. Downvotes to the left.
---
delete this, makes you look like a complete dumb fuck.
---
And NA players don't want to carry you asshats through the game.
---
I'm gonna go for "they have fixed it but it wasn't shipped yet" cause I have seen really highly populated starting areas, and I would be sad to see this on launch
---
who the fuck are you tho lmao? just go
---
TIL lol thanks
---
Normally I woudlnt trust blizz and the server numbers are concerning but Im still gonna hold Blizz &amp; Ion to their words. 
---
When Ion specifically says "Layering is antithetical to community and Vanilla gameplay", Im gonna fkin hold him to it.
---
Great point. Thanks for that brilliant commentary.
---
Yes, though the /sal options allow you to enable it by default for all characters.
---
Yeah I don't understand that. I tried to revive my polymorph macro from BC when I finally started playing my Mage again and couldn't make it work. 
---
It would focus my target, sheep it, and then if I clicked it again would cancel casting and re-sheep that same focus no matter what I happened to be targeting. It would clear when the mob died or when I held shift and used the macro.
---
It meant I could resheep in the middle of my dps rotation very quickly.
---
Couldn't figure out how to make it work in BFA. A lot of the commands weren't working. 
---
WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT
---
Yessss. This is needed!
---
Yeah, but when people have already posted the same shit 50 times, it is definitely considered low effort.
---
I’m not a warlock fanboy. Just pointing out stupid bias towards certain classes. I just gave you an explanation on why your post was retarded.
---
You think you do, but you don't

“Nobody likes overcrowded severe or queues” they said. Yes. I do prefer overcrowded to dead and I’d rather have queues than layering. Even from day 1.
---
Noticed as undead mage pathing, you have dinging level 13 before leaving for Org/Crossroads. But the guide backtracks here and shows you dinging 12 in barrens when we already should be 13+. Wanted to point it out.
---
No you fool! Don't you understand? Blizzard *literally* hates their playerbase. Displeasing them is their #1 goal.
---
How is one additional step for raid preparation double the steps? Of all the consumables every class needs, soul shards DOUBLE the preparation required for warlocks? Really? Bahahah
---
Google if there is an Addon that tracks your quest progress (which quest you've completed and which not) without giving information on how to solve it. If you found one then inform me please how it's called xD
---
The claim that PvP populations are appealing to the younger and more competitive crowd, and that PvE realms lend an idealistic server where adults won't be grieved?  That's the absurdity in your mind?  
---
People under 25 will play Classic.  A lot of them.
---
A larger percentage of them will play PvP.
---
A larger percentage of people over 25 will play PvE.
---
Those are my "bold" claims.  The claim that Classic will be just like Vanilla.
---
Theres another Fairbanks server here that isnt managed by a large group thats already managing other discords
---
fairbanks.classicdiscord.net
---
Back in the day I went from bartender to dominos and never went back. Dominos is pretty great.
---
I was a bit spoiled when I tried a ..... server one time ; turns out you add mods tire stuff to enhance graphics (even have wod models). But I’m so happy when I was able to jack up the graphics to ultra and 1440p; its more beautiful that current wow!
---
You must be one of those retail kids that is getting in to Classic. 
---
Oh boy.
---
Um no I just think its sad that I can see maybe 5-10 players in ORG and I STILL have to invite this mage so I can see him. I can understand if the city is packed and I not see him cause layering but that's not the case.
---
Oh okay. I'll delete it because you told me to.
---
Just kidding. Go outside and play, neckbeard.
---
I’m on monbile rn, but you can find it if you search, it’s commonly known.
---
Based on the reddit poll Fae is by far the least populated PVP East server. 
---
And it seemed like the guy I was replying to didn’t know it existed/forgot. 
---
But we definitely need dedicated LatAm/BR servers.
---
The site doesn't work for me.
---
Love how they’re all coming out as pro changes now. Good example: bitching about spell batching when in reality they screamed about it non stop ( muh vanilla) until blizzard added it.
---
I’ve noticed that PS Ret vs Blizzard Ret (low level of course) that official servers seem to have more damage. So I’m expecting to still see lower DPS on the spec overall but not as bad as the PS made it out to be.
---
Explain Illidan (US) retail then.
---
Just because you don't like his logic doesn't make what he's saying invalid.
---
I had big trouble finding my wife when we created characters at the same time! Took A LONG time for her to be into my later! Please fix, please no layering
---
Aww muffin, did mommy forget to tuck you in last night?
---
If they mostly join one faction it will also destroy faction balance at launch probably.
---
Brazilians are the worst
---
Not true. A good hunter will use distracting shot and pull the mob over the trap. A well played hunter is hard to find but if done correctly they can single handedly distract 2-3 mobs at a time for the group (Trap one, kite one, pet on another). Hunter has a very high skill cap and most people don’t do it properly.
---
To be fair, if you don't speak either language it might as well be Greek.
---
It's almost like this sub is overexaggerating when it comes to the impact layering will have on a server community.
---
Did he report it? Layering isn’t supposed to work this way. When it happens like this and isn’t reported it’s not doing any good.
---
I reported every layering mishap on stress tests every time. You aren’t supposed to get layered mid fight like that. If you aren’t going to report it though you can’t get mad about it.
---
Yes. RP servers are for players who want to stay in character.  Anything that breaks immersion such as Donald Trump talk in general will get massively reported.
---
Bro, you've made this same exact thread at least 5 times now...
---
Are you just deleting and recreating them in hopes of getting a different answer?
---
Go on fairfield I suppose lol
---
LunaFrames doesn't work for me :/
---
How is this enforced? If I name my Warlock DwayneJohnson will it get reported and I forced to change?
---
RPPVP it is then. The streamers won't go there, BR isn't going there. The streamers still might not do Herod, so the safe bet is RPPVP. Which won't make the RPers happy. What a mess already.
---
They won’t do this. It’d be too big of an undertaking considering classic isn’t a separate game. It’s just a different server you play on.
---
I was about to simply say no but I realized I don't really know what it is. So what exactly does a bond/taken system imply?
---
&gt; Farming for soul shards took hardly any time out of your day before raiding.
---
Thank you for agreeing with me that it was extra work that most other players will not want to deal with.
---
Not sure why you had to comment the way you did earlier. Perhaps your feelings were hurt? IDK. Really weird for someone on the internet.
---
Hispanic people sometimes pretend that there’s only one continent called “America.” Even though it’s not taught that way anywhere except for some South American countries. 
---
That’s why some people take issue with calling people “Americans” instead of “United Statesian,” as if there are people that go around identifying by their continent. Next time I see someone identify as “South American” instead of “Colombian” or “Latino,” I’ll take the argument a little more seriously.
---
Good on them. I only saw the language barrier as an issue. And it seems like they are fixing that as much as possible. Glad to hear that from them.

Could say same shit about Americans. I've met many brazilians and many of them have been cool people
---
Japan player here.
---
Im looking at Whitemane. TW would be cool but I don't think it will have enough of an English speaking community for me to enjoy it.
---
Agreed. It's even worse, 5 PVP servers for *all of the Americas*.
---
I think you're underestimating how much population playtime dropoff will impact things, and I'm tired of empty MMO worlds personally.
---
To each their own.

I'm with you man.  I resubbed for stress test/naming. I've only got to play it for about 5 hours and it is worth the price of admission. It's the best $14.99 I've spent in a long time.

A lot of them seem to be joining this discord: https://discord.gg/hR3GfQY
---
I'd rather start with 11 and add more as needed than the alternative of starting with enough for the launch flood and having 50% of the servers dead in 2 months like every MMO.
---
this was asked in elwynn forest earlier
---
This is my take on it...
---
I want to see what they can do first hand and I want to see how far I can push them. 
---
I'm in it for the challenge of it.
---
What negative experience have you had with Brazilians to have you think that? I haven't had a bad experience with them.
---
Even if i agreed with you 100% on this. Blizzard shouldnt lie to us anyway dont you think? Because they clearly said that there would always be a human reviewing a ban/silence which is clearly not the case.
---
What’s layering? Sorry
---
Well, how would you describe your personality?
---
From what I've gathered it's not the streamers that people don't want, it's the childish fanbase screaming ASMONGOLD ASMONGOLD LOOK AT MEEEE that everyone wants to avoid.
---
Warlock 40 so stronk
---
Alot harder to organize . I'm definitely dodging streamers but if soda is horde and asmon is alliance and they set up battles ... they will be epic
---
I just want you to tell me how their data ended up telling them that 20k EU PvP'ers would be left standing for phase two.
---
"Why do people not like the font?" Coming from a guy who uses a font changer lol
---
Boomerang for good measure 👍🏼
---
While you shouldn't specifically join a server type to find ladies, I can't dis it too much given I know many many couples who came together because of an MMO. Me included.
---
thalnos gonna get culturally enriched
---
This seems to be one of the current big threads discussing it:

---
Yeah, you summed up really well what I was trying to say :)
---
And now Pacific realms are the official East Coast American realms.  Come on over boys, we understand.
---
Whitemane Alliance represent!
---
Sometimes the realm will have queues. How many people do you think a 3k concurrent cap server supports. It’s a lot more than 3000.
---
People still have to farm for tokens too. If someone buys a token with money, someone out there still has to pay gold to get it.
---
I've uploaded a new version with highlight to quest items added, go check it out :)
---
Well there’s 9 NA servers so Blizzards expect to have 30k concurrent players after a 2 months when they disable layering.
---
"Layering is totally better than server merges, guys! Blizzard knows best!!!1!!"
---
I would like to point a one flaw in this pole. It represents the reddit community, so when you look at europes language demographics, the english numbers will be disproportionatly higher than reality since a lot, like really a lot of europeans (at least for the french) almost don't speak english so highly doubt that they are visiting this subreddit as much as english speakers.
---
Spoiler Alert: Almost every online community where anonymity is possible, or easy to achieve, in this current point in society is going to be inherently toxic at launch, and for a good bit post-launch.
---
You have all of the streamer fans, the RMTers competing to earn a paycheck, and people who take the game far too seriously. 
---
FFXIV is probably one of the main exceptions because you dont have an incentive for an alt or troll character for the most part.
---
Isn’t there an option manually select what game you are playing to show in the discord window? I do this for a lot of NoSteam games and odd ones that don’t normally show.    
---
Or does the description just say “World of Warcraft”?
---
Imagine thinking layering is going to get any better with so few servers per region.
---
I didn’t raid and I was playing pvp casually. I played a rogue so I could get away with the gear I had. Never stepped foot in mc, bwl, aq, naxx. But I still remember a player seeing me and a friend told him I was a good pvper. You can pvp casually and enjoy it, well at least I did lol you won’t be doing crazy 1v3’s but you’ll do fine.
---
&gt; same shit 50 times
---
&gt; low effort
---
Theres a difference between Quantity and Quality. 
---
The point i’m making is that mods cant tell the difference between a low effort post and a good one that they just end up removing both
---
Yep. Will for sure be rolling on Fairbanks. It’s a Sleeping Giant. Should have less of a Meme-boi population.
---
all of the replies to my message suck so i made this message
---
They are impolite in gaming and are generally trolly.
---
I’ve dealt with them numerous times in retail. Being a tank and refusing to do anything in a dungeon by bugging out combat and just sitting there till everyone leaves.
---
Red ridge*
---
Ah fair enough . Forgot how it worked .
---
Zandalar Tribe, Lucifron, Sulfuron, Everlook.
---
I don't quite agree.
---
Word, thank you for explaining.
---
Keep it simple, they'll annoucne the sever they'll be playing on, just dodge it. Thats your chance to ensure your server is \*streamer\* free, the streamers not playing on Asmon or Sodas server wont have a large enough impact. Just like back in the day if you roll a bad rng server compared to the amount of players you have on your faction you just have to roll with and enjoy it (I know i enjoyed my time as a 3% Alliance vs 97% horde) or to reroll on another server. If you know about the streamer servers, you have the decision to dodge it, if you don't bad luck :).   
---
Sadly the server they pick will be a sess pull of shittyness, I hope everyone who sees the server name will dodge it, even people who want to be there and gank them and ruin there \*time\* (you wont lol) will not really get the best experience they can get from Classic WoW. Just do whats best and not play on their server, you have other options.
---
Not from latin america but many people on this reddit fought for language servers in eu. So you have my support if there is a petition!
---
Note, that according the poll; only 4% reported they will be speaking Portuguese on release.
---
We appreciate the follow through from our BR friends and while I don't speak for everyone obviously, I welcome them to the server with open arms and am looking forward to building a community with them.
---
20-40ms more
---
Dude why make it another server when it can literally just be a checkbox in the settings? It doesn't have to affect anybody else at all. We had this option in retail for ages! People could just turn the new models off if they wanted.
---
Naxx is wotlk
---
~100ms. Playable but noticeable. Definitely a downgrade if you’re used to a silky 15ms.
---
Some people are extremely gullible, so yes. There are still people who believe Blizzard when they claim layering will be gone by phase 2.
---
I agree that it takes more time than some classes to prepare. But double? If you think it doubles the time, you just have no idea what you’re talking about?
---
Latin America players don't want to play with Bazilians either.
---
*Stealth sound*
---
I have been open to the idea of a rp server, but I don't have a clue how to rp and the etiquette of it? Does anyone have any good resources to learn?
---
Most of the pvp you do likely won’t be 1v1
---
For sure. I’ve been subbed for a few months just for a chance at a beta invite, and to do some stress tests. I did a few hours on this one too and it’s well worth it. I would’ve paid $40 JUST for the weekend without even thinking twice, so people bitching about $15 is wild to me.
---
Look up the lore of the available races. Im pretty sure theres some good one on YouTube if you have the time.
---
I know it’s the right choice, but I’m being tempted by whitemane’s milkers! But no Brazilians is the real goal
---
Maybe a pacific server lol. Only 3 servers on the east coast. Streamers, Brazilians and one server for the entire east coast....
---
Tbh, this looks like the sharding in retail so it's probably a joke bashing "layering"
---
There were 89 US servers on launch day in 2004, even 40 isn't enough, but it's certainly a lot better.
---
Lots of people shouting "layering sucks" due to this.  But this is clearly a bug since clearly you should always be on the same layer as your current party.
---
Im fueled by challenge. Group leveling isnt as difficult. 
---
Raiding is impossible solo, so i group up.
---
Honestly, Id prefer 20 man MC runs from my first run onwards than the 40 man cluster fuck of easy that is MC in 1.12. 
---
Was the same in real vanilla too, By AQ launch we werent consistently doing Ony, so we could take a 5 man group and do it ourselves, if we so choose. 5 man Ony at level 60 is so much more fun than 40 man ony in prebis.
---
I posted that as a joke bc ignorant people in the US sometimes chant ‘ENGLISH ONLY USA’
---
Troll for horde
---
Dwarf for alliance
---
I've thought about doing the reverse: using Bethesda's Creation Kit to recreate vanilla Azeroth. I'd like to start somewhere small, of course, like just Northshire Valley. I'd also do what I can to implement WoW's lack of loading screens, so Northshire Abbey and Echo Ridge Mine are just part of the outdoor cells with different lighting. Stuff like that.
---
Even bugged moments like this aside, it's insane that if you're in a five man group for a dungeon and want to trade an item with someone in org/IF that isn't in your group before heading to the dungeon, most of the time you will have to drop group and invite that person to a new group to even see them standing next to you beside the mailbox.
---
I think your perspective is pretty fucked up.
---
All I wanted was the opportunity to NOT play with streamers. The streamers gave me that opportunity, not because they had to, but because it was the courteous thing to do. I am grateful to them for doing that. They were the only ones with the power to guarantee my ability to play on a server without streamers, and they made it happen. I can find NOTHING to complain about.
---
Too bad streamers aren't joining Thalnos. Wherever they go they'll have hoards of people to play and interact with. I doubt they'd even realize half the server doesn't speak English for months.
---
Just depends on what time you’re available. I think you’ll be fine. I’ve done the opposite (play east coast live west coast) my whole time playing WoW pretty much and don’t really have an issue.
---
G E K O L I N I S E E R D
---
You look like Gollum at Orodruin
---
Most horde are UD
---
Except the devs literally said they would be doing that.
---
C’mon man - just go on the App Store and loook for meme makers.
---
No, that's 40ms on top of what you're already getting on an eastern server. Most will be between 70-80ms depending were on the east coast you are total.
---
Light bless you, exactly what I needed :)
---
I use this one: https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/cat160.html
---
Cheers :)
---
&gt; If you think it doubles the time, you just have no idea what you’re talking about?
---
It takes a good amount of time, maybe not double, but it wasn't meant to be a literal interpretation. 
---
Stop being so hyperbolic.
---
Imagine this happening during a world boss.
---
You aren't wrong but you know how it goes "I'm on top the bank / in front the AH". Not really necessary to always invite but with layering now you might as well.
---
It feels like an excuse for them to have as few servers as possible. Does anyone else feel that?
---
actually, that link expired. we'll need an unlimited use invite
---
Damn right! I was happy just to get to login on Thursday. The fact they are giving players the weekend is super awesome. It's like we are finally getting a game we have been dreaming/hoping/begging to be able to play again and someone gives you a shot, but your like... $7.50?... No thanks!
---
Party frames don't work. Under Unitframes, in General Options there's a tab called "Disabled Blizzard Frames" Untick the ones you want to show

When you're hired by Blizzard to create a dwarven head model but you can't use crop tool.

Whether you lose them to their mum making them go carry groceries, their wife forcing them to feed their infant, or a power outage in their area, you never know when it can get super duper hard.
---
Who is he guy in the middle?
---
Eh, there will be alot of orcs
---
Heh i see. Still an odd situation. I guess you're used to your side of the hemisphere being all amerimens and canadians, so language servers didn't cross your mind. I hope you get them though!
---
Hello hunter bugs?
---
The only reason they aren't being honest about layering being permanent is likely because it would be bad PR and most people wouldn't even bother paying for the first month.
---
It's pretty sad that private servers are objectively more blizz-like than a blizz-made version.
---
Nah.
---
It's annoying if you are hardcore pvper tho. Ping matters, even in wow
---
But like... is he wrong?
---
Yeah, no shit sherlock.
---
Wish this was an east coast server.
---
Why not Herod? What are the streamers planning to do?
---
They actually dont know.
---
Right now they are open to TBC or Classic+ for future content if classic does well. Its down to the community to discuss and decide what we want.
---
No, but then we wouldn't need layering either?
---
Not me. Seems too “Meme-ish”
---
Fairbanks seems like it’ll have a more mature population.
---
The community did not decide that, Blizzard did. It is absolutely NOT a necessary evil, it's completely unnecessary and people need to stop defending this shit.
---
1 race having 25% stun resist is a horrible reason to not go rogue
---
"They're sending people that have a lot of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. Their rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."
---
The real quote for those interested
---
It was extremely easy. I think a lot of people would be surprised. I'll try it out in a VM if you end up posting it on the sub.
---
Between this bullshit, the multiple bugs I found literally within 20 minutes of playing last night, there's an increasingly high chance I'm just not going to play this game. I'll keep playing private servers if this garbage isn't fixed.
---
It is an issue, but if I wanted to play a rogue I would play it still if I picked the wrong faction and have to deal with orcs. It’s not THAT bad.
---
Both are true.
---
I leveled a Druid during WoD with a friend, farming dungeon finder the whole way. We eventually got accustomed to bracing for a more difficult run if we saw "-Quel'Thalas" at the end of our group members names.
---
They announced 11 servers in NA.
---
What's wrong with Tips? I watch his videos and streams. He seems like a perfectly cool dude.
---
Its actually really sad tbh..
---
https://youtu.be/e3Rb9mIOivI
---
It is important to mention that the Brazilian community is not as big as they think it is, it will probably be around 5-10% of the realm's pop
---
With the coke can? Sodapoppin.
---
Have any luck getting party frames to show?  I couldn't find them anywhere.
---
Why is that a horrible reason? Is it not a big deal?
---
There's only 11 servers and hundreds of thousands of players, the population is going to be more than healthy no matter what server you pick.
---
This, its not like you are going to melt if you read a sentence in spanish once in a while, just ignore it.
---
Just play what seems fun to you
---
They did, and then they changed it. And people are still gullible enough to believe layering won't last forever.
---
Oh, righto then. Your comment was about the spawn so I thought you missed the part about losing his group.
---
DISGUST!!! remove layering and sharding!
---
My god thank you.
---
Ya'll have some weird fetishes.
---
Unless they add way more servers, layering won't go away. It can't go away or each server will be so ram packed full it'll be impossible to play.
---
Add more servers Blizzard.
---
Clearly not working as intended though is it.  The dude didn't even leave his party.
---
Ah, I misinterpreted the word “double” to actually mean double. 
---
How ridiculous of me. You poor, stupid troll. Have a nice life. :)
---
Honestly people are really overestimating the amount of Brazilians. They really are going to be a max like 5% of the population and most of them speak English too. In my opinion, it adds a bit more of fun to Thalnos whether it be hunting them, making memes, or seeing Portuguese curse words in world chat.
---
I don't remember soul drain being that hard to time.  20-30 shards takes literally 5-10 minutes tops.
---
Why do streamers ruin the experience? (Honest question)
---
This is the last test. Stop being in denial, they aren't going to fix layering.
---
Two friends are staying for release week.
---
We're going to mark every Lvl-Up and every death on this map with small stickers.

---
Really hoping Grobbulus doesn't get bogged down with non-RPing PvPers.
---
Yeah, I realize this now. I was naive.
---
Ah righto, cheers matey. 
---
so who has the orange wig? I thought that was him
---
&gt; A sizable percentage of the playerbase knows what they're getting into and has already proven that they love the game before it even releases
---
Oh they 'know', but they don't 'remember' how much they'll miss some of those QoL changes that they have come to know and love.
---
The only portion of the playerbase that actually knows what theyre getting into AND remembers it to this day are the ones currently active on pservers. 
---
If anything, the 'vast majority of people' who try vanilla will realize how padded for time it is for every little thing you have to do and remember that his was how you made money in the era when Vanilla launched: make an mmo, waste as much possible player time in it such that they need as much time as possible to get bored, rake in sub cash while they do that.
---
It sucks they have to put some statement out like this and I do feel bad for the good side of the community. It's unfortunate the BR community has such as bad rep dating back to before WoW days. I think they are making the right calls and looking forward to what will come of it.
---
Why is it better to create new servers rather than merge the dead ones?
---
Die gibt es bestimmt
---
Laughs in PvE.
---
&gt; Ah, I misinterpreted the word “double” to actually mean double.
---
If you read the first post I made that lead up to that you would have understood the context. 
---
I take it reading comprehension is not your forte?
---
when they roll out TBC, I can stab blood elfs in their stupid faces
---
This is most likely unintended as it's only when I have my bow in hand and not when I have either melee weapon or no weapon in hand :(
---
I'm east coast and all the test servers have been west coast if server time is anything to go by. I average 60-80 ms but never noticed any issues.
---
&gt;Made my first meme after playing the stress test
---
Wife: Wait, so there's no achievements? 
---
Me: Nope. Pretty cool, huh? 
---
Wife: So what's the point?
---
[ME](https://gfycat.com/newglitteringhorsemouse)

This sub is underexaggerating if anything. Layering is detrimental to the ENTIRE damn point of bringing back vanilla. I mean, seriously, what's the point? Right now even private servers are objectively better, and that's pathetic.
---
There were less but they added more so quick that 89 is what they roll with. If there were 89 servers on launch day they wouldn’t have had the issues they did since that would’ve been more than enough servers to handle the load of launch day.
---
Why is it better to create new servers rather than say merge a couple low pop ones?
---
Aww boo hoo. Stop being a corporate apologist.
---
I was about to spam Huehuehuehue and then saw it was mentioned in that post. 😂
---
It is important to mention that the Brazilian community is not as big as you guys think it is, it will probably be around 5-10% of the realm's pop
---
Yes but no one is going to actually be able to tell the difference between a 80ms and 120ms.  Both are damn low pings especially considering what everyone's ping in 04 was.
---
There’s just no option for full screen. You have to play windowed mode. It doesn’t affect gameplay at all.

---
How do you work that one out chum?
---
Layering is going to be turned off though. The point of layering is to compensate for the population being crunched into starter zones. Once the population spreads out the intent^tm is to turn it off and not use it anymore.
---
Blizzard confirmed that there will be no layering after phase 1, and that's when the world bosses start coming out. So world bosses won't be an issue.

They are just for the squirrel. She's catched a cold. ;)
---
Everyone is really trying to have a nice community for all, every guild has agreed to a blacklist (so if you see someone being bad we wont be nice to them at all.) and to speak english only in general and trade chat. 
---
We're not the azaralon scrubs that think they own the game for themselves. 
---
If ya'll are open to give a chance for all of us to clean our reputation, im sure you wont be let down. 
---
We welcome all of you to Thalnos :)
---
Short version. Engineers can make bombs, grenades and gadgets that are SUPER useful in pvp and pve. Anyone with engineering is going to have a leg up against the competition in pvp and the damage meters in pve.
---
At the same time I can totally see the higher ups going "but what is the lowest estimate?" Cause that MIGHT be the most cost efficiant option
---
Thank you and you are welcome :)
---
Hopefully not too much. I'm very tempted to pick Atiesh over Pagle and Mankrik. I'll probably play Mankrik though. Screw PvP realms, the pvp server cultists, spanish speakers, streamers, and BRs can all fuck right off with their drama and cancers.
---
Not very GDPR sadly..
---
Okay! Makes sense. Thanks for the help, appreciate it!
---
lol can't relate to this more if i tried.
---
It works for runescape.
---
Thanks, mate!
---
What is that addon for the health bars? (New player)
---
Make player and guild names be reserved across multiple servers.
---
Nah, you're full of shit.  
---
I played lock classic-&gt; Cata. 
---
Multiple server firsts with guild, raided 4+ times a week.
---
Rank 14 warlock.
---
Saying soul shards require significant effort sounds like something a bfa kiddie would say. Tenwalks is absolutely right.  At most, the bag space crunch is a *minor* inconvenience.
---
They needed a cross platform way to pick up on games, realistically how would they get it if not for filename checking? The only options would be checking for a window called Game Name (obviously false positives there), a set of hardcoded paths for supported games (massively subject to change and would be immediately out of date), or picking up on running processes with known filenames.
---
I will be if you stop being a crybaby who wants to have his cake and eat it too.
---
Stop with this dumbass apologist bullshit. They aren't testing or working out bugs anymore. This is it. This is the game. Stop trying to make excuses for Blizzard's bullshit
---
Being proactive and starting up a new server early will help get that server a healthy stable population, since it will be during the time most players are starting fresh characters anyways.
---
A server going dead takes time.  During that time, players are leaving and re-rolling on other servers.  Even if you merge two servers, you aren't getting any NEW players, just combining the leftover players of the two dead servers.  Sure, the merger may help a bit, but the damage has already been done.
---
Because I don't want public chat channels to turn into twitch spam?
---
Plenty of videos on yt that should give you a good idea of how rp works.
---
But just a few point that need to be mentioned:
---
1. Rp is optional, even on Rp servers. Just don't disturb other roleplayers when they are roleplaying and you're fine
---
2. You should have a lore friendly name. So nothing like SlayerXx, Ikillyou, Arthasz or Illlidan
---
3. If you want to really get into rp, come up with a back story.
---
4. Rp is performed in /s, /e and /y. Channels like trade chat or general chat are ooc (out of character)
---
why i come here. ty!
---
Wait until the day after classic launches and check where they ended up.
---
Was Twisting Nether an RP-PVP server? I think that's where I ended up. We are all Grob Mob now.
---
&gt; Im sure it will work out.
---
It's hilarious seeing comments like this for years after years and it almost never "works out". Come on man, I'm not being "doom and gloom" I'm being realistic whereas you're being idealistic.
---
I certainly wouldn't hang out with my friends on a public WoW  server Discord.
---
No need to get so triggered when someone points out some stupid logic. I get that you're a full-fledged member of the Classic cargo-cult, but chill out dude. It's okay to point out dumb logic.
---
Got a source on any of those claims? Articles from those industry vets? Tweets? 
---
There’s dozens of low pop realms on retail which haven’t been merged since the merges that occurred during tbc and WotLK because it’s a logistical nightmare. I find the PR angle very strange considering classic has barely been marketed at all.
---
I used clique for years and years. Great add-on. Loaded it in the stress test and it works. Then I decided to Google mouseover macros and it's so easy to make them. Just copy and paste. I deleted clique shortly after. I'm a mouseover macro convert.
---
Can you imagine them having a real job, fired on day 1.
---
"It's just a beta! Blizz wouldn't release azerite gear in such a poor state!"
---
"It's just a beta! Blizz wouldn't release classes with half their rotations gutted!"
---
I was with you until that last comment. I have no confidence that it will be fixed before launch, considering it's been happening since layering was implemented.
---
I'm starting to understand how older people feel now. The world changes around you, you don't like the newer stuff (fortnite etc) and the relevance of what you do like slowly fades away (MMO's). 
---
Truly Feelsbadman.
---
There is a lot of room for theft, trading like that. You are right though hopefully something is already planned to deterrent users/farmers from spamming.
---
I have taken a few economics classes from University, unfortunately I really disliked Macro/Micro Eco so I only put the minimum amount of effort in the class to make a 3.0 (B). 
---
If we take out the annoyance from the spamming what is the actual harm (economically speaking). Isn’t it just a redistribution of wealth since the money (gold) on Classic is a closed loop?
---
What did blizzard do to prevent gold farmers from spamming? 
---
I know they opened the loop to exchange USD for Membership (gold). But I am pretty sure spamming wasn’t an issue at that time.
---
I can make out some Spanish. With Portuguese, I have no fucking clue what they're saying.
---
Because the entire east coast is trying to decide if we’re going to cram in the one east coast server, or deal with latency issues while there’s 2 other servers created for the east coast that are unusable. 
---
One server is not enough for the east coast.
---
https://willitclassic.com/ just so you have a link for what chipmunk mentioned. I've had good luck looking for stuff I know I need on there.
---
First guild to sign is literally named “Autism”... Suuuure
---
Three years later when layering is still in the game, I bet you'll be saying "Nah guys, Blizzard totally promised they'll remove it next patch. Stop being so negative!"
---
Aight if that's the case I had no idea it was that huge. I'll check it out. Ty
---
he is joking
---
No you don't understand, classic bad ion good.
---
geographical location isnt race, the fuck
---
How are you already playing Classic when it's not out yet?
---
^this sums up. I would only want to add that engineering is more a gold sink then profession for earning (not that you can't earn with it), but it is by far the most fun profession to have.
---
Top tier meme. Just re watched this movie a couple nights ago and its probably one of the greatest of all time. And directed by Ben Stiller, like wtf. 10/10 though
---
Love my vanilla models but would be nice to have the option to change it.
---
You don't have to worry about that.  As long as there's only one server option for RPPvP, it'll be evenly split between eastern and western timezones.
---
And based on recent survey, faction ratio will be almost 1:1 and total population nearly as much as other big PvP servers.
---
Survey: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BTfTNjcThmoe_47K8mbf8IffpfK0XrBCFWE4X5X97wY/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#
---
Ok but what’s the alternative here? More servers would just mean dead realms within 6 months. If Blizz sticks to their word that they’ll remove layering a few weeks in, it is the best way to handle the launch. We don’t really have a choice but to trust that they’ll do it right.
---
I am too, layer is the same shit, and Blizz are turning it up to 11.
---
A streamer ?! GET HIM !!! /s
---
Depends on how many players the let in on those servers before opening more.
---
Whats fun in a rp server? Whats different
---
Fucking Russians
---
&gt; Did he report it? Layering isn’t supposed to work this way. When it happens like this and isn’t reported it’s not doing any good.
---
How do you know? Seems like Blizz wants to do anything they can to ruin classic. 0 pvp servers for eu eng and then this.
---
Thanks, holy crap that was even worse than I remembered lol. Not just "most of them are rapists &amp; drug dealers", but straight up "they're sending their rapists &amp; drug dealers - period."
---
They just know that proly more than 80% of early playerbase will drop after a month leaving servers dead so instancing is the only way.
---
Whomever reported this comment, while I enjoy the irony, should understand that this comment does not break any rules.
---
Do you have the link to the website you got it from?
---
in 2015 WoW had ~5.6 million subscribers. 
---
(a far cry from today's 1.7 million)
---
These numbers i believe exclude china, which is irrelevant to the following analysis:
---
Let's be generous and assume that the entire United States only accounts for 50% of the playerbase. 
---
Let's then be extra generous and assume that the other 50% are ALL in Europe.
---
The USA has one official language, english. EZPZ.
---
Europe has... TWENTY FOUR official languages across its member nations today.
---
Making a server for each one would be retarded, and the ask is retarded too. 'Public outcry' of 200-2k people for a server JUST for their language is absolutely insane.
---
You want to spread 2.8 million people across 24 different realms? Or maybe you cherry pick your favorite 6 Languages in Europe so you get English, German, French, Spanish, Swedish, and idk, Italian?
---
Then you get to spread 2.8 million subscribers across 6 different realms.
---
You'd end up with 1 server with potential pop of 1.4 million (the half of all those people willing to play on the English server)
---
and 5 servers with a pathetic potential pop of ~250k. 
---
AND THATS BASED ON 2015 NUMBERS.
---
THIS IS A DUMB THING TO ASK FOR.
---
As long as they all stay on one server away from everyone else I dont care what they do.
---
Imagine trusting a lawyer snake.
---
I always wanted to play a Discipline or Holy Priest that only wore grays as a sign of poverty and asceticism. I'm thinking that would be a toughrow to hoe in the RP, though.
---
knowing that the average age of the mod team is aged 22, you know they only want memes. These mods highprobably voted on the Meme candidacy of Trump.
---
Oh damn that’s not good. This is the first I’ve gotten to actually see laying screw someone over in the middle of combat

So don't play Classic and go play on a private server. Layering is happening whether you like it or not so those are your 2 choices.
---
Because they (Ion) talked about how it should work and used this exact situation as an example of it not happening.
---
Someone is bored today 😂
---
Every stress test it has felt like cities are in a separate phase than the rest of the layer you come from. I don’t know if they were trying to make the cities always feel full and messed up or what, but it sucks. “The whole world is one layer do someone you see the same people from zone to zone” doesn’t seem to work that way.

Warrior is always fighting an uphill battle regardless of your gear.
---
I'm hoping Blizz will have a window where people can 'transfer' off the high pop servers to the newly created ones before they're unlocked for everyone to reserve names on them. Most likely, Blizz will just add new servers willy nilly and you'll be fucked if you want to reserve a name on a new server.  
---
If they were smart, they'd have the name's stay locked to the account for the name reservation time so you can freely move the name about to any server as needed.
---
Not bad, TFA was dogshit though

They won't remove layering as it currently stands. When will you people stop being sheep????

---
He never said that
---
By that point the numbers will have stabilized and they will either add new servers or not. Simple. Phase 2 isn’t going to be week 1 or even month 1.

Whenever you befriend a healer that will be willing to keep your ass alive while you go smash

Have fun farming soul shards every minute of playtime then being demanded to summon 3/4 of a raid to drain your inventory right before first pull.
---
I'm going to go for "Ion and his team of yes-men suck ass at making video games and so they fuck this up just like they fucked up retail."
---
Thank-you for the response! Really helped with my decision, the first part about priest racials has been on my mind a lot trying to make this decision, didnt wanna get flamed for being a Night Elf priest - knowing that druid healing is definitely a viable option, and the play style does sound interesting - I think I'll be rolling a druid for sure.
---
dont think I have one
---
If they could somehow program out ganking, pvp could be alot more interesting. I actually enjoy fair 1v1 open world pvp. 
---
But it's nothing close to that, so no ty. 
---
Apparently unpopular opinion, but rolling on PvE vastly increases your chances of avoiding assholes also.
---
You could and you’d probably be generally right depending on the state and city they’re from. A lot of Americans are assholes and I certainly wouldn’t call somebody racist for thinking that.
---
Where was this confirmed?
---
Really? Fairbanks seems more troll to me. Who or where even is that in WoW? All I can think of is Fairbanks, Alaska when I hear it

---
Unless you are in a highly skilled highend guild i doubt you going to rush through the content
---
Test server is live until Monday
---
its not about the cost, its about people not liking empty servers. Do you honestly think enough people in Germany, who don't already know and use english every day, alone will play vanilla wow to warrant having their own server? If you do, maybe take a 2 week break from marijuana.
---
A mixed language server with high pop continuously is going to be preferable to all players vs specialized language servers with 6-7 people on in your level bracket.
---
On top of the fact that he’s a Warrior. 
---
Warriors getting fucked over while leveling. Feels good to be back.
---
I was mostly memeing, cause I assume that in the communities where LA and BR etc congregate it's been an issue for a while. It's just a big thing in the English speaking areas now that we realized what we're getting into again with BR claiming a server lol.
---
To be clear, I wouldn't mind a language barrier, and actually enjoy the challenge and I guess you could call it "purity" of communicating through stuff only in game like marking things etc. The problem with BR communities are the toxicity that comes with them. I've never cared to look too deeply into why it is, but just in my experience of basically every game that's had a BR population, they've been some of the most toxic, terrible, lazy players I've ever had to deal with. It's just a culture thing, which I've heard a few people explain they specifically enjoy fucking with people who like to play games well and just be shit at the game on purpose etc, but I don't know how much I really believe that cause it's just so foreign to me to want to be bad at a game lol.

theres already a *large* grob server https://discord.gg/KbjsuwH
---
I'd argue that runescape is also a theme park mmo, even more vastly than WoW.
---
In RuneScape you can train your Agility or your Fishing in any order, but you're still bound by your Agility Courses or your Fishing Spots. You go to those spots and level-up your skills. Those are the attractions of your theme park.
---
They're not bound by leveled zones, but to maximize your exp, you still need to go to the highest level hotspot of your skill.
---
RuneScape also tells a story, or rather, many stories, using the Quest system. In game updates, some of those stories get a sequel to continue the quest chain. Same as in WoW, with stories told by quest chains. End-game raids are all separate like the RuneScape quests, the story of Onyxia has nothing to do with any Naxxramas content.
---
You can do whatever you want in RuneScape, true, as long as it has to do with an attraction the world offers and if you meet the level requirements.
---
Same in WoW, but with less options. You can train in combat, but do a herb or mining run, play the auction house, do some crafting, or finish a dungeon or raid with your friends.
---
And both the skills in RuneScape and WoW feed into each other. While in RuneScape you might train your Herblore to make a potion for a quest, rewarding you with an item for being better in combat or Prayer, the same is true in WoW. You tailor your dress to become better in combat, which feeds into quicker leveling, going to higher level places, because have better loot, then sell the loot so you can buy your mount. Which again decreases time traveled between combat.
---
I've made my point. Have you changed your view on RuneScape? Of course, you may reply to me with a delta Δ if you think I'm right. :)
---
The other three servers in the stickied poll here have more alliance than horde, mankrik is the only one with more horde than alliance.
---
Are you going to pvp mainly or pve?
---
A pvp rogue needs up to 24% hit to reach dual wield cap. But that is all you have to worry about. You just show up and do dps. 
---
A warlock will constantly have to farm soul shards and always be demanded to summon lazy/slow players. The soul shards farming gets a lot of talk because it s a huge time sink required of the class. But their pvp hit cap is only 3% but in PvE it is 16%.
---
Whatever happened to when it's ready™
---
&gt; Whine on a forum they dont read
---
They litterally lurk both this forum and other medias. Its part of why we have classic and why through its development course, theyve changed a lot of decisions after communities requests.
---
SO yes.. Being outspoken and keeping them to their word. 
---
Not that hard to grasp. Doesnt mean it guarantees they'll keep their word.. but atleast they'll be publically fucking demolished for it if that ends up being the case.
---
How many players fit in a server? 5-10k? Do I think there's gonna be much mpre 50-100k active *players* a few months in? No
---
lmao they suck. Not like us true gamers at all. Time to rise up
---
That's exactly what they're doing to you if you want to avoid them.
---
Oh absolutely I loved that factor. I wasn't digging at it 😖

They're just raising awareness where it's needed most
---
Yeah that doesn't sound very realistic lol, I think blizzard is underestimating the long time demand for this severly because Bobby Kotick a moneygrubbing kike that doesn't understand games at all and only sees numbers on a paper.
---
It's the *why* that matters. You can criticize other cultures, but if you think it's because of some genetic predisposition, like the “warrior gene” for example, then you're most definitely thinking racistly.
---
This is the Discord our guild is currently using for Whitemane as well!
---
You said it yourself. Dead servers.
---
I'm just super tired if the constant circle-jerky comments we see in this subreddit. It's frustrating af. I want classic to succeed so other stuff has potential. I want every game to be good because games are amazing. 
---
I'm so tired of people looking for a reason to be upset and not just play the game. Just give it hell and hope, maybe against odds, that the problems we find get fixed timely and it doesn't hurt us playing the game. But if we go in with shit attitudes I don't have much hope.
---
You have to consider that those bleeds replace the ability to use the Manual Crowd Pummeler for cats. Also, the bleeds don't do anything for tanks. Bear threat is still better than Warrior threat in Vanilla even without them.
---
I have played with people on regional servers on retail and some have been some of the best players I've played with and others the absolute worst. I am hopeful that the BR community will try to set themselves up as something better in WoW:Classic, especially with servers actually having a "community" now (since no xrealm stuff).
---
Hoping this was a manual layering on Blizzards end with them testing something. If not we're in for a scuffed as fuck launch boys.
---
So is that a 13” or 15”? There’s a big difference since the 15” has a discrete graphics card.
---
Grow a sense of humor
---
It’s crazy, I’d rather end up on a server with all the streamers than end up on a server with the Brazilians. It sounds so racist but I’ve had not one good experience.
---
Dude you need to turn down your brightness/gamma or something....
---
What do they do?
---
A lot of people are going to have a warrior alt. Warriors are vary gear dependent and need to constantly update their gear. So having a main character to fund this makes leveling a Warrior so much easier.
---
I hear its around tier 2 that warrior scaling really kicks off and the class feels amazing against other classes.
---
Warrior is first on everyone's lists because of that endgame scaling, but theirs a lot to endure before then. That includes all of phase 1 and at least half of phase 2.
---
Or you are severely overestimating it.
---
It’s not like they can’t add more servers. Also 50k active players is not the same as 50k concurrent. You understand the difference yes?
---
Usual PvP rules apply. If there is a PvP solution, it's allowed. RP rules also apply. If your name isn't RP friendly, it will be reported. You can also be reported for griefing RP events by spamming emotes, and generally making a nuisance of yourself. This would be more oriented towards griefing your own faction, as if you try to crash a RP event in a contested zone you'll more than likely have that entire group camping you.
---
So? After that it's just cruise control with very short raid weeks. This might be accurate if he was going for R14.

---
You can search and choose an online-printing service for your country that fits your needs.
---
Same problem here.
---
For real. They have 2 weeks between early character creation and launch to add as many as they think they need. They could double the number of servers on Monday afternoon if demand is higher than they expected.
---
Why don't people want to play in the same realm as streamers?
---
Hahahaha what? I love how you dismiss soulstone and healthstones as “when they feel like doing that” and then imply that I’m saying that the imp buffs “are the best advertisement” when I listed soulstone and healthstones first — which for the record are considered top tier utility for dungeons AND raids. 
---
As others have continued to point out below —your arguments lack logic and reek of absurd bias and stupidity. Know that you typed all this out for people to laugh at you and think of you as a moron.
---
Woah woah woah your saying that they had a TEST before launch to see if any bugs came up so they could fix them before release?  But what am I supposed to do with my pitchfork and #nochanges boner?
---
Yeah our choice who we associate with except when a large chunk of the population you have to work with is them. Not to mention the fact chat will be spammed with Jaja and other languages or some streamer join asmon layer garbage. There is no positive with these servers. Shit sucks.
---
"sad" is the word I would use.
---
Id argue the dota and wow classic playerbase are rather different
---
And back in vanilla.
---
It works perfectly for OSRS.  Which has a much larger player base than the original game which is rs3 now.  74.99% fail.  75% pass.  It’s a ridiculously good way to see what way the active player base is swaying with content
---
That would be the end of world pvp in Azeroth.
---
Ours too
---
I'll believe it when I see it. Blizzard has trust to build and it seems a bit naive to take them at their word.
---
Lemons into lemonade right here.
---
Yeah I agree, faction balance is important
---
&gt; Yes, but it could take months for 1 Shaman to get 8 pieces of Earthfury,
---
Unless you guy stupidly lucky, yes.   However, the 5pc is also really good.   You won't be giving that up for some random cloth pieces.
---
Complain? Dude, what? The question is, why is Blizzard adamant on ruining Classic? I'd literally rather them not do it at all then ruin it. So no, I'm not bowing down to Blizzard and sucking their dick for Classic. I did that in the past. I'm going to hold them to their words, and be critical when they make monumental mistakes that defeat the entire point of classic in the first place.
---
Got it, avoid Thalnos at all costs.
---
&gt; Those servers aren't potentially going to die. They will. So will classic, retail, FF14, ESO, GW2. None of them are permanent. So just don't play anything cause you're going to lose your progress sooner or later.
---
The difference is, Blizzard's servers are 99.9% likely to be as permanent as you could ever actually care about, while your favorite private server could implode tomorrow.
---
Well, I think you get three names to reserve. So don't use all three on the 12th. Save one in case blizzard makes more servers available before lunch
---
This is false, hopefully you don't actually think this.
---
&gt; I’m glad people are finally starting to wake up
---
Ditto. The amount of times I was told "it's still X weeks to launch, they'll fix it" or "I know layering is not perfect, but I don't want for mobs to respawn" is pretty disheartening. If I want Classic, I want it done right. And Layering is as far from right as can be.
---
Ah I remember now, you have to pull a lever to get to him right? That’s funny they chose a minor boss for a server name
---
They don't owe shit.  But they shouldn't get to dictate where we play to avoid them.

There are far more of us than steamers, and we don't have to tolerate them if we don't want to.
---
We don't owe them shit either.
---
Stop actively searching out streamers and you will find out how little they matter. 
---
You guys care so much about these strangers. Just play the game.

Don't lose sleep over it. Layering will be in effect in the beginning, probably later too. Kind of hilariously stupid how people see some polling data on reddit of Spanish speaker or people from other countries that have 500 votes for a top server for them to congregate to that was polled in an isolated community, then that gets shared around on reddit and everyone on this sub decides, alright fuck that definitely not going there. Like you're going to join one of the 3 PvP EST time zones and it's going to be a hodge podge like no do you know how many other people are going to play on those servers that aren't from reddit or from reading a forum post? Get your head out of your asses
---
When will you people stop believing that blizzard is intentionally sabotaging classic? Stop being so paranoid, Jesus Christ.
---
If I remember right Asmondgold said he wanted to go PvE. I think only the big streamers should be avoided. Smaller streamers aren't going to be a problem, and many of those guys are pretty chill like def camp and kargoz.
---
Would not suprise me if he chooses one of them just to be a ass.
---
wow a keyboard, wish I had one of those you must be super rich.
---
Stop being such an asshole.
---
Yep you get to keep them so farm as much as you can now to get a headstart.
---
There's a setting specifically for if you want whispers to be displayed in-line or in a new tab if that's your only concern. By default, it will create a new chat tab for each user that whispers you and has their name on the tab.
---
Lol. I’m a loner anyways. I’ll play on a dead server. Doesn’t matter to me.
---
So, yes. I will be having the time of my life on Fairbanks, whether or not it’s populated, whether or not I get layered.
---
For instance, you can make 3 characters on one server, or 1 character of one server, and two on another server, or 1 character on 3 servers.  Max 3 characters, but multiple servers, if you choose so.
---
Thalnos is in no way safe from streamers. Only Staysafe has tweeted they aren't going Thalnos, but he's not the spokesman of all streamers, especially Asmongold. Asmongold has said he will go wherever he wants and won't announce it. If he goes Thalnos, that server will be a shitshow. Even if the brazillians "claimed" it.
---
The cities feel empty
---
Why are you stuck on the law still?  I used an analogy of something that is illegal in some places but not everywhere...I get it, why can't you let this part go?  I never said this is illegal everywhere or making any kind of statement about scalping other than a comparison to the tactic of ransoming off a name.  Also I couldn't care less what the streamers do or don't get I don't care about them I'm not a fanboy.  Blizzard already has plenty of checks in place to force scummy people to play nice this one isn't a huge deal.  Take whatever name you want I really don't care.  A million names will disappear and you know what?  I'll still have a name for my character.
---
Thanks, apparently I included the wrong link. Will fix later!
---
Really? Thanks, that sounds pretty cool.
---
That's the unfortunate conclusion I've came to.
---
I'm thinking about not playing classic anymore, it's extremely compromised.
---
Because of this kind of toxic behavior:
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/SuspiciousGorgeousFiddleheadsWow
---
Each individual person has their own reasons for disliking streamers and you will never get a general consensus reason
---
Yeah hidden room behind the wall. He’s got some legit lore to him, madseason talks about it in one of his lore videos. But yeah to have to choose between busty whitemane or dusty fairbanks... he is the only undead in the scarlet crusade I think, which is tight
---
oh its mr. white-power again
---
They "should" save, but make a backup just in case!
---
Maybe people don’t want to be told what server to play on?
---
Why can’t we pick which servers are the streamer servers?
---
That’s not a bad use case then at all - it should work great for leveling and general use.
---
Thanks! I miss Linux.
---
They are not fucking with shit in tests anymore. Blizzard themself said in their announcement of the stress test: "We ask that players please log-in and play as much as possible during the first two hours of the test –   as that is when we’ll be actively monitoring for issues important to launch**."** 
---
People! Please stop giving excuses to Blizzard!
---
Thats basically trying to add feats of strength and cosmetics all at once.

Glad to see that horde and alliance is relatively close to 50/50. I was expecting everyone to roll alliance due to no belfs (i.e. horde = ugly)
---
But that doenst make any sense, if 100k people roll on the server and the player loss is 70% by phase 2. That still leaves 30k people on the server.
---
How the fuck are they ever going to fit 30k people into one server and what would ever incetivize people to swap to a new server or start there.
---
They need the servers to be there from the start.
---
common sense. Blizzard's reason for layering vs reality. They've stated layers will be capped at around actual vanilla server population sizes of 2.5k-5k. With the tiny number of servers we have, populations won't drop that low for more than a year if ever. Which means that if they drop layering, the servers will be massively overpopulated which destroys the classic experience. So the only solution is keep layering of open new servers and offer free transfers.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
It's pretty easy to tell which option they will go with, perma layering.
---
Belgian (flemish) alliance player looking for the server where my fellow country men will be rolling on.
---
people dont trust the streamers to follow the decision
---
Which is another reason why layering is absolutely ridiculous. They developed this new sharding tech that is actually worse than sharding the 1-10 zones would have been. 
---
Layering has to go.

Uhh I've had many games ruined by toxic BR players or just simply not speaking the same language as the people around me. Its pretty legit to want to avoid that...

id like updated characters models and graphics in general. but i'm cool with the old looking stuf cus the gameplay and rpg is way more important.
---
This is an idea I can get behind. I thought it was strange everyone saying we have to wait and see what server the streamers pick.
---
Umm no we can collectively come together and pick the server where streamers aren't welcome.

Didn't they already say they'll be watching the population and take steps if necessary too?

&gt; Most Euros in France and Germany who play online video games speak English well enough to navigate general chat and integrate into a guild that speaks their chosen language. 
---
No, most of them don't. I'm German, I've been playing MMORPGs since 1999 (EQ1, EVE, EQ2, WoW and many others over the years) on both, German language servers as well as international ones (EQ, EVE). Most German players now enough English to maybe function in text chat on a very basic level but when it comes to voice coms, that groups just got a whole hell of a lot smaller. It's simply not as fun to socialize in a language you have very low proficiency in. It's even worse for the French. The reality is that not having localized German and French servers would probably reduce the number of French and German language players by 80%. At least. So it makes good business sense for Blizzard to support those language communities.
---
&gt; If you are going to defend language specific servers, why not one for Spain or Italy or Poland? 
---
And I am defending language specific servers based on the size of the respective communities. There ARE Italian and Spanish retail servers and they're fucking dead. They cover a European population of almost 110 million yet don't can't even muster half the amount of players 66 million Frenchies do. It would make ZERO sense to have even one Spanish or Italian Classic server. It would be a ghost town. I doubt a Polish server would fare any better.
---
&gt; Why is there twice the english to german servers when germany has 20 million more people? If your answer to that is more people in Europe speak english than German...then you've just answered the question to your OP
---
Is there an argument somewhere? Why does this make German and French servers a mistake? There may be less German language players than English but they are still a huge group. In retail, the language split is (source: realmpop.com):
---
* 12% French
---
* 14% Russian
---
* 25% German
---
* 49% English + everyone else
---
I see absolutely no reason to not have French, Russian or German servers.
---
Really a kind thing from them, but we shouldn’t even be in this situation. Pls just give us more realms.
---
All this would serve to do is create a class hierarchy, split the population into "vanilla players" and tbc+ "babies". You can bet your butt that we'd end up seeing LFG messages like "LFM X dungeon, be geared and have Y vanilla flair cosmetic item".  
---
One of the best things about classic is the clean slate, so how about no :p
---
I dont think classic is getting a battle royale anyway
---
That was TBC. There are only two level 60 Engineering head pieces at level 60, both arrive with phase 4, and neither is especially good.
---
There’s a large alliance of English speaking alliance guilds rolling on Pyrewood. I really wouldn’t worry, there will be a mix of people from all over Europe on all the European servers and the general consumes seems to be that English will be spoken in general chat and separate channels will be made for Spanish etc...
---
So you base which guild is best for raiding pure on which side has the most players?
---
I would look more into the backgrounds of guilds advertising then just look at some online poll where people say which server they choose.
---
Not to mention that a lot of popular streamers haven't decided yet and could influence the ratio which means the data you use now is useless in a week or so.
---
That depends on how your communication skills are when you are in a group. Do you talk to people? Do you take orders? Blah blah blah
---

---
I've got an off-hand that I think shows up. When I get home in about an hour I'll try to remember to check.
---

It remembers your last choice. So if you were last on Classic it doesn’t revert to BfA.
---
eh, much easier not to step in the bad as lock than rogue.
---
"Blizzard knows what they are doing"
---
There will be much higher demand for Classic to Modern trading than for server trading.

Trading Classic Gold for Modern is the only way you can get WoW tokens for sub fees or legally buy Classic Gold with real money.

I misunderstood what you meant. I thought you were implying you could have three characters on three servers, so nine characters total. I see what you mean now, and you're correct. You can create one character on one server, and one on another, etc.
---
This isn't true at all. And if you ever did any calculations for different ranks of Healing Wave for example, you would know this.

With the amount of servers they announced? Good luck.
---
With so few servers you're either acknowledging the game is going to flop or layering isn't going anywhere anytime soon. We're going to have mega layer servers for many many months.
---
Blizzard said no layers phase 2 because of world bosses. Mark my words, "layering" and "layering 2.0" is in. They're going to invent continent layering with world boss zones that are there own local area with no layers. Layering CAN'T go anywhere with how few servers there are, maybe some servers will "die" (doubtful) but you're telling me there's not going to be massive servers when there's only 3 fucking PvP servers.
---
We got played
---
Can someone link me a classic version for this addon? Or does the 1.12.1 version work?
---
This is how retail sharding works. All these reports of people spontaneously swapping layers or not being in the same layer as party members seem like major bugs.
---
Ah ok!

Is there anything else thats good/useful that makes it worth going for anyway? Maybe something worth selling so that I can make some gold. :)?

Ariba Ariba!  Muerte Ragnoros!
---
.. am i saying it right?  I want to be a bueno spanish raid leader!

And im over im SEA dealing with 250 or 350 ms servers with their own pros and cons
---
No worries, there's enough layers for everyone!
---
I don't wanna RP, I want to play peacefully with my ~10 friends, but I want to gank shit up, and progress PvE. I am also afraid that the 2 EU PvP servers will be a nightmare.
---
Is this ok for an RPPVP realm?
---
I will be WELL ahead of the curve. Even a few of these streamers have literally hundred of thousands of followers. 
---
They can and will decide the fate of some servers. I'd rather not switch.

I get where you're coming from tho

From your post history you seem concerned so i'll take time answer.

From my gaming experience, they are really "clicky". And if you're not part of the click, you're garbage. They stick together and don't care about others, if you try to interact with them they make no effort to speak english, they are rude, will easily insult you and generally, they are just not really good at the games. 
---
Like, this week i played a game of league of legend, i got placed with a latam premade. They were not talking english, they started to feed, i tried my best to carry and communicate with them to come back and try to win. At the end they finally started to speak english but just to insult me and say that i suck while they were 0/5.
---
This represent literally every interaction that i ever had with latams. 
---
But hey dude i'm from Quebec (french canada) and we have the same reputation for the same reasons so i understand that it's obviously not everyone that is like that.
---
There's gonna be enough people on Eastern who want an RP-PvP server that you'll find Eastern guilds you can raid with.
---
You'll be just fine.
---
Yeah true, I guess my real question is do ppl RP alot during dungeons/BGs, making them take alot longer?
---
Gurubashi Arena chest event - the OG Battle Royale
---
Ok
---
Thanks, that's crazy...
---
Yeah certainly, I expected a lot more server than just a few per Language/Type here in EU. Situation for NA seems better but EU is another massive customer area and just few servers isn't enough.
---
Not long ago it was speculated that Blizzard would open like 15+ servers per region so even then there is at least couple of servers less available than expected.
---
Easy solution, region lock anyways and say tough luck

Thats sad :( I was hoping he would go to like the RP server or something since hes so into the actual game not just the streamer games

Hahahahaha. Who would be the actual Classic Nazi? Some streamer? Maybe Asmongold?
---
This.... I dont know either why everyone is in such a hurry.
---
Yes it's been confirmed that BGs will always be cross-realm.
---
Where are you getting the 100k number, though? I'm not saying you're wrong, but everyone's pulling these huge numbers of players out of thin air, thinking it'll be how the launch is. I'm not saying it won't be hoppin', 'cause it will be, but it's doubtful we're going to be looking at over 100k players rolling on each realm.
---
They’re only used to defend flags.
---
I have to imagine you play or have played quite a bit? Do you really want to content with 10k Bros of a single streamer farming something for their daddy while your just trying to hit a node?
---
exactly the same story here lol. i came back for bfa after i quit in cata and i felt disgusted af. completely different game and not for the better
---
Layering is like phases. It's there to prevent areas being too crowded. You know the existing phases in game? Blasted Lands for example has pre WoD phase where level 40s can to questing. Then there's the WoD phase when the iron horde invades and the draenor portal os red. Layering is like that, only they are copies that have their own mobs and resource nodes etc. Again, to smoothen individual player gameplay.
---
Layering is not supposed to separate your from your party or guild (at least it will try its best with guilds).
---
Developers have stated layering will only stay around for the first phase of the game's launch. The first phase is when "tourists" play the game to check it out, then leave when they get bored. Tourists come and go every expansion launch and also some content patches.
---
Basically, Layering means that not everyone on a server plays together. Instead, server layers are created that house a certain number of players; As soon as a layer is filled up, a new one gets created. Basically, it's supposed to be more consistent sharding, if I understood it correctly. And if enough people leave to make a layer superfluous, it gets folded into other existing layers.
---
From what can be seen, it looks *just* like sharding, however - including, like in this example, people *in the same group* switching layers mid-combat. Which, according to Blizzard, would not happen. Nevertheless, *somehow* sharding got a scathing reception, but almost everything seems okay enough with layering (or at least accepts it as necessary) - even though it really seems to be pretty much the same thing from a practical perspective.
---
Furthermore, the problem with both sharding and layering is that they are antithetical to Vanilla values - it destroys a core pillar of why people want back to Vanilla: A solid server community, with the integrity of the "server world" intact: Whoever is in Silithus at a given moment, I can meet.
---
This [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cnowfl/race_to_60_choosing_the_right_diapers_i_know_its/) has some very useful information on hitting 60 asap.
---
It’s my favorite set from Classic. I’ve never been able to mix and match with it on retail because it can’t be improved.
---
At first it was for me like this and then the whole thing stopped working and it went back to normal bags. None of the bag addons are working for me, really afraid that I'll have to do with regular bags on release...
---
Why the fuk my pp hard?
---
having too few then expanding is better for everybody. the alternative of having too small a population to fill them all is way worse.
---
I mean, a better guild could be on a server that's 70% alliance 30% horde, but I'd rather be on the server with 70% horde, there's just more people to play and trade with there.
---
I thought mages couldnt polymorph "tagged" mobs?
---
Man it is beyond me how anyone can play retail and not be following classic news.
---
There has been some hints that he's going to stream classic after release.
---
80% of the streamers will quit after a month anyway
---
Yes. I played on kelthuzzard for almost 10 years. I think I know how much a streamer has on a server. 
---
Spoiler: it doesn’t. No one even talks about the streamer. We just play the game and not worry about people who we won’t even see.
---
It’s a Corsair K65 RGB.
---
&gt; You are picking your main just based on a free mount?
---
You say that as if it's the only reason. It isn't.
---
My choice is simply between warlock and mage, my two favorite classes. This reason simply pushed me over to warlock. 
---
Also, who said main? I said first, not main. Mage will be my main probably. I plan to level all classes to 60. 
---
&gt; Do you know how easy it is to get gold needed for mount? Literally can just level fishing and earn your mount gold by 40.
---
You don't seem to have much experience on a completely fresh server with a new economy. After a full decade of playing on private servers, I sure do.
---
No, it is absolutely not that easy to get gold for your mount by 40 within the first couple weeks of a server launch. You know what's a whole lot easier? Just being a Warlock. 
---
&gt; Also you said "mounts" but the 60 mount is expensive as fuck and even harder to get than the regular 60 epic mount.
---
That was a typo.
---
Yes because that's how successful companies operate, turning away 1000's of paying customers.  And again VPNs.

This is basically how I have mine set up, except I have:

---
* Combat Log
---
* Loot
---
* Whisper
---
* Guild/Party/Raid/BG
---
Cause I don't like my screen getting spammed to hell with loot and currencies and shit while I'm farming on Retail, so I'll probably end up doing it this way on Classic as well. It's just how I like to have it set up. That way, I can tab over to general and see General Chat, Defense, Trade, etc. I don't want those bogging up my guild and party conversations, either.

Might have something to do with shadows or related settings? You only have blob shadows while in OP’s post, there are modern shadows. And shadows darken, which can be why Orgrimmar looks so light to contrast it with.

Look in the WTF folder for your account then find the realm you're playing on the stress test. Copy all the folders and files in there. Make a new folder with the realm you plan to roll on in in the folder with the stress test realm. Paste all the files in the launch realm folder. BAM, done. Same thing is done when you want to move character specific settings, but you just copy one character's files to the other the same was as the realm.

I had to do this last night to continue editing my UI as they closed the RP-PvP server where I made my first character.

Sad that layering will be the death of classic just like everyone has been saying since day 1. Blizzard yet again shows that they will not listen to the players and just do whatever they want even if it ruins the game.

“What?” - my rogue
---
I think people are overestimating how many realms we actually need. Sure, Blizzard had tons of realms...at the start of the game when hype was ramping up (and sub numbers continually went up). It still ended up being overcompensation. Understandable at the time (because server load etc etc), but that's no longer a problem today and tweaking resources a tiny bit would be WAY better than opening 30 servers only to find that all of them have like 500 people on them in six months.
---
I'm not saying people won't play Classic (obviously tons of people will check it out, relive some memories, etc etc), but it's not going to be this 'hey it takes over the entire game and more subbers are playing Classic than retail by double!' thing that some people in this post seem to be hoping for. I mean, it \*would\* be pretty great, but it's unlikely to happen. Maybe it's just me, but I want to temper my expectations a bit. I was shocked at the amount of realms at first, too, but I'm glad they're being conservative about this. Like yall were talkin about, I'd rather deal with some layering and tweaks to that down the road if necessary than log in and find out that nobody's online/there's nobody to play with/etc etc.

Not out of touch with reality at all. It makes literally everything you do more satisfying, especially when you see how many others still didn’t kill the mob but YOU did. Layering is a massive mistake.
---
Photoshop!!?? This is something easily accomplished with paint or image edit.
---
I'm willing to bet they'll roll on Herod out of spite.
---
&gt; So you're telling me you're perfectly okay with your group phasing out mid fight?
---
No, that is clearly unintended and needs to be fixed.
---
&gt; You're perfectly okay with farmers jumping layers to spam herb and mine nodes?
---
No but you also seem to be missing the point that it isn't 10 people from one layer jumping to 10 other layers. It will be a bunch of people jumping layers, if it even ends up working the way it does in BFA, to other layers that also don't have nodes because people are doing the exact same thing.
---
&gt; And somehow, you missed the obvious third option. We push to end layering.
---
It will end...at the end of the first phase but the two choices for Blizzard are layering or huge queues and they aren't going to let people sit in 10,000 person queues.
---
If it comes to that they might be able to do it like they did on retail with connected realms. So if Faerlina and Herod merged you could have names like “Thexd-Faerlina” and “Thexed-Herod” on the same “realm”.
---

oh yeah definatly, these responces are all from reddit users, and the discords are empty compared to the actual wow community as a whole.
---
Mankrik mafia!
---
Fuck Blizzard just give us classic!!!!!! No fucking layering, just give us one fucking world to play in together!!!
---
This..makes me uncomfortable.
---
Sure let me just do that real quick so I can learn
---
rank 1 : 1.58 heal/mp
---
rank 2 : 1.59 heal/mp
---
rank 3 : 1.78 heal/mp
---
rank 4 : 1.88 heal/mp
---
rank 5 : 2.04 heal/mp
---
rank 6 : 2.19 heal/mp
---
all the way up to
---
rank 10: 2.80 heal/mp
---
Because it's impossible to spin up new servers if they need to.  It's better to start with less and add more as needed than to start with too many and have to condense/merge low pop realms.
---
Have you tried it? If so, have you experienced party group not visible on ElvUI?
---
you also aren't supposed to in retail with their sharding system or whatever but it still happens frequently.
---

---
That should answer almost every question you can have regarding mages.
---
So that instead of friends being split up by a bug they'll just end up on a server with maybe 1k other players, nice
---
Have you considered how the economy looks with 1k vs 20k players? I doubt you have.
---
I don’t think so, they’ve been trying to communicate with the community about where they’ll go, since we initially decided to just wait and see.
---
the fuck, why would you thank them for shutting down nostalrius and feeding us this hacked up corpse of a version of vanilla.
---
They will have as much control over their peeps ad we do over ours. Which is to say... None.
---
Ha! I am waiting on getting a new machine before I try Classic and I was thinking the same thing. By the time I get my shit together most of these issues will be settled one way or another.
---
Seriously, we FAILED the test.
---
All this thing has done is devolve into a tribalistic land-grab, where the community keeps fracturing into smaller and smaller groups.
---
but in vanilla around launch the servers had a max capacity of around 2500 players online at once, due to the limitations of technology back then.  
---
I don't know what the numbers are now, but with layering etc, i bet they could easily have over 10k online at once.
---
hope all streamers die or something so we can enjoy a fucking game not being afraid of idiot ruining a server just because he has 2k kids watching him doing jumps in goldshire and attention whores jump behind him spamming ninja stars and N words uhaha content
---
That's not going to happen. Latin America probably does not have enough players to sustain a server with healthy population a couple months after launch. Also, the servers are physically located in the US, so there's not a big incentive like lower ping for Latin Americans to want play there, not to mention that Brazilians really don't get along with Spanish speaking players from Latin America (and vice versa).
---
Moreover, Latin Americans will be like 10% of the NA server population and it's not like there will be a dungeon finder placing them into your dungeon groups where you are forced to deal with a language barrier.
---
I'm Brazilian and I don't like playing with Brazilians either because I don't share the same gamer culture, but I fail to see how Latin Americans could be more disruptive than any other player. If people speaking a different language bothers someone so much there are plenty of chat addons to fix that problem.
---
Crafting professions aren't really gold makers in Classic, at least not all in comparison to gathering professions. Each has recipes that *can* make money, but very few of those recipes make much in comparison to the cost of the raw materials and those that do have cooldown restrictions or require special circumstances. 
---
You want to pick a profession that is useful to that character and that interests you. Engineering is the most popular profession because it provides unique items only the engineer can use and grenades are very good in PVP.
---
As a Rogue main myself, I will be leveling with Skinning and Herbalism, choosing to drop Herbalism for Enchanting when my Herbalism skill can no longer keep up with my leveling pace so I can disenchant quest rewards that I don't have a use for and that don't have a high vendor price.
---
At level 60, I will drop Enchanting for Mining and level it as quickly as I can, keeping everything in my bank. After I've collected everything needed to level Engineering all the way to 300 in one sitting, I'll drop Skinning for Engineering.
---
I'll be keeping Mining to fuel my Engineering needs and because solo farming BRD for Dark Iron Ore/Bars is fairly good money and quite fun.
---
Get rid of layering and I'll be much happier.
---
Maybe somebody who has nothing g better to do than wait in a line for 2 hours to play a videogame should go get some professional help.
---
I thought vanilla wow fans cared about the community aspect of the game, but who on Earth would want to play with you?
---
People mainly only RP in dungeons/raids if they've set something up before hand. Some might casually do fluff rp during down time while people drink/corpse run but a full RP run of a dungeon isn't something you usually do on the fly.
---
I've done IC runs of dungeons and they're great fun, but they've always been planned events.
---
I went to the same spot and the water is transparent so I'm not sure what's going on with your game.
---
Must admit I thought the gravestone would be for Steve Irwin
---
Names mean something to a LOT of people. You lose server pride, too, with merges. See also: subbing for name reservations only to lose the names you reserved because your realm got merged with five other dead realms.
---
I get where you're comin' from, but if Blizz wanted to go the merging route, the whole launch should have been handled differently....which isn't happening. Too few is better than too many, because we've seen what too many does. Have they merged all the current realms in retail that they should've merged? Yeah, let's not pretend they'd have merged Classic's in a timely manner if we needed it.
---
Apologist....man your too invested. I could care less how the system works. It will be fun either way. Get over it.
---
There are a handful of people who are like mentally ill for their need to defend blizzard, and the same goes for those who complain. And it's probably the same couple hundred people having these autistic arguments
---
WHATS THE STREAMRR SERVEEERRDRRFRRDJKKKLL HLIHHHLUGLUGL
---
Well that's not a Master List as some realms have multiple competing Discords and the popularity contest has yet to be won!
---
Well Twitch already updated their category selection to just "World of Warcraft" with Ragnaros as the cover. They are already prepared for the Classic release.
---
but vanilla did not last long enough too
---
why would the player loss be 70%?  
---
i always see random numbers thrown around like "in one month they will lose 80% of the players cus classic sucks"  
---
i don't get it.
---
r/gatekeeping  
---
Vanilla wow will either be successful or it won't, and none of it will boil down to absolute insane losers like you having it match exactly what you want
---
I'm horrified by the fact that you're probably 100% right xtrmx.
---
I played with a latin guild in BC content, in a english speaking server. Everyone was very respectfull and almost everyone spoke english. I think the playerbase for the new classic content wont be the 15 y/0 dota players, but rather people returning to wow, 30 +years, and most of them can speak english.
---
Just keep feeding them trolls boy.
---
And I think if reservation/sub numbers from this weekend/Tuesday blow their minds, they will do exactly that.
---
At this point it is the least of my concerns.
---
And people like you are why Retail is such a piece of shit. Blizzard gave in to the demands of the crybabies, and now we have BfA. 
---
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
---
Well I’m sold
---
Once again, you’re not bringing anything to the table. 
---
He made a comment that might have been a joke but this discussion isn’t about the original response. You made it about my use of false equivalency and that’s why we’re still talking. His was response was a false equivalency because his comment was tying retextured graphics to the introduction of LFR. 
---
You’re just being pedantic and if i’m ‘hiding behind a facade’ and i’m so ‘twisted’ why are you still wasting your time responding to me? Surely i’m not worth the time of day? Or is it because it’s actually you are actually the person ‘talking to get wins’? I’m just defending my point, you’re the one that’s keeping score and being ridiculous. The fact you condensed this down to trying to ‘win’ an internet argument when i’m just standing my ground shows your level of maturity. Stop projecting.
---
Thrust me daddy
---
They’ll just start shutting down our private servers now. Blizzard created WoW 15 years ago and have been mutilating it for the past 10. This year they’re finally pulling the plug due to a mix of incompetence and hubris.
---
Warrior is a long uphill mountain to climb. Its grueling. The other classes will be doing so much better then warrior, they will gear faster. That is until warriors gets geared in BWL. There's going to be a lot of other dps warriors and raid will be tempted to take like 8 of them to a raid. There will be arguments and schemes about who gets dps gear.
---
Duskwood cemetary for soulstones. Also tell your guild to fly their own asses to the raid.
---
you seem reasonable
---
12 servers in NA and at least 1 million active players will play calssic, 100k is a fair assumption
---
that's because they want to be in control. streamers are so full of themselves because of their huge following, so they have to be in control of everything. I saw a clip yesterday of a big streamer saying "We were nice enough to give you a server, the rest are ours. If you try to join us, prepare to get virtually fucked"
---
The way I see it, all the streamers will coordinate to get their scepter quest done well before the gates open. They've got enough of a rabid fan base that they'll spend 10 hours a day farming silithid enemies for parts.
---
Still traumatized from warcraft 3 dota days lol. 
---
Br wont change.
---
lol @ people who think PvP makes up half the game.
---
It allows for more players on a server according to Blizz. I’m not sure how it works behind the scenes, but I would imagine each layer is a “virtual server” that they can spin up. Each layer is a copy of the main server and anything done on a layer is saved to the main server.
---
So the problem they faced is that they could handle hundreds of thousands or millions of players at any given time logging in, but a server itself could not handle more than a few thousand on it. The solution originally was to have tons of servers to spread out the player base. The problem here is that servers die out because players are spread too thin. That’s when they started introducing server merges where in retail you’d see 3 or more servers merged into a shared server so the population could be brought back up. 
---
Now that they have better technology, their solution is to have a few servers, but spin up virtual instances (layers) of that server to meet demand. Once the playerbase settles they can tear down these layers and be left with only well populated servers. Each layer can handle several thousand players, so theoretically the server itself can house an unlimited amount of players logging in and playing
---
Layering is not based on how many people are in your current zone. It's based in people on your server/layer.
---
No Tim-Tams?
---
Bang a Gong! only provides the Legendary mount in Classic. There is no title, no tabard, or anything else.
---
That's *obviously* what they want...
---
Look, there is still plenty of time for Blizz to respond with additional servers. 
---
Many of us won't go back to retail because we haven't played it in years, I don't think Blizz is trying to turn away our money.
---
There's going to be no shortage of people playing in Phase 1 either way. Infact, wouldn't they benefit more from no layering at all? Because then it would pressure people who re-subbed to WoW to go check out Live while waiting for their +10k queue time to get some form of Warcraft catharsis.
---
You can't calculate all of the more casual players that will grab a server at almost random.
---
Can female locks summon a magnum dong incubus?
---
Yep the stress test feels like a ghost town. I can’t see the people around me playing. It’s just such a shitty feeling that’s missing exactly what it was that made vanilla great - seeing *everyone else* playing around you in the world!
---
you can't buff people in bfa?
---
That makes sense
---
I can’t tell if it’s in the front or the back lol
---
Pretty sure the mobs have to give exp/honor/rep to get a soul shard off them.
---
The courteous thing to do, is to announce your servers, and all play there so the rest of the community isn't subjected to the shit that surrounds them.
---
People who are going to follow them will follow them no matter what.
---
Almost every major guild is waiting to be sure where the steamers are to avoid them.  
---
Their choices affect the entire community, a community that does not fully embrace them, and that they should try to have a minimal impact on.
---
You shouldn't thank someone for giving you crumbs and a pat on the head.

---
Stop spreading misinformation and your own paranoia.
---
You're not taking into consideration overhealing, you rarely want to spam max rank heals on your tank for this exact reason. This is the reason downrank healing is more efficient. Theres a reason druids spam rank 3/4 healing touch and not max rank heals.
---
How is this not just layering and creating new servers if the servers keep being too full?
---
For real. I've played games that tried to go wide with their number of servers and they all ended up consolidated in the end.
---
go to his twitch stream and type !addons in the chat. not all are working perfectly yet though.
---
Yep, easy to pick up but hard to master. Hunters have a superb toolkit and one of the highest skill ceilings in the game. Let them keep sleeping because that means more loot for us lol.
---
The amazing classic community... woah....
---
I actually bought into the classic wow team being passionate and blah blah blah, but this is clearly nothing but a cash grab. From all indicators, they've made absolutely dead 0 attempt at fixing these bugs. And this isn't a minor bug, this is a fully game breaking, game ruining bug.
---
What an absolute disappointment
---
As much as they would like to think the majority of Brazilians aren't toxic, I think we all know from our experience across many games that they are. The vocal few won't change the behavior of a population. It sucks they chose Thalnos because it made sense to roll there since streamers said they would avoid it
---
then add more servers
---
These dudes are crazy lol. I played a raiding warlock in Vanilla. Firstly soulshards don’t disappear when ya logout. Having shards are the least of your worries. I used to queue up for AV and farm some shards and honor at the same time.
---
Yes, but we are comparing 13 servers to 100 servers... Don't you think there's a middle ground?
---
I might legit just play on a private server. Never have before, but Classic has given me the itch to play Vanilla WoW, and classic with layering is absolutely not vanilla WoW
---
Obviously a bug and not intented
---
You listed a lot of fair points, I assumed main because most peoples first character is their main. I just leveled on a fresh private server and fishing deviates in the forgotten pools was how i got my mount. No im not arguing that its easier than actually just walking to your class trainer and learning an ability but I think its one of the easiest way to earn gold on a FRESH server. You are bringing up 10 years of experience but acting like fishing deviate isnt a good way to make gold. pretty sure entire economy of a fresh server is based off deviates. Who cares whats easier..thats like me saying i want to main a Mage because they can make food and thats easier than buying it. Actually food/Portals &gt; mount when all is said and done.
---
They also have cross realm crz stuff going on. I mean I’d take a merge over that for sure. I’m all for more servers don’t get me wrong...and where layering is broken it needs to be reported and fixed... but nobody is throwing out numbers either. Do they want two more pvp reams? Do we need one more rp pvp? Some clarity would be great, but it’s hard to guess because we can’t know how many people will try the game OR stick it out.
---
It never amazes me the depth of knowledge some people have about this game - your comment and the one above it.
---
I had the same thing happening to me a couple weeks ago and I downloaded the 67gb retail wow but never actually finished it. 
---
It never displayed the download for Classic Wow only until a couple days ago and I really don't know how that happened. 
---
Note I don't have a subscription activated.
---
because you are wrong!
---
I reported the whole concept because there was no fucking layering in classic
---
If people don't leave it's highly likely they just release new servers with free movement to them. Like they always have done in the past.
---
Gamers rise up! We can defeat these streamers! With a bag of Doritos in my left hand and a 2 liter Mountain Dew in my right, I among the other hundreds of thousands of streamer haters, claim Herod as **OUR SERVER!**
---
literally no way they remove layering, probably ever, at least not for the first year
---
What's the ally/horde ratio going to be??
---
Do you have a link to download it from?
---
On the character selection screen open up your addons button on the left and you should see it
---
Thought an announcement in china said 10k concurrent players per server. So you can think of a server count is 3x what they have.
---
Honestly, who the fuck gives a shit about a discord server?
---
Aug 26th for some of us!
---
Sounds like you’ve got a stick up your ass. 
---
Nothing a little Classic won’t fix.
---
And to your point, they are FORCING multiple layers regardless of the server population to test the layering function. 
---
Im STOKED for classic, but I played the stress test for maybe 1.5 hours. The population isnt very high and I would think they forced 5-10 layers.
---
This is the stage called denial. People have been complaining about layering being bugged for months, nothing was done. We're now two weeks from launch and 0 changes have been made to layering, and people have still deluded themselves into believing they'll somewhere do a massive overhaul on this system in the little time they have left.
---
Classic WoW is finished. Accept it. Play on private servers.
---
and on the other hand, it's not blizzard's problem if players invest emotionally in these characters that were only going to exist for a short while
---
They usually implement free server transfers to new realms.
---
Use the F-keys and don’t look back!
---
Yeah, on go to the "files" tab in the link and download the one that says 1.13.2
---
It literally breaks the game... of course they are going to remove it.
---
I don't know how I'm part of the problem? I like Asmongold and other streamers. I'm not advocating against them. I just PERSONALLY don't want to play with them. I remember playing on Darkspear with Swifty and others. It was a toxic server with plenty of drama. I just dont want anything to do with it. If streamers get pissy that no one wants to play with them then maybe they shouldn't say shit like "we're gonna ruin the server" all the time.
---
Yep. Captn's server definitely has the twitch chat vibe to it. Trying to avoid streamer servers, that disc is basically a streamer server without the streamer.
---
It might actually spice things up. An element that wasn't there originally may play for better or worse.  Just hope for the best maybe it'll be fun.
---
They’re definitely going Herod. Thalnos is being targeted by Brazilians so basically Ragnaros 2.0,  while Faerlina is looking to be a Spanish server. 
---
Wish there was an extra PvP est server.
---
there's only 5 pvp servers lmao. There would have to be less than 15,000 people playing the game to remove layering. It is absolutely never going to happen
---
Make sure to download the 1.13.2 file, it works fine
---
But OneBag 3 is working. Go to warcrafttavern.com and download it from there.. just did it like 1 hour ago. Worked perfectly
---
Want to dress them too?
---
username checks out
---
There is talk of everyone rolling on Herod to make it "The People's Server".
---
We shouldn't sit back and let streamers dictate what server people play on. There are more of us than them so I'll be rolling on Herod like a lot of other people.
---
Mine is working again :D
---
Yup yup
---
You forgot that it's also addiction and social isolation - to make it more balanced in the grand scope of things :-)
---
You're the one underestimating and you seem to forget that a healthy classic server without layering only supports like 5000 players.  Blizzard is currently expecting like 60k active players in NA.... That is so absurdly low.
---
Definitely helpful.   Im dual boxing and was auto running all over to do the same thing
---
yes, the bridge is pretty clear, i just think its hard to monitor for blizz and therefore would cost them money instead of making them money (tokens) so they can just keep silent about all this topic and tolerate tokens for their own monetary gains, which is what i think they will do.
---
That’s fair! I wonder what a realistic player loss % would be. 50? Less than that? 
---
How many servers do you think should be added?
---
true
---
The majority aren't the huehuehue ect, In my opinion you have them mixed. I have played with many from BR. 
---
I was just AFK bobby b
---
OG Shaman from Vanilla, will play Druid in Classic. Shaman is fun but Druid is much better at tanking. I'm old and mature now and I'm comfortable running my own groups - I need to play a tank.
---
If all you want to do is heal, then yeah, go Shaman.
---
That's not the point of the joke
---
And who is going stop them from rolling wherever they want? Not like we can ban them.
---
Thanks!  I should have specified that I was talking mostly about pve raiding.  They did use mostly plate, but strength wasn't nearly as important as hit and crit back then, so there were some pieces that were best as leather.  Likewise, some paladins wore cloth for better healing.
---
It was a weird time, but that's why vanilla was so cool
---
SURROUNDED BY LANNISTERS! EVERY TIME I CLOSE MY EYES I SEE THEIR BLONDE HAIR AND THEIR SMUG, SATISFIED FACES!
---
man, I get that folks have so much pent up energy and they can't help but unleash some of it into this 'worry'...but guaranteed, your experience will not match what you think it's going to be
---
Thats the thing, the addon button isnt there :/
---
It's not that I don't trust you, its that you don't know what your talking about. I live on the east coast and have never played on an east coast server. Ever. None of my local friends have ever played on an east coast server. We play from the east coast, raid at east coast times with zero problems. The server time has zero affect on real time
---
 People want to play with friends, not with timezones. Ignorance is bliss for you I guess lol!
---
People can reasonably make 15K gold per hour in modern WoW vs 50g per hour in Classic.  Based on that, 100g will probably cost you around around 50-100k. 
---
I would bet higher end as a lot of modern WoW players will want to offload their stock. On the other hand, Classic players will want modern gold to pay for their sub fee, so the ratio might be lower.
---
he said it on stream, i guess he could be lying though. He said he wont be able to experience classic the way he wants if he streams it so he said he was planning on not streaming classic so he could enjoy the game
---
When it screeches, it pulls any fellow neutral mobs in an X yard radius.
---
I was thinking of it in relation to how old wow was. Everything was so absolutely tedious and time consuming that the blue PvP sets where probably the easiest thing for casual players to commit to grinding towards that was actually worth it. Even getting that full epic tier 0.5 dungeon set probably took more effort and you could truly get that one playing at your own pace.
---
 Playing for a few hours a day or heavy gaming on the weekends was a pretty low key commitment for something back then. And pretty much everyone who wanted the blue sets got them. You could grind them by playing actually casually maybe just a few hours a week until you got to rank 7ish to which then you only needed to then commit to the weekend binges or the 4 hours of gameplay per day thing for about 3-4 weeks or less to complete the grind. If you decided to no life it for 2 weeks you could probably do it even faster. The honor grind only required heavier commitments the higher you got into it. So grinding for the blue set was actually a reasonable goal for casual players and something a significant amount of them accomplished it. 
---
I do see though how most people probably wouldn’t necessarily consider that casual though.
---
Not emotionally invested but wanted to mess around in WSG for most of today but the character list was bugged on the oceanic realms only. Seems to be working again /shrug.
---
The top guilds will play on Golemagg but there will be still problems with a lot of Spanish/Italian players since Blizzard is too fucking lazy to make realms for them. Blizz is underestimating Classic so badly it's just unreal.
---
horde to me are orcs, skinny orcs, zombies and tauren
---
We ain't the Borg, lmfao.
---
They could, but that wouldn't be a classic experience.  A high pop classic server will be anything over 5000.  Anything bigger than that is going to start to feel really cramped because Azeroth simply wasn't as big with as many resources available as the game became later after the expansions added more and more content.
---
It's my favourite type of trolling. It's harmless.
---
What bug or bugs are you referring to, specifically? I noticed nothing game breaking, and never had a problem partying with people, and never once saw another player just disappear.
---
A lot of us are trying to play the second it's released we out number the streamers by a lot wish we could know in advance.
---
Ogre's have layers
---
I'm east coast but will be rolling on Grobbulus. Should be no streamers and the community should be awesome.
---
No, cross-faction collusion isn't against the EULA. It was removed years ago. And Classic will not be getting its own EULA, no Blizzard game does.
---
They confirmed dynamic respawns will be active for launch, primarily in early areas, and tapering off in higher level zones. Exactly how it should be. Sorry some dumb troglodyte downvoted you.
---
You've been infected with Classic. Congratulations
---
god damn it i hope not... if so that ruins EVERY us-east server
---
Wow. You sure are a nasty son of a gun aren’t you? Take a second bud. There’s no need to be so volatile. 
---
Think about it okay?
---
Company’s fail all the time. I’m not sure how this is even disputable. You’re really putting them high up on pedestal bud.
---
&gt; Druids also have the meditation/reflection talents. Shouldn't they benefit just as much from from Innervate seeing as they are a spirit based healer with lots of it on their gear?
---
They don't. Priests have a better spirit -&gt; mana formula. They will literally get more mana back from innervate if both druid and priest have the exact same gear on. Plus PoH and FH are better high throughput options to spend mana with than what druid has.
---
Streamers are kill on sight on Herod, nice. Camp em until they reroll.
---
That's just Anduin bobby b
---
This poll really does not show much. Would be better if we could see allience/horde numbers for each server separately.
---
I’ve played with enough people from Ragnaros and Quel’thalas to know it’s in my best interest to avoid Thalnos altogether. I am sure there are wonderful people in the bunch but I don’t want to take the risk.
---
Yeah apply that to a few historical examples genius rofl
---
lol I rarely see more than 5 people at any given time. It’s a ghost town now. Feels really sad cause I know there are more people playing. At least I think there are...
---
DRINK AND STAY QUIET, THE KING IS TALKING!
---
Let's do it. This is a community movement I can get behind 100%.
---
Given the week we've just had, I think you need to re-evaluate that statement.
---
Lmao, are you seriously arguing that Classic WoW is going to pull 13k active players NA?  You're being so ridiculous.
---
That helps, thanks
---
Min röst likaså
---
Probably the worst out of them all tbh
---
&gt;we, as a community, could have handled it the same way we handled language specific server. an adamant: "we need it". (in case of layering: "we don't want it")  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;with layering tough, it seems for every person that thinks it shouldn't be in the game there is one that says it should. blizzard just saw both sides about equally represented and went with the safest option.  
---
&gt;ie: keep venues for adjustments as open as possible and then decide what to do as time progresses.  
---
&gt;it makes perfect sense. nobody wants their vacation time wasted in ques, serverdowns and unable to level due to overpopulation.  
---
&gt;whether or not its worth the price is very personal and sadly not as simple as saying "we need language servers for eu".  
---
&gt;edit: btw now there is prettymuch 0 chance that blizzard decides against layering after the invested so much time, money in it.
---
what i am trying to say is that the inability to be decisive about it meant blizzard had no reason to change their mind about layering. we could have,(like we did with the eu servers) but we didnt. 
---
therefore we have to blame ourselves.
---
blizzard just does what companies do.
---
Yes.
---
Don’t you think we should wait until Classic is released, and we see what the Demand is telling us, before finding that middle ground?

Why doesn’t anyone seem to realize that more servers will come with more demand? How hard is to it be patient for 16 days?
---
&gt; I just leveled on a fresh private server and fishing deviates in the forgotten pools was how i got my mount.
---
How many weeks after launch of this server did you get your mount?
---
not directed at ya

---
How do you see your ping in game?
---
GOod to know ty.
---
You can stream snipe and camp their ass all day to make them switch
---
It'll be fine. Maybe.
---
So was I, my god. I was hyped for alot of MMO's, but i'm so jaded now. Even going into classic, im reminding myself to keep my expectations low. 
---
I'm still really hopeful for Pantheon though.
---
Static layers that will be merged if population decline allows for it has been suggested since they rebranded sharding for us.
---
I don't think I've heard anyone actually explain why this option is worse than the layered mega-populated servers we're gonna get. At least there'll be unsavory options with accurate data if Blizzard fucks this up.
---
I’ve read that the new models are not that compatible with the old gear/gear textures. Idk if it’s a legit argument, but could be one.
---
In Vanilla, Blood Fury only affected melee attack power.
---
I simply dont have footage because I have never thought about recording myself playing. I don't need any sort of specific footage. Just something to use as a backdrop for the guide.
---
The graphics are fucking incredible for Classic
---
Nice I’m glad the old exploits are still in. Anyone know if we can still wall jump into the caverns of time. The caverns of time before they added all the assets in tbc was probably my favorite spot in vanilla. Felt like you were just walking in outer space. Used to hang out in their all the time.
---
&gt; Big heals are for emergency only.
---
How the hell are you supposed to have time for a big heal during an emergency? Just cast/cancel a big heal. It's not like the tank will spike 100-0 in two seconds.
---
That's very naive.
---
These are memes as old as time. Every time a new MMORPG released, general chat is full of trolls "WoW is the first MMO"
---
tried the github version too but still getting lua errors and standard minimap :/
---
Excuse me sir we don’t like logic here, we prefer panic and rage
---
Your community is so retarded that you feel like you shouldn’t even speak your native language to avoid the stereotype.  That is horrible.
---
You're having trouble downscaleing at 1080p on your macbook with your 4k monitor?
---
The closest match should be like the #3 on the slider for Classic style graphics.  If your frame rate is still suffering then drop view and render distance, ground clutter and shadows, then particle effects.  Keep going until it's smooth.  
---
There's a chance you could get it just perfect but won't be able to see super far and won't have ground clutter until closer.  It's very hard to help without hands on the system myself but I hope this helped any.
---
There wont be 5+ Layers active when the current server population is \~1000. They are literally testing it. The stress test isnt for your Major City immersion...
---
i dont know if you've noticed but thats a double negative. It always bothered me in the song XD
---
You clearly have no damn clue what the fuck you are talking about.
---
They probably do. But while in classic its reasonable for someone to miss some of the improvements since then. Nothing troll about it.
---
I thought this could not be true, but i googled some and actually found you are right. 
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit
---
Formulas for mana regeneration based on spirit:
---
Priests and mages: 13 + (spirit / 4) mana per tick
---
Druids, shamans, paladins, hunters: 15 + (spirit / 5) mana per tick
---
Warlocks: 8 + (spirit / 4) mana per tick
---
I wonder what the design philosophy behind this is. It is been harmonised in TBC patch 2.4
---
It doesn't save mana without +healing. If anything you spend more due to violating 5SR more often.
---
When private server are more blizzlike than blizzard servers.
---
It’s pretty obvious layering is here to stay throughout classic at this point. I doubt a streamer being on the server won’t matter. You will most likely never be on the same layer
---
I mean the focus was always the first couple hours of the test and they were clear about that. I don't see anything alarming about just extending a test. There could be any number of reasons for extending it ranging from they saw a few things they wanted to monitor over the weekend to they just want to let people enjoy it over the weekend knowing plenty of people subbed specifically for the test. Plans are good, plans changing isn't always bad nor alarming. Could be it be? Sure, but in the absence of other details I fail to hear alarm bells.
---
They better let us transfer off for free then.  It still creates a mess for us players if they do that.  I can get being conservative to avoid server mergers but there's conservative and there's being literally retarded with expectations.  13 servers NA for Classic launch is so dumb.  20 at least would leave not a single one dead in 6 months.  Maybe in a year when people start "beating" the game, but that's going to be an issue inevitably.
---
Except they do review it. When you petition for the ban to be removed. 
---
So what I told you is true, from a certain point of view.
---
All the EU servers sound like names for STDs.
---
Sad that they even feel the need to make a post like this. They aren’t being given their own server and you’d think of all places in the world NA would be accepting of another culture.
---
There will be more attention andys following streamers than Brazilians by far. 
---
Speak your own language homies you’re people too!
---
I love how random decide “this is THE official server”
---
Wow this is a shitshow. I can REALLY understand why blizz waited to the last moment to release these servers. People are hysterical
---
I think you are GREATLY over estimating how many people will be playing Classic WoW in 3months.
---
I'm not asking for your WoW credentials. I'm asking for the specifics of the claim you're making so I can actually know if you're wrong or not. 
---
You do realize that the economy at week 8 is pretty massively different from the economy at week 2, right? Of course you do. So why is it weird for me to ask how quickly after launch you bought your mount at 40?
---
2-3 weeks is pretty quick. At that point on the private servers I played on, the economy was simply too small, that you had to seriously grind to get a significant gold supply. Its just not desirable for me.
---
But I suppose the population of classic will probably be much higher per server, so maybe it won't be so bad.
---
I guess one could, but it was just way easier with Photoshop and I wanted to practise my PS skills anyways.  
---
In case you're interested, I took the news overlay out of the original picture into a separate layer, replaced the background with a WoW picture, found the same (or at least very similar) font from Google, and replaced some of the text with that font.
---
Yeah it definitely sounds impossible when you use unrealistic numbers like those
---
Ok, blizzard marketing spy agent thank you for your insight on the sharding.
---
Hope we all get used to it because it will not go away. When it does we all complain of the lag and how unplayable it will be with 100k people per realm. Then back to sharding and we will like it. Thats how corps play.
---
Individuals. It’s easy as shit to set up a server to host wow.
---
Having played a rogue from day 1, it's been the best decision I have made with the original game.   Good in Raiding.  Good in PvP.  
---
And best of all, you can stealth to that quest mob that is in the back  of a camp and just fight him.   And 2-5 minute timer abilites that let you destroy one mob you normally wouldn't.   And a vanish when you fuck up and you're not going to win.
---
If you watch his stream, you’ll see he usually has an army following him so any area he is in will instantly become twitch chat, over crowded, server possible queue, could even have server population drop the second he leaves and in balance the second he logs on or off, there are many reasons to avoid streamer servers.
---
Yeah, the kind of communities that form around and outside of popular streamers vary from game to game. I do appreciate your wording of it as had effects on the server, it's less fatalistic then killing the server. Then again, these are big classic streamer names, this is their livelihood, and they will no doubt be setting up to progress through multiple expansions streaming their content. They won't just be up and leaving.
---
It isn’t 2004. It’s 2019 and this game isn’t drawing in 10 million players.
---
I'm speaking from experience, I have played with many BR as well including games where they dominate the server. In Tibia they used to hunt all non speaking Portuguese players until everyone was sick of playing with them and we had to switch servers
---
Ok cool yeah I didn't see that

---
Check the edit I just made. The original project lead mark kern talked about it
---
Hey guys! I'm on [http://whitemane.classicdiscord.net](http://whitemane.classicdiscord.net/) and I just wanted to let you know we already have a big community with active people in conversation. Come join us! \^\_\^
---
The server list at launch is not at all indicative of the server list ~2 months from now when Layering is removed.
---
People can say what they want and order anyone to do anything, that is protected under first amendment rights. The streamers or you also have the right to listen or not listen and do what you want as well. You can absolutely ignore people's commands if you wish.
---
Your common sense is not a good source.
---
So you admit that 2.5 is not the cap?
---
Also the buffs mean a lot more in classic, especially low levels. 3 stam when you have 120 health is a big help lol
---
half this sub seems like douchebags so they should fit in
---
The difference will be is they will be a major minority.
---
I do understand your concerns though. I am willing to give the chance.
---
I'm still ok with it for phase 1.  Yeah, it sucks, but it makes the game playable and if Blizzard wasn't afraid the game isn't going to draw 50k active players, it would help with healthy server pops.
---
As someone who's made guides for wow, I find it that you should be invested enough to have both the knowledge. I never have faith in people when they feel disingenuous.
---
You probably could have used a better adjective to describe them.
---
Worst of all is that brazil is going to have a special server (Thalnos) and we wont(spanish speakers) by the moment.
---
If you have ever played Dota, there is a history of excessive toxicity prevalent in a couple SA counties. Some people have a bad taste in their mouth from that. But wow is a different kind of game where you can just blacklist people and avoid them
---
I would say this post is fairly low quality, Spence.
---
I mean he's not incorrect, individual preference of association isn't racism in any capacity.
---
What's the discord?
---
well, the post isn't about the models, it's about the discrepancy of blizzard saying 'no new models, wasn't vanilla' and 'layering! (even though it wasn't vanilla)'
---
if they're trying to give a vanilla experience, there should also be no layering.
---
Layering will make it feel like an even worse version of Retail and anyone who doesn't see this is legit too blinded by the hype.
---
Going hunter here. Played one in vanilla. Also got warrior, priest, and mage to 60. Hunter is the most fun by far for me. This time, instead of troll hunter, I'm going orc
---
I think it’s more the fact that it opens a door of “well paladin got a change so why can’t class x also get this” 
---
Might be wrong but it’s the impression I get from the replies you have received.
---
We are actually hoping to avoid big streamers coming to Whitemane. I'm sure we have people who like to stream, but it definitely isn't a "Streamer Discord". 
---
=) Questions are great though, because it clears things up!
---
It’s pretty obvious layering is here to stay throughout classic at this point. I doubt a streamer being on the server won’t matter.
---
5pm Monday.
---
That's a first step, he's still the Admin of the Shazzrah Discord though.
---
&gt;Given the week we've just had, I think you need to re-evaluate that statement.
---
Name a better Country. Then move there.
---
&gt; As much as they would like to think the majority of Brazilians aren't toxic, I think we all know from our experience across many games that they are.
---
That strikes me as extremely unfair to Brazilian gamers that aren’t toxic. It must be extremely burdensome to them to be presumed toxic just because other people speaking the same language are.
---
Meanwhile I'm using my quiver to wack mobs in melee range instead of my 2h sword.
---
I get it guys. I would rather not play on a streamer server either, but this is actually deranged. You guys are gonna blacklist people from even rolling on a server? Because they STREAM? It’s ironic that you guys think the streamers community is gonna be toxic for the community when you’re trying to lay stake on a server that isn’t even up yet.
---
5pm for you.
---
the post isn't about the models, read into it a bit more...
---
I believe it's like this for all class quests.
---
I'm really not. And yeah I was a bit rough there but it's legit pissing me off how stupid some of you are. Companies fail all the time, sure. Server management is not something a company like Blizzard is going to fuck up.
---
I don't mean to alarm you, but every server is going to have streamers. You're being way too paranoid.
---
If you are doing it for the challenge, then it is a rather weak challenge. It won’t be hard. You can tank dungeons with far worse classes.
---
People won’t be pissed if you know what you are doing.
---
Your fear seems to be based on not wanting to reroll based on finding out a streamer is on your server after you have started. Can't really identify with that myself, if I want to be elsewhere I will go elsewhere
---
In retail they can’t. Maybe in Classic they won’t be able to. On private server they definitely could.
---
It shouldn't have to be like this. I feel bad for them too.
---
If the streamers will just go ahead and pick a server, then BR can pick a server, and then everyone else can pick a server. There's 3 eastern PVP servers, it should be possible.
---
Yes ideally Blizzard would have more servers. But as far as we know right now, it's not. So we have to figure it out ourselves.
---
I wish Blizzard had just given streamers their reserved names already, so that they would announce where they will be without worrying about it.
---
Are you seriously recommend server transfers in classic within a week? Yea that’s the best option, destroy what made classic servers great in the first week. I don’t care about your feelings. Do some research and roll on the best server for you stop being an emotional asshole
---
Did you look at the post? The project lead said it was around 2.5k but was dynamic?
---
No. I prefer dead to overcrowded.  You can play a dead server.  It can get lonely, but seeing someone actually will raise your spirits.  The world will feel bigger.  Overcrowded servers are literally unplayable.  You'll be waiting in queues on everything and you won't be able to go into a PVP zone without being a level 60 in Naxx gear with a group.
---
All the big names have already talked about announcing their servers. Seems pretty non-douchey to me.
---
I understand. Just know that everyone who benefits does appreciate whatever you do. Thank you.
---
Yup I remember blizzard offering to transfer my toons on high pop realms to newer, lower population servers, when they opened them back in vanilla.
---
New character models not being part of the "vanilla experience" is dumb, not being compatible with old textures is not though
---
That shit right there makes me feelsgoodman
---
Im doing orc hunter and tauren druid dualbox.
---
Who cares about streamers, play the game you enjoy ignore them. Dont let there fun ruin yours.
---
OWNED
---
Do you understand what dynamic means?
---
Layers won't be forever.
---
what?? that didn't make sense. i have more than enough knowledge and experience of priest to make a pve focused guide. don't step this way son
---
And with that, toxicity throughout he BR community came to an end. 
---
**based on a true story**
---
The retail one with all the upgrades
---
Thank you for being such a nice guy
---
I have no hope that layering in its current form won't end up with Capital city ghost towns on release. 
---
I could miss the guy standing in the bushes naked selling bags. 
---
There's so many experiences that layering could keep me from even having the opportunity to experience. 
---
And unless they're going to roll fresh servers at some point... There's no going back and re-experiencing this. This is all there will be.
---
gift? rofl the shills are evolving.
---
The layer doesn't change per zone as far as I know...
---
If there are 2900 people in your layer, and 2700 of them are in elwynn forest, only 200 of them could be anywhere else in the world on that layer.
---
So no shit cities are empty during a stress test weekend with a 15 level cap. People are probably leveling out in the world instead of AFKing in the city.
---
This is way better than server merging.  Could you imagine having to change your name?
---
Asmon and company being really obnoxious and obstinate about announcing their server choice is the biggest problem. We have to play around them *and* the Latin community, which means 2 out of the 3 EST PvP servers will be compromised.
---
If they'd just be like "yo guys, we're going Faerlina" it would be totally fine... but for some reason they're being coy about it. Really frustrating.
---
I feel like most RP-PVP servers really were not historically strong in the Rp front. 
---
Best of luck, and I'm sure there should be lots of cool rp-pvp events for the first while. But when the hype dies down, you might really just need to be in the pve servers if you want to just go out and find random rp and stuff. Much like modern WoW is, and was even as far back as my memory in Cata (I was just pve prior to that).
---
&gt;This is clearly just a bug that will be fixed before launch.
---
lmfao. You can't use this line now that it's not beta anymore.
---
Me neither.    
---
&gt; don't represent the bigger part.   
---
As a standalone thought, it would make sense that randos in LFD don't represent the majority. But if that were true, having played for over a decade, I should have encountered at least one single instance of players from SA servers who weren't incompetent morons. And I have not.
---
What is the context though? What is he replying to? Having only what he said doesn't really give much of a picture.
---
Have you been paying any attention at all to this sub over the past 2 days?
---
Yeah, herb/alch here. End of the day, phase 3 is quite a ways off and I really feel that it's more important early on to just get your mount and BOE gear and consumables sorted, before you worry about fancy profession stuff. So I am just going to rush for my mount and then save up to powerlevel alchemy and start transmuting ASAP. 
---
Still not sure how early that will be. I don't intend to be hardcore enough to sign up to a dedicated dungeon leveling group, but if it turns out to be practical to pug my way to 60 in dungeons I will focus on that before messing with professions. If not, I intend to level with them as much as practical.
---
Way to let everyone know you hang out in bad subreddits..
---
Def the superior whitemane discord that I have found
---
I like most folks probably experienced this in pug groups. All the South Americans in my actual guilds over wows history have been great. I still have a macro in Spanish(he was Peruvian) to salv our top fury warrior in wrath!
---
What? I'm asking what APES are, and also, how do we know they're going on Golemagg, that was my question...  Thanks.
---
Did you ask?
---
Eh, giving the benefit of the doubt autism is also just used as a "we're tryhards" type thing, not necessarily about being spergy.
---
Same, ESPECIALLY away from group members. Since sharding was added i've never had this happen personally
---
No... For adding layers
---
&gt; classic is a way to play wow as it was back in the days. (Or with less possible changes). I don't want to play another game. Having protadin changed would make classic another game.
---
How does giving prot paladins a taunt change the game? You would rather them be suboptimal tanks "just like before"? 
---
Why? What is the reasoning? "Because they were suboptimal to almost worthless tanks in Vanilla, and so they need to be that way again" seems like awful reasoning to me. 
---
Especially with a change that is extremely minor.
---
Engi for min/max PvP and PvE
---
Alch/herb for making money
---
Rogues don't really have 'SAP' as a reliable CC unless they talent it, and even then it has a 10% chance of failure (in the sense the Rogue will sap, but then get de-stealthed). If you wanted a Rogue to CC you'd pretty much need to 'time it' so that the SAP went off and other things (like Polymorph) landed simultaneously, or that at the very least Polymorph followed SAP. Otherwise you just got a Rogue who sapped and then insta-gibbed by the group of mobs.
---
Yeah their culture is toxic, but opposed to what; this community? I know I’d rather have some kid streamsniper than half the malevolent shitposters on here. Can’t realistically avoid either though so I’ll just play my own game
---
I can't say I know the answer but I just assign marks to the num pad and it's very fast to assign them to targets.
---
&gt; People are literally retarded. The WoW sub on reddit is just a little bit shy of the actual subscriber count too. 
---
How do you know the sub count on this subreddit isn't 10% of the players who will be playing classic?
---
Ok, thanks. Would you try to avoid them or not?
---
Very good. Yes the Quest items work.  
---
Ranged slot still not working. Have you checked mail or trade yet?
---
Awesome! Thank you man.
---
It's honestly sad, all the bugs but also it seems Layering is even worse than sharding.
---
A guy on the forums took this screenshot https://imgur.com/my2vjON He can literally see 4 people in Stormwind while 50+ shows up for level 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. Darnassus on retail seems more active than SW on a STRESS Test :(

---
I dont see 1 :/
---
If that is real than thats just sad. Talking about the importance of the community all the time and then talking to that same community in this way. really disrespectfull.
---
Take my silver for exposure.
---
Not to mention people pooling their money together and making major money decisions predicated on a few streamers could fuck the economy of the server.
---
This post is hating on layers not classic are you a paid shill?
---
That's actually correct.
---
Ignore the idiots who have zero idea of the time investment being a mod requires.
---
Why add Servers for a Stresstest at all. For what purpose. I don't care if it's easy or not.
---
What is the reason to add 2 Servers within an hour, for what?
---
Really it exists because they make it about being Brazilian while being asshole toxic trolls. If it was just bad people who happened to be from BR people wouldn't care as much, but it's like a matter of pride to be toxic and terrible at the game for them for whatever reason.
---
You're correct, but 50k active players still means 10-15k concurrent players. That's more than 3x what a normal server supports. That's like Nost levels of players, which wasn't a great experience if you were there.
---
Wow, that is a really good 1-10 guide
---
I'm going to come back to this comment when layering gets fixed and say something along of the lines of "well that bug took them a while to fix huh." It will probably be after layering is taken out of the game by the year 2028.
---
Well it's up to them to change the perception of their community. They need to police the bad apples like they claim they will in this post. I'm not willing to roll the same server and find out though
---
It's more complicated than that, but you have to understand that in a certain since, a public entertainment company such as Blizzard is at war with their customers.  Because they want to extract as much from them as they can and they want to get them addicted to their content.  
---
Blizzard sees Classic as retrogressing to where they were 15 years ago before they were even made public.  It's a huge sign to investors that they aren't growing and their demographic is getting older and shrinking.  It's not a signal of growth, because how can Blizzard pivot Classic into growth?  They just can't.  The whole principle is that it's untouched by ActiBlizz.  Blizzard before acquisition.  They are explicitly forbidden by the customers to fuck with it and that's a big point of contention from them.  Don't think they don't realize that either.  This is their livelihoods.  It's just our hobby.
---
The problem is that there are players in the city, but the game isn't showing them because of something that may or may not be happening win the layer it randomly assigned me to.
---
Horrible isn't that harsh.
---
Why casino
---
I'm so torn between rolling here or on Pagle. On one hand, I've spent a lot of time on Wyrmrest Accord. I love the immersion and reading people's cool profiles/backstories. I like daydreaming about my characters and coming up with stories!
---
On the other hand, I never RP in-game and everyone else I'll be bringing with me isn't into RP at all. (They would be respectful of RP and think it's neat but they'd never partake.) I can't decide where to put us. D:
---
I think the ideal situation would be this: 
---
Start with a queue, and when it gets too high take all the players in the queue over a certain amount and layer that server. Keep the queue active, let players know they are in a layered server due to server constraints, and let them continue to queue for the main server.
---
There should 100% be a prompt to join the main server before automatically being removed from the layered server and causing nonsense like this. 
---
Maybe that's too complex, but the fact is no one likes the idea of layering and we are all alright with a queue as long as the queue isn't outrageously high. Layering should be the last resort, not the first approach.
---
No, it's actually not.
---
“Make America great again.”
---
“No, keep it shit, if u don't like it, leave.” ~u/chknh8r
---
Nope.
---
Haha, thats very kind of you but I must decline :-) I'm not the original author of the addon, I just updated it since there was a demand for it. Thank you anyway!
---
So even  with layering it’s a 10k cap before queues start?
---
We will have our highest population during Phase 1. I'm not saying that they wont add more servers than they have said they would. I haven't heard them put out any exact number of servers anyways. But unless there is reason to expect a huge surge of players to join fresh during Phase 2, there is no reason to make new Servers during Phase 2.
---
They will make more servers than they need in Phase 1, and merge them as they see fit in the following Phases.
---
We are saying pretty much the same thing man lol.
---
Rwanda, with a GDP of $9B ($750 per capita), vs. the USA's $19.3T ($60K per capita) has universal health insurance.
---
😂
---
People calling streamers/streaming community the toxic ones... "THIS SERVER IS MINE AND THAT ONE IS YOURS, WAHHH!! STAY AWAY REEEEEE". Hmmm, yeah totally not toxic.
---
Its like being Polish in Tibia back in 2004, Good Times.
---
I was all set to roll on a PVP server but I think that the PVE servers will be very underrated
---
What about all the people who will *start* streaming, no matter where they began playing Classic?
---
Yes they migrated servers to chicago and LA datacenters , I don't know if every server on that list is 100 % correct but the example I used definitely is as I just checked it. Eldre'thalas is an east coast time zone server the realm time is east coast, i have 90 MS to it from the east coast. That is not a chicago server it is 100 % an LA server.  
---
They 100 % have servers with east coast time realm time that are located in the LA data center.
---
I genuinely hope it works out for you guys. I remember how awful it was to play with the BR population on my server in vanilla/tbc, and almost every game I've played with a noticeable BR population has been the same, so it would be really awesome to see that culture turned around for the better.  I'm sure it fucking blows to be lumped in with a bunch of complete idiots, so hopefully this effort can change the tides a bit.
---
This is the based server,  the other servers will be more accommodating to the liberal ideology.
---
Thank you everyone.
---
Don't forget about the spanish community aswell, well the non-EU one
---
&gt; Equal level mobs give shards.

Yes, that's what give "experience" means in my comment. 
---
&gt; You can farm shards on trash if you come with a few.
---
Coming unprepared to a raid?! DKP MINUS!
---
&gt; If everyone needs to get summoned to your raid, get more locks or a better guild.
---
You only need one shard to put down the stone. 
---
&gt; You can kill mobs for shards while clearing mobs around those ore/herb nodes you need.
---
That's not going to get you full for raid night. 
---
&gt; It's fine. Really.
---
You're still spending 20-30mins more than other classes have to in order to be able to play your class. 
---
Then again, I suppose that's immersive?
---
Ide like to see if vanilla guide or tour guide or Zygor guides work.
---
Not everyone will start in launch day. Many might wait until weekend.
---
I'll be on Grobbulus with my handful of weirdos! I expect this realm to stay true to the spirit of rp, filling the goldshire in forever with weirdos.
---
And then you’d cry about how unplayable the game is. Whoosh. Full circle.
---
Right now I'm using the cast bar that comes with Dominos and its pretty good. I use quartz in retail and this is the closest I've been able to find a working addon similar to it
---
Man, that's tempting. Female Dwarf Rogue with gray skin and a grandma face, Undead Warrior with a missing jaw, Female Tauren Hunter that refuses to wear clothing...the possibilities are endless.
---
Yep we know. Whitemane and Herod
---
So it will be streamer and MAGA server?
---
Works for me
---
When was that? I was on the stress test as it opened and valley of trials was absolutely packed. Almost every scorpid/boar/imp was getting spawned killed. If you log in now, sure, it's dead. People leveled for a bit, some of em to cap, and then they logged off, there isn't much else to do.
---
X-Perl has been dead for ~5 years. Z-Perl has some fixes for Classic, but isn't working 100%.
---
Was wall climbing a lot last night, it's harder but still there.
---
What IS vegimite?
---
Not trolling but what exactly is everyone's concern with playing on a "streamer server" besides maybe long queue times? I'm genuinely curious since we're still deciding out server.
---
I mean yeah fans can be annoying but half the streamers will probably quit classic after a month tops to go back to retail/variety.
---
I have no idea, I guess i assumed not, hard to bieve only 12 people were in dusk wood.
---
Not all of them tho. Maybe the notorious trio aka esfand tips and staygay but soda said he wants to go Faerina and asmon actually said he wants pve no?
---
It definitely would but I actually tried to level multiple characters at once back in Vanilla and burned out real hard.
---
This time I'm going to do one at a time. :P
---
I've always used the default f keys for targeting group members while healing.
---
What should I be using for that instead if I change the f keys to mark?
---
Should I just rely on clicking party frames and using the clique add-on?
---
Depends on the times you'd wanna raid/do things. I'm midwest but go to bed early so I'm gonna roll EST so that raids don't run as late. People who don't get home until later in the evening might prefer rolling west coast so that their schedule lines up better.
---
RIP. Guessing they mainly wanted to keep the reputation of the Golemagg server up.
---
No, there are no queues with Layering besides queues to the login server which shouldn't happen beyond the first hour of launch. There is no population cap on a realm with Layering enabled.
---
Nah you guys aint gonna take Retard from us as well. We are slowly losing all of the age old golden internet insults to the language police.
---
Bingo.  If Classic WoW is successful, it signals that current Blizz is not.  
---
There's a post on /r/games that has a link to ActiBlizz financials.  Blizzard operating income is down 50% year over year.  They are under a lot of pressure with those kinds of numbers.  
---
With King pulling much better numbers and at least holding steady with revenue and income, investors are going to be asking why are we investing in Blizzard in the first place?
---
Just ask Thex for a heal.
---
I feel like race choice is a lot easier once you've decided your faction and class, kinda limits your choices lol.
---
"minuscule amount of power"
---
Censorship in general is anything but minuscule.
---
yikes
---
grob gang!
---
There's gonna be like 6 new servers opened within half an hour. Most of this is pointless
---
what movie is this from
---
There are a bunch of people, such as myself and friends, who roll on RP servers just for the better community. I am not against role playing, and I strongly encourage and support  it, but I do not personally RP in character all that much. 
---
Twisting Nether was a great RP-PVP server that I rolled on and everyone was fantastic!! No children spamming "Trump2020!!" in general, even though anything goes in general chat. 
---
RP guilds always did a great job organising events I would respectfully participate in as well, which made the server feel much more fun. 
---
Also, streamers won't be on RP servers :)
---
Yeah, RPGs are pretty neat. The modern version of WoW is barely an RPG anymore, so that is probably what you're feeling.
---
I actually really like streamers (even Asmongold although I know he’s reviled around here) but their presence DOES alter the in-game experience. I’d much rather see server celebrities and big names rise up organically, rather than knowing beforehand. 
---
For me specifically it has nothing to do with the followers, although I know lots of others feel differently.
---
His argument may be flawed, but I sincerely doubt that it is in bad faith - in stark contrast to your way of "discussing" things.
---
Happens to me too focking frequent on retail, did not happen even once in beta. Guess I got somewhat lucky
---
Because everyone quits their terrible expansion after the first month of timegated garbage. The level headed people see the treadmill in front of them with a set timer preventing them from spending too much time progressing plus the lack of content and bail. 
---
Classic wow has content for months just from phase 1. You have so many ways of progressing through the game that aren't time gated. So many enjoyable experiences to be had through world pvp, getting BiS items, maxing professions, leveling alts, raiding etc.
---

&gt; Ranged slot still not working.  
---
Thanks for pointing that out. I've fixed it now and will upload a new version soon :-)
---
I’ve haven’t had a layer switch in combat since the first stress test months ago. I had a bunch then though. I was thinking they had it fixed but I guess not.
---
All your energy has to go somewhere
---
Blizzard, build that firewall!
---
Real vanilla experience was getting disconnected from the server several times a night and getting frequently stuck in the loot animation because of database lag. Having to relog once in a while to clear some layering glitch doesn't that that horrible in comparison.
---
No.  Quite the opposite really.  Given that I'm here for a game that was made 15 years ago and BFA is hot dog shit.
---
Still happens in bfa lol
---
Wait South America isn’t getting there own server?
---
Lost faith in Blizzard years ago. Not surprised
---
Layering will NOT effect how many people are in zones. That's sharding. A layer is the same size as a server limit would have been. Your statement makes you sound like a smoothbrain.
---
 I get the same I wasn’t particularly interested in classic but I played it during the stress test and it’s so nice. So less complicated and so peaceful to just explore and quest no rush no race for levels or anything like that
---
layering got worse?
---
what?
---
If you don't believe him just leave the fucking discord
---
This won’t do anything lmao. They will roll on wherever server they want.
---
“We will stream snipe and camp them”
---
Good luck with their fan Zerg. 
---
I’ll just wait and see where they go. I’ve never seen so much drama before in my life.
---
So did he actually say 10k in the interview at chinajoy cause I didn’t hear it.
---
Am I dumb or can you not actually change the action bars at all with tukui classic? I was trying to figure it out last night during the stress test, but I cannot, for example, change the number of buttons on a bar, rotate a bar or anything like that.
---
$$$$
---
Spread the word.
---
It's not quite phasing, but there was a bit in highmountain where there is a bonus quest to disrupt the feltotem just before you go to kill their leader. There's a particular spot where there are things you can click on to progress the quest, but actually walking up to them takes you outside of the bonus quest area and despawns them.
---
No just go away.
---
Hell yeah. Honestly it’s such bull shit that we have to worry about where these guys are going to play. It’s giving me un-needed anxiety when I should feel nothing but pure ecstasy for the classic release. I wish they would just disappear.
---
"Apparently"
---
Here we go and...
---
(no link, no context, no receipts)
---
Figures.
---
(copied from wow forum, maybe you can help me)
---
I'm trying to set up Pitbull unit frames and encountering this error. I can’t get it to display exact health values on my targets. No matter what I select, the HP displays as 100/100 (seems to be showing me the percentage in absolute values). Only the player frame has an accurate health value. Every other player, NPC, and enemy I select shows 100 HP. Targets that take damage show the respective percentage out of 100, so a mob at 3/4 HP displays 75/100.
---
I’ve tried selecting different options but I get the same results each time! Which makes me think this is an issue that goes deeper than the addon itself, sort of like why spell ranks still aren’t detected properly by addons.
---
Mana values appear to be displaying correctly, though.
---
Any ideas? Examples below if you need a visual.

---
It depends on some weird stuff: some says I don't change shards unexpectedly at all, but then some days it happens like every 15 minutes for the whole day. Idk wtf that is
---
This is how I always do it. Function first, then appearance. I don't care how cool I look if I hate the way the game/class feels to play.
---
I’d just go 1900x1200 still good but not 1280 oof
---
They said it at Chinajoy, which is like E3 for China, which is the largest regional market in the world.
---
Get over yourself.
---
Why do you think EU servers are split into English/French/German?
---
It solves more problems than not.
---
You don't like gnomes, so roll a human. You really shouldn't pick a race you hate just for the racials.
---
Yeah, that's actually the only one I ever played and it was fine.  I was a pally though and literally beat a level 80 hunter at level 73.  So my experience may have been different.  So fucking OP.
---
This is such an absurd comparison people keep making. Of course retail leveling on a fresh character is faster and easier. You have 119 levels to go, you are in the oldest, outdated, least populated content in the game. If it was as hard and time consuming as classic, where you are in the newest content available, WoW would be the worst starting experience of any mmo on the market.
---
If you love leveling and want it to be a grind and a big part of the game, obviously you are going to prefer classic. We don’t need a blog from every player who feels that way.
---
The community wasn't decisive, Blizzard just has millions of fanboys that will defend everything they say without any thought, and Blizzard likely didn't account for that bias. Not to mention, it's not about democracy, it's about doing the right thing: remove layering.
---
&gt; therefore we have to blame ourselves.
---
You can blame yourself, I sure as hell won't because I've been fighting this shit since it was announced despite being called a crazy lunatic the entire time. Unfortunately, I was right yet again. I don't want to be right anymore.
---
You can really do whatever you want man, the more screens the better I suppose, but if you want what I think is an optimal setup, you can have your ultrawide monitor and then a normal 16:9 turned vertically to the left or right of it for stuff like reddit or a side window etc.
---
Ultrawide though is big enough to have two full windows side-by-side which is why I generally stick to the one monitor as its more than what I need at the moment.
---
china numba wan
---
No, that was TBC. It would drastically change vanilla however. Everything down to the way all classes gear, metas for both PvE and PvP, the classes brought to raids, boss strategies, etc. Basically everything
---
Here we go again with the stereotype reddit comments.
---
Some of us have leveled to 60 several times already and enjoy doing it fast. I know, shocking, others get enjoyment a different way than you.
---
Wooooooo! Already got my server and it's neither of those.
---
F
---
They should be forced on to PvE servers
---
But they shouldn't. That's antithetical to the entire point of bringing back vanilla.
---
Whitemane is way cooler of a name than Fairbanks. A lot of the streamers are pretty cool themselves but some of their following is pretty cancer.. not super excited about that.
---
Wow I love that art.
---
Streamers profit from chaos.
---
Its not blizzard talking to Chinese audience, it is Chinese company talking to them, foreign countries cant operate in china, you need local company owned by Chinese.
---
I think most people accept that there will be a dropoff in playerbase after a few weeks/months. Everyone can only guess at the numbers, but its a fact that if Blizzard built servers to house everyone at launch that some of them would would be dead before end of year. Only time will tell how accurate Blizzards estimates are.
---
They are looking like the weakest link in ActivisionBlizzard right now given their latest financials and under a lot of pressure to turn it around.  
---
When you go public, being successful doesn't entitle you to anything but being even more successful.  Blizz isn't doing it right now.
---
Use some mouse keys, if you don't have any use scoll up skull, scroll down moon, middle mouse - cross, shift+scroll up diamond, shift+scroll down - blue. other marks you can have on Fs, you need to have few marks on convinient binds so you can mark super fast, while moving and being functionable as a tank. When someone asspull or something bad happens, you ened to react fast, moving attacking at the same time. as you do all marks with one hand, click, mark, click mark, click mark etc.  and your left hand is compeltely free for everything else.
---
And as a tank remarking skull is pretty much a part of your rotation. 
---
so ya if you want an advice form me, use mouse keys at least for a few most important marks. cos in most cases you amrk not with tab targeting but with clicks, so your mouse will be busy anyways, and if you use left hand binds, for marks you become completely disfunctionable as a player for a moment. which sometimes is not something you can allow to do. as situations in game can be very different.
---
with mouse keys i able to mark the whole pack really super fast.
---
and when you resseting skull as your routine, since marks are offgcd, you can keep spaming your abilities with the left hand without distraction and while marking with the right hand.
---
rebind zoom in zoom out, on ctrl+scroll up scroll down. if you just have some mouse buttons use them.
---
I can't wait for the 28th when all the doomsayers will be busy enjoying the game.
---
Nah, Going PvE this time around. I have less time to play that 1st time so i don't want it wasted on corpse running due to gankers.
---
they really should have their own server.
---
Priest gets an innervate for every stack of mana pots they buy me
---
Not everything at Chinajoy was streamed or in English. John Hight did mention the 10k number in a written interview, but the number was already being quoted in Mandarin by several attendees as confirmed.
---
Doubtful... in terms of hardware there probably isn't too much of a difference between a layer and a server. I don't think the hardware cares too much whether it it runs 10 virtualized servers or 1 server with 10 layers.
---
&gt;  I have a hard time believing that one nationality is going to completely take over an entire North American server, given the huge American population that will be playing.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/blockchinese
---
I understand there is going to be a lot of everything, I just know that warriors are considered “god tier” end game and that everyone and their brother will want one. I also know that many will drop off due to the difficulty in leveling as well as many not knowing the joy of stance dancing. I just don’t want to be in a sea of warriors trying to get by.
---
They lied about that. There was never a plan on removing the layering.
---
Wow. They really need to get rid of that. I don't even care if there are waiting times. F u c k t h a t in classic
---
Yeah its unheard of that we want information on a product that was a love letter to the community.
---
I don't think it will grow as much, but of-fucking-course it'll be more popular for quite awhile.
---
Well, actually maybe it won't, because they decided to fuck up the entire point of vanilla by adding layering, so the game is certainly going to be terrible and most people will leave. Not because "the nostalgia" wears off, but because Blizzard failed to do their job.
---
strange, have you exited wow and restarted the clients? :/
---
That all goes without saying. Thanks for your input though.
---
Yup.  I did it once, never again.
---
don't forget retarded pseudoscience and religious bigots
---
Thighs 🤤🤤
---
Oof this takes me back, I'm actually starting uni this year (10 years late lmao) and Classic is coming out
---
You really couldn't lose here could you? If they fixed layering then you'd be just like "huh finally they fixed the thing". And if they didn't, as is what happens right now, you'd say "ha told you this from the very beginning"
---
This sounds like such a shitty point to have
---
Everyone has their individual roll and specialization in the process of bringing this back. You can bet your ass they're going to take every step possible to make as much money as possible. Factor in their work force, I'm sure the classic project might not even be the majority of the employees biggest concern right now. They have other shit to develop, and whoever decided the budget sure isn't going to go back to less convenient or more expensive storage for server space. The way these industries think has changed, before you would hear from those that worked or at least developed the base WoW game said that they all agreed to spend as much resources or time necessary to make just about every aspect of the game revolutionary, clever, and enjoyable. Over a decade later and we already have had games like WoW and the trade offs that are more efficient have been taken, and shit maybe they've just run out of ideas for retail. But check other corners, the entertainment industry, the movie industry, all filled with shit sequels and cash grabs. There's a reason half the popular games played are mostly dogshit and filled with lootcrates.
---
h1z1 was a great game before winnie the pooh and friends cheated the game to death.
---
Put the feral in the tank group for higher raid threat cap.
---
From having taunt for a class that can already tank?
---
I've been called delusional time and time again and I've been right every single time. I'd like to be wrong for once, but it ain't going to happen. You idiots are so gullible it's infuriating.
---
I like the effort, but the streamers have power and leverage over you. Nothing is gonna stop them from rolling wherever they want. I'm pretty sure they're going Faerlina anyway, because of what soda said in discord, tipsout's twitter damage control, and ziqo twitch clip.
---
Oops was counting the oceanic servers.
---
For fucks sake Blizzard.
---
Thats blizzard plan since day 1 that people here try to silence with "well they have to wtf do you want ?"
---
less actual hardware investment in more servers and just software support with layering that minimize the cost.
---
Hence why we get so little servers.
---
My bad, but it says layering in the title and what happens in the video is what I'm talking about.
---
Detect invisibility was always useful, gotta watch out for them rogue/druid ganks.
---
Played back in the day, thought RP was dumb.  Now I'm excited to be joining my buddy in Bloodsail Buccaneers!
---
Does it though? I leveled to 11. Echo Isles was full of people and I had to look for raptor eggs on the small islands. On quilboar quest I had to practically spawn camp to get the tags. Similar situation in the human keep. In the north-eastern cave mobs kept instantly respawning due to being killed so fast. In fact, any bigger amount of people and the game would be frustrating to play. Orgrimmar was rather empty, this I admit. But this can be easily explained by people not wasting their time on stress test.

TBH, I doubt you and your friends stick around.  I could be wrong but Classic is an old game at this point.  You will get a better experience playing games like ESO and FFXIV at this point.  I consider your demographic the least impactful in terms of population.  
---
But there are other people who have been playing nothing but WoW for 15 years now.  Millions of them in fact.  BFA is pretty much a disgrace to them and they will chomp at the bit to get back to what they initially fell in love with and play it all over again.
---
Skilled fury warrior is the most thought after spec for raiding, emphasis on "skilled"
---
Can someone explain what I'm feeling?  because this is exactly what I'm feeling.
---
What is it about classic wow that has me so hooked, that isn't in retail. By all accounts retail should be better , it's had 15 years of experience. There are more races and classes to choose from , and the questing has been streamlined with voice acting and cinematics, but why am I immediately bored when I log on to mechagon?
---
&gt;underinvest in servers 
---
While I get your concern, that’s really not accurate.
---
1) Literally all of their infrastructure runs on an internal cloud. The servers are already there and have been purchased. They can easily use the excess capacity from BfA, Hearthstone and their other failing games. 
---
2) Their “servers” are independent VMs. But as far as anyone can tell layers are as well. Based on what blizz has said about layering/sharding in the past basically takes the same resources to spin up a server that it does to spin up a layer, for the same amount of people. 
---
So layering doesn’t really reduce cost on their end.
---
I get being cynical, but in this case your fears are unfounded. They are likely just underestimating the level of enthusiasm and will have to add servers.
---
If you roll a dwarf priest you'll be the most wanted class/race combo in the game.  
---
For leveling priest is alright, just expect to wand a lot. A lot.
---
yes
---
Sharding is the one thing I despise the most on retail and if they don't get rid of layering in classic wow after 1 or 2 months I don't see me playing there actively. It's astounding how they think this is even remotely okay.
---
Love it. Was waiting for a comment like this.
---
Trimera for me. you?
---
? Neither
---
There was a fake screenie circulating that claimed thus, wasn't true.
---
Still 30, not 11
---
I don't really have an opinion on it because I dont know much about it... but why is merging low pop servers viewed so poorly?  Is it things like potential faction imbalance name changes for some?  I imagine economy could fit in as well?  
---
Just curious on others thoughts.
---
Sorry but I don’t believe you w/o proof
---
Good talk.
---
That is EXACTLY the fight I was thinking of when I made that comment. All you could hear is Stipe saying "I'm a world champ!" and the occasional shit-tier Brazilian fan booing.
---

---
Are you actually defending blizzards communication to their playerbase? Really? Ive seen more bluepost in 1 week of New World beta, than i have from blizzard the last 1.5 years.
---
But in the end i would like to play Warrior but everyone says it takes a LOT of time and dedication before warrior is actually good in pve and pvp ? I dont have the time to play scheduled raids and join raiding guilds to get the best gear unfortunately.
---
That’s good to hear. Really won’t have time to raid much, but still want to play a warrior and at least feel functional and impactful to the group.
---
Then don't overheal? It's not hard. You can of course keep some different ranks for cast time, but its no point in and of itself to downrank just for the sake of it. You lose efficiency, but gain some control.
---
Lol.  Blizzard has all of their names reserved for them.
---
I think I heard in an interview that they were only aiming for around 250k players in 2004
---
Here we go again with the bullshit hyperbolic posts saying REEEEEEEEEEE without evidence.
---
Links or don't, edgelord. Easy.

Why should I care what you have to say when you talk like this to people?

Weird how everyone wants to live here but also apparently hell on earth lmao.
---
You shouldn't speak your native language in public chat if it's not the language of the realm. That's obnoxious as fuck.
---
So we've got sharding, dynamic respawns, and too few servers. Super.
---
Can someone explain to me how streamers "take over" a server and why I need to avoid streamers in the first place?  I'm asking seriously.  I don't understand this debate at all.
---
Consider the time and effort it takes to level as well, not just end game
---
I for one have never had problems playing with them, and am looking forward to sharing a server with some good Brazilian guilds. I think it should make the server more fun
---
Yea unfortunately hes very wrong... it IS the majority that is that way... the ones who arent insufferable are the minority.
---
How will you streamsnipe them when they can just switch layers constantly to avoid you?
---
I hope you reported every single way you abused it
---
I had an online friend who had only played diablo 2 before wow, and was totally unfamiliar with 3d games. He never understood that you could move the camera angle by holding mouse1, and he had somehow accidently moved the camera to be directly above him looking straight down just as he logged in (in diablo 2 you move by holding/clicking mouse1).  
---
He made it to level 10 this way and called me up on skype(I was around 40 at this time, he started late) telling how this game was super overrated and shitty, since you could barely make out what was going on. After he explained his issue a couple of times (I did not understand what he meant), he managed to take a screenshot and send it to me. I think I laughed for 15 minutes straight, told him to hold mouse1 and push the mouse forward. Then he too burst out laughing at his own stupidity.  
---
Good times man, good times.
---
Watch Asmongolds stream for 30 seconds and you’ll understand what the issue is.
---
Cya
---
Congrats, you hate someone so much it's impeding you from playing a game you like.
---
I need to link it to every single person who said layering would be fine. Boom roasted.
---
Why are you surprised that communication from a company to their customers increases as we get closer to a product release?
---
Well I only meant they aren’t making enough servers and meant nothing about the monetary end of it, but thanks anyway for the weird rant.
---
Sorry, I like getting a paycheck.
---
I inherited a huge guild that had a crap rep on the server.  I tried instituting policies like this to rebuild the reputation.
---
It was a complete failure, people would report guildies that I was physically in the PUG on an alt and never saw the behaviour they reported actually happen.  
---
Hell, I had an alt they reported and I know nothing went on except listening to nasty remarks about the guild name the entire run then getting kicked at a loot roll because the item was a minor upgrade for someone and a major one for my alt.
---
Spent 6 months trying to fix that then when they opened up guild server moves, got it the fuck off that server with as many guildies as wanted to go.  Then it got better.
---
I'll assure you, the non-assholes aren't going to be on that server because they're sick of being associated with the rest of them.
---
Exactly, way better name then fairbanks
---
I don't remember this happening in vanilla.
---
I like my job too much.
---
Can someone ELI5?
---
Speak for yourself. 14 year old me stayed up every single day reading the wow website and the forums. I don't think any game or even any other piece of media will ever come close to how high my expectations were for wow.
---
It’s funny seeing people slowly realize that layering isn’t temporary at all. You’d think that it would’ve been obvious given how many times Blizzard  has changed their minds but maybe not.
---
We always had a shaman in each group and never really prioritized having two shaman in the main and off tank group.  Usually it was tank + warlock + hunter + shaman + off tank.  Then some melee groups would get a shaman, but they would be moved to caster groups when mana tide was ready to drop.  Then moved back.  Never got more than 8 shamans in a raid to double stack groups like you suggest, usually closer to 3-5 per night.
---
Deadmines is VC.

I uploaded some screens of my own. We seem to have wildly different comparisons.

Layers will be in the game. Get over it or don’t play.
---
Well which is it?  Everyone here on the subreddit is claiming Faerlina.  I guess these forum guys are gonna be bigger than us? At least more organized?
---
Do you work for blizzard?
---
Blizzard has not made a mistake unless we get to Launch and see all the servers overflowing and days pass with no new servers being released. That means blizzard has not yet made a mistake. But I get that you have to put all your anxious energy somewhere.
---
&gt; A pretty realistic amount of non English speakin
---
What? No... The thread in the official german forums had 26k replies. The reddit survey is nowhere near close to being representative. Look at the relation between european retail realms (english/german) and they're pretty close.
---
&gt;Iron forge is the best city in the game.
---
True
---
&gt;Horde have mud pits and sticks.
---
Rofl, true. Undercity is cool though.
---
Downranking should be used in dungeons pretty much off the bat. Many or most pulls in dungeons don't require the highest rank heal (even with 0 +healing), especially with the damage elites were doing in the Beta

We asked for a vanilla experience. Layering has no place in a vanilla experience, we're upset... Next time you order your favorite meal from your favorite restaurant imagine that someone took a huge shit all over it, now don't complain just eat it and smile. That's your mentality.
---
Not to say that you cant play warrior casually, but i would advise against it. 
---
It's a very gear dependent class that excels in group play, but struggles with anything solo.
---
Mage/Hunter/Lock would be much better for casual play imo

Obviously we need them sooner rather than later.
---
Message sent from other account.  
---
Wow OK.
---
of course.
---
It has nothing to do with hating them. I'm frustrated at their actions because they *know* the community is waiting on them to choose, and they aren't doing it.
---
I also am not avoiding playing with them, I'm avoiding playing with their ravenous tween fanboys. That's the real problem.
---
What about after layering goes away
---
No and i never said that. Im surprised that i have to read new information from second hand sources.
---
That's true. And now there's not and there are maybe 5-10 realms on retail that are truly high pop. Everything else is just a crossrealm illusion.
---
Does lightshope still have forums?  There were some good links there.
---
This release is working for me:
---
[https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bartender4](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bartender4)
---
Jk btw
---
A short temporary fix is ruining the entire mfin game. You’re a fucking failure at thinking logically
---
Not all pets do. I remember being amazed when pet swimming animations were added. lol
---
However, I did notice that night elves in Shadowmeld are not using the stealth animation. They just stand upright, in stealth. That's weird.
---
It’s a lobby where you can queue for mini-games basically.
---
Sure, they might. Just will waste players time if they don't confirm more ahead of time. I don't see the point you're arguing. They can obviously add more, it is just in poor taste to add it after the fact.
---
And what happens when your dead server gets merged with a streamer server?
---
Layering is fine
---
Don't even have to.  Two good pvp guilds could wipe them all day.  A few mages with the initiate and sapper charges could even wipe their horde of noobs.
---
/r/iamverysmart
---
&gt; I like alliance for the fantasy feel
---
Alliance has definitely the best in game tavern music
---
Someone else mentioned a 70k queue but didn't respond when or what time that happened when I asked.  Same thing with 3k disappearing at a time as they assumed it was making layers.
---
It's working for me... Maybe it's buggin' out with another addon you're using? Did you try disabling all other addons to see if you could get it to work?
---
Then you're also saying a community failed to form on Light's Hope with it's 15k pop?
---
They claimed Faerlina.  Hopefully, they don't speak enough English to know that's the streamer server.
---
Thanks for reply. and what about a priest healer for pve and pvp ? I lean towards mage or priest for my first character then
---
Fuck me I havent even thought about the fact that you have to pay a monthly subscription just to reserve a name before the game comes out ! and there is such a small amount of servers so the chances to get your name is even lower..
---
How the fuck is everyone ok with that ?! I dont want to pay a month of subscription just so ill be able to get my main !
---
It's not. We had a guy make an updated models patch for private servers and all the armor looked fine on them.
---
If you read til the end, I say that. Gotta read it all
---
If you're a casual with limited time then I wouldn't play warrior. It sucks to level and only shines when you put in the effort at 60.
---
Pick literally anything else and you're fine.
---
One extra level, or about 1.8 points in the talent tree for improved prowl (similar to rogue's improved stealth).
---
Personally I quite like it, feral builds have a hard time sparing the points to max out that talent, and sniffing out rogues is great since they're in a world of hurt once you get the jump on 'em.
---
Damn I'm not a BR but I want to be in Autismo SA
---
We don’t know. First Ion said launch day, then it was “first couple of days”, which then became “a few weeks” and their latest promise is “before p2” which means ~10 weeks. 
---
It’s inevitable that it’ll be left on longer than that, but there’s no way to know how long exactly.
---
Trolls and tourists who will be gone before Ph3, maybe even Ph2. Still upvoted for meme effort and the look on that first birb's face gets me every time.
---
Oh for sure. 
---
The basement of one of our abandon cities is much nicer than the rest of their trailer parks they call cities.
---
Thanks! I was able to move them individually, was just a pain since each anchor hides after clicking the next one - so I had to guess to line them up properly.
---
Many think they do. Yet many are like "yeah, classic is so much better", When you ask them why "uhh, it was harder, better... whatever, it is great".  
---
Most were there when it all started and the feeling was (and no doubt, will be) great. Yet we will never experience what we experienced back then, when nobody had any clue and addons were non-existing. Compared to this classic where it will be cluttered with addons from the start. Nostalgia is a cruel thing.  
---
And btw: when you only have to pay once for two games, why not?
---
If the streamers come to Herod, they'll be stuck with me, not the other way around.
---
Don’t worry, RP servers won’t be popular enough to be merged.
---
good to know where I wont ve playing
---
The vast majority of the day 1 players are going to leave because nostalgia wears off.  They're going to take 3 days to only hit level 15 and say "wow this sucks more than I remember" and just not play again. 
---
I have this sour feeling that classic is going to fall down because the real core playerbase in a year's time is going to latch on to some small issue that they think  blizzard didn't get quite right (even if they're wrong) and quit.  They'll say "blizzard just didn't get the classic feeling I remember" and then go back to their pservers with 10x exp and real money bonuses.
---
If you agree it’s a pointless comparison, why did you post it?
---
For me the issue was simple. In old wow we used to just be wayward explorers immersed in a world. Sometime around / shortly after wotlk we suddenly got transformed into these omega semi lore gods being champions of some famous lore characters and sent onnthis amusement park esque story rollercoaster. We were no longer allowed to just be and explore. The game shifted away from that. And thenphilosohy shifted away from that. Instead of opening a vendor in a random town to see the sell some cool rare alchemy recipe, I’m now being told to grind daily quests and shit.
---
There were of course a ton of poor design decisions blizzard incrementally made over the years. One or two weren’t a big deal. One or two every year eventually became a big deal. The movement that got us classic today started with people pissed off over tbc design direction. But the main thing that lost me was what I described above.
---
Then go play on private servers. You won't though, since you're still here browsing. There is no community on a server with 15k pop.
---
Yes. Perhaps one mountain. But not the mountains we see now.
---
Then again I was speaking for myself. And many others. But not everyone. You have to put your energy somewhere.
---
Are you delusional? Classic won’t get half of the 2006 sub numbers even if it was perfect.
---
Imagine trying to convince ppl that the worlds cultural, economic and military powerhouse is a shitty place to live lmao.
---
yeah but LCDs can look a bit crap when running at non-native resolution. at least with 1280\*800 4 pixels on the display represent 1 rendered pixel exactly. it is only a 13" screen so still better ppi than a 23" at 1080p (\~114 vs \~96)
---
So you're mad about them shutting down Nost, and eventually coming to terms with what the community wants and providing is what we've been asking for for nearly ever since BC released?
---
A Classic WoW server and community that is not run by corrupt GM's creating fully rank 14's out of nowhere, selling gold, banning people they don't like, the constant impending doom that your server may just cease to exist at any given moment?
---
I was part of the 200k+ that signed the petition, so that I wouldn't have to put up with that crap anymore.
---
Thank Blizzard for making Classic, the real rose tinted goggles are the ones who think Private server's were the best representation of Vanilla. And this is all coming from someone whos played on Pservers for nearly 6 years.
---
I am considering it too. Using one of my 3 character reserves for the RP server
---
LMAO
---
Ja, stimmt.
---
It happened to me while fighting the world boss in Nazjatar this week. But it seemed to be the whole raid that got switched rather than just one me.
---
Apparently fixed in the latest version, so just download it from the repo again.
---
I admit it was only up to lvl 5 but this morning I was taking on three mobs at a time with a warrior in northshire. Felt weird.
---
You really think it will go away? There are 2 pvp servers. 
---
Vanilla had like 40+ pvp servers I really don’t remember the number but it was high. It’s pretty obvious they have planned the servers around layering throughout. Or do you disagree? What’s your take on it?
---
And people still claim linux is easier to use than windows . This is a huge wall of text, thanks ofcourse for the support to make this , but god damn.
---
Bedore you downvote me into oblivion my official automotive diagnostics software and suspension geometry software is only supported by windows so no im nnot a brainwashed pc peasant.
---
If this is true then we can expect ~20k on each EU realm? Not on launch, it will be more extreme, but 2-3 months after release
---
Exactly, I feel like there's much bigger potential issues that could arise. Certainly more important than this.
---
No. It is not too late to change. Delay the release. Problem solved.
---
If you can’t handle how it should be, go play retail. End of story.
---
Meanwhile EU players rolling on the other US East PVP servers to avoid queu.
---
Mage&gt;hunter&gt;warlock&gt;paladin&gt;priest&gt;druid&gt;rogue&gt;shaman&gt;warrior.
---
Feel free to offer your own tier lists for most casual friendly class
---
Conditionals are very restrictive in Classic macros, and there's no way to store state or use the current icon as a conditional in your macro.
---
It can certainly be done with an addon, though. Ready to learn some Lua? :)
---
Imagine being this entitled that you think you can claim anything like this or attempting to force anyone not to play where you want to play. Honestly i hope all streamers pick Herod out of spite, because it would simply be fun to see the reactions of all the entitled people.
---
How many diehard fans do you think chose *not* to play the August 8th global test? Because the data from that test is what Blizzard used to determine the number of available realms.
---
Alexsensual was right all along
---
Almost as if no one is gonna stick around for a crappy stress test when the game releases in 2 weeks. Lmao you guys can't be this retarded right?
---
Legit crying about the game is empty during what is essentially a demo?
---
If you are fighting over monsters with 3 other people, and they get invited to a group on another layer, what happens to them from your perspective?
---
But why Whitemane?  Aren't there streamers from EU planning on rolling with them?  Isn't playing on a West Coast server going to cause issues for them?
---
you do realise. you can just ya know, walk away from them right? wow is a big game. most likele unless you attempt to snipe them you will very rarely encounter them
---
1) there aren't enough servers to go all " this is my server you can't be here" 
---
2) you can't force them to join another server and you can *literally* do nothing abt it (oh you'll camp them big boy? yeah join the stream snipers )
---
ps: I just want to enjoy playing classic, don't care if streamer / non streamer server ( which again due to low serv count there will always be a streamer on your serv)
---
...which part of her is thicc?
---
What subreddit are you on?  This community is fine. If you want to be with streamers go there.  Nothing is stopping you.  Many don't and we have decisions to make and this makes it easier for us.  Get over yourself and quit opining for the poor little streamers.
---
Do you think they used to transmit the graphics and animations to you over the interweb using your dial-up? Really?
---
Or do you think that, just *maybe*, they're part of the thing that's installed on your computer, and what the server does is tell your client when to activate the weather that is already installed on the client.
---
Some people...
---
Thus the 99%
---
they're just players.. everybody wants their names. if someone reserves a name they used for 10 years on a server with streamer cancer they'd be mad too. plus as the other dude pointed out, any streamer worth a salt that has a following is in blizz's pocket on names
---
A few different things:
---
* Population impacts of a streamer/their fans quitting, making the falloff hit that server harder
---
* The streamers will likely be throwing events, which some people might like and others might want to avoid
---
* Like you said "INVITE TO ASMON LAYER" is very annoying.
---
Correct.
---
Emergency was perhaps the wrong wording from the OP... But big heals are, more generally put, for high intensity healing situations only.
---
Tanks can spike 100-0 in a couple of seconds in certain situations like Scarlet Monks, enraged Scarlet Myrmidons, stunning mobs, sundering mobs, AoE pulls or large pulls before party members get their CC off or resisted. In each of these situations the healer can probably already prepare to use a higher rank heal so it's not exactly "emergency" but it's not the norm, just something you use when you know you need to.
---
That’s why I said 99%
---
But if you are casual, you obviously don’t need to compare with other people especially during leveling on how “good” your class is.
---
Warrior without healer is going to suck regardless of gear in both PvE and PvP.
---
Incorrect.
---
been trying this too. same here
---
Not if you have a pvp focused guild equipped for aoe damage.  Their horde of shitters has no chance against a group of determined mages with engineering combined with a follow up attack from the rest of the guild.
---
Upon discovering this news my entire guild has decided we are going Herod. 
---
We're a bunch of neckbeards from the Lights Hope pserver. We were/are one of the biggest and most hardcore guilds on that server.
---
I can't promise you that we will be 100% successful in repelling the streamers, but know this: If you're serious about keeping them off of Herod, you have a gaming community of 30+ neckbeards for sure migrating to classic on your side. At least 4 people are quitting their jobs to try to get 60 by week one/two.
---
We all hate streamers and are all more of the old head mentality. And we're stubborn. We will join you in repelling these idiots off of our server for the betterment of our community and classic experience.
---
 I won't reveal who we are to avoid becoming thex'd but I will see you all in game. FOR THE PEOPLE!
---
It won’t be the last time, better get used to it.
---
If you do, please understand that it is still a RP server, don’t troll rpers and ruin the server. This happened a lot in retail, non rpers joining Rp servers then making fun of/ trolling people rping.
---
Emerald dream 🐐
---
Tantrums aren't discussions
---
Asmond wants the scarab lord title he’s going to go somewhere different because he’s selfsish Like that and won’t have the other big horde streamers to get in his ways he’s probably playing along with the other streamers but going to do his own thing last second.
---
I mean, I thought the streamers were being pretty nice telling everyone what realm they were going on. They never told anyone they can’t go on that realm they just wanted to warn people wanting to level normally it might be difficult with all the people there, that’s all.
---
I was a mod for a popular video game forum. Eventually my powers were revoked because I was far too cautious in when I applied them. I have the opposite problem. I hate using power in fear of accidentally abusing it. If only most people reacted to power that way... would be a wildly different world.
---
I really hope this works out and they change peoples minds a little bit about Brazilians. I feel really bad for the majority of BR players. Most aren't awful, but they get lumped together with the minority (imo) that is just the worst.
---
1 thread is being made every minute at the moment. You could choose any topic and write any comment, yet you had to spend that energy making a negative comment.
---
Yup, keep defending layering retards!
---
And?
---
That something that happens to you a lot?  People in the middle of fighting a mob accepting invites on another layer?
---
Interesting. 
---
I resubbed for the first time since 2008 yesterday.   And since I couldn't find any of my old game keys or account, I bought a brand new one.   I played for many hours on retail.  As a warlock with 0 free resources it took me a good day (12 hours)  to reach lvl 22.   (I did waste an hour or two in nonsense like the darkmoon faire) 
---
I must admit I am surprised by how slow some things still  go.  Tailoring, Cooking,  Enchanting , I tried various things but after a day I am still only skill 30 or 60.  And I thought you would be nearly lvl 60 after a day.  Did they slow it down again?  
---
Other observations:     Lowbie economy is non existent.  Everything is insanely prized and targeted at rich lvl 120s.   But that also means you can earn hundreds of gold by selling some lvl 5 items a new character.  
---
Exploration is pointless.  Everything is Quest Scripted and if you lets say enter a cave and encounter a named mob , killing it is pointless.   You don;t get anything and you will be forced to get back once you did the pre quest.  It's almost always a little chain, Kill 6 A, Gather 8 B,  Kill 12 C, oh done?  now go there and there and Kill leader D.   
---
No adventure left.   
---
After one day of playing, I have seen enough.  Classic it is.  Someday I might check out some high lvl content, but it feels like 'a time playthrough single player game to me'   While vanilla is still interesting to me after 6 years of playing.  I still have never played a paladin or shaman
---
Putting energy into crafting the experience to come, I get that.

Br and SA are not same servers....
---
I'm going rp pvp to avoid (hopefully) alot of the streamers and possibly restricted layering (doubtful) but I'm not looking to rp specifically. I'm just hoping for an overall less toxic and elitist crowd. That said I will be looking to be competitive in raiding and pvp.  See you there

I just threw something out of my ass at /r/classicwow.
---
But idk, blizzard trying to fit all the players that they will recieve on the few realms (13 across US and OCE) that they will have for classic into all these layers.
---
Or the streamer riding herod hype train with their cult followers right behind them overwhelming the ''normal'' players with ''INV TO ASMON LAYER''.
---
Pick 1 :D
---
Addons were non existing? This is not true at all. Plenty of people used addons, I even used them and I was around 9 years old when I played vanilla. Classic is better because it was harder? It's better because it's the complete opposite of retail. Theme park MMOs are boring, MMOs where it makes you feel like you're actually a part of the world are fun. It's harder, but that's not why it's better. It's better because it's actually quality, devs poured their heart and soul into vanilla.
---
Do you know which one they're choosing?
---
Is this broken? Or is this how it actually was in vanilla? I didn’t play shaman then.
---
"They hated him because he told the truth"
---
We don't really care about Korea, downvote me all you want.
---
Here we go. Was a vanilla experience also tens of millions of players at launch? 
---
Around and around the circle we go. Wee
---
Yeah, I can tell...
---
Fairly certain there's a bigger one that this established.
---
Doesn't bode well when "Autismo SA" is top of the list.
---
Jesus this is toxic. You cannot stop someone from going to a server, streamer or not. More likely than not you will end up on a streamer server because there are only three EST PvP servers. Unless you want to play on a BR or Spanish server, get over it and play the damn game. The amount of REEEEEing I see is actually unbelievable. Grow up and just play the damn game.
---
yes please, everyone go to whitemane
---
And what? I translated OP's post, I didn't give my opinion on the matter.
---
There has been pservers with 10k players every day, and no layering. Besides the lag it was fine.
---
No matter what the tech can handle vanilla game requires a vanilla server population cap. Why would we want to make changes to the core mechanics of the game?
---
I'm referring to about a dozen US streamers.
---
Just like in real life
---
Shadowed Unit Frames is what i'm on the look out for. It has a "quick fix" on the Willitclassic website, but it's somewhat broken ingame. Party members don't display, and has bars for "unknown" randomly placed above the player. 
---
Also, Auctionator is a perfect alternative until TradeSkillMaster comes out. Auctioneer I feel is the internet explorer of auction addons and it's simply used because it's always been there.
---
Are you saying you’re not flaming blizzard?
---
Really just roll what you like, personally i'm on the fence of warrior or priest maybe shaman long term. Just don't have the time to put in for alts as i once did. I enjoy healing but also enjoy tanking, dps is always good to. Warriors will be the PvP class along with rogues, they will have the ability to 50% someone in 2 hits. But just roll what you like classic is a long term game. First  3 months nothing grand will be going on besides hitting 60 doing 5 mans and learning the game.
---
I was wondering if they were gonna make a return
---
No we don't need to cause strife. We need to make this well known so it can be a priority to be fixed before launch.
---
They've already said it's only temporary, a few weeks max.
---
&gt; North American server
---
Yeah, im more skeptical than ever before. Few servers, which means hundreds if not thousands of layers, how are they gonna deal with "removing layering after couple first weeks"?
---
"Many of us won't go back to retail because we haven't played it in years." 
---
   More like we have played it in years and it's terrible.
---
Of course im not going to harass anyone.
---
I hope so! This is my last “favorite” that I haven’t got working for classic.
---
1. There will never be enough healers.
---
2. No matter how popular the class there will always be demand for skilled players. 
---
If you're worried about being sidelined, read guides and git gud. If you're better than the other priests, you're the priest they want.
---
I got to the point of making a macro answering all the stupid questions being asked in chat over and over that I would hit maybe once every ten minutes.
---
It rubbed a lot of people the wrong way.
---
15k pop? Seeing the amount of available servers I'd say we will deal with 50k pop here. Also do you mean during Classic times? Obviously not an issue because there was no layering.
---
Imagine having this much blind faith
---
Guys. Layering is here to stay, the amount of servers available clearly states that. Find another issue to fight because this one isn't budging, at all.
---
Nah. I love playing on a server where people can pay real money for instant 60s, or x5 exp rates. And there's nothing like sinking months of time into characters that might not be there tomorrow. That's just the bees knees.
---
At least people aren’t being ruined by debt whenever they get sick. And I’m sure the care is as good as the States. And even if it isn’t, at least they’re doing their best under hard circumstances together. The fact that The US probably could give everyone in their country the best care in the world because of their wealth yet don’t is morally damning beyond any shortfall in Rwandan care due to triage.
---
Pretty much.
---
Barrens chat will be filled with all sorts of memes on every realm. Even the RP realms. You cannot escape that
---
Right? It feels like there’s no surefire winning solution. Maybe they’ll add another couple realms at least to help. Then they won’t be dead down the road either (or at least not as bad as if they’d added tons more)...
---
You got flamed by inbreds with the very same mindset of those who flamed people asking for Vanilla prior to Classic's announcement: Blizzard Whiteknight Shills who cannot critically think for themselves.
---
We called this out ever since we heard about it in the interview, and these people who defended layering are equally to blame.
---
World PVP is so much of the fun in classic and u lose it on a pve server
---
Still not going anywhere near Thalnos. They should have their own servers
---
How do you do the night elf skip from barrens to sentinel hill?  Is there a video somewhere?
---
Yet when you ask tryhard guilds, only about 10% was on the stress test. Now count the non tryhard fans that also didnt participate and do the calculations.
---
Imagine getting this triggered over something that the dev team knows and agrees with.
---
Its 45% total.
---
That's so shit they can't speak there own language on a server.  Murica!!
---
I thought North Korea was PVP?
---
1. Any progress you have made within a week or two wouldn't be worth the money to transfer realms, just move on and make a new character if you don't like the server.
---
2. if you're suggesting that after a week or two your character is so baller that you DO need to transfer it, maybe you should be streaming your play....and BECOME THE CANCER.
---
Wow, you should take off the tin foil hate every once in a while and really start to enjoy your life.... this is beyond insane.
---
$6 for gametime or you translate it to days of that gametime
---
What's your point?
---
That is solved, if it even is an issue (classic will be far more popular than Blizzard is estimating) by combining dead servers together. It's that simple. You don't need layering bs.

“Naughty secrets! I’ll tear them from your flesh!”
---
Sadly, you're right. Outside of WoW community this launch means nothing. Even simple threads on this sub will get hundreds of comments where as big news posted in other subs (like /r/pcgaming) will get 50. 
---
The majority of hype is coming from people wearing nostalgia glasses, people that play pservers and have no idea what it was really like, and tourists from retail.
---
People log into it for the stress tests and are amazed at how "populated" it is without realizing it's because 100% of the population is in the starting areas. In 6 months when people are spread across all zones/levels/dungeons/raids it's going to look a lot different. 
---
I'm looking forward to playing it again but I'm also aware that the game isn't going to get the attention of millions of players. Honestly, a year from now if 1 server is considered "high pop" on the NA servers I'll be surprised.
---
"It's alright guys don't worry, they have everything under control and layering will be fixed before launch"
---
It's mostly text to describe what your using each item for.  It can be combined into just a couple commands for simplicity.  I broke it apart like this so people would understand why they are doing each item.  
---
You do you, I enjoy my Linux freedoms and control, and it's nice having an OS that's not spying on me for profit.
---
What? 
---
How is your op relevant to the, lol, leveling competition. 
---
I’m not playing a 15 year old game for the 2nd time for the competition—I’ll raid mythics to the best of my ability if that was the case. 
---
I’m trying to have fun—leveling alone is more fun.
---
dont reserve your name then?
---
It was never like that though. Classic launch isn’t comparable to anything that happened.
---
You're going to see that on any single server the streamers roll on, it honestly doesn't matter. You are underestimating the amount of disdain this community has for them, warranted or not. It won't matter if it's Herod, Whitemane, or Faerlina, organized legitimate pvpers will absolutely grief them regardless of servers.
---
That's only for phase 1 at most. Not to mention the stream snipers can switch layers just as easily by spamming "inv to x layer"
---
When the game was vanilla it was still a fresh concept and experience for everyone. Everyone was doing the leveling grind for the first time and everyone had no idea what was in store in the future. Classic is the same experience again, which, to me, means players already know what's going to happen, which will lead those who only come back for that nostalgic feeling won't spend the long 70+ hours getting to 60 and will probably stop in the 40s. Population will dwindle eventually enough so that I'd give it a few months (3-5) of layering before population is low enough to remove it. It's been said before but I think that's what's going to happen.
---
I realize that. It was just actually seeing it was kinda a oh shit moment. It’s suppose to be gone after a few weeks right?
---
Streamers don't want to be ganked/camped repeatedly
---
&gt;and say "wow this sucks more than I remember" and just not play again
---
You're right. But it's not because the nostalgia wears off, it's 100% because of layering. The game is going to terrible the entire time it exists. Community? Nah, not happening. The #1 most important part of vanilla won't even exist. Of course people will quit.
---
No more thanos server for me
---
In peoples defense, it wasn't supposed to work like this the way Blizzard explained it. You weren't supposed to just be forced out when you're with friends in a group.
---
I’m on Smoko!
---
I think it’s Luna.
---
Thats because sharding is different than layering dude. Its been months now, you should understand how layering works at this point. If you go to Boralus, you will switch shards from the one you were on in Tirigarde Sound. If you go from Elwynn to Stormwind in Classic, you will not automatically switch layers. 
---
Sharding thresholds in BfA cities are most likely different than the rest of the world. There's no competition for resources or mobs there and Blizzard has an incentive to pool players together to make it seem lively.
---
How is a one time issue with names worse than layering, which will literally ruin the main aspect of an MMORPG
---
You polled every single guild that's been organized before launch and found that only 10% played the latest test? I don't believe you.
---
Ah yes, what players want is entirely meaningless after all.
---
/s
---
Yeah it was fun to work with, albeit a challenge.. not much info on using non-geographic maps
---
anything &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; warrior
---
I think the majority of people don't care if you stream, it's the "big" streamers that people are afraid of, without naming any. 
---
They don't want to play with these guys because of the potential negative impact they can have on the in game stuff, like population imbalance, or economy issues. I mean wherever they go, the 50,000 followers are going.
---
This guy isn’t raging at facts, he’s raging at hypotheticals.
---
They can go with the brazilians. Make that the latin america server and leave everyone else alone.
---
If you feel your name is worth the money at a chance to get it.. than do it. If not than pick a new name. Wow op..isubbed again to test it out this go and get my add-ons all set. Worth it.
---
The only way I see layering will be removed without causing the realm to face an already overpopulation, is to simply add more realms before launch, or within 24-72 hours after launch. Because I can't see people liking the idea of tossing a character they spent time on, grew some kind of attachment to, made a social circle with the people on the realm. And If you're in a guild that is intending to compete, wasting that many hours is gonna set you back in the leaderboards.
---
That's not how **login** queues work.
---
If i had. Nother laptop i would def go to explore linux
---
How do I do that?
---
You're only screwed if you want a common name, but common names are shit.
---
I have played a lot of Retail, but have little to no Classic experience. I am looking forward to Healing in PvP. Dungeons, and Raids, and then farming extra gear for DPS and Tanking rolls at the end game. Does anyone have advice or a guide on how to level as a healing Druid? Do I play as a DPS spec and heal in dungeons and pvp when I can and then respec into healing at max level? Do you level as a healer, do you swap constantly when you want to dungeon (I think respecing is expensive in Classic, correct?) Any advice on the flow and order of playing a mostly healing Druid in Classic would be great.  
---
Also would love to see any resources anyone has on playing a Druid in classic in general. Also looking to heal World PvP and Structured PvP if and when it releases. Thanks in advance!
---
They'll just get a rez and continue on wont they?
---
They will never get rid of layering. You can quote me on that.
---
If they don't they should, it would solve this entire issue.
---
Hehe, that might be what I have to end up doing.
---
Ah dude, I remember you French Canadians from my days in Guild Wars.  Yes, you have the same thing where you insist on speaking French, but I would say generally, you aren't as bad at games as BR.  Nor as easily prone to griefing.
---
Yes invite your competitor to your party, what a great immersive argument. You are a bootlicker lol. Hope it's satisfying, idk what having a smoothbrain feels like, but I imagine the complacency is rather satisfying.
---
To be fair, it's not 2009 any more.
---
A modern server has way more memory and more cores.  It also has SSD not HD.  A single 2019 server is the equivalent of 4 servers from back then.
---
This is the solution
---
Important to note that while this tool is awesome and a great effort, it's meant for level 60 and specifically for raiding. You also likely have no or minimal +healing while leveling. So use it when you're 60 but to answer your question while leveling, downrank in dungeons to avoid overhealing and to avoid letting your tank's health drop low while waiting to cast a max rank heal
---
How is it obvious?
---
You and your like are the very reason why gaming today is straight horse shit. You keep defending garbage decisions until it's too late. There's a lot of folks like you, and Blizzard thinks it's okay for that reason.
---
Had you all said no from the start, they wouldn't have proceeded with this.
---
Congratulations.
---
Who's the artist? For my research study.
---
You pick a server dude?
---
You said yourself. The experience is so streamlined. Retail constantly reminds you that you’re playing a game while in Classic you are an adventurer that’s part of a world. While classic has numerous MMO and RPG elements, retail has simply become a lifeless video game that contains neither of those two elements for the most part.
---
Pvp server is the only way to really get the frustrated vanilla feeling
---
Lol no, if anything, it proves we are actually toxic and racist af, and nobody wants to deal with other nationalities
---
Inb4 mods delete this thread
---
Was looking for this earlier today. Lets hope that someone can update Quartz for classic API :-)
---
Exactly. I thought that's how it was intended to work, so the initial zone or two on launch day wouldn't be 1k+ populated. After a few days, they'd turn it off even in these initial zones. Apparently not, Blizzard is sabotaging classic deliberately. No other explanation for this (outside of incompetence only comparable to monkeys inputting random commands).
---
No good Na east servers now guess I’m playing west coast now
---
Most streamers and community leaders try to maximize impact on that community.  
---
He's just saying that he knows that he and his streamer cohort will be able to impact every aspect of that server's community. From raids, to pvp rank waitlists, the auction house, world PvP etc...  
---
He's aware of his power over the server, and saying so directly.
---
As opposed to pvp realms where they can do the same thing. Correct?
---
Big news lol
---
If they're streaming launch day, which I absolutely assure you they are, then we'll know exactly where they are from the moment it starts anyways. It's not like they can hide.
---
no idea what you're talking about
---
This is the dumbest thing ever.
---
Please never post again.
---
Yeah, having all the friends you made over phase 1 spread out to a bunch of new servers sure is better than merging dying servers.
---
LOL BRALNOS. Has it even been 24 hours yet?
---
That's why a lot of people rolled on RP servers back in the day even if they didn't RP.
---
If they reset them, then nobody would reserve them in the first place. . . You're not being very logical here, bruh.
---
i dont mind memes, i mind cringe twitch memes which is largely promoted by streamer culture.
---
Imagine a company/business giving priority to people they know are going to pay for their product. Crazy word we live in.
---
PvE servers are boring as fuck. Dont do it
---
Jesus...
---
You're wrong.  Ganks happen, but its not like you really lose anything when you die.  If someone is hunting where you're trying to level then you move someplace else.
---
can you link to that
---
Were you under the impression that you had to play arena? People can play classic to not play arenas, whether they're there or not. It's just something that could appeal good players to pick up classic as well, no downsides.
---
RemindMe! 2 months
---
Wrath came out in November 2008
---
Before you start playing classic, log onto retail and go to lights hope and you'll see
---
I'm still here browsing because I don't want to give up so easily. If layering is permanent, I'll either go private or just not play at all. I'd bet the vast majority of people who quit classic will do so directly because of layering.
---
&gt;There is no community on a server with 15k pop.
---
No, but there's more than you will ever get on a layered server.
---
thats an odd way to spell fairbanks
---
I've noticed that I get placed in combat if another player pls something near me even when I'm not I a group or interacting with that player.
---
You good?
---
It's a lost cause.
---
This is the new paradigm and everyone must play knowing it.  Even if they say they will go to a specific server they have every right afterwards to create a toon on another server if they feel the move will generate viewership and engagement.
---
Oh, they are telling us their server on monday? Well, I did not know about this. I don't see how I'm being immature, though. I dont feel as if my post was immature, but I guess you can feel about it however you wish.
---
so this escalation people is talking about it does only affect pve? end gear pvp still good then?
---
Mousing over a mob is kinda buggy. A bit low on the priority list right now, but ill take a look
---
At start, there was no addon. I mean, the first few weeks/months.  
---
Ok, that is your opinion and I can kind of get behind this, yet I have doubts that many will confuse "poured heart and soul into vanilla" with nostalgia. If not: great, if so: can happen. Anyways, it will benefit retail and classic that the other one exists. We can agree on that?
---
I don't think it's what you lose--other than time.  But "just go someplace else" isn't as trivial when you have no mount and somewhere else might be a looooong walk/series of flights.  I like the idea of world PvP, but not while I'm leveling as much.
---
I will quit the second they continue layering past phase 1. I want one world. One community. I want to see everyone.
---
Aggressively merging low-pop/dead servers would have been a way better idea.
---
Yep.
---
Are we talking about how we define tryhard guilds? Thats kinda offtopic to what we are discussing. They sure intend to play on launch day, but many did not intend to participate in this stress test. Let alone tryhard is only a small % of the playerbase. Many non tryhards didnt particiate in this stress test either
---
Well, that is one option I suppose. I'd rather do something and making things happen, though, rather than just sit around and "suck it up."
---
&gt;I don't want to pay them for something that will go to waste until the 27th.
---
Me either, but I'm fine with being named Characternamee instead of Charactername.  Also plenty of fancy accented characters to chose from, whatever I have the name myself I'll be fine and my game experience will not change, if you're so butthurt over someone "stealing" your name that it's really bothering you this much then pay for the privilege of choosing early.
---
Wtf blizzard naxx was a wotlk raid, why is it gonna be in classic phase 6?
---
Except RuneScape has streamers and it doesn’t dictate anything.  It took 3 years to get a specific item added to the game.  It’s ok, you’ll be one of the early ones that quit when you run out of content.
---
Hey Navak, how do you do this barrens to sentinel hill skip?  I'm up in the moutains on my night elf right now and can't figure it out at all lol.
---
I play retail more than any other game. There are some amazing players from Rag, Quel’Thalas,  and Azralon but when things hit the fan in RBG or M+ and you need to communicate it becomes near impossible a lot of the time. Now is someone who doesn’t speak your language going to be fine in a 40 man? Yeah, probably, but if you can avoid a potential headache why wouldn’t you?
---
I've played Horde since 2004.  I feel like playing alliance in Classic will give the game a whole new feeling.
---
Who decided this?
---
As a Mexican player is very sad for me to see how badly portrayed our community is, and how hard it was to not be ostracized for being from Ragnaros.
---
Had a few great experiences with US guilds to the point pf raiding constantly with one group, i’d wish you give them a chance, there are as much bad players in any side of the conversation.
---
&gt; They sure intend to play on launch day, but many did not intend to participate in this stress test.
---
I'd like to see the data on this.
---
It’s a bit strange I admit. But people are eager to get their favorite name so they don’t care.
---
Oh, so you’re bitching about something on Reddit when you have essentially zero information? Go figure .
---
It sounded like a whiny child calling for a boycott because they aren’t getting their way.
---
Rep gain is a good point, though it doesn't play an active role in raids. I don't think starfall is a thing in vanilla, but if you mean starshards, it's not a DoT but rather a channeled ability like Arcane Missiles. It has 100% scaling with spell damage which is fun, especially since arcane wrath gear is dirt cheap while lvling, but yeah, no role in raids.
---
I don't watch twitch at all, but I'll make an exception for the future content:  PVP guild on a Killing Frenzy! Streamer &amp; Fans chased and killed all over Ashenvale
---
I get that. But I doubt their vision is to have a number as low as 5-10k players active on the pvp realms and around the same amount on the pve realms. A vanilla server can only have around 3k people before it gets flooded and messy without layering. Maybe 5k if you are really pushing it. 
---
Because that’s what they can support without layering as it is right now (per region)
---
Even if they expect 90% to quit it’s still not enough to remove layering. 
---
Guess we will have to wait and see but I and many now believe they are planning on keeping layering. I think the amount of servers prove that. It’s not just a low amount as in many will quit. It’s such a low amount that even if it flops you will have to keep layering  or split the servers.
---
My god if these crazies put this energy into politics you might actually get something done that matters.
---
It's more mana efficient to wait. It just requires more skill.
---
According to the Spanish forums they’re appear to have changed their mind? Mirage Raceway looks like the choice for Spanish speakers.
---
Inspect the thigh region
---
Latency won't matter. Back in the day we have 1k+ latency and 3 FPS.
---
Well, streamers on a server will be impossible to ignore. There will be rippling affects all over the server from their fans and it will be impossible to get away from them.
---
I am trying to not care about the streamers. If there was a definite server I could go to to not care about the streamers, I'd happily roll there and never mention it again.
---
Well, to be fair they did announce that before BR claimed Thalnos.
---
They control where we go, because they don't care if we also play on there server. This is a one way street.
---
I suggest you man up and stop whinging about the possibility of being slightly inconvenienced by having to wait to find out what server streamers are playing in. It's pretty pathetic.
---
Yea, I'm not suggesting it's the best thing they could do. But it would be better than new servers only coming after launch once people have already started levelling/made connections in the community etc.
---
We'll see, it's just a hunch.
---
The alternative would be to aggressively merge low-pop/dead realms when and if they happen.
---
Anyone supporting layering is in essence anti-community.
---
That's a yikes mindset to go into a game with.
---
Very original post, 10/10
---
Spanish have settled on Mirage Raceway after all, based on what I’ve read on their forums?
---
They're hopeless.
---
Sorry for the late question, but you seem very knowledgeable about classic addons. I generally prefer to leave most of my UI "vanilla" and then modify the bits that I don't like slightly as well as add new elements that are "in the spirit of the vanilla UI"...
---
With that in mind, are there any addons that will:
---
1. Allow me to move the position of and change the size of each of the individual UI elements on my screen? (e.g. increase the size of the stance bar buttons + move the stance bar buttons more towards the middle of my screen). I've used MoveAnything before, but I can't find it for classic.
---
2. Add another row of action buttons (without altering/removing the vanilla action buttons). The row should have variable amount of columns. I used something called "G15 Buttons" back in the day, but it hasn't been continued / ported to classic.
---
Apologies if any addons like this exist in your list already! I looked through all of them, and none of the descriptions seemed to match.
---
Layering will be in the game. Get over it or don’t play.
---
Servers will be added if necessary. Get over it or don’t play.
---
..uh yeah it's the competitive pvp mode.
---
If you think arena players suck, that's because your rating is shit. If you're at a rating when you're facing shit players, that might be a sign that you're also shit. And that's not an insult, just explaining how the rating system works.
---
Yeah, the leveling process is long but Vanilla raids are extremely basic compared to even LFR in current WoW.
---
Eh, you can play normally on RP-PVP servers. Just don't name yourself something stupid and don't be rude to people roleplaying. That's it. The community is great.
---
That's gonna happen no matter where they go.
---
So I just checked out both discords.  Think I'm going with the one organized by guild leaders that didn't post asking all of its members to come advertise on this thread, lol.  Oh, and that isn't your discord.
---
Anyway, I don't know why there is a discord power struggle.  Maybe I should make a third one?  For 25+ y.o. only?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/comzc5/psa_hunters_first_pets_must_be_learned_from 
---
I think this topic is the investigation into this.
---
This is true. That is why I am trying to incentivise them not to do this, but it seems that everyone else has just resigned to letting them do whatever they want without any recourse from the players while in reality, these streamers would be nothing without the players and the viewers. It's unfortunate, really.
---
So it's about the ratings and rankings then? I guess I just don't see why that is what matters over having fun dueling people that you choose. Why not just duel people and identify the good players?
---
Though I guess it doesn't fill the 2v2, 3v3 etc niche
---
You want screenshots of me asking some guilds or what data are you looking for?
---
This is what I’m thinking.
---
At your side, m’lady.

**What is layering?**
---
Layers are virtual servers **the same size** as what a server limit would have been.
---
This makes the "I would rather have layers than fight over quests with 500 people" crowd especially retarded, as laters do **nothing** to remedy this. With layers there will still be 500 people per popular race starting zone.
---
Layers are basically scalable extra servers, at a very slight convenience over more actual servers.
---
"What's the alternative?" "wAhT aBoUt mAi NaMeZ?" You might say if you managed to rub your glorious two brain cells together.
---
Well that would be resolved easily by having groups of servers per region and type that share naming limitations.
---
Example: East coast could have 20 PvP servers, with names limited by groups of 5, and within those groups of 5 whenever 2 dropped below thresholds they could be seemlessly and automatically merged.
---
"bUt WhAtS ThE dIfFeReNcE bEtWeEn ThIs aNd LaYeRs?" You may ask if you literally are incapable of critical thought.
---
Well to answer: with layers, the active players you interact with slip in and out of your game world and is extremely immersion and community breaking.
---
With this proposal, the active people you leveled with and play with **will never change**. From a players perspective you will never have friends in a different game world, just suddenly a large injection of new players will appear. That may be slightly disorienting, but no where close to what layers will do to the game.
---
The only discernable reason layers exist is the same reason people still don't know what layering is: people (including classic developers) can and will be stupid, and still make it into decision making positions through nepotism.
---
Layering is only downside vs intelligent forethought and more physical servers, as the alternative is just as automatic and hands off as layering is intended to be.
---
Can you please tell me which part of my post is crazy and why?
---
If that were the case they'd not start counting down on the sub until the 27th.  Blizzard wants an extra half month's worth of sub fees, that is totally what this is about.  There's going to be a bunch of cheap bastards like myself that will not sub until just before the servers open, so how many people preregister is going to be a poor metric.
---
Don't they usually merge two or more low population realms?  
---
That's not the same as deleting.
---
But how else can I feel superior over retail babies? I was playing on nostalrius way before 8.2 was even released!
---
Economies won't be as negatively effected because the items on each server will have separate owners, with laying you can have 1 player for example gather the node on every layer. More items is fine if they are distributed between more players but laying allows individuals and small groups to abuse it. If the servers are low-pop then the community will already have become quite shallow and they should welcome a merge and the fresh faces they will see from it.  
---
It's not a perfect solution but it works.
---
Streamers aren't the problem. The Twitch crowd is, and there's no way they won't get themselves banned from Grobhub.
---
Here's the problem, and I'll admit Blizz without question knows this shit better than I do, however, I still believe 11 servers is not enough to hold the long term population of this game WITHOUT layering, fwiw, that's probably barely enough to hold the total subscriber base of this subreddit, which I'd bet does not encompass everyone that plans to play or will play classic.
---
If you are OK with layering long term, I think virtually all of us agree that is unacceptable, then sure this is fine, but otherwise there is a really good chance this won't be enough or even close.
---
so just the people who want to register a name on the 12th are fucked, nice
---
I do not understand this viewpoint to be honest.  You're going to completely quit the game just because you can't see every single person on your server all the time?  Hundreds of hours of solo and instanced group content, guild relationships, etc thrown away because "Well, I couldn't see that shaman that one time when I was level 12"!
---
I need to bleach my brain after that comment thank
---
Gibt's schon nen PvE-RP oder PvP-RP server?
---
&gt; You had it right over a decade ago blizzard.
---
Uh no, launching too many servers is what got us server mergers, which no one likes, and cross-realm zoning, which no one likes.
---
Layering has very little to do with keeping starting zones playable, that is just a byproduct of the real goal, which is allowing every realm to have the healthiest maximum sustainable concurrent population for as long as they can.
---
I don’t think you understand the ethos of pride. Imagine understanding what you said.
---
Rep gain is extremely useful for the fire/nature resist recipes that will be used in MC/AQ. Yeah, my mind was failing me about the name of the spell and the mechanics, thank you for the clarification.
---
Oh a layering post with 2k upvotes. Finally.
---
This is the problem. Streamers are being completely unreasonable. Oh well. If they want to join the non-streamer server, then... let the hunt begin I guess.
---
Yeah, Runescape is way different in a lot of ways. Sometimes you want a popular server and you go on that one cause it shows you the numbers too, but sometimes you want to farm and grind and you go to a low pop. Theres just so much more to that system
---
Im ready to get disappointed
---
Not cool, why we should endure such punishment only because we are closer?
---
Normies PepeLaugh... they dont know
---
Fuck em dude. All this server reserving is bullshit. They say this server one day and the other server the next. I’m just gonna go on Pyrewood. There’s no way a bunch of spanish will dominate the whole fucking server with only two english PvE servers in EU.
---
dandonfuga. I bid you good luck in your studies!
---
Es wird keine deutschen RP Server geben. :( Tut mir leid.
---
I plan on playing a feral druid in Classic and PvP is my going to be my main focus.  However, I am having a hard time deciding between Night Elf and Tauren.  Which of the two would have a better advantage in (world) PvP and why?  Thanks.
---
Fuck this has me worried
---
They can’t but streamers can?
---
Layer will get removed in phase 2. You can't have world bosses and shit with layering because people will farm them.
---
I'm worried about the lack of horde guilds i've seen on this server.
---
Okay I understand there’s literally no way for it to be exactly the same. But saying layering is a good idea is beyond me, it would be much closer if there was no layering at all.
---
I'd have to disagree. I see plenty of avenues where this can lead to economic success for Blizzard, which is inextricably tied to pleasing players to keep them subbed. I doubt stakeholders would ever approve this venture if this project didn't end net positive. It's also worked very well for Jagex with OSRS.
---
Glhf on launch :-)
---
Listen we all finally have the chance to make a night elf hunter named "Legolas" like we always dreamed dont take that away from me
---
As long as layering is for a limited time, I'm happy with it. If Blizzard takes actions against abusing it for crazy farming, perfect. But: it just needs to be disabled after phase one.
---
I already have a mistress

Yes, I'd like to see exactly how you arrived at your conclusion. Exactly how many players did you ask? Exactly how many said they intend to play on launch day but are not playing the recent test?
---
Because I do not believe you at all.
---
Yeah, the more appropriate comparison would be the game I had more experience with, Tales of Pirates, but it's fairly unknown and a relic of the past.
---
this... actually might not be a bad idea, to avoid the cesspool streamer cults. just gotta think real hard about which weird language i can suffer the most
---
It's a money grab, but I don't really give a fuck, not paying it, but am slightly surprised by the number of people that are.
---
&gt;Mods here and on discord actively delete layering threads/posts frequently.
---
Why the disingenuous framing ? The stuff that gets removed is low effort drivel. 
---
You're making it sound like there wasn't an option to discuss this. Since the sharding announcement during Blizzcon we had a lot of good threads that talked the topic to death. We even had a sticky that had a shit load of traffic. 
---
Threads like this stay up, because they have value. They showcase a bug. All of the stuff I have seen being removed was "DAE layering bad &gt;:(" threads that didn't want to engage with arguments.
---
It's actually kinda ironic, because I think big parts of the mod team outed themselves as hardline anti-layering.
---
Can anybody confirm if it’s the same for druids or not
---
Did someone actually ask if they could send gold from their bfa character?
---
I'll put my Ally alt on Pagle. My horde main on Mankrik
---
Oh except for personal liberties and protected free speech... hence why people from all over the world flock to the United States to try to create a better life. 
---
Since when did it become so cool to hate the United States?
---
There have always been unofficial forums, even before WoW was released. All Reddit is is just another user created unofficial forum. 
---
Also, even though it was not popular, Reddit was created in 2005 while vanilla was still retail, so there's that.
---
You haven't played with much of the BR community have you? A decade ago the benefit of doubt was given that most must not be so awful to play with that it seemed like a joke. It was soon realized it is just that community.
---
Personal opinion? Yes.
---
Doesn’t matter. Both end up wearing cloth in the end. As long as you’re a hot human char you’ll be accepted in raids
---
Can and did.
---
Vanilla wow is very unforgiving in world pvp. If a single guild wants to ruin a streamers entire day, they can easily do it. There's no running away on flying mounts, 99% of the areas are fully pvp flagged, and the TTK (time to kill) in vanilla is tiny so they can kill him easily.
---
&gt; be /u/abrftw 
---
&gt; trust Blizzards word
---
&gt; 2019
---
Just lmao if u think any part of this will be smooth
---
That's not the argument you made previously, you said was it an issue if I couldn't see other players at low level because there's other content to do. It's also missing the obviously issues like in OP's post that makes the world feel disconnected and how it ruins the economy and rare items/spawns because people can abuse it.
---
Doesn’t matter still not playing there
---
If the gankers are happy just killing them once, sure.
---
I actually think it’s going to be a big problem for some streamers. I’ve seen enough of the internet to know that some people just like to watch things burn.
---
I agree, it adds an awesome feeling of danger to the world!
---
Can't wait for YongYea, Jim Sterling and It'saGundam to shit all over Blizz when FO76 2.0 happens.
---
Iron ore will be the two shot explosive shotgun of wow classic.
---
What you described is basically layering.
---
Didn’t pick up on the Druid, no idea who that was! Well played bud
---
We're going home guys.
---
To play on any of the other servers that doesn't have all the big streamers with an obnoxious fan base.
---
I mean, I'm south american and I have never played in a SA realm in retail, realm name means nothing.
---
You realize they remade classic purely to make money off it right? They're a business 
---
The issue at hand is that they promised a genuine classic and what we're getting is not
---
Think of it like false advertising
---
Nobody knows.
---
Ok enjoy your anger.
---
Every heard of Hollywood? The Blues? Hip Hop? Rock N Roll?
---
Then don’t play. Your family is more important than a video game.
---
I’m speaking harshly here, but you have some serious growing up to do if you can’t recognize there is a problem with the things you are saying.
---
Ya until they complain that you stream  sniped them and blizzard bans you
---
It's not like their whole raid is gonna stand there and not kill the gankers lol
---
That's what they say: "Best way to get rid of your enemies is to make them your friends."
---
Have to agree this is a show from over the ocean
---
Modern wows end game focus
---
Or just layer and then no need to merge.
---
Sorry mate I could never play on a PvE server. It's PvP or bust for me
---
Gotta love those exceptions, huh?
---
fuck layering
---
I'm guessing this is a one step at a time type of thing with Blizzard.
---
Dude. I literally just said that.
---
Calm down bro.
---
I don't think it'll be all that bad leveling up. There won't be a honor system in place so you won't have a ton of people trying to hit rank 3 for the mount discount.
---
I’m sure many people do.
---
Imagine conflating "not the top of a metric" with "being a shitty place to live" lmao.
---
Lol. All we ever wanted was what was already on private servers but to host by the actual company themselves but apparently that's too unreasonable of an ask
---
Even discussions of alternatives were deleted. When you do that, what kind of quality of discourse do you think you'll be left with?
---
I wonder what Blizz's stance on behavior like this will be like when its targeted towards streamers vs. just other players.
---
"very old and mostly forgotten game" you gotta be fucking kidding me, do you realize how huge wow was? are pacman and super mario brothers "mostly forgotten games" because they're not as popular as they used to be?
---
So your issue is that you don't want to have to reroll. You don't want one hour of your gaming experience to go to waste?
---
That's just asking to be left out.
---
This is a STRESS TEST and they are TESTing layering.  If this is a bug, yes it needs to be fixed.  But they are most likely moving people around layers to STRESS TEST the layers.  I don't mean to imply you don't know this, but most people have overreacted to blizzard literally TESTing their game in a STRESS TEST.
---
Are the streamers waiting to announce because of name reasons or something else?
---
Well this is clearly a launch issue, so just report it and be done with it.
---
I'd literally never played wow before 1 week ago
---
Yup, total fanboy.
---
xd
---
They've yet to announce any servers for Taiwan, but they will come.
---
No one knows. No one plans years in advance before the game is even releases.
---
I know right!
---
I assume their countries chose a language quite a while ago.
---
I think the Portuguese did when they colonized the country but idk
---
There won't be 50k people online at the same time, nor will there be layers created for 50k, and you are also pulling that number out of your ass to make yourself angry. Light's Hope is a private server with a 15k population playing at the same time. By your logic there is no community there.
---
Mage might be the most casual compatible class there is. Everybody loves their food/water, sheep’s and ports. Plus you’re a damage powerhouse. As always, be a hot human female and you’ll be accepted in any group.
---
Reply to me when you have data for 500+ people and tell me the results.
---
They said most likely East Coast PvP and said no Thalnos or Fairbanks, which leaves Faerlina and Herod as the most likely picks. If you want to avoid streamers, Herod is one of the worst choices.
---
Each individual person on the RP PVP server contributes to the experience there. It's not a scene. It's what you contribute to it.
---
Don't be retarded
---
Yep, I reported them. I don't normally report bugs, because most of the time, other people already have. But since our guild will be using this a lot in raids, I wanted to help out. \^\^ (Plus, nobody else had reported them, so I felt like someone had to.)
---
some streamers, not asmon, not sodapoppin
---
I second this
---
Lmao what a moron hahaha
---
And because there's two for launch certainly means there will only be 2 even if both have 50k queues each for 6 months right?
---
You aren't necessarily screwed. You get to take that chance
---
Holy fuck
---
Damn
---
They aren't being unreasonable, there's a very limited amount of servers and not every streamer wants to be on servers with certain other streamers.
---
You seemed to defend blizzard, I don't
---
They're a greedy company that only cares about money
---
Judging by the pepelaugh it's some dirty memer streamer shit.
---
The same thing happens with e.g., progression EQ servers. People show up when a thing is new, play for a bit, and get bored and leave. 
---
It's not unique to MMOs, either. This is how game releases work. The highest pop numbers come within a couple weeks of release, then slowly fade to a steady state.
---
Remove layering offer more servers. It'll all be fine after a couple weeks
---
Quin is from New Zealand lol.
---
Thatsthejoke.jpg
---
Ah yes cause when you want to message someone on your server it’s nice to have to add
---
 -whitemane.
---
If they were going to merge them I’d rather they fucking merge them than give us the BS that is connected realms.
---
Note to self avoid the m'lady server.
---
If you don't want to be in danger while leveling, go PVE
---
How do you know it wasn't happening on purpose on test realms?
---
Can't you just solo it by kiting him to guards?
---
I hope blizz doesn't take streamer side with wpvp. Gonna be strange times ahead.
---
&gt;god i wish i was west coast
---
WHITEMANE PST CHADS RISE UP!!!
---
He made his name by being that. He was a toxic no lifer and people loved him for it. He's toned it down now that it threatens his income
---

---
UI, what is it? Where find it?
---
It has nothing to do with being a bad Shaman or a good one. You should cast the spells that are required to make your raid group successful.
---
Only bad raid groups require Shaman to cast anything other than Chain Heal. Druids are better at healing tanks and Priests are better at covering the raid.
---
“I just said that”
---
“You seem to defend blizzard”
---
???????
---
Like are you being serious with me right now?? Or do you not understand that what you are saying makes no sense?
---
That's exactly what I'm trying to do... I want them to inform us on what server they're playing so I can plan with my friends on what server we will be rolling.
---
That you'll pick and choose what's acceptable. In other words, you're a weenie.
---
Level cap on stress test is 15. They don't have hellfire that early
---
basically, streamers should be allowed to pick a server and force people to play other other servers but an average player cannot ask a streamer to play somewhere else because they can literally change the server dynamic
---
Moron
---
Just move across the country try for classic, duh. /s
---
I don't see any subscription option for less than a month, which means I will have an active subscription for 14 days I can't do anything with, since I don't have the latest expansion(not that I'm interested in playing it).  
---
Being subscribed for 14 days still costs a lot more than $2, it's half a month so about $7.50 assuming I only take a month at a time.  
---
I really can't follow your logic here.
---
Yes. They gave us classic. We wanted vanilla. Two completely different games.
---
I use it as my PC wallpaper, 
---
thank you it's really great :)
---
Ooh, 500 people. A completely worthless amount and yet you still won't prove it.
---
Why would he go to whitemane when the others are not
---
This is all Blizzard's fault. They could have handled this
---
You’re calling me a kid after this whiny ass post? Lol, ok.
---
Have fun with layers and with the current server list, you won’t be getting what you want and that makes this all the more enjoyable for me. Thanks for playing.
---
Oh no, we spooked it! Everyone, scram!
---
Mate, I hope you are wrong. It's gonna fuck up the EU launch so incredibly bad.
---
Remember, Asmongold can’t put an ikea bed together without almost passing out.
---
I live in what's essentially little Brazil in Massachusetts. I love the people, love the women, the food, and I hope this effort works because it would be great to say I love gaming along side Brazilians.
---
I'm still staying the fuck away tho because I'm not sure how much impact this will have. Good luck tho and I hope I'm proven totally wrong.
---
It's just unfortunate that LatAm didn't get their own servers.
---
Inv to Asmon layer
---
How is 10 failed dying servers eventually being combined into 1 a better solution?  How is that better for the community?
---
Which streamer?
---
Nothing. Blizzard says thanks for playing, spawns Kel'Thuzad in every major city, then shuts the servers down for good.
---
and on pve servers you don't have the choice.
---
So toxic to want what was promised wow
---
Almost as bad as all the wow hippies acting like a stress test is giving them convulsing orgasms just walking around mulgore. That shit is more annoying than the trolls...
---
Do our feral druids get dropbear form?
---
Yea, classic might keep company alive.
---
But that's not enough. They want all your money, not just $15 each month, ALL of it!
---
Exactly. Most people don't know what the words racist, or racism, actually mean.
---
INV TO ASMON LAIR
---
Pure Speculation
---
Why would stream sniping be a ban offense?
---
lmao unreasonable? its unreasonable for you to "Force" a certain person to a certain serverget off your own high horse instead of complaining about them being on one. Fuck me i hope to not be on a "streamer server" but this is just dumb
---
You asked 500 people and didn't keep records? Now I really don't believe you.
---
It doesn't. In vanilla, the size of the text didn't vary depending on the targets distance from you. In Classic, a max-range spell shows a tiny little number.
---
I think Pagle will be my home !
---
i already know. i played the beta for almost 2 months leveling a mage, warlock and warrior. And its really not even close to as big of a deal as people make it out to be. Most of the clips are incredibly misleading, showing swings and dmg numbers after damage has already been done. making it seem like taurens can hit you across the map. you'll see when the game comes out.
---
Undead priest but starting in the orc zone for the mount rep! That extra travel time is probably going to fuck me over in my server first wand journey, but I'll do my best! Going to try farming the human castle in Durotar and also trying to buy cheap cloth and "flip" it for more with wands. Kinda pointless since that low amount of silver will be eventually irrelevant, but it'll be fun af!
---
because others are not
---
UI is TukUI (TukUI 17 enabled in options)
---
Im going tank feral i dont give a fuck what you say
---
Why so afraid though? Seriously chat will be a shitshow anyways by the number of server we get so just fucking corpscamp them 24/7 their comunity doesnt matter after a week or two
---
Starting to sound pretty entitled there m8. Streamers don't owe you a damn thing. Nobody does.
---
Is this the incel server?
---
I'd say it's easier to find someone that hates something than likes something.
---
Bind mouse side buttons to shift and alt or ctrl. Hold that and any key feels comfortable.
---
The OP said they were in Amsterdam, so the top part is for Amterdam time. 
---
The event is happening at the same time globally, so the countdown is just to when that is. Time zone wouldn't change anything about the countdown, because it's that many days/hours before the global event (the only thing that changes is what time it will be for you when that countdown hits zero).
---
actually worrying about where streamers play instead of just enjoying the game I actually feel bad for people like this :\
---
I mean, you will have times where you get parried, dodged, parried, then miss and die cause of it. But it's much more important to play what you want. It's a long way to 60 no matter what you play, so if you pick something because it's more "casual friendly" not cause 6ou want to play it, you might end up switching losing even more time.
---
Come on man...
---
Yeah they gonna ruin the best server
---
Is the Sound still really spooky when you Enter the room?
---
You could say the same about retail wow too though, and it's clearly not true. The modern game feels very hollow.
---
completely agree. Strange that this seems to be a minority opinion on these boards.
---
Shhh, dont give up the secret best server. Let the spergs roll Whitemane.
---
I do care, because Asmond is a dick and I refuse to be in his guild, and as a hardcore raider I'd really like to see my guild compete for Scarab Lord this time, but his guild is going to have so many resources and have so many epople giving them literally everything that it's pointless to try to compete on his server for R14 and world firsts. How do you not understand this? It impacts everyone.
---
All of the lfr/normal pug community is awful to play with.
---
Join a guild and stop blaming a race of people for your shitty groups.
---
Yes but Wotf and trinket is on seperate cooldown. Plus a Warlocks main weakness is rogue and warrior. Horde Orc gets 25% stun resist which is god mode against warriror charge, kidney shot etc. 
---
If you are going to focus on pvp there is literally no sense is going alliance warlock over Horde Orc Warlock. If you want to roll Alliance you choose mage over warlock.
---
And not everyone was playing from minute 1. People drippled in slowly over month.
---
Why not use the servers from the people that made vanilla friends?
---
Plus they can just get those names again on the new server.
---
Exactly. The word racist is so misinterpreted and misunderstood.
---
Wow. 
---
That is unbelievably fucked.
---
I am happy they are trying to do this.  But it is 10 years too late.  Any server that they are on, I won't be part of.
---
Why?
---
I'm so tired of seeing this response. No, how about hope for Blizzard to make the game better rather than just telling people to leave.
---
[Classic Aura Durations](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25006-ClassicAuraDurations.html) is the addon you are looking for. It adds CC timers to portrait frames.
---
So who's account are you trying to steal?
---
Yep, didn't wait around to see if they mentioned C'thun though monkaS
---
Add seasons like diablo 3
---
Not sure what to expect just relaying what someone else said for a queue number or if that is even accurate.   I must have been in the first layer because I never saw a number like that.  Logged out a few times a few hours after launch and I got 1500 and then an 1800 queue.  About 10 min wait.  Like I said I don't know what time he claimed to see 70k but I was only logging in the early afternoon could have been a ton more at night.  Or it only made me queue for my layer if there was a huge number of people.  No idea.  Take what you will for what it means in the long run.
---
No but he’s clearly fucking you.
---
They'll remove it after the launch. If you had like 50 servers and all the players were split between them, they would all die after 4-5 months when 80% of the playerbase will be gone. With fewer servers and layering it's easier to gauge how many servers they will need.
---
The original vanilla players know that the game is a long haul though and not a quick hit to get their slot machine jimmies in. They may not play all day every day but they've been waiting to play this long-term for a fucking decade
---
Did you watch asmondgold's beta? And that was with only a few people getting into beta. he's going to have 100+ people following him everywhere giving him everything he could possibly want, what are you saying it doesn't impact the economy? It impacts everything. Anyone on his server has no chance at R14 on his side, and has no chance at Scarab lord.
---
Exactly. Communities formed over time, organically, there was much much much less of the fear of missing out, a feeling like everyone else was already so far ahead that you would not be able to have any fun.
---
Just like retail!
---
You can as gnome so I'd assume you can on dwarf aswell.
---
Here you go: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IaTNhUcXY0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IaTNhUcXY0)
---
yup, fairbanks
---
Go horde, it'll for sure be less horde than Ally :)
---
Out of the group I'll be playing with I'm the only one that regularly browses reddit.  
---
That's 1 out of 8 people... and even I'm not subscribed.
---
It's an older playerbase and I imagine my situation is similar for a lot of people.
---
I couldn't care less about name reservation, but something that worries me is the server population cap. I won't be subbing early to create my character ahead of time, so what happens if all 3 US East PvP server become too crowded and get locked by Blizzard?
---
Surely they would have to create extra servers, but then I would be forced into a server that may or may not populate properly, and I'm not subbing to WoW to play on a low-mid population server.
---
The brain is the most important organ in your body... according to the brain
---
Same here, only played late in vanilla and in TBC though. But amazing server and great people!
---
GROB MOB
---
When people won't listen won't fix and won't change tantrums are all you can do
---
Merging servers still keeps the original community intact, no one dissapears onto different layers WHILE playing. 
---
All merging does is create an influx of players at one point, which sure isn't ideal, but still miles better than layering. "But but what about players with the same name!!" we've been over this and on how to prevent it.
---
I know what he said.  Read the rest of the comments in the thread.
---
I hope they make proper hero classes, like mountain king, blade master etc.
---
Shadowmeld is for stealth eating/drinking and it's OP.
---
&gt; if anything I feel like they’re tempting streamers even more to play there.
---
4D chess, if they tempt them to all be contrary pricks and go there out of spite then theyve still succeeded in quarantining them.
---
And by getting this conversation started early and publicly then there's a good chance that itll be resolved before classic comes out so people can make more of an informed decision for themselves.
---
Yeah I am rolling a shaman so I have everything I need there. But you are going to grab all the flight paths on the way so. If you really want to take the first 10 there you just fly to ogr to train... obviously not ideal but a work around
---
And he responds to me in a DM:
---
“enjoyable for me too. Your peepee’s still small.”
---
Lmaooo, ok kid.
---
Can't say for sure as it's been a while since I've transferred from ED, but from what I recall it's pretty much a pure PvP server now with little to nothing in the way of serious/quality RP. If there's any RP left there it's probably in select few guilds, which is obviously quite limiting as not every character will fit or make sense in every guild.
---
No, but beside from your idiotic strawman it's clear Blizzard thinks it knows what its audience wants more than the audience.
---
I've already played on a private server, I'm still undecided about classic, but the main benefit is that it's properly supported and I won't have to fear my character being suddenly deleted. However, as it stands right now, the gameplay itself is definitely objectively worse. Classic wow has layering, private servers do not.
---
&gt;Definitely not, it's arguably worse, 15k pop on one "layer" is and was a fucking nightmare.
---
Get ready for 50k people megaservers in classic then. I don't see how you can possibly defend this.
---
For an Australia-hosted server, yep. Not much global attention however
---
No streamer is forcing people to play on other servers. Full stop.
---
Their name being taken is part of the consolation prize that is their twitch fame.  Sack up and live with it.
---
He’s such a piece of shit.
---
Thanks for that, I am from NC and wanted to roll on an RP server and got bummed that Grobbulus that Pacific.
---
But having the guarantee that you'll stay in the same fucking universe with your friends as long as you're logged in
---
I've always wondered if the nelf stealth/prowl boost is even high enough to have any real effect.
---
This thread is such a saltmine, in both directions
---
I feel like with so little sergers your going to have to play with some streamer and his followers.  Try and remember that the streamers and followers are still just people trying to play the game too
---
Nice, hopefully we have a healthy population on Arugal.
---
How many respondents did the survey have?
---
I personally don't care if I'm on a server with them, but I did find it odd that they essentially told people that do care, "Hey, you can have 1 server. Here you go, are we not merciful?". If they really wanted to help the community they would just announce their server and give those that care their choice back.
---
The thing that makes you a dingus is insulting said person because he likes something that's not a part of vanilla so he's a retail player.
---
I've used it for leveling on the stress test, and it's great! I do wish that your progress would get stored somehow. So if you accidentally close the tab, you don't have to spam the 'next step' button to get back where you were.
---
lolmao. They deserve praise for doing their work because what, their work requires a higher education than sitting on your arse? If they were curing cancer, absolutely, but get a fkin grip dude.
---
Grob mob hell yeah
---
Wow that's lame
---
world of togglecraft
---
There are 3 healing classes. If you have half of those as Shaman, then you have proportionally high number of Shaman. Even more of a reason to give the Shaman priority off-set cloth pieces... which is the whole point of this discussion in the first place.
---
For the horde

Player
---
Don't micromanage and tell them what to do.  Answer questions and let them play.  Warcrack is all that's needed for someone new.  Don't ruin it "trying" to make it fun.
---
player
---
LOL either /s or you're not aware of the blacked meme (nsfw BTW).
---
Mate, you might have a problem. I've been there too, but make sure you look out for the future you while you still can. All the best.
---
And then 3 months later phase 2 is there, there is 30k player on the servers so it need to be split in 10 servers to remove layering. How do you do it ?
---
Oh really, thats sooo nice. Ty for info!
---
I'd like phase 2 fairly soon, but otherwise it could take as long as they please tbh. I just want PvP ranks in the game so I can start the farm asap. Since that's not being in phase 1
---
This is why Blizzard should offer them early reservations on maybe 3 servers. That way they can all come out and say which servers they'll be on early. And if they want to level in secret they can play anonymously somehow until they're happy.
---
Moveanything works and I think leatrixplus can do the dragon portrait but im unsure
---
If only they had their own servers monkaHmm
---
Meteor
---
rogue.
---
I was on Garnera. One of my friends was really into it back in the day so I joined him every now and then.
---
My guild has decided to say screw the streamers and also have picked Herod (before I even saw this post). Glad others are on the same boat.
---
Even if they start with the low amount of servers, its 100 times better to add new servers after release (and people get fresh starts too!) vs having 50 servers at the start and half of them dead once Phase2 starts.
---
lol we have 1 server, no one will play a normal server.
---
I understand your point, but Blizzard definitely has been messing with layering during the stress tests.
---
this happens all the time and has been since wod and it seems to happen at the "edge" of shards so you walk forward and the game switch your shard and when you back of you get back to the shard you left? i think its like that atleast
---
Just want to kindly mention that it took 1:30 for the mage in the video to find his Polymorph spell - onto a target about to get nuked. If you are in a wPvP situation you need to sheep their healers ASAP or you are no mage at all.
---
Can confirm that's what I'm doing, I picked the default server my guild is going to for at least some scientific accuracy but if asmons there, I'm out
---
Conceptually it's fine (and needed for launch), the implementation is lacking though (like in the OP's vid, that shouldn't happen).
---
Hello, EU here. Not jealous about ur streamer friends.
---
He's going to Fairbanks, isn't he?
---
Seriously this is so fucking stupid, why does EU get language specific realms but NA who has a far larger second language community than any EU server doesn't get a specific Latin American server. This wouldn't even be an issue if streamers weren't going to ruin any server they touch and apparently they've decided on east coast servers for whatever bizarre reason despite most of them living on the west coast.
---
Thanks! Will do
---
&gt;This is the problem. 
---
Your entitlement is the problem. He can play where ever he wants. I would do the same as well considering how this sub acts towards these people. It's ridiculous.
---
Yes.  Lots of people are going to quit (the tourists).
---
Eh from what I've seen lately Staysafe has tuned into a bit of an asmongold clone as of late. He wasn't like this a year or two back.
---
Bloodcaller is the best Mage weapon in the game and no one can convince me otherwise
---
BFA beta is a great source, but your head is too far up your ass to see that.
---
Unfortunately they won't put the money into that.
---
Duskwood would be too high level for most stress test players.
---
Not that unusual.
---
You can click the "remember account name" box in the corner so you'd only have to type the password when launched.
---
&gt; y the same token, since there’s very few servers not everyone wants to get stuck on servers with streamers, 
---
Too fucking bad.
---
10 Cooper for each prof
---
Knife is 82 copper
---
So I can't call Alliance retarded?
---
This whole system is dog shit.   imagine this shit and the server caps of 50-100k..(atleast in EU with only 2 servers)   its gonna be a complete shitfest
---
It's a bastardization of Asperger's syndrome, the same way that people use autistic as an insult.
---
SL Warlock.
---
Maybe not, but there's also a fraction of the amount of realms.
---
You aren't wrong lol
---
My experience was having one or two people complain about classic, then 30 people bitching about the person complaining about classic and spending the next half an hour shit talking retail. I get it, BfA isn't great, but holy shit, just shut the fuck up about it already, you're spamming general chat with your salt
---
He has 120ish upvotes and multiple ppl commenting with similar experiences. No, I think he has a genuine point, and if you'd read then you'll realise that most of what you state, like '' Threads like this stay up, because they have value. They showcase a bug. All of the stuff I have seen being removed was "DAE layering bad &gt;:(" threads that didn't want to engage with argumen '' is precisely whats not happening - they don't stay up, and that is genuinely shitty by the mod team.
---
Yea, cause the box is a cricle of course! Wait....
---
You'll have to check Preachs server then, and Taliesin and Evitel. Don't know any others this side of the world.

I always thought it came from the word Asperger's.
---
So you're saying that if you're an east coast player and want to play on a PVP you have to either play on double/triple the ping, get stuck with the toxic cancer streamer communities or stuck with the similarly toxic/awful latin communities? Fucking fantastic, thanks Blizz/Streamers.
---
I'm not sure that's true. WOW itself has maybe what, 3 million players these days? They stopped releasing the count because the number is pretty low I'm afraid. There aren't a lot of other MMOs picking up the slack either. Some exist, obviously, and I've played most of them, but none I've seen have large numbers to speak of.
---
And WOW was great for 2004, but the same 2004 game isn't going to attract a high percentage of players from other games.
---
Everyone try to reserve his name :D
---
Yep i would happily take a delayed release if they would come to their senses, but as much as some ppl are vocal about this, there are a lot of retail drones and corporate dayjob defenders telling us to shush.
---
It’s so obvious they put out the least amount of servers imaginable and plan to layer them for as long as possible because they don’t think they’re gonna make much money for classic, but have to deal with the “private server problem.” Blizzard is a joke these days. They refuse to admit that they fucked over the game and community hard over the past 7 years. Honestly who is surprised though when the only way they make money these days is through store mounts and ‘carrot on a stick’ progression and loot boxes? Activision dominates this company. The writing is on the wall, and it’s why Morhaime, Metzen and the OGs got the hell out.
---
BFA beta was never mentioned as a source. I don't know what relevance it has though because I didn't play the beta, do tell.
---
Because he doesn't want to be bullied by a mob?
---
&gt; The premise is that we need to cram as many people as possible into realms so that when the population drop off comes (which lets admit it, it will come) the servers are left with a healthy population.
---
See that right there is the problem, you’re brainwashed into *thinking* we need layering and you’re just another sheep.
---
Prep Rogue with cooldowns up
---
*Was*.
---
Vanilla/clasic is not in the mind of anyone who didn't play it then and enjoy it, the friends you managed to convince or those few who played private servers and enjoyed it.
---
To your point, yes, a lot fewer people playing super mario brothers today than they did when it was new.  That's how things go.
---
We've added :chadmane:
---
You create a character on the servers you want. And then that name is reserved on that server.
---
Personally i think we should should have longer phases phase release timing should be based on where the bulk of players are.
---
Yeah let me just jump in ahead of my raid group to sheep one person behind their melee just to instantly die. I shaped when I did because it's when they pushed up and someone was off to the side so I knew it wasn't going to be broken like if I would have earlier. Thanks for the shitty comment though
---
He's the king of the idiots and weirdos
---
Pick a server your dedicated to.   Reserve 2 Names.  
---
Pick a backup server  -OR-  RP / RP-PvP Server.   Reserve 1 Name.
---
Yeah I just did that, and turns out it was my action bar add-on. Thanks!
---
&gt; It infuriates me that they think they are above everyone.
---
Is this a joke? You are the one who thinks you're above them. They can do what the fuck ever they want just like you can. Fuck off with your entitlement. The only toxic people are you assholes here and do nothing but bitch 24/7 about streamers.

Layering isn't ideal, but it is a trillion times better than merges. I don't understand why people keep defending an objectively inferior option.
---
It's almost like people have different opinions on a completely hypothetical scenario and its affect on the community.
---
Nope, looking at your post history you’re just either stupid or a troll and me explaining the relevance of it to you would be a waste of my time.
---
Good day.
---
Looks amazing! 
---
Is it possible to get a mobile version?
---
It's like 1.2 silver for skinning + herbing + skinning knife but you can get 2s to be safe. You can get 2s in less than 10 minutes farming mobs in most starting zones btw
---
Source: tested because I made an optimized route of getting to nelf area as a dwarf with all profs to skin early beasts as most people won't sling them because most don't train till at least level 5 but you don't actually need to
---
That’s not the purpose of this stress test.
---
Grob mob
---
He's a piece of shit because he's making his own choice about what server he wants to play on? I don't give a fuck about any streamer but you're an idiot
---
I wonder if it actually shows for the other players ooOooOOoOOoooo
---
I made a lvl 1 troll shaman on the stress test just to fuck around and i got 2 6 slot bags in 5 minutes. i felt like that one mem from wrestling where the guy gets more and more excited
---
It's been a long time since I've checked my Vanilla discs, but are you saying that Blizz didn't actually use an internal format or encrypt any of the files? I guess I wouldn't put it past them, they were remarkably open with other things like their API.
---
It's over for classiccels
---
Gonna keep them clips comming!
---
Your experience is any more or less valid than theirs.
---
tauren is more fun thats for sure. as you get another awesome ability to play around with, and button to consider and press. and melees will get on you and its a good peeling tool to get the distance even if like 3-4 ppl got on you, warstomp into grenade - 4 seconds aoe stunlock combo. that orc just cant get away, and will jump couple of times and die like a potato. at least as a tauren you can defend yourself and dont feel helpless. thats how i feel at least. for me its much better feeling to have something to answer to ppl that get on you, than to resist a one of 4 stuns randomly.
---
aswell as warstomp can be used and helpful against all classes, in many many ways situations and combinations. Aswell as 5% hp is massive.
---
when orc is mainly only help against rogues, and its luck based. so in many cases it will be like you have no racial at all. 
---
obviously orc is strong no shit. it also helps to resist engi grenades.
---
&gt; Blizzard pinching their pennies really hard on this one
---
I think you don't really understand datacenter computing if you think this is about money.
---
Hmm. I’m basing my opinion on 2 things. Before the above response I just thought “bit of an abrasive douche.  Not a fan.”
---
This comment pushed that opinion quite a bit further down the line. 
---
Curious, what do you find funny about him? I am always uncomfortable while watching him, at best.
---
Aye the negative impact layering will have on communities is not talked about nearly enough. If anything makes classic fail, its this issue having that effect, and it sadly will - somehow i still have hope, but its not one i'd like to think to deeply about because looking at the situation we're in a dire spot.
---
Ya what an asshole for wanting to play on what ever server he wants and not feeling obligated to announce it to the world.
---
From Lebanon and can confirm
---
ElvUI works allmost perfect, i just have a problem with my bags, but its just a graphical bug. Everything else works.
---
Can also confirm that Leatrix Plus, Vendor Price and Monkey Quest all work.
---
I don't think it matters that much when the first few phases come because the new content doesn't really devalue the old. BWL came out long before I hit 60 or was raiding but it didn't mean I missed out on MC and Onyxia because of course the gear and guild progression to make BWL possible relied on running them a lot first.
---
The War Effort and Naxx coming later are more important because lower levels would miss out on the world events if they came too soon, but I don't think they are likely to. My concern is more that they don't force expansions on us really soon after the last phase (or at all, I won't bother playing them this time anyway) as originally I missed out on ever doing Naxx due to BC coming out.
---
MVP post
---
That's because asmon is kind of an asshole.  At least other streamers understand and respect the influence they have.
---
Remubros unite
---
That troll’s gonna freeze to death sleeping in the snow like that.
---
Will they even enforce that? Do they even do that in retail anymore lol?
---
same. i dont really get why people are against the new models , they dont affect the gameplay at all
---
Am I the only one who really dislikes the change in fov? It feels like I'm in a fish bowl when playing. It's the one thing I'll miss about private servers the most.
---
Yeah.  I'm guilty over oversimplification and you called me on it.  :)
---
But I think my point is still valid.  A multi-chassis "server" cluster is way more grunty.  GB Ethernet (or 10Gb) is standard instead of 100MB.
---
It’s fine, half the time you ignore each other anyway cos the run back isn’t worth it :p
---
Spriest mage rogue
---
It was meant to be sarcastic because of that :p
---
What is the current image of the BR community? I'm a bit out of the loop.
---
Korea can complain about this on their forums. As mean as it sounds, nobody here cares.
---
You don’t give a fuck about any streamer?  I don’t believe you. 
---
Found the asmongold fanboy...
---
Grobulus shaping up to be the comfy realm. NA, west coast, no streamers, RP-PVP
---
Different programs read files differently, and unless (as the other guy was suggesting) the Vanilla disc files were just really easy to extract and read, then there's the possibility for slight variation in portrayal of 3d objects and effects on an emulation server.
---
Hmm. With how packed other starting areas are going to be, I wonder if this saves any time.
---
Won't even matter to me.
---
Man I feel bad for you US folks having to put up with these absolute numpties. 
---
Such entitlement. Knobs.
---
Pretty sure it's against tos
---
\*brain literally explodes\*
---
&gt; You say that, but if you have a job and kids and like, you know, only 2 hours a night to play this fucking game and the queue when you get home is 1.5 hours long...
---
Then go play BFA, they made the game just for people like you.
---
This but seriously
---
Blizzard already addressed and fixed all those things. You can’t layer jump on command anymore. Making farming that way inefficient and where you can’t avoid ganks. The player base early will be huge and that won’t be an issue either. Especially with so few servers. All wrong.
---
yeah the normal server will be shut in a week
---
I dont see Alliance Role Players going PvP. Grob would be the coolest server in Classic if it could be faction balanced.
---
But they already blew their load on the retail names.  We just got the leftovers
---
Look into VMware if you want to test the waters with Linux. Ubuntu is a good first distro to play with.
---
You want to avoid the non entitled people? Have fun with that.
---
I can wait and fish all day
---
I did think before I spoke lol. The 10k number is coming directly from blizzard. Meaning it has been confirmed that each server has a total population of 10,000 players..
---
See the chinajoy blizzard interview. Please next time look up the facts before you make a post (as I have and I didn't make that number up.)
---
Saving those for later.
---
Nice comeback buddy
---
&gt;5 pvp servers
---
Layering removed in 2 months 
---
That does not fix the problem of the servers being empty after the population decline.  So your proposal is to have many servers with 3k players in at launch leaving an estimated 300 to 800 players left on each server on average?  So you want dead servers?  I'd rather have layering for a bit than dead servers.. you have any other ideas?
---
Honestly tho this is more than ive seen language communities do before in any other game. I hope you guys manage to get some language servers tho.
---
That + not versing humans.
---
What's the worst case? You die? Doing a level 15 quest? 
---
If you can't handle dying once because of some in-game BS, vanilla is NOT for you.
---
Herod has the coolest name and they expect streamers not to go there. That’s hilarious
---
i 100% understand your point. But if people had the option to toggle it in their own settings and you wouldnt see the difference , why are you against that?
---
Your comment causes me internal conflict
---
Nothing, in retail it's loss after loss.

in wod there was an option to toggle it client side so its absolutely possible.

All they had to do was give the Brazilians their own PvP server. x.x

Yeah Fairbanks sounds like a low scale suburb on the outskirts of the city. Fuck these assholes for not telling us EXACTLY where they're going

---
Check out ebbnflow on YouTube for solid drood stuff
---
yeah and lets make seperate servers for people who wanna use shadows as well
---
Hopefully not Horde (what?)
---
Lol tell me there's footage..
---
To clarify, part of what ruins the low level economy when it comes to gear is transmogrifying.  People will sell any gear that has a decent look a lot higher price than necessary to use for transmog.  Every once in a while you'll see some fairly priced items, but more often than not if I want some nice greens for a low level, I end up sending gold from my main.
---
You’re right.
---
You could try move anything for retail and use an earlier version. I think classic exists on top of some sort of BfA lua, so I'd try https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/move-anything/files/2637437 try the different editions for different patches of retail and maybe one of them will work.
---
You could try dominos or bartender. https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info9085-Dominos.html
---
This is something I'm not very knowledgeable about, sorry.
---
Lot of server talk because they just released the realm list yesterday. Lot of streamer talk because most people in r/classicwow want to avoid choosing a realm with a streamer and the gang of 15 y.o’s that come with them. 
---
Layering is new tech introduced to keep a bunch of people on the same realm however not overpopulate certain areas. You could literally be questing in STV in the same spot as another person on your realm but never see them or the tiger they’re killing because you’re in separate layers. However, if you invited them to your group they would be added to your later and you’d see them appear out of thin air. It’s to help the 4k people be able to log on day one and actually find something to kill. It’s going away after phase 1 which should last about 2 months. 
---
This help?
---
On the other hand, itll be easier to grief streamers on pve servers because you cant fight.  Stealing tags for spawns, stuff like that.
---
So who's going to be the one to make a streamer sniping/griefing guild? If so, you have my axe!
---
This has got to go
---
I tried it, but it seemed way too complex and heavy for my purposes. I have everything the way I want it except for the buffs/debuffs, so hopefully a lightweight addon comes around for me.
---
Thanks a lot for the suggestion, though. =D
---
You'll be disappointed to learn it is indeed Horde. I googled it (and them).
---
I was torn on faction but I might go Alliance now tbh.
---
I’ve played on servers with &gt;1500 people and I’ve played on servers with &lt;10k
---
I’ll take 10k any day. I didn’t sign up for an mmo to feel like I’m playing an instanced single player game
---
I like how you’re asking me as if I’m the lead game dev and my opinion matters.
---
Layering is going to ruin this game, it’s a problem, it always has been a problem, but people like you just get your nuts off being a contrarian and defending a billion dollar corporations decision to save money while you waste your time playing a lesser experience.
---
Enjoy “classic” bro
---
Nah, instanced pvp is cross server, they can't influence ranking.
---
fuk layerinng
---
&gt; stop a useful discussion in progress? It's relev
---
If they delayed the release there'd be a shitstorm.  So many people take time off of work for these things (myself included) and if that PTO gets wasted, on top of not being able to no-life on the new, later release date people would lose it.
---
Luna works for unit frames.

---
Taliesin will be busy playing retail
---
I am not advocating 2 shamans in the MT group. 3% crit is LotP. Grace of air is about 4.4%  
---
If you wanted your tank to have both wf and grace that shaman would twist.
---
Hunters are nice but not required in tank group.
---
You are 100% correct that you have about a shaman per group. Most people don't recognize this.
---
Dead servers are far worse than layering.. imo of course.  If you have a solution for dead servers that's not layering I'm happy to hear it man.
---
Just checking, but you do know that video was partially a joke and some of the fights were staged right?
---
I did figure it would be those actually. I've played them (not much league but otherwise) a lot on both the EU and the oceanic servers. Honestly from that experience i think that it would be more surprising if there wasn't some group that the hate is focused on. That's just what those games do sadly - their good games, but they sadly make some poor communities at times. For EU its russians, for Oceanic its china iirc. 
---
Did you see the post about the BR's community response? That is a lot more than I've seen any language community do in any game. I can understand if you still have worries, and i certainly think a language server is warranted, but honestly - i think you've got a pretty good deal all in all.
---
Awesome spreadsheet, I really appreciate it! Would it be possible to add regular RP as well?
---
zperl works quite well in the current classic build
---
I've been really thinking about doing the opposite. I've been on a PvP server for like 98% of the time I've played WoW. I've always been annoyed at getting ganked and love the idea of not being on a PvP server to start over. Once War Mode was implemented I've never taken it off.
---
But the population difference between PvP and PvE servers is making me think Atiesh will end up being dead. I don't have the time or energy to deal with world PvP anymore and want to just chill and level without having to worry.
---
Do you forget that most rank was gained by Hillsbrad during the rank grind? Or what? WSG AB and AV aren't released until later correct? Also, they can influence ranking by having massive advantages on gear by having people give them stuff.
---
I'll just talk about EU, but the problem is similar for the US I think.  
---
For Europe blizzard is planning to release a total of 10 servers.  
---
2 French servers (1 normal, 1 pvp)  
---
2 German servers (1 normal, 1 pvp)  
---
6 English servers (2 pvp, 2 normal, 1 roleplay, 1 roleplay-pvp)  
---
They plan to make this viable by having "layers", meaning there will be a bunch of every zone on top of each other, and once you party up with someone, you go to their zone. This means they can have like 50.000 people on one server.  
---
A large part of the community feel like this will kill server identity, which was a huge part of vanilla wow (you knew the best guilds, the best pvp'ers, who was an asshole or ninja, etc.), since there will be too many people for anyone to stand out.  
---
That and a slew of other potentially exploitable things by layering (pick up a Black Lotus, party with a guy in another layer, get another Black Lotus, rinse, repeat) which will also screw up the economy.  
---
Probably a lot more issues as well, but that's the gist of it.
---
I think the RP PvP server is safe.  It’s where I plan on going.
---
One of reasons I chose Rogue.
---
I think these mods could invest their time more wisely
---
Makes me want to roll against them just to fight them, but I know most of them will be horde so that ruins my plans.
---
You don't quite understand how server infrastructure works do you? There's more servers than what was presented to you running Classic...
---
Thank God I hope everyone goes to golemagg they are really cool and friendly with morals :D
---
lol DISGUSTING
---
Such an underrated comment my dude. Thankyou
---
Warstomp + instant ghostwolf wins fights in PVP. So classic definitly tauren, TBC goes to orcs
---
Oh well... I've got to play with what I was given then. Decided on making an RP PvP guild, too late to back out of it now. So only thing I can do now is charge head on! Oh gee

What does it being an MMO have to do with it?

---
was designed to pit players yet released without pvp system\\BG's  
---
aha keep telling it  
---
in a month we will see woh ppl will cry out when they will be ganked non-stop in contested areas and this situation will become even more harsh once pvp system will be out in p2 without any BG's to queue in
---
Because generally with stereotypes there is an element of truth to them. It is not like they come out of nowhere like you may want to believe is the case. 
---
In this instance, alot of people have had bad experiences on BR realms. Hence, that's a view alot of people hold. If alot of people have had negative experiences then surely that is not just a coincidence? Stereotypical existence is based off large numbers of similar experiences in a population.
---
He doesn’t owe you anything. No streamer does. Insisting they go out of their way to do something for you is entitlement. You can be entitled all you want, just don’t act like this streamer hate isn’t stupid and entitlement.
---
You guys get 11 servers per region!? 
---
English speakers across Europe (and the Middle East) get six servers. Six. Two PvE, two RP and two PvP servers. France, Germany and Russia have four servers each, two PvE and two PvP. 
---
It makes absolutely no sense. Germany has four servers to choose from. Players from the UK, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Holland, Greece, Italy, Poland, Tunisia, Egypt to name a few countries will all be sharing six servers, two of which are expected to accommodate all RPers this side of the globe. A quick search on google tells me that out of 450 million EU residents, roughly 370 million of those speak English.
---
Level in a group and assist your allies when being ganked.  Ultimately during phase one the PvP will be less as there is no incentive to do it
---
yes, it is, you don't speak for the whole game
---
If he saps. I played the beta I would just sap and run the remaining mobs to the tank, vanish if necessary.
---
Wording is abrasive, but Asmongold is 100% correct that its his choice what server to pick. Frankly, people heavily exaggerate streamer impact and I wouldn't react well if people wanted to tell me what server to play on either.
---
As for what I enjoy, Asmongold runs a lot of cool community events(mountoffs, transmog competitions, achievement runs).
---
Regardin his stream specifically, he has an almost encyclopedic memory of the game(in his transmog competitions, he can identify 95% of the mog gear from every expansion on sight). He takes a strong stance on things like store mounts and LFR that I believe are horrible for the game. And he does a good job distinguishing between in game banter and RL insults.
---
Yes, it’s a newer server that’s trying to grow. I appreciate your obvious observation.
---
It's not mean.  If they want a pvp server then that is their battle.  We have our own war for Latin servers here in NA.
---
True , I decided to roll on the Pacific RP-PvP server haha.  Now I just need to pick a race and class.
---
This killed my interest in trying the rp-pvp server. So, thanks!
---
Yes, that's Samwise Didler, Blizzard's art director who's been with the company forever. His face is used as the icon whenever there isn't a default one set.
---
I gotta say choosing when you PvP was great. 5 mins to wear off, gather in front of crossroads and then raid it was fun.
---
For pvp? Certainly not.
---
The game already has this danger without layering lol
---
If you start attacking towns and outposts and stuff, the opposite faction *will come after you*. 
---
You don't have to be on a PvP server to experience world PvP.
---
Even just being flagged can entice someone enough to try and take their shot at killing you, especially if they think they're coming in as a surprise because they weren't already flagged.
---
That's a pretty unpopular opinion that Vanilla was better than TBC or even WOTLK. But I do hope they launch those servers eventually, whether or not they are a continuation of these Classic ones.
---
!nwordcountbot u/Big_Neb
---
I would but playing with 70+ Ms isn't worth it to me.. I guess Herod it is and deal with streamers
---
Good point on the zero lag. I also took part in some world pvp, at least 3 raid groups involved total and there wasn't any noticeable lag. 
---
I had feared after watching some streamers attempt the same in BFA and the servers literally dying that classic might suffer too.
---
Clearly you do too since you just said that playing with them is a punishment? Lmfao
---
Its textbook definition trolling if people are getting mad at it
---
Yeah I'm not waiting months for them to remove a shitty feature.
---
dude hates Brazilians with a passion it would be too funny him on thalnos

A close friend of mine used to play with him every so often off stream and he seemed a lot more relaxed and easy to talk to.
---
That's just his experience though.
---
I, for one, will be hoping *Camelot Unchained* is out by then.
---
/cast petattack
---
/cast dash
---
Probably.
---
I don't think you appreciate how unimmersive it is having to roll over layers to find people and events going on, if there's a big PVP event on Hillsbrad most people going there are going to see nothing. It's absolutely awful and ruins the experience.  
---
As for the Black Lotuses or other herbs/materials it severely affects every other miner/herbalist and alchemist on the server. It's frustrating trying to compete on the auction house at times, let alone with someone has 20x as many materials as you because they've been abusing layers.
---
He didn't make himself a celebrity the community did. And if the community wanted they could take away his celebrity instantly. That's who you should be upset at.
---
most of the replies are from people who know the guy looking for the heirloom vendor is trolling and are just joking around too.
---
Why not create a new Classic WoW subreddit while you're at it?
---
A good community is worth sacrificing a little ping. It's Classic, people got by on dial-up.
---
Your kidding right?
---
/r/the_donald is leaking.
---
&gt; You dislike someone so much
---
I don't know them but I know Twitch chatters and they're a bunch of cancer. I didn't downvote you either, weirdo.
---
That's actually pretty awesome! I thought maybe there was a rogue dev who tried to sneak something in. The more you know
---
Don’t be entitled. Streamers owe you nothing. Hell League has an actual issue with streamers not blocking their mini maps. Do I demand all streamers to block mini maps? Nope. I’ll ask but if they say no, that’s it. I’m not going to call them an asshole and try and force them off the server like I’m a passive aggressive ten year old.
---
Goddamn, please don't encourage downgrading the UI graphics for some nostalgia sake. I have a monitor at least twice as big and triple the resolution I don't want grainy ass UI elements just because.
---
Yes, from what I remember (and what I could find with a quick search to confirm) it’s basically WoWs default icon for if something’s icon is missing.
---
Also the guy in the icon is samwise didier, the art director.
---
That icon is a picture of Samwise Didier, art director for Blizzard. It's used as the default icon so if no icon is available that one is used instead. 
---
Report it as a bug. There is probably supposed to be a real icon used there.
---
I don't think many people know this but Classic has voice chat channels in it. Me and a friend tested it and the quality seems to be the same as any other voice chat. I remember when WoW first came out with voice chat it was so bad they took it back but I guess its made a resurgence? Though because discord exists not many people use it.
---
Just like real life
---
No when they “merge” realms you have to add whatever server name the player you are messaging is on. For example I play on burning blade. However I can’t just message people by using name, I have to add whatever realm they are on be it Onyxia, Lightning’s blade or burning blade since we are all on the “same realm” now.
---
You use a vanilla client and just modify where it connects to for the most part, everything is the same in terms of graphics.
---
I take it you don't have a lot of gamedev experience?
---
Thanks for the vote of confidence. I'm rolling on Herod regardless but it would be fantastic if they go to Whitemane
---
Ok. If that's how you want it.
---
u/c0sm0nautt is a racist, and you racist scumbags are upvoting his racism.
---
Nice vid. Looks like a fun fight. Always found that having the high ground in video games also helps for some reason. You agree?
---
Yeah, almost as bad as coming to someone's thread that's clearly against layering to tell them they're not important. Take a big wiff
---
People have proposed plenty of ideas. Server name (1), server name (2), server name (3) being separate and then scheduled to combine at p2 if player numbers dropped enough, and stay separate if not. 
---
Let’s face it, with 5 pvp server for NA, BR, and LA, there will never be a point where there’s only 7500 people playing in all of those regions combined. (Thats 7500/1500 for the 5 servers and vanilla population cap.) 
---
People are not only upset about layering, but they’re just now piecing together that it’s here to stay for good. Something that people like me, who have dealt with blizzard for over a decade, said from the beginning.
---
Scarab Lord, world firsts, and R14 impacts like the top 1% of players.  The rest of us weren't getting anywhere close to those achievements anyway.
---
There’s a separate screen? Ah hell naw! This is some bullshit right here.
---
I'm already calling it Grab-Ass.
---
Nah, there were 500k at launch, it kept growing, but they definitely didn't add 3x as many servers in 2004, so I doubt it was 1.5m until at least 2005.
---
The biggest thing will probably be raid times. Most guilds raid in the evenings so if you pick a pacific server you may be raiding starting at 9 or 10 EST.
---
The subreddit lol
---
Holy fuck lmao
---
I think it'll be fine. We've got so few realms that there's bound to be one or more streamers on each server, and I've never heard of these guys so the impact might not be too bad. At least EU has it better than NA.
---
I'll be rolling Horde on Zandalar too! So see you there!
---
Each layer is technically a server. So if you believe they are stressing the servers you already prove my point of them stressing each layer by forcing more players onto other layers.
---
No. There’s always been some groups at the top. Forcing Blizzard to do something so other people can’t play isn’t really classic.
---
So we shouldn't be able to because it only affects 1%? I'm PART of that 1%, I'm retired now and don't do shit, and can play WoW all the time something I couldn't do when i was in the military. Holy fucking shit I don't have the crayons or time to respond you people.
---
Set / Not Available .
---
Sometimes the models would get corrupted / manually changed (sometimes improperly ) by the user - and this would be the default placeholder for images with no png currently attached to it .
---
I was til you called it that you fuckin weirdo
---
it's important if you value small millisecond differences
---
it's important if the guild you join just so happens to run based on the server clock, \*because\* all or most of those raiders are in that timezone, and their raiding time happens when you're at work or at school or making pancakes orrrrr
---
Good luck mate that’s the biggest challenge
---
you dont like are thicc holy goddess?
---
I think time zone can help with raid times.
---
If you’re from west coast and you chose an east coast server it might give you and chance to raid earlier.
---
Fuck eh!
---
The purpose of the stress test is not to test how much stress the servers can handle?
---
Treat your friends well cuz you never know when you gonna lose them.
---
No idea. I get 38ms in Finland though.
---
What we need to do as a community is grab all the streamers preferred names on Herod, if someone other than asmond grabs his name he might be pissed off enough to vacate the realm.
---
Was the thing that came to mind “I need to remember to look up the definition of viable”?
---
are hunter bugs fixed? I played to 15 in the second stress test and it was a bugfest and not fun at all, especially the pets were not responding very well
---
Engi/mining (this enables dm:e rich thorium farm if you have a healer buddy) 
---
Engi/bs if you have mining on an alt or if you dont mind buying your mats)
---
Can we keep this i kinda like it and it gives off a homey kinda vibe from blizz
---
Do not underestimate the power of **F R E S H !**
---
R14 control isn't limited to Streamers.
---
Do you want to forbid all hardcore PvP guilds from rolling on your server?
---
Play with people from rag on relevant content and come back and talk to us.
---
What's the problem with not wanting to be a part of a large annoying group? There are server options. Why not try to use relevant information to join one that suits what you want in a server? This is exactly what the streamer groups and SA groups are doing. The people not in these groups shouldn't do the same? Blizz plans that 80% of the players are going to drop off after the initial rush. If it's more, they'll merge the layers still and open up fresh servers. This is speculation, but the most likely scenario. They don't want to start with too many servers and then be facing dead realm population on some servers. Everyone wants to make an educated decision when picking servers.
---
wave at them and continue about my day
---
If you can't explain it it's because you don't understand it well enough to.  I asked you explain not so I could better understand it, but because I'm fairly confident you don't.
---
You said it impacts everyone, I'm pointing out those things impact practically no one.  I'm sorry you ate all your crayons.

Boo hoo, people keep telling me to stop using slurs. Woe is me.

You mean the cities sharded with people from 3-4 different servers are packed?

You’re very smart :).
---
It's amazingly hilarious that some random dude who likes the name Herod thinks he can "assign" people who play the game for a living to Faerlina.
---
As someone who intends to play on Faerlina, I am reassigning them right back to Herod.

my wife and i were both on the same server same time same faction and couldn't even group with each other, tried inviting through friends list and it thought we were on different servers :(

Sometimes though, I really wish I could flag against a player in my faction
---
they hated him because he spoke the truth
---
been playing on RP servers for 15 years. can confirm the vast overwhelming majority of people there do not RP.
---
I know, it's easier to take the lazy way out: get that 'feeling' of being surrounded and involved by literally being surrounded by scores or hundreds of faceless anons.
---
You had that in the starting area, for sure.
---
You don't have it now, so you feel...empty?
---
So find out where people are...and go there. If you just \*expect\* strangers to always be hustling and bustling around wherever YOU happen to be...sooner or later you gonna be disappointed.
---
You create your community experience.
---
Ebbnflow has a levelling series where he goes full balance, resto, feral, hybrid builds etc. Watch his stuff
---
There is one of them and tens of thousands of other people. Not saying the server is going to do nothing to help reserve that name on some specific server. Blizzard is gonna have to do it for them. If even soda and asmon get the name they want on the server they want, I guarantee that blizzard did it.
---
Personally I'm ok if they just announced it after the name reservation, if they wait until launch day they are just being dicks for dick sake.
---
you should like a very ignorant and dumb person. Streaming makes sense... hating on streamers makes no sense and if anything your just jealous of their success.

Do you have a source on the "first couple of days" quote?

jaajjajaja 
---
Can't you just join Pacific servers
---
Is anyone still defending this..?
---
Correct! Non-RP servers it's just non-offensive names and non-lore names. But the latter of the two would be stopped at creation (like naming your character Thrall).
---
Im rolling RP-PvP for the first time so this is just from me reading official posts and such and figuring it all out myself recently.
---
Excellent find, you are absolutely correct.  I forgot to remove wine-staging.   As for Haswell, I am unsure if there is much you can do about that.  I think the Vulkan cut-off was somewhere around 2014-2015, Haswell is unfortunately before that time in development.  Being said, there could be solutions out there outside of my knowledge.
---
&gt; 100% agreed. It infuriates me that they think they are above everyone

With tier 2/2.5 and the right offset pieces you’re essentially a healer with teeth. Nothing better than having a sword and board on, and some cheeky rogue or war opens up on you sensing an easy kill, only to have you trinket the kidney shot, switch to a 2 hander, take 4/5 of his life in a hoj and hit him with a crit hammer of wrath as he tries to escape
---
Nationality != race
---
And there going to have followers come protect them and camp you. Lol.... just play the game it's literally not rocket science.
---
You’re doing that to yourself. A few people wanted to legitimize their hate/jealousy of streamers, it then spread to the whole sub, which GREATLY overexaggerated the impact that streamers will have on your experience. Can’t wait for Classic to actually come out and for reality to kick in.
---
I just think posts such as OP are entitled and cringy. If you care if a streamer is on your server, you are as much as a sperg as the ones following asmold around you claim to hate.

---
It’s not a month you’re wasting it’s 2 weeks. So even at $15/mo it’s $7.50 for the name reservation.
---
It's not a tiny amount of power. They can literally impact your ability to find groups on your server if they decide they don't like you personally.
---
Who is in charge of the server discord is a very important job for a realms community. You really don't want it in the wrong hands.
---
God I fucking hate all these dipshits. Force them all into quarantine on one server IMO
---
Take your studies seriously. TBC set me back a bit more than I would like to admit.
---
Theres just not enough people, some sacrifices will be made.
---
Yeah, instant queues are nice... but so is being able to level in relative peace and farm without getting killed over and over.
---
Because it forces people and guilds to change names which is an even worse of a cluster fuck.
---
Being forced to do something outside your control is a very bad feeling Blizzard would prefer not to emulate.
---
Can confirm had a Chinese tank I grouped with in beta who couldn't use discord. We talked ingame which he could do
---
Look, the client can be run as is for priv servers (aka real vanilla). you change one txt file and you connect to another address (pserver). The only thing that needs to happen is that the server respond correctly, but that has nothing to do with the graphics engine or transparency of water.
---
Nobody knows; but he will probably go where the other streamers aren’t; we are all just fucked.
---
This is incorrect, i trained swords on my rogue at lvl 8 on the stress test
---
1 pvp server for 14 countries in the oceanic region....can’t wait
---
Cause their fans are twats? 😂
---
LMFAO
---
I thought it was funny but I'm 4hrs late to the party, so...
---
Are we gonna need to make a guild dedicated to killing streamers on this server? SEG(Streamer Extermination Group)
---
Why do people watch sports then? This argument is so old and stale
---
G R O B M O B
---
I play Horde but secretly I love dwarves and especially that face.
---
It's those f*ing humans and nelfs I can't stand.
---
How is this any different than if that person went on a different server to begin with? You'd have less opportunities on a less populated server right?
---
Would you rather have the guild GMs creating alt characters to act as a guild bank to hoard all your guild's items instead of an actual guild bank? 
---
That's one of the reasons why I think Classic might fail after a while, because people are so closed to QoL features that don't change the Classic WoW experience at all.
---
Comments like this really show how the WoW audience has changed
---
I will because logging out of a character doesn't have any relevance to a queue
---
A few people wanted to legitimize their hate/jealousy of streamers, spread it to the whole sub, which then GREATLY overexaggerated the impact that streamers will have on your experience. Can’t wait for Classic to actually come out and for reality to kick in.
---
That’s my concern. I want to play pvp but my mates want to play pve. I had to keep turning off warmode when I played bfa to play with them.
---
Or you could, you know, stop being a xenophobe and expand your world by learning another language. 
---
Just a thought.
---
Simple answer is no mate. Welcome to the Human Race. Enjoy your stay anyway you can.
---
Thanks, this is great!
---
tell them pewdiepie is the best
---
I agree with you, but you're wrong about loot trading.
---
The only time I ever hated multiboxers where the few dudes who would multibox 3-5 elemental shaman in tbc and become omnipotent gods smiting people with more power then fucking Zeus.
---
Even then, we'd be losing an entire server to them. We didn't get enough servers to throw them away like that.
---
Because to play sports at a level that is televised, you actually have to be pretty good at it.
---
Any plug can just go on Twitch, set their shit up, and stream. Half of becoming a popular streamer is luck.
---
The idea does sound fun to me but I wouldn't want to do it unless the game was actually designed around running teams of characters (ie Dragon Age Origins style) and everyone was doing it.
---
I forget the name of the game and I don't know that it ever took off but I played a beta of an MMO that did just that with each player controlling three characters so you had to choose a team, set up tactics and formations etc. Was a good concept but it meant that each of the classes was quite basic in its skill set to account for it and pretty much every player just ended up running with the same three classes. With the greater complexity in WOW I could see that it would be a lot more interesting... and confusing.
---
image  if amy schumer put her layers on you
---
I just want to add, I feel like there has been and was genuine joy in everyone I have seen playing this game this year. Whether livestreamers, private server players, beta and alpha invites, people just investigating meta.
---
I cannot WAIT to see which direction Blizzard takes ClassicWow. I personally hope they feed the ecosystem after all the raids are released, and give us as devoted long time players a much deserved good experience. Unadulterated with microtransactions and LFG/LFR...
---
Coming from FFXI where NA and JP were on the same servers with player based rules (specifically JPONRY) I was always floored when a JP player played with my party and sure enough, they were AMAZING players. 
---
Granted, ffxi was a jp based game so the NAs were the BRs of their servers. I would feel terrible if I knew they spoke of us like we do BRs. 
---
I knew they didnt want to party with NA players but the ones that did, it was always a blast.
---
Id never discriminate a player for their nationality. I hate that this community is basically forcing them to find their own server. It's toxic as fuck.
---
What do you mean by Thalnos will be Azralon 2.0 and Faerlina will be classic Ragnaros or Quel’thalas? Sorry Im not sure what that mean.
---
https://github.com/Hoizame/AtlasLootClassic
---
Bartender let’s you have 10 action bars, the stock UI has 5 I believe.
---
&gt;and go there
---
But they are layered. I was going to meet my guild and it was empty because it was layered.
---
Bruh.. OCE has two servers. There is no fucking way they’ll dump layering. I feel so let down. This shit sucks
---
Considering all the people from ragnaros quelthalas and nemesis ive played with, while their demeanor is annoying the real reason I actively avoid playing with any players from those servers is because they make your average private server player look good.
---
Oh yeah good idea let me just learn Portuguese these next 14 days
---
Best content?  Are you talking about streamers?  Far from the best content
---
If someone dedicates their life to that single reason, I really feel sorry for them. I'd rather just enjoy the game.
---
This isn't retail. You aren't going to be spending all of your time afking while waiting for a queue to pop up and instantly teleport you somewhere.
---
I’m confused why it says Azeroth at the bottom of Eastern Kingdoms, isn’t Azeroth the name of the entire world? Or is there a bit or old lore I missed out on?
---
Lmao did you just unironically call someone "a smoothbrain"???
---
This sub is gold
---
So you have more data on it than they do?
---
I'm seriously considering it. Never been a real RPer but always done what I call soft RP, like making a fitting name for the race/class, wearing a thematic transmog (won't be an issue in classic lol), and making a little story about who they are in my head. People from RP servers are generally very pleasant in my experience pugging on retail too.
---
Preachs community is pretty chill. So I would only bank on drama time being the drama.
---
Dont listen to this guy. If you want to be half way decent there is a LOT going on with hunter. Low skill floor, very high skill ceiling.
---
I got my wife playing, my 9 year old has her own character on limited time, and my 7 year old gets to fish.
---
Different variables that pservers had to guess on without hard data.  They may have gotten close on many things but not perfect.
---
it's a victimless crime!
---
Yea I read that on the wiki, but I figured it was worth a try anyway. I'm traveling, so I am currently on my old reliable Thinkpad, but I'll have to give it a go when I get home on my desktop. Vulkan is truly a blessing, hopefully the need for windows to play certain games will soon be a thing of the past. Excellent guide my friend :-)
---
Confirm that undead warlock can pick up class quest from Durotar with no issues. 
---
Tauren hunter (lol) can not pick up class quest from Durotar, you get sent back to mulgore.
---
I don't know how it works for each Indivudal combo.
---
I am playing on the german server with english client aswell and I wouldnt worry about that to much. The only acces to classic server for the last 10 years was private servers. This servers have almost always been english servers. While looking for a german guild i have come to know that many people play on eng client because they are used to it from their recent classic experience.
---
It's actually like asking for fries from chik fil a during breakfast and them saying you gotta wait 5-10mins for them and having a hissy fit. You're still getting what you want, but its gonna be awhile for perfection. They COULD of sold this as a 60/40 dollar game as a remake like other publishers. But they're not. ( they know people would of paid for it and dont kid yourself think a mass of people wouldn't)
---
 They're also giving it to you for just a sub with their main game included that could of also been separate and an additional fee. 
---
It's called being entitled. Complain when layer actually lasts longer than they say, if it even does. Were you there when servers would literally go offline and be unplayable for days due to lag even if they were up near the start? Would you take days spent down over this? Would you rather fight 6000 people to get the 1-10 stuff vs 1000? What experience does that increase? Be thankful for blizzard not really changing the game at all. 
---
Layering will affect you as much as falling through the world does. A mild annoyance that you'll get over in a few days.
---
There is not nearly enough servers. They had 10 million people willing to come back for WoD because of nostalgia. If even 1/4 of that come back they will need to make dozens more servers.
---
