It looks like it's active now. Giving me the option on herod but I only have a L6 so didn't try it out in case it's limited to a set number.

Yes

Yes you have 5 minutes

servers are broke af rn

When did OP complain?

How does one blacklist someone else’s account?  Shaking my head. Morons everywhere.

Whitemane?

Are you in a PS guild that is ready to down MC on day 5?

If not then dont worry about raiding

lol, *hair*.  The hallmark of anime is the large eyes.

Ok.  I was starting to get worried.  Guess I’ll keep pushing on!!

Same for Smolderweb...
---
Restarted and at a black screen on character select
---
same
---
Nice, actively trying to get players banned
---
I was just playing and the world server seemed to totally crash. Blaumeaux btw.
---
Hell of a oversight.
---
I got the same thing on Rattle. Couldn’t loot, exited game and now this.
---
Yeah, just got kicked off too. Fairbanks server. O\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_O
---
It won't matter.  It will remain black.  I've restarted the client 3 times now.
---
The end is nigh! I too am experiencing the long black night!
---
my realm (thunderfury) just crashed and now when I try to re-log I'm gettng that black screen too
---
Yep, warriors are basically the only viable raid tanks, paladins are only good as healers.
---
Think something's up with the server. I started lagging out in-game, and when I tried to restart that's what I see now too.
---
happened to me
---
Black screen here as well. I think servers are down.
---
Sit in this fucking chair I need karma

appears to be widespread, I was having connection problems in game, alt+f4'ed  and came back to this at character select on multiple servers

For Lights Hope. It may not seem like a LOT, but with MCP being the key item that makes it work, it makes a significant difference.

I know what you mean there is just something about classic which gives you such satisfaction in progression

Atiesh is down as well

Game froze logging into Gnomer on Fairbanks, black screen on login.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/classicwow) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
So I got my rogue to 10 on the pvp server. Probably try a lock on the pve and make my choice. Or at least hopefully that'll help!
---
And yeah I agree; balance matters :)
---
Just happened to me on Biggles too
---
Yeah everything lagged out for me and now this screen is all i get trying to sign back in
---
The rule of thumb is that you cant have 2 actions that trigger global cooldown in the same macro.
---
I dont think wanding triggers a global cooldown.
---
So, theoretically you could put this code at the beginning of the macro. It will attempt to start wanding and then fireball each time.
---
At this point, you could leave it at that if you can live with the "I cant do that yet" spamming each time you tap the button.
---
Alternatively, you can look into macro error handling. I dont know if this exists, but you could maybe handle the spell being on cooldown in a try/catch or equivalent.
---
I'm talking about raids.
---
That's Murloc for Murder!
---
This is perfect. Thank you!!!
---
Same on Fairbanks, went for a smoke break, ran into SM Armory and got a forever loading screen, alt f4'd and stuck here.
---
ITs back up
---
they restricted the API so i don't believe you can make a focus in Classic
---
WoW Classi: For the working man.

Kurinaxx hurting too
---
Kurinnaxx is RIP
---
Getting same screen on Rattlegore
---
Wb
---
I'm back in bois!
---
I was doing some questing with a couple of others. Whenever a green dropped, I would greed. They both passed.
---
thats terrible!
---
I lagged out underwater on Kurinaxx, seems to be gamewide
---
Not like they will get banned alike how 10 man dungeons was a thing they didn’t get banned did they it’s a blizzard bug it’s no one else’s fault that it’s abusable
---
Been able to find quest items on the ground a million times easier as well after I set ground clutter to 1.
---
F for the servers
---
Obligatory LaFave Bros video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN80_7rNmcE
---
Atiesh was one of the very first PvE realms, and is pretty crowded despite never having a queue.
---
Servers just went down. Literally the minute my group was entering deadmines too... :(
---
Even without a housekeeper, house keeping is hardly a time consuming chore.
---
Even a very clean person should spend maybe an hour or two a week.
---
Mostly cause it's fun to play with the potential of pvp, even though most people don't actually want to spend 90% of the time ghost running though. I'm not saying what's right or wrong or even what I like or do - I'm just saying in reality people don't constantly attack each other on pvp realms, in my experience in vanilla and on private servers and in Classic.
---
Same thing happened to me. I restarted client and I re-joined w/o a queue. In the char select screen here it was also black, but I just waited and it worked. I think it may have been fixed cause of a bunch of guildies also logging back on.
---
Lol you’re fucked mate
---
When they go stale they double as a melee weapon.
---
It's not an exploit, layering is a feature endorsed by Blizzard.
---
[I'm also having the same issue.](https://i.imgur.com/KRN8tSr.jpg)
---
Oh shit...i have 539 people to go. hopefully they are fixed in about 15 mins
---
15 years in the future he may wish he had made some sacrifices instead of only focusing on instant gratification
---
Smolderweb back up
---
Sigh...I told myself I wouldn't go out of my way to PvP last night, and finish the quests in shimmering flats. I'm running through 1k needles, and a warrior in general chat says a mage is sheep spamming him at shimmering flats and wants help. 
---
Naturally I find the mage and camp him for maybe 20 minutes. This is followed by probably 2 hours
---
Yea seriously the arrogance astounds me
---
I would’ve ganked his ass all the way there and back too.
---
Because you need to buy game time to play Classic WoW.
---
the level to 19 free is only on retail.
---
Whut? More work?
---
LEGEND!!!
---
A sub is required
---
A google search would dig your ignorance in the dirt but I can’t have you admit you’re wrong. :)
---
Enjoy the gold friend
---
Play the game!
---
Can someone please tell me what add-on he is using for his name plates? The ingame nameplates has a really shitty short visible range.
---
Game is not f2p at all. BFA however, is.
---
Can I please get an M word pass from the kind cows here?
---
Because active game time is required is order to play WOW classic. Exactly what it says. The free trial doesn't include classic.
---
Aaaand they're back. Related [vid](https://youtu.be/jOUiAr9-KSo?t=125)
---
Because you have to be subscribed in order to play WoW Classic. It told you that.
---
I got rank 12 or 11 in pvp (full armor set and mount) as a balance druid. Restored is preferred for raids but at least you can do 4 different things almost as good as war/rog/caster
---
Hey folks.
---
A simple question.
---
I havent maxed/played much on retail, so i am wondering how different is it from classic?
---
You need to have a subscription to play Classic. Trials do not apply to Classic.
---
My first day as a warrior in Classic was great. I looted 4 pouches within my first hour of playing and felt dirty. Arrived at Goldshire and tried to pick up a quest but missclicked on someones guildcharter and was traded 20 silver for it. Buffs from every direction, random people saving me when things go south. Saw a guy named Rngeesus and chuckled out loud. 
---
But the best part.. My first trip to Stormwind.  I hadn't taken two steps inside before a random dwarf and nelf handed me 10 healthpotions and an 8-slot bag. I was so shocked at the random act of kindness I forgot what I was doing. Ran around aimlessly for a good while after that, just trying to think of how I can return the favor to some noob in the future.
---
 Hunters farm really well, so you should be okay making money. And you've got Aspect of the Cheetah/pack in the meantime.
---
Bleu it!
---
Hows Incendius server right now? Pop/Queue
---
40 mans can afford a lot of flex spots, but won’t be main tank without a taunt I would guess.  Lots of fights need legit off tanks though.
---
The free trial to 20 is for retail WoW, classic is a different thing entirely, which you get access to by having the subscription.
---
You should be proud of your kid, at the age of only 4 he already know what is better faction and best race.
---
If you’re a warrior, just log in. 
---
If you’re not a warrior, fly to Durotar and farm the boars there until one of them drops a kidney. Bake the kidney into a pie and present it to a lvl 17+ warrior. If the warrior accepts your kidney pie and eats it, then he will tank your dungeon. If he rejects the pie, you have to start over.
---
They were insanely popular at the start, it seemed every queue tourist rolled a druid.   
---
I rolled on Dreadmist and Mulgore was like 90% druid. Then the tourists left and now druids are fairly rare again.
---
I've yet to have another druid in my dungeon groups, and even in Ashenvale/1K Needless I rarely see any. (Relevant cos most likely for Tauren/Elves to go.)
---
I may be a young priest but Holy Fire seems like such a waste of time, mana, and DPS. I only use it on undead mobs.
---
Do you have any evidence of the guilds successfully farming mats using layer hopping? In that blizz Q&amp;A right before launch they described a mechanism to prevent people from logging out to layer hop and collect the same resource node. Considering all people of the same guild are on the same layer, how could a guild do what you are describing?
---
Do you think this would work? https://www.walmart.com/ip/Lenovo-ideapad-S145-14-0-Laptop-Intel-Pentium-Gold-5405U-Dual-Core-Processor-4GB-Memory-128GB-Solid-State-Drive-Windows-10-Grey-81MU007NUS/658235074
---
except alliance is better in organised pvp (BG's)
---
I asked about a priest earlier, but what should I spec into while leveling a warrior? I’ve read arms or fury are generally better, but should I do a mix? I just don’t know what I definitely do and do not need, you know? And so many guides say so many things I just don’t know what’s best
---
[deleted]
---
It's 2019 and we still believe images we find on the internet?
---
Used to be that way though. I leveled my first WoW character to 15 back in the day.I don't remember if it was capped, but I remember it was limited to 8 days.  
---
And yeah I didn't make it past 15 in 8 days. Pretty sure I could have leveled higher.
---
I'm trying to level a hunter and I am constantly pissed at how slow it is to level. I feel your rage meter should be constantly full like mana and when you blow off steam with attacks it lowers.
---
You have, somehow, created three different "wow accounts". Each one can be subscribed and played separately. Mostly support for people who multibox I'd think.
---
Wow i have to keep this nifty trick in mind. As a new wow Player: Classic is so fucking awesome.
---
&gt;AFAIK
---
you're right because I use to do this on final fantasy all you gotta do is use google remote and can use your pc from mobile device
---
Had three horde attack me in barrels while doing my succubus quest but I got the warlock quest giver to help me and killed one before dying. They both spit on me then I used ss and killed them. Good ole classic bb.
---
At least it wasn't a nelf priest stealthed and mind controlled into fatigue waters lol
---
If I do a realm switch, can I pay later on to switch back to a more populated realm?
---
I mean, I can’t fault the guy. I made a lot of spelling errors when I was 12 too
---
Select the guards from as far away as possible and put markers on them.
---
There is a point where they walk away from each other and you can squeeze in and get it without aggroing them.
---
They usually will pull as you run out,  but hey quest is done.
---
Balance druids have an ability that will root whatever hits them in melee.
---
Oh god, this brings be back to college days.
---
Undead
---
Kodo that high? Oh no. Kodo go low.
---
nobody gives a shit. stop crying about queues in the future, but again nobody cares
---
These people crying like this aren’t old enough to even do that.
---
The character being leveled isn't even in the guild LOL.
---
Oh awesome I might play around with it tonight.  Thank you sir

5k is a dead server. Cap should remain the same as it is now. 20k.

There was a time I trusted and respected blizzard, that time has passed so whatever they might say or claim holds very little to no weight in my mind.

Can you play in a different country's server? Specifically, all my friends live in Korea and I live in Australia. Would it be possible for me to make my character in a Korean server eventhough I'm connecting from Australia? Thanks in advance for your reply!
---
Paladin is just autoattack spam but if it feels better, go pally. Your only viable raiding spec is holy however
---
Yes, because you aren't expecting it.
---
Per hour. 100k was doable with that exploit.
---
Thanks for the server info 😊
---
Why is this poll everywhere? Seems like it’s in every thread.
---
Could be that your hardware has an error. A bluescreen indicates an hardware error.
---
Try to read/make a screenshot of the bluescreen. It will contain the information on what caused the crash.

My husband and I waited for a questmob respawn in a tower. I decided to sit on a table next to the wall. A wild warrior appears and take the seat to my left. My husband to the seat right. And the warrior began to tell a joke. 
---
we laughed and then a fourth came to our table and joined us. You can not beat the waiting time any better.
---
It's fun being on the populated faction of a server
---
moo moo moo moo moo MOO
---
I tend to pass on items in instances so enchanters can level up, and if I do get boe items I don’t need I give them away. I figure as a healer I should have a vow of poverty. IRL I milk the clock and doctor my miles for a few hundred a month.
---
Oh wow, why didn't I think of that along with the other big guilds doing exactly the same thing on the same server.  Any stockpile of lotus will not be unique.  And it will sell a lot slower than you are hoping for.  Unless you can maintain an absolute monopoly on lotus when you start selling it, you will be undercut and your stockpile will rot until you finally agree to sell it at whatever the market dictates.

---
Anyone know if you can transfer more than one character? My buddy and his brother use the same account.
---
Fair enough. For me, as long as there's enough people to raid with and it not be empty, I'm happy but I totally get where you're coming from.
---
Shower:10 minutes
---
Do laundry: Once every 2 weeks, takes maybe 20 minutes, so about 1.5 minutes a day.
---
Meal prep:I typically spend about 20 minutes cooking a real meal, but the meals will last me 2-3 days, so maybe 8 minutes a day.
---
Clean:This is mostly meal and trash related, maybe 5-10 minutes a day. I do a more thorough clean every few weeks, but thats hardly a significant portion of my time.
---
Eat: I combine this with leisure time, because I will eat while watching TV or playing on the computer.
---
I don't see how any of these aren't at "adult appropriate levels", and it totals up to about 25 minutes a day.
---
Well this got disproven. Bugged.
---
Are you me?
---
Yup which is why a good rogue opens with garrote so your silenced in the stun lock
---
This deserves more upvotes.  There is tons of potential ways they could add new endgame content without going to BC such as Uldum and CoT in Tanaris.
---
Karazan could be added with minimal changes, maybe just make it a high level 20 man that would be a tier between AQ40 and Nax.
---
Hyjal is another area they could add/expand...
---
Grim Batol near the Wetlands...
---
They could add a lot of things without increasing the level cap or epanding to BC.  I prefer the constraints of Vanilla (level 60 cap, 40 man raids, no flying mounts) but I am not opposed to seeing new content added to the old world, they just have to be careful not to make anything new they add trivialize the old content.
---
That's only like 3 hours per day. You don't actually feel like you've played a lot, do you?
---
I don't doubt that you've played all you've been able to or what not, but "playing forever" with such a low number
---
Damn thats huge!
---
In your character panel there should be a little icon on the right side, it may be an option you have to enable? I’m nowhere near computer so you might need to google this yourself. Regardless save it under a name or number and then macro it to swap. You only need to swap weapons so you’ll just have two sets, one with your 2h and one with your shield.
---
I reigned terror in dusk wood to make me feel better lol.
---
Badass frisbee bro
---
It literally existed under the name paranoia in vanilla...
---
You can maybe deny it 1v1, but once we’re in world or BGs, warriors will be one of your biggest problems.
---

---
Naw use it first before the fight starts, it’s pointless after I agree but it’s that dot that I like.

Most people spec all fury until 40 then respec to arms for mortal strike

15$ at once!?!?! No way! I only buy a 3$ coffee every day at dunkins. Only 3$. Every day. Wait..

Yea am enhance atm. Definitely know dagger shield is better for solo and wf 2h for group. Just not sure what to use with this epic dagger. It crits really hard.

"whys it so hard to make money in this game??"
---
Someone's going to get level 60 in a 15 year old game before me!!!!
---
Ive been buying cockroaches from the UC vendor and reselling them on the cross faction AH for 2-5 gold. I’m at 16 gold and I’m only level 14 lol. Feels good.
---
I was honestly worried my body would fall off if the boat left, but the rez point was close.
---
In fairness - that's warriors pre-40!
---
Funny I had just given up.
---
After many hours of questing in Ashenvale, I feel like I've gathered enough data from running past enemies on the main road to say that feral druids will attack me on sight far more often than any other class.
---
Rogues are in 2nd place and warriors 3rd
---
Your mom goes to College!

Guys I have ZERO PROOF but trust me this guy you all know nothing about is exploiting/cheating so you all must report him to get him banned. Sounds like a salty player who got put in their place in guild and is butt hurt.

He's literally CHEATING by PAYING a CHINESE LEVELING SERVICE to PLAY FOR HIM.

Wouldn't this make her the opposite because her name is backwards? Isn't that the rule? So she wouldn't actually want to talk to your manager? Or she would but she would be nice to everyone? Fuck.
---
Yeh my charge macro has a stance swap in it. It sure I will want to change to battle stance every time I hamstring but I see what you mean.
---
Do you know if it allowed multiple characters per account to transfer? A friend and his brother share an account and we don’t know if we should server transfer for the reason above.
---
Well they said it was going away and it will.   
---
Players will just have to take up their responsibilities when realms are single layer. And make proper migration then or face the egregious amount of players.   
---
It's entirely in the players hands. Blizzard is removing layering no matter what. I'd say in October at latest.
---
TrinketMenu
---
as long as they actually check the corpses so you can grab it :D
---
I didn't make that number up, that was what I found out via a gold seller messaging me on day 3 saying "we see you are leveling well and could be a candidate for some money, our current rates are 1gold=7USD are you interested? If so visit x site". I've also been told a similar story from folks on my server, none of us have actually checked it out lol but I believe it'll come down more as gold is more readily available. I think they were trying to capitalize on whales by getting as much as possible those initial few days.
---
I love tanking as shaman. That said I queue for dps but if we struggle finding tank then I'll gladly take so we don't wait. I really wish shaman tank was more viable, more than anything. But they simply are better off tanking and grabbing aggro from overzealous casters.
---
no changes.
---
Just code it bruh. You need a ballpoint pen to fidget with and glasses. Hope this helped.
---
You could also download an add on called quiestie it can help you identify areas to go to get quests associated to your level on the map. Basically the built in quest helper before it was there.

This is a pretty good representation of what playing on a pvp server is like. The only time it's fun is when you get to be the asshole who picks on someone low leveled or less geared than you.
---
can't thunderclap on defensive stance, and if you don't have the talent in arms tree that let you retain some rage when stance changing, its usually better to just stay in defensive stance and tab target using sunder/revenge
---
Nothing notable. Maybe an obscure effect or combo of consumables or something. But no, not entire areas.
---
Etiquette doesn’t apply to world PvP. Not in my experience at least

Same.

Wtf are you talking about? Are you not aware of the druid code? It's only been around for 15 years.
---
Ah yes, Hunters rolling on everything. Welcome to Classic.
---
at low levels before you get life leech absolutely.
---
You guys have phones right
---
You don’t get it and that’s fine lmao. Let’s say you party up with an IRL friend when you get home from work and you get phased into his shard. You then proceed to kill a named mob who wasn’t up yet on your shard. According to you that’s exploiting yes?
---
Well the more you know, I haven’t had to look for it yet so just assumed it was there. Just check your lines your wrote for the macro, could just be wording the comas you used etc that is causing the issue.
---
I'd say Classic is definitely more focused on leveling to 60 and dungeons then raids
---
Yeah unless the guy before you isn't used to having to mine it multiple times
---
Or it was just a commonly accepted fact of the game... I specifically remember when fear was patched so that players no longer can run off of edges
---
To clarify, an actual server merge has not happened, there's connected realms which is almost a merge but the servers and characters remain independent in name, for example Gronfors-Shu'Halo and Gronfors-Eitrigg. [Link](

Pro rogue strats of spicing up the UI with the coolest looking icon

We're all victims of Blizzard's poor decision. They should've made Brazilian and Latin American realms, like in retail. But they clearly underestimated the number of players.

Three things should be obvious. They will release BC. You will get a one way copy or transfer.  Vanilla will remain.

no changes

If you want to get PvP rewards at all remember that BGs aren’t until phase 3 but honorable kills are in phase 2. So unless a bunch of people on PvE servers start flagging themselves in phase 2 you’re going to have to wait for phase 3 to farm honor. Just food for thought.

Totally true lmao

Saronite bombs are a feature...and yet Blizz banned world first Lich King guild due to the "feature".

can somebody make me a castsequence please Warrior.
---
Aww! What a cute lil' adventurer! Can't wait to gank your son.
---
Typically, I will season and bake meat or fish(maybe 1 minute of work), rice(another 30 seconds), and some sort of veggie(maybe 3-5 minutes). I make enough for 2-3 days, so really its more like 2 minutes of cooking a day.
---
Blizzard please fix Hunters
---
fear should cost no rage
---
other classes all get spammable free eternal CC but if a warrior needs it's shitty mere 8 sec CC it costs an arm and a leg

Kinda. Had a level 18 &amp; 15 on Mograine. 
---
Ended up deciding class but queues were too much for me so I went to Zandalar. Now I have a level 36.
---
Undead warlock here. I love Cannibalize, it's basically like a second bandage in a separate cool down so I can just tap for mana and use it so I have to use less food and water out in the world.
---
Plus there's nothing better than getting ganked by the 9th NE warrior that night, winning the fight yet again and actually eating the booty like groceries.
---
How are you right clicking in Chrome remote desktop for fishing? I've had trouble with it.
---
So because 1% of people knew how to install addons that means everyone did? I think that’s a stretch to call someone a liar given the numbers. 
---
You think that most kids got new computers every year or something? That’s not how things worked in normal families. We were lucky if dad got a new computer for the family every 8 years. When you’re under 16 and can’t get a job to buy your own PC it doesn’t make you retarded for playing on what your only option was at the time.

You can and you don't have to.

Whelp. It was fun while it lasted. Fuck this game.
---
It was Warcraft 3 that got me on academic probation. I did get things turned around eventually.

In my experience their entire tos boils down to "we can ban you for whatever reason we feel fit, because it's our game and not yours."

It will still be fine to reroll next year if you want.
---
Warriors almost one shot me at mid 30s now lol. I’m a mage.
---
No changes.

Aww that's a beautiful tribute to her. And I agree, Menethil Harbor when it rains is so relaxing, especially at night when you can see the glowing, orange lights of the boats passing by. Can't think of any better place to fish. But I also really like the docks in Redridge. Feels like you've come across a small fishing village and you're joining in... And I like the pier in Stormwind City, where you can often meet and talk to other people who are fishing... it's a cute spot. Oh and when battlegrounds are released, don't forget to fish in Alterac Valley while your team fights, to give yourself that true Vanilla "afk but not really afk, just totally useless to the team" experience!
---
Nachos is my snack of choice for walking around the barrens. Ohh and samosas
---
That depends on what your goals are, but probably rerolling to enjoy yourself is the right call. Battlegrounds are not coming out until phase 3 for example, and I would be surprised if that isn't at least 6 months away.
---
If you want to quickly be one of the most geared PvE characters on your server then you may want to hurry, but we will have months of Molten Core and Onyxia. I assume people will still be doing those raids sometimes in later phases as well. 
---
I would suggest not spending the next months or even years of your gaming on a class you don't like. If you're just feeling indecisive then for the same reasons you may have time to level up an alt later as well. I'm trying to level quickly on my main, but I'm already thinking what alts I will want once I reach 60.
---
Playing a warrior is way more enjoyable when you have a high level character who can spoon feed him gear and potions.
---
RemindMe! 12 hour

It's here already

How did you enjoy your run back?

but if we did that, how could our nails on a chalk board voices be heard!?

I'm new. I had no idea what happened. All I knew is that the gnome ran in, cast something on me, and I lost control of my character and ended up running off the boat. :(

No turning back.

Been playing these games for awhile. I've seen how anonymous people act when women are around. I want 0 part of it, sucks but that's how it is

Warlocks can basically dot and cc forever in vanilla, Priests eventually run into mana issues. With fear and the ability to drain tank locks control whats going on better than anyone. At 60 a lock has 3 insta cast dots, ae fear and heals as well as dd spells to finish off anyone thats close to death. Single target a priest might have better dps, but locks can handle multiple targets without much drop off per additional target.
---
It’s 10% from honoured, being exalted only lets you buy a different race mount. You also get 10% discount at pvp tank 3( not available yet).
---
100g-10% is 90g
---
It works really well, I have no problems questing and doing profs, listing stuff on the AH, etc. sure it’s a little slower but without it I would probably level 4 right now.
---
Honestly, I feel like it's very customer service oriented decision for blizz to allow it this early because you're right, a month from now the player base will probably die down and blizz could save a lot of time money and effort by not allowing it until numbers stabilize. Instead they're offering it early so that we can have the best playing experience.
---
Although you could argue that blizz messed up by not having more servers on day one but they're still doing right either way which cant be said for a lot of game companies..
---
That site is a meme. You do know that right?
---
They were titan forged. And arcane is from the titans.
---
Ita crazy how much lighting and some ground clutter spruces things up
---
I’m on the fence myself, rolled holy for my personal friends so I can be healer, can’t get anything done solo. Too expensive to keep respeccing. Takes like 10 smites and all my mana to knock out a monster of my level.
---
I'm glad I didn't roll a hunter, but I missed the gameplay.
---
I'm selling up through medium so far. haven;t had as much time to play as I'd like.
---
GNOMES RULE!!!
---
Server?
---
That was in vanilla, they didnt add quest inventory until maybe BC, but possibly later like Sunwell Plat. or even Wrath. I remember having an inventory filled with swamp filth and Arrakoa horseshit long after leaving those zones in BC. Could be wrong.
---
now i can finally play the game
---
...or just dont accept invites from WoWgoldbotchinawww.wowgoldspammer.com
---
Thanks my dude this did it for me. Just had to add the 16 on the first equipslot. :)
---
Oh - so it rapes your battery AND your Data if you dont have a wifi connection to use while playing on the phone 
---
not as cool as I thought
---
You realize WoW PVP is a player combat system and not PVE right? More time invested generally means stronger skills, so if someone has played more than you they should have an advantage in skills and should not need any safe guard mechanic to help them win.
---
I just want to get in the queue from my phone 🤦‍♂️
---
Anything modern in the 250-400 range in laptops should get it. A desktop you could manage probably in the 200-300 range. My laptop was 350 and does 90fps mid settings
---
Even in Hillsbrad theres a shit ton of Horde. Hillsbrad is actually the one zone it felt "even". Every other zone was an absolute slaughter. STV? Absolute fricken slaughter, no contest. In all my years on a pvp server, and in Vanilla, nothing compared to the time I spent in STV this time around. It wasn't the amount of pvp, it was the amount of completely one-sided pvp.
---
 Just because you got killed by alliance one time on an alliance-popular layer doesn't mean its an issue. You win some, you lose some, that's the joy of pvp servers. This isn't "winning" some. It's been extremely Horde dominated on every layer, every time I log on so far. That's a problem.
---
&gt;So because 1% of people knew how to install addons that means everyone did? 
---
It was not the gate that controlled who raided. Delusion. But keep grasping.
---
&gt;doesn’t make you retarded for playing on what your only option was at the time. 
---
tbh it does if you were wiping your raid and wasting many peoples time. Selfish and retarded perhaps is a better way to phrase it.
---
Do you really want to leak your real life info over something this stupid and childish, Zachary?
---
To be fair to him there have been loads of posts on Reddit about enjoying the leveling experience but if he doesn't use Reddit and is only used to retail then maybe he didn't know that a large part of classic is the journey compared to retail that's all about the end game content, seemed to me like OP was just trying to help him out
---
yeah I have to agree on that. It's not a bad move to offer it that early. So ppl that never enjoied classic/vanila and don't mind switching to a different server can get an experience free of queues. I personally prefer to get some queues while beeing on a High pop server than on a dead realm in the next month
---
Because people just want a "fix" between bfa content while the people who spent years advocating for the release of classic and want to ensure longevity of the servers get ignored.
---
I got it! Then what the hell are they doing? The game is out for a couple days and already got exploited in so many ways..
---
It’s elitism and entitlement. Some of the people on here have no other social environment and can easily slip into the mind set of “you should do it my way because that’s how I like it” and in turn, just ostracized themselves even more.
---
I've been doing good with keeping weapon up to date. Got a 31 blue two-hander for cleaving and before that I had two up to date blue-1handers for fury.
---
Yeah my thinking is that most people are still leveling and I'm pretty fast at it so I won't be too far behind.
---
Exactly. I have two others who don't care
---
But is abandoning your pet to die worth it as they look at you running away to hit a rock? If you're a true hunter main, the answer is... Maybe...
---
The “old storm wind” where you phase through the wall to the underworld beneath was awesome to do.
---
Nice video
---
Might just be your server then. I’ve died multiple times to Alliance now.
---
I saw Herod and others were primarily horde and bounced from those pretty quickly.
---
this is not a complaint. this is a statement. Did you finish grade 10?
---
I see you also skipped most of the other totems.
---
Nice!

I think someone put out a hit on you, watch your back bro.

Fun story! The prairie dog was bugged on release. It would get scared when you started a fight and it would run away. It would come back... but if it encountered any friends while it was on it’s journey it would bring them with it. In short, it would run off and agro other mobs then pull them on to the party. I knew this. My friend knew this. Most people didn’t. When we had an especially bad group, out came the prairie dog and shortly after were the, “Where the hell did all those mobs come from!?” Oh, good ole Prairie Dog. Good times. Good times.

1/70 in bc was faster than 1/60 in vanilla

No one cares about your petition

Good luck !

Soon they’ll revert back to jumping off buildings and leaving corpses that spell out the names of their websites.

I've seen a lot of people try this. If your doing light grinding it's fine. Lots of latency. Don't even try if raiding lol.

Your clearly someone who exploits it.

Idk how people can do such tiny detailed art. I can't even paint my nail one colour without messing it up

where did you steal the laptop from? can't steal data, eh?

All I did was go to the quest locations. I discovered there's simply too many people farming elementals for it to be viable so I bought all those materials off the ah for 12 gold. For the trolls I grouped up with another random warrior on site, and we got it done in about 40 minutes.
---
The last phase was easy, asked in local and found five other warriors, grouped and took turns, took about 10 minutes.
---
The main thing I hate about these cleave groups, is that unless I managed to find a mage to give me water, I have to use my own which cost 5 for 9s. and I can only sit to drink maybe 9 seconds of it before having to get up because they've already pulled the next group!
---
Like pretty much all cartoon characters have big eyes whether it be Eastern or Western animation tho.
---
It's my basement.
---
Yea. I originally liked it at first, thought it was kinda fun name. But this was my main, and I knew if I didn't 110% like it now, I wasn't going to like it more later on when im 60. Mine as well reroll at the low level of 17 lol. Hours wasted.
---
Oh yea and I agree with op, leveling is half the journey and I think enjoyable. I can see tho why the random might get triggered over ops interjected opinion when the guy was just lf whatever he also enjoyed
---
Use fucking print screen REEEEEE
---
The skritches!
---
Thanks, but unfortunately that macro doesn't take into account the CD after switching stances. So you click it once, it takes you to Berserker/Battle Stance, and then you have to wait until the CD passes and then press it again to execute the move and switch stances again.
---
The problem is, if you spam click it too much, it will take you back to Battle Stance/Berserker Stance after a full rotation. Since i doubt there's a macro that does all that, I'm personally just sticking to manually switching stances for now.
---
Thanks for the help though :)
---
14 fingers. u trying to make me laugh too or wot m8
---
Agreed
---
Gold won’t get you much gear in retail unless you also use that gold to pay for dungeon/raid boosts
---
This would be a really cool addition
---
The game will never end. There is 3 tiers of content and 2 off tiers of content. You will see guilds forming for MC until the game shuts down the servers. Was like this on all pservers and will be like that on live. You will AE a vast majority of people in tier 1/2 for ever. AQ will have it’s fair share of guilds and naxx will have those dedicated guilds. Don’t worry about rerolling. If you’re not in your high 40s or early 50s with your first toon as is... you shouldn’t be worried about “falling behind” simply because there is no such thing as “falling behind” in classic wow. Guarantee once we get to AQ/Naxx content, any alts your guild has will be invited to a raid in greens and half geared by the end. Don’t worry about falling behind since it doesn’t happen in classic. ALL 50+ content is relevant for the entire history of the game servers being online.
---
I heard that if you stick a finger up your arse and gently wipe it over your phone you get extra data. let me know how it goes.

Mages and warlocks. Lol

I always thought those were his top teeth. I guess not.

Please do. Consistency
---
Lvl as combat, get improved gouge (useful for energy regen while bandaging) + 5% hit, cd reduction in evasion and sprint plus riposte (make a macro for every attacking ability and add /cast Riposte first, example /cast riposte, /startautoattack, /cast Sinister strike/rupture/eviscerate etc)
---
You're right, it's none of my business. I just wanted to say that it's okay to be "behind" and it's silly to feel rushed, or the need to rush through the game when it has only been out for a week, but I didn't expect someone to get so defensive lol and it went south from there
---
I'd miss wow achievements too if I had nothing to achieve in real life.
---
... So in the end, WoW mobile did become a reality, and it's Classic... LOL! 🤣
---
This reminds me that my gnome is going to be stuck on a loud mechanostrider for 20 levels and untold hours. Ugh. I need my horse and I need it ASAP.
---
You can easily tank in zerk stance and 2hander for most of the leveling, if the healer is any good he'll keep you up and with all the rage you're getting from being hit the mobs die twice as fast.
---
My first character was a hunter.  IMO, hunters went way downhill after WotLK, when they changed the mechanics completely for them.  It’s so refreshing to be able to play the way I remember it!
---
Since you're including Sham I take it Horde is at least an option.
---
It's not terribly original but undead rogue was/is one of the kings of wPvP due to the mileage you can get out of WotF and Cannibalize. Nothing generates salt like a sapped or stunned enemy w/trinket on CD while you Cannibalize and bandage back HP.
---
That dude is spouting nonsense. WF on a dagger is fine. When you're leveling, I would suggest using whatever enhancement is the most recently leveled. Not necessarily the highest rank because you got them all at different points. So if you just trained rockbiter, it's likely doing the most DPS. Windfury is just flashier, but the numbers are there. This trend will continue unitl 60, when Flametongue and WF will dominate for damage. The only reason I would say to not use rockbiter is because of the threat issue in a group. Other people who have never played a shaman are going to shoot me for saying this, but seriously it's the truth. Just try it yourself.
---
As an Alliance player I second this as I’ve only had bad experiences with gnomes so far in Classic. From ninja looting to ninja pulling to basically just being rude in general. So far I’ve dreaded making a gnome character in fear of becoming one of the gnomes. So to both of you gnome bastards that ninja pulled Chok’Sul with your fancy magic spells I hope you die to a naked orc with an owl.
---
Those brackets made me audibly laugh. Tbh I'm all up for them in 2 years time taking the osrs approach to adding new content. ie. Laying out the new content with a video and extremely detailed plan then letting the community vote on it and do a 70% in favour to pass
---
Okay that makes sense, thank you.
---
Jesus. I'm not talking about what you can and cant do. I'm specifically talking about the warrior that was tanking in Quinn's raid.

This old school fog and rain is to die for.  I love it

Maybe try free and I’ll fuck around on it if there is huge queues

Nah nvm keep it

STV

My entire guild of Tauren all do this when we first log on hahaha

I thought only *I* could prevent forest fires...

I got the game to run but can't figure out how to get the WSAD stuff configured. I can only choose Default and that just shows trackpad, joystick, and d pad.
---
Or maybe that's not a large part of classic to some people? I hate leveling.. from 2 60s on retail vanilla as well as 7 on 1x xp rate private servers leveling is not even remotely fun for me, I enjoy end game much more.
---
I'm playing shaman for the first time. I'm disappointed in myself for not playing one a lot sooner.

I'm playing a shadow priest with my best friend playing shaman. Gonna be sad when he hits 20 and leaves my ass in the dust.
---
I don't get where people are coming up with the idea that there will be "eternal vanilla servers". Odds are if they decide to go with a classic TBC, the classic servers will migrate to TBC just like vanilla did back in 07. 
---
What are you gonna do on a 60 server once you've cleared Naxx a few times and the majority of the playerbase has moved over to TBC anyways? Ever been on a dead private server, its depressing as fuck.
---
Now there are a few but remember launch day? all of the were full because they didn’t expect this even though we’ve told them “we think we want it and We Do”
---
You targeted yourself....  :-\\    But yeah, awesome work!
---
Fantastic
---
It was 4 (Vanilla), then 4 (BC), then 1 (WOTLK). but yeah, I remember taking all day to install it and then having it crash on the 4th disc.... several times.
---
its cuz im black huh
---
You can enchant the same bracers multiple times.
---
Really wish humans didn't have such shit tier 60% speed mounts..they look so plain
---
I'm going back to school for a master's degree in October.
---
I've spent an inordinate amount of time plotting how to leverage stuff like Notability so I can get some game time in during the more mundane parts of lecture.
---
You're the thrower right? Cuz my experience has been 35+ Alliance getting raid groups together and making circles through the farm and coast lines
---
You enchant the same item over and over.
---
I have to work a double...my guildies are gonna pass me, and I just got caught up yesterday
---
This is what I do.
---
Enchant same bracers over and over.  Spam trade chat free bracers enchants
---
If classic does well enough I dont see why they couldnt maintain BC and vanilla servers at the same time
---
Turn on raid frames in the interface settings. Last option all the way at the bottom then check the box at the top. You can enable class colors as well.
---
For powerleveling, Just keep enchanting the same pair of bracers. It will pop up asking if you want to replace, just click yes. Keep going as much as you want too.
---
You can see them all on wowhead. One of them says "the lich king lives!"

I started going Holy spec after Spirit Tap/Imp SWP and Wand Spec will it be worth it to respec for Shadowform at 40?
---
Looking down the Holy tree looks really nice for spell damage and the added healing ability for dungeons.
---
The amount of chrome tabs you have open puts me on edge...
---
Gotta find the right download! I downloaded one from wow-legacy and it was fucked up, then googled a bit and found one that works perfectly. I’m so happy with it, it looks great and it works so much better than zperl or any other I tried.
---
If you can’t find the right download file let me know and I’ll look it up for you (going to sleep now and turned pc off already)
---
I wasn't talking about WoW, i was talking about Diablo, Overwatch and Starcraft.
---
Deleted nvm read your post wrong
---
Started with a priest stopped at 17. Leveled an enh shaman to 23 , now I’m having thoughts of going back to the priest 🙄
---
Yes, my point is, if they were farming dungeons nonstop to level, the tank should've gotten zerk stance and 2h tanked. It's faster.
---
rock elementals in badlands give good grey drops if you are up for something grindy.
---
otherwise go do quests! a 2h weapon quest reward vendors for &gt;1g
---
I think I get it... felweed wasn't introduced until BC. Maybe that word doesn't belong in this sub.
---
K thanks
---
I don't mind getting ganked. I do mind only ever being ganked by people with ??? levels in large groups. I shouldn't have to roll PvE for the enemy faction to not grief lowbies constantly. Feels like some basic etiquette is missing

We bailed from skeram when we saw server pops.

Keeping your fingers toasted!

Bear tank is best tank.
---
Your cat is about to blaze that bowl HARD!
---
You have already lost to poopsockers who hit 60 and cleared MC in the first week.
---
Yup and steam open as well. It is a remote desktop pretty much. It's just super smooth (connection depending) and has controller/key mapping support :)
---
I got this too, then reloaded to a 5k/80 min queue. Fug.
---
I would but we got a mage in the group already, can you suggest a type of mage to play? Obviously there can be be more than one of one type of character but personally I try and not pick a class if someone is already playing it. You know what I mean?
---
I went into classic solo too and although I don't mind playing solo and just watching Netflix while I quest I also took the time to have a look at the guilds on my server. If you find your servers sub Reddit there will be recruitment posts up or go on the wow forums for your server and just hop in each guilds discord till you find one where you get on well with them. If it's a large enough friendly guild (especially if your chatting to people on discord) you will have no issues finding people to roll with.
---
And as for trying a new server I would stick with your character and server for now and if by the time character transfers come out you haven't found a guild you mesh well with then find one on another server and move to that one after you have chatted to them 
---
Good luck
---
join a guild
---
I’m almost certain that Blizzard lost their court case against the company that made the bot because it was illegal for them to scan running programs
---
You do you. I'm garbage at shadow spec and do better as disc, myself.
---
That does look pretty damn cozy....Is that a recliner??
---
Use two fingers at same time. Not sure if it's a setting or something but I think that worked for me by default
---
Can be not totally responsive all the time though
---
Wow.  So much easier.  Thank you.
---
&gt;you don't always get 2 loot from raid bosses, because what if someone else looted something first, haha you're wrong you obviously have not played vanilla ever!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Imagine being this desperate to prove someone "wrong" on the internet.
---
Where Gators bitches at
---
Probably a target macro for boss spawns

Why the FUCK isn't there realm transfers for my realm? I'm on Whitemane and I'm still in a god damn 6k queue after work. I want to play the game at any time, this is retarded

I have a 2013 Dell with an Intel Celeron 1.5 Ghz processor and whatever the onboard graphics are and I'm playing classic woth no noticeable difficulties. Will only run retail at 10 fps though.

But there wasn’t a rumor out there  Blizz would make BfA available for free to the people dinging 60 in Classic?
---
Has science gone too far??
---
Thank you

You are a higher level than me and you are playing on a phone.... ugh I need to step up my gsme

This mage rolled on +nature damage staff. We had a Druid in the group and the mage took it because it was a blue staff.
---
I'll smoke to that!
---
Same lol. I went and picked enchanting/tailoring as well, so I’m probably gonna be short come 40, but I really, *really* don’t want to just wand and bubble my way there.

Man you've got it pegged. As someone who taught undergrad courses for several years, the purpose of a lecture is catering to the auditory learners and answering questions. This is just my experience. I'm going back to school myself and plan to read ahead, ask questions, and play some WoW with that lecture time.

The only thing i miss about having to purchase the box sets is the midnight launches that my friends and I would go out to.  The game store would be mobbed, and you actually find cool people you can add to your friends list!

Did it help with pickpocket opener?

I just think thats cute because he's probably new and had no clue wtf he was doing :')
---
Probably

Haven't seen any of that. A couple of solo alliance here and there and 30 lv20 horde players anywhere between SS, TM, Hillsbrad Fields and Alterac.

It's one of the hallmarks - but like, a lot of really classic anime doesn't have particularly large eyes in comparison to western animation. Like, Ghibli is considered like... the height of anime and their eyes are not particularly large.
---
Ghibli movie in typical house style:

Depends on the series and the character designer. Some go for the stereotypical huge eyes and small mouth - some go for more subtle, realistic looking humans: [https://video-images.vice.com/\_uncategorized/1522720647672-cowboy\_bebop\_box\_2\_review\_screenshot3.jpeg](https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1522720647672-cowboy_bebop_box_2_review_screenshot3.jpeg) \- Cowboy Bebop

More modern anime in terms of broad style goes for more naturally proportioned faces with soft, idealized-natural hair:

TBH trying to define exactly what is anime at this point is getting kinda weird - like, Castlevania and Cannon Busters have all the visual hallmarks of anime... but are show run by Americans, have a ton of American artists working on them, and the native dub of them is actually the *English*.

That said, the visual language which defines anime uses a lot of traits beyond Big Eyes Small Mouth - that comprises some of the elements... but there absolutely is anime hair. :P

Edit: Before marrying my husband I knew about 1% of this. The weeb is infectious and spreads easily.
---
You had him make a warrior?  That should be considered child abuse!
---
I'm having trouble getting the WSAD controls to show up. I just see the joystick and D-pad on my controller settings on the app.
---
Yeah, I'm on Incendius and I went there as Ally and didn't have a single problem. Seemed like everyone there just wanted to quest.
---
layers affect you global.
---
This made me cringe...
---
I play alliance lock on PvP server and I am killing it. 2v1's no issue
---
Hey man, I've been playing wow for more than 11 years and i still don't know what to roll on classic. Do whatever you want the game will wait for you. I'm currently stuck on level 20 on my rogue which i enjoyed the most so far but i still need to try out druid,priest and hunter. :)
---
This is the kind of stuff I am absolutely hoping for.  I keep second guessing my choice to play classic on a PvE server, because I've been on PvP servers since TBC.  I want the consensual zone battles without all of the ganking... so I hope those kinds of things aren't too rare.
---
Ain't that the truth. Mained a Warrior in BFA. Got to classic. Uh wheres my victory rush? Trying to line up that one heroic strike... you need more rage! You need MORE RAGE! But I cant hit the damn thing to get rage! And I'm running back to my body.
---
Ok. Now let's eat and get that mo-- I cant eat? what do you mean I'm in combat?! Oh c'mon I dont have enough health for thi-- running back to my body.
---
And this is level 14!
---
But I'd be damned if I'm not going to get this guy to 60. Classic is truly a remarkable experience even today.
---
Will they do the same for Wrath when they release that too?
---
Out of combat regen is really high tbh, as long as you keep a decent 2.4+ speed mainhand there shouldn’t be much downtime until the late 20s
---
Same thing happened to me!!
---
Yeah I saw the DS/Ruin setup, which is a large competent of maximizing damage on the Warlock.  
---
Though I'm more keen on Soul Link (3% dmg) and Master Demonologist 10% increase in dmg and 20% threat reductions. Overall less dps than DS/Ruin with greater general sustainability and utility in non-raid environments.   
---
Will be jumping onto Succubus by level 30. But really gonna miss that Blood Pact and Fire Shield.
---
Damn, that's amazing.
---
On my server you let people know you're being camped in general chat and its all, "Lel pvp happend gitgud."
---
meh. im doing good. I dont really care what people think.
---
Exactly, that’s why I’m saying although I personally agree with ops opinion I can see how dude he messaged got upset because everyone has their own opinion on what’s fun and what they personally enjoy
---
As a feral druid I can tell you, it's not much better.  Early levels are rough for anyone who has impatient dps.
---
Use remote desktop to queue up an hour before you leave work.
---
Then what are you doing here? Lol
---
All in Arathi aswell. Someone really wants Tidal Charm
---
Owls are awesome. Screech is an aoe aggro magnet and the damage reduction makes it super tanky.
---
Let me just say they really need to not do this. Keep classic WoW as classic WoW, and just expand on it with more content.
---
We don’t want TBC, WOTLK etc. They need to go the OSRS route
---
That game was great - just not WoW. Best non wow mmo ive played I think in terms of enjoyment
---
Does every zhevra drop a hoof? Does every ooze drop a bag? Does every stupid elemental drop a gods-be-dammned Laden Dew Gland? 
---
So it is with fused wiring.
---
I love the non looters in dngs. Checking for an item and then move on. Meanwhile my bags are filling with 20s+ greys and materials. 5 greys are already 1 gold! Every penny counts for that sweet mount
---
Yeah I have the old one with four disks. Lol I have all the way up to WoD I actually posted a pic on this reddit over a week ago of it
---
Amazing! How long did this take to make?
---
Tbf if attendance is mandatory they can't be mad.
---
You're welcome!
---
Just beware of the rogues with mechanical engineer sheep in starting zones.
---
doesnt garrote not silence in classic?
---
As a new guy warlock, how am I supposed to know these things about other character’s abilities and when I’m fucking up rather than helping? 
---
I’m doing my best out there!!
---
P
---
Jg, you piece of filth who spammed "go to retail" after killing me with two of your friends. I am coming for you.
---
I looked at my guilds 40+ online roster today, no druids.      
---
Made one today, level 10 and enjoying it already.
---
I'm unable to train 2-handed axe at Org ? Do weapon skill doesnt show up. DDo you know why ?
---
I've had some decent PVP encounters on Kromcrush. If I had to wager my time in ashenvale and hillsbrad would be like 70-30 in the hordes favor though. It's just really hard to get a good perspective from just playing one character though.
---
Whitemane &lt;3
---
Most people just run default UI with a few addons like Leatrix plus classic, ClassicAuraDurations, ClassicCastbar, Real Mob Health, and whatever other addon they prefer.

Hahahahaha
---
32 Druid, thinking of just rerolling to hunter because I don't have a whole lot of time to play
---
Being melee hurts
---
Tanking/healing is stressful because people just pull for you or don't wait for mana
---
So I'm most likely just gonna reroll to hunter and breeze my way through everything lol
---
I'm getting zero loot nor option to loot at all. Are they supposed to drop anything? I've dropped 6 and none were lootable.
---
You are not alone my friend.

---
Scarlett monastery?

ya
---
Nope I was actually running back and forth helping family with a project. But its reddit and you want to be a shithead so lol.
---
I don't understand your thinking on this, you should never die to a hunter and most of the time you can kill them if its 1v1?
---
The guy didn't even cast root once?
---
He means in general. Lol this dudes face has shown up so much.
---
That doesn't explain undead rogues, the worst of the worst.
---
The only thing is I'm not familiar with how hard/expensive it would be to run separate servers for different expansion packs would be. Also the more servers are open the thinner the populations will be and that may cause a problem
---
His 1st time playing wow. He said to me "It worked for WC!!??"
---
You ever get a fix for this? I'm having the same problem too where I don't know where to go to find the wasd setup
---
Quite a few alliance people I've seen (playing alliance) are honourable about pvp and don't agree with fighting far weaker/outnumbered foes.
---
Of course some don't have that code.
---
You have a point, however anyone who says it's not great to play 19 hours a day does too. It's his life but that's doesn't mean it's worth wasting. 
---
All things in moderation. Including moderation.
---
You have to reroll for jhomkresh
---
The server isnt open, it is only going to be available for transfers only for a bit.
---
Don't start fights with either mocking blow OR heroic strike. Mocking blow is best used for emergencies, and heroic strike is best used when you have significant excess rage. Lots of new warriors seem to think heroic strike only costs 15 rage, but the reality is that you don't get rage from that white attack so it costs more like 22-30 rage.
---
Moral of the story. Don't use heroic strike unless you have a shit load of rage and need to dump it. Stick to sunders and shield block/revenge.
---
Horde ftw
---
ok.
---
Horde: Ruthlessly swarming into the fields of war turning alliance into gnome juice.
---
Alliance: I turned a sheep into a sheep
---
You remember that when you’re teamfighting in an AV in the future, and you take a mortal strike to the dome lol
---
I have a level 5 owl, I hear you just go to Westfall, tame a bird, learn screech, teach it to your owl, and then you're good to go?
---
What about bite/claw and all that? Does the bird in Westfall come with it?
---
The fact that you didnt kill him when you saw him make you a weak prey. You will die 100% of the time any ally attack you.
---
how else do you think I've been beating those queue times?!
---
I got nothing
---
Same here. Saw people rejoicing the return of the 10~ polygon prairie dog and I'm just wishing we could have the newer one, along with newer models for everything else that has been updated.
---
But I don't want true Classic. I want Classic mechanics but with a mount and companion tab, with a barber, with newer models and textures, and so on.
---
A 200-300 raptor strike makes a big difference.
---
I am OP and your comment made absolutely no sense you bloody idiot.
---
Fuck other kids bdays tbh
---
Lol I do this with my stoneclaw totem.
---
Wait is this the transfer from skeram and the other one? That’s already out? I’m not sure if I want to transfer
---
I feel like just make some shit up would get him to leave you alone sooner than ignoring him.
---
Yep pretty much me except I was helping someone build some furniture. But you and I are literally Hitler according to people on this reddit thread. Nice on the burritos btw. I love to cook my own as well. I do turkey meat :) I honestly prefer it over beef now.

Ah I see! I followed this video exactly and it worked like a charm

1H mace crits are my favorite in-game sound.

This but vanilla. Got me a fancy “gaming” laptop that had like an nvidia mobile gt450 or something awful and had a 1440 red wide screen. Was super sweet and campus had WiFi in all my buildings. Did about 0% work that semester.

What arline is this?  Every airline I've flown on with internet, is so slow I can barley check my email.  Much less game.
---
Last time I played I specced disc and loved it.  I wonder how it compares in classic.
---
And then the acid hits you, woah
---
That's because everyone is in the Barrens. No one is in Silverpine. Gotta explain that to him. Tell him to go to UC and try trade chat.
---
Did Blizzard hire the GoT staff and director for this ad?
---
i got one to 13, but decided that i played druid so damn much in retail over the years (was my main) that i want to play a class I've never really played before (believe it or not, there are two classes that I've never maxxed despite the many years of retail).
---
so i rolled a priest.
---
The phenomenon started with anime. Large eyes in western animation caught on after it was made popular by eastern animation.
---
Kirtonos, medium-high population. Occasionally a queue but never more than 10 mins or so. Lots of Horde guilds and a lot of Herod refugees.
---
While true, crit is very important to shaman when they get the Flurry talent.  Each crit gives you 30% faster attack speed for your next 3 swings.  Get enough Agi/+crit% and you can reliably maintain that 30% faster swing speed.
---
For real the moves are coming at least.
---
Night elves do get a stealth bonus which will help druids on the alliance side. Still not as strong as a night elf rogue stealth but can makes up for it somewhat.
---
I made *so much gold* from selling Ornate Spyglasses because of this zone! Small benefit of leveling on an RP/PVP server. That and the discombobulator rays when they would still dismount players.
---
Well, lucky for you the code doesn't concern you :)
---
Maybe you were with me o.O
---
how many of your pets survived?
---
It’s because we both played WoW before battle.net integration and were minors. When battle.net came we merged our accounts together, I can’t remember why or what the procedure was.
---
First one documented on reddit? Lol
---
No queue during the day, 3000-4000 person queue at night
---
33 mage and have been considering rolling a priest for my guild because we only have 1 priest but theyre lower than most of our pack. So close to getting a mount, but man questing sucks right now. Even killing every mob I see I am usually doing 2 or 3 quests before changing zones because everything else is orange in the current zone or yellow but has me fight orange mobs.
---
I think a lot of people that level a rogue so they can easily gank will have a rough awakening in classic. Its actually hard to gank decent players as a rogue.
---
Theirs way more stealth detection in classic, rogues have not so many get out of jail cards (outside of subtle and dagger builds are shit without really good gear) and a lot of classes can kill you quite easily if you make one single mistake.
---
Like a lost puppy &lt;3
---
Noooo. Why would you post this and make me sad??? Rerolling to play with your precious friend!! :(
---
*arousing* the guards.  Delete this and re-post.

I pulled this exact camp of 3 dudes as warlock this morning. There was a warrior nearby watching in awe as I managed to dot them all down with my voidwalker. I imagine he was impressed by my skill, but I was in fact shitting myself the whole time.

Also, fuck the shackle drop rate.
---
For real, I remember having the poopiest computer and I had to have my friend remote in from his laptop and fix a patch for me cause I was so young I didn’t understand why it wasn’t working. Too me that was so cool, now it’s nothing special at all.

I know this if off topic and I’m sorry but what does re-rolling mean? I keep seeing it but can’t figure it out lol

Are you going horde or alliance? Pve/pvp or both?

Shaman or Druid seems to fit what you’re looking for, especially if it’s for pvp.

Lvl 9 orc warrior with my brother a lvl 9 priest just rerolled. Gonna be spamming dungeons. Soon lol

Best. Response. Ever.

Actually I forgot about the mount training costs, the cost of 60 paladin training comes from the fact that there are 18 things to learn at level 60, many of which cost almost 5 gold each.

how can you do plenty of moving around and playing at the same time?

Complaining is part of the pvp experience.

Change my mind.

Oh, Ive been using daggers since that feels more ROGUE to me...

creating a new character

just let them win guys

Bear tanks are amazing especially in dungeons whaaa?

is frostbite needed for a frost mage pvp spec? does it proc enough to make it worth it?

Ouch.  It just gets better lol.
---
I was questing in STV last night and an alliance rogue unstealthed and started killing mobs I was likely going to die to, saving my life.  I thanked him, helped him with a pull so he could get a quest mob, then went on my merry way.  2-3 hours later I was doing the Heart of &lt;insert large gorilla's name here&gt; and was very obviously going to die to the last wave.  That same rogue popped out of stealth and finished the quest mob off for me before I died, so I was still able to get credit.  Turned out he needed the quest too, so I stayed and danced with him while we waited for it to respawn and I helped him out.
---
If only I could add him to my friends list...
---
You: Shamans are rolling need on a wide variety of items
---
Me: Here's why shaman (and hunter) players might feel compelled to roll on such a wide variety of items. As an aside, here's some fun trivia about hunter abilities.
---
You: Why are you saying shamans and hunters should be free to roll need on everything?
---
Me: What? I only explained why they currently do.
---
You: YOU DON'T DECIDE WHAT YOU SAID---I DO.
---
Neither can I. I can’t find any of the key bindings it just has a pop up keyboard
---
First of all, don’t rush. Who cares about leveling speed and efficiency. You should be taking your time and enjoy the whole experience. It’s not a race to level 60. There will be plenty of people around your level regardless of how slow or fast you are. I started at launch and I’m not even level 20. 
---
Your guild should be a leveling guild ideally with people of your level. If not, don’t worry. Most groups are formed by random people encountering each other while questing anyways.
---
Awesome thanks!  Definitely PVP, not sure about faction but I think my friends are on alliance.
---
False
---
Thank you lol
---
Better yet, have him type
---
 "/join LookingForGroup" every server has one &amp; if not, doing this will create it.
---
On my server (incendius) this is wildly popular and reaches 100% of the game. 
---
(To anyone within the channel, regardless of zone will see the messages)
---
It is so popular that you nay want to consider right clicking on general chat TAB and click "create new tab"
---
From that tab he can set filters for what type of messages this new TAB will receive. 
---
I'd recommend "system messages" "lookingforgroup" and "whispers"
---
Also, let him know that if he holds shift and then left clicks on a name in any chat it will tell you the class, level, and location of that person
---
He will have all the groups he can ever join or create from that tab alone. 
---
GG

Cheers!

Alaska.  It's consistently 1 sec latency, playable for questing and gathering.

I love it. This was me.

As an alliance player, I have to upvote this

Yep. I also put up a couple shirts you get from starting a new character for 2 gold as well. Someone bought my thug shirt already haha.

Been looking for one of these, you’re a legend mate
---
Being good for goodness sake isn’t internet points imo
---
I don't put creamer in my coffee. So just getting the most out of my cup. Although the retarded thing is correct.
---
Oh shit it’s u!! Hahaha
---
This is why you make your own group as tank and only invite clothies, rogues, and Druids.
---
I have halo, power, magic, judge, trust, first, sham, pos, lol on mine. Na, I’m good for now.
---
That is all good, I just want to say sneak into contested areas, past PVP guards, near players.
---
How hard is it really to level a warrior? I’m sure is not lock like but near impossible as people paint it?
---
I dont see how that changes it.  I have just one point in.  35% proc chance, annoying when it doesnt proc, but has never saved me from a rogue specifically when it does.  Does it get easier to break?
---
# HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
ive never RPd but im definitely rolling an alliance char in a rppvp server next to check it out
---
I had a alliance priest following my orc warlock for about 5 min applauding or laughing at me depending on how good I killed the trash mobs I was farming.
---
Won’t it show the attack tooltip since that’s next in line?
---
You do you. I can't stand that place.
---
"Thousand Needles escorts are aids because of the respawn rates" need I say more?
---
Edit: since you're obviously too thick to understand what I'm saying I'll add another quote. 
---
" It’s one thing to ask for help if you can’t solo something, but to feel obligated to ask for help because someone might have to wait a couple minutes because they got there later rather than sooner? Lol. "
---
Do you see the contradiction in these two statements? You don't care if someone else has to wait for their escort so why the fuck do you think we care if you have to wait for your escort?
---
lol the nerve of this dude who does he think he is?
---
Or should we say “WOW!”
---
Never post to the AH from your main

As a warrior waiting for overpower procs is my only thing getting me through it. Last set of charms for ww axe. Can't waiylt

Wand attacks aren't like auto attacks.  You have to interrupt wanding, wait for global cooldown, and then cast a spell.
---
What app do you use to do this?
---
I noticed this on my crap pc in stormwind...during the day! Go the cathedral area in the back and look for the roaming guard. Looks amazing.

It's an Enhancement talent

I don't know about that. I've seen plenty of those people here, but also plenty of people who are reasonable towards people they might not agree with.

Personally, I choose to believe that most people who wanted Classic wanted it for the mechanics, and then mostly stuff like no dungeon finder, no flying, and the class mechanics.
---
I think most would be okay with a barber and a mount/companion tab to clear up the limited bagspace we have.

&gt;... Only to beg for gold and items from other players after saying they strictly wouldn't.
---
I have not once seen Asmongold explicitly ask for gold from people. People just send it to him. A lot of them probably send it so that people will make posts just like this one against him.
---
&gt;...Only to spam Scarlet Monastery to level.
---
He's been open world questing for a while now. Pretty sure Scarlet Monestary was just to get a lead against gankers.
---
&gt;...Only to beg for gold for your first mount when you said you wouldn't
---
Again, I haven't seen him explicitly beg for anything.
---
&gt;...Only to say " CAN I GET THAT? " whenever an item drops.
---
That's literally an Asmongold trademark. Do you really watch his stream?
---
&gt;...Only to say " I don't want to do that quest it doesn't give good enough loot "
---
That's not un vanilla like at all. You're not pigeon holed into completing every single quest to progress a zone like in modern WoW. If it doesn't look worth it, you don't have to do it. And a lot of people just don't.
---
&gt;...Only to do the same exact things and behave the same way you do on retail
---
Asmongold acts like Asmongold no matter what game he plays? Shocking.
---
This is just a common case of your magical envisioning of how classic WoW is supposed to be being inaccurate.
---
I am indeed very lucky that I get to lay waste to any target, cat or bear I see instead of holding hands with the enemy faction because of a lame rule made up by a few players. Last I checked there's a faction flag beside your name not a class icon
---
lol
---
There's an unusually high proportion of high-paying quests at level 48 and 51 (like half of the 6-8 quests), hence the weird spike around that area.
---
Is funny cause I took the gryphon from gatze to thera and came here to browse reddit while I flew and saw this post. A minute later went back to the game and when I handle the quest I was "WTF, I know this face"

Maybe I need to give it more of a chance.

I remember an old video of someone using like an iphone 3rd gen that was jailbroken or something to actually run wow at like 10-15 frame rates. I wonder now with the mobile power if it would run closer to like 25 frame rates. Tbh, I could see blizz porting this to arm chips and hit the mobile market cause of the diablo immortal move already.

I am currently really torn between Rogue and Warrior. I played both of them a lot through the game (started in TBC, played until BfA, but never played vanilla at max level)
---
I like fast paced gameplays in general, rn i have a Warrior at 20 but i feel very very slugish in combat. Does it get better at higher levels ?  Or should i roll Rogue and embrace the SS/hemo/backstab spam? Would be nice to have intel from people who know classic more than i do. Thanks!
---
Whatever’s working for you, I plan on taking it out of rotation eventually cause it is time consuming but gettin that initial burst at the beginning of the fight feels so good, I won’t use it on a player though, that’s too much time

Its wow etiquette to insult your warrior tank in dungeons... so they generate more rage.

I think it’s more that it just wasn’t a very good joke.
---
It's the weakest solo class definitely. But it's only a hair worse than rogue. It was the first class I leveled in '04, and it really did skew how difficult I saw the game being. 
---
If you prepare and keep your gear and skills good, it's fine. But it's worse than every other class until 60, at which point, you become an unstoppable killing machine. (Spoilers: you do not really become an unstoppable killing machine until you have, like, BWL gear. The further you go in progression, the better you're becoming than everyone else.)

Same here i can't find the keyboard setting at all

Sorry to tell you this friend but people can play however they want, there is nothing wrong with farming dungeons for xp.

I just used a base macro but put the shield first. Because I notice it would put on the sword, in the offhand and then the shield in the same slot, unequipping the sword. So putting the shield first solved it .

Lucky mofos. I'll have people 4-9 levels above me gank and camp me, many times. Was especially bad in stv and badlands. On the plus side I've gotten pretty good at escaping. But seriously, I can't count the number of times I've been ganking by high levels or while pulling 2+ mobs

Your wands share the same cooldown as your spells. Its not considered a weapon technically
---
Might as well stop to smell the mageroyal. :D
---
Put it this way, if you played it perfectly and only pulled single mobs at at time, you should be good.  
---
The issue is that if anything goes wrong, you're kinda stuck with just running away.  Rogues can stealth away, other classes have easier times to run, pet classes don't need to, and any healing class can just sit there and take it.
---
Guy had 3 spiders on him so I used howl on him and the spiders. All 4 went running off in opposite directions.

It looks so nice though! I wish my setup looked like that... (wish I had a setup) lol
---
Until you get that strong Blue 2h that chunks a mobs HP every hit (that’s not a miss/dodge/parry). 
---
They’re just too dependent on their weapon staying relevant while leveling. But once you get that corpsemaker, warrior quest axe, etc.. it’s a whole different ball game.
---
For I am going into battle

Do you have any advice? I'm really trying to get help here. I can't play the game at all unless I was to run everywhere which I don't have time to do.

hmm I can understand being mad at 10 man exploits, but this is just the normal game and a good thing if youre lfg?

I’m not asking for you to give a shit. I didn’t ask for it and idc about you dude. I said blizzard didnt think about escort quests when it comes to increased respawn rates. You’re irrelevant.

Yes. I live in Japan and play on US servers

This was a quality post and it deserves more credit.
---
Got a source/link for the survey? Curious how my server stacks up - I'm Oceanic which historically has favored alliance heavily over horde.
---
Ok my opinion isn’t what decides if a game is good or bad how about we look at the numbers then. I am a blizzard fan boy but it was a failure. It’s great that you like it but that doesn’t make it a good game either.
---
Uhhhhh...Stonks?

Does that addon have a button to auto-sort the items? I use onebag and it doesn't have it.

I should probably try to find a copy of the full-width box for LK just for completion's sake lol
---
I might be wrong. But i don't seem to get raged from taking dmg
---
I get that feeling with Mind Blast. It's *much* faster and even though it doesn't have a DOT with it, it takes a chunk out of the enemy, and after casting SW:P, and throwing a couple wands.. my target is usually past halfway dead. So... I mean for me... I feel like that absurdly long cast time for Holy Fire and the little time it would tick for me is just a waste.
---
It's a stack of two gold bars. Seems like you also have some add-ons
---
I remember years ago thinking the same question. Was in alterc valley and found a chest when I made my sad discovery.
---
na dont think so
---
Thats just not true. You just need to max str (literally uber-alles), use a decent 2h weapon (a slow attack speed for high max-dam) and just heal with bandages you make from the cloth you loot. Warrior infact is a reasonable fast class to level.
---
If you skill herbalism/alchemy and just trink your own stuff all the time you are even competing in the top field of leveling, because warrior scales insanely good with potions.
---
A name is what you begin your life with. Names are important. My intention was not meant to be a dick, despite the delivery.

VC is the short hand for Deadmines in classic and pre cata, just helping people with the transition away from retail
---
Probably until they are happy with the realm populations.
---
I guess I didn't really specify where I was sitting, but I intentionally sat off to the side and they could only see my screen if they turned their heads to. 
---
I did learn to position myself *completely* away from people after that, yet even afterwards when they were sitting wayyy in front of me, they'd make a point to look back at me and scoff, even when I wasn't on WoW (just assumed I was). I usually go out of my way to make sure I'm not bothering others. They literally just wanted to have an issue.
---
Edit: &amp; my keys are very soft &amp; my sound was off. I literally wasn't causing a distraction. They were just the type of students to shit on other students *they* think aren't trying hard enough.
---
Some have PTO saved up, some just dont have any responsibilites other than a job. If you're working 8 hours a day, that leaves 16 hours to sleep and no life classic. If it makes you feel better, you're way further along than I am at this point, similar boat to you, kids, pets, job.
---
When is pvp coming out?
---
Was a warrior and got ganked constantly. Rerolled priest and barely die. Unless stooped alliance 10 levels higher decide to punk me. Lol
---
Likewise but by Horde obviously.  I find myself only getting ganked though when it is a group of five or more for some reason.
---
Should you *also* run the MSAA and such in game with 200% scale? Isn't this the SSAA they took out/renamed?
---
Maybe you just became more of a baby over time.
---
Wow, I didn't know. that's awesome!
---
No no. I meant i can only run classic and probably not retail as my pc is kinda between dying and dead.
---
Could it be because you are still in elf starting area?  I’m not familiar with alliance leveling, but for horde at that level, The Barrens is highly populated with lots of people looking for dungeon groups as well as people spontaneously grouping up for quests.  Find the populated area and start up conversations with people. Just put out that you are looking for people to quest with, do dungeons, even fish or whatever.  It can take time to find a couple people you click with. 
---
Might look around for another guild or work on building up the one you are in. Since so many guilds have all started up at once, many of them are small or have a core group of irl friends etc.  it will take time for guilds to build up member base. If your guild isn’t actively recruiting new members it can be tough.  Can you offer to recruit new members your level? 
---
You could roll a healer or tank and then you’d be in high demand for dungeons.  
---
I’ve started leaving all my groups telling people to hit me up if they are ever looking for heals.  I’m just a lvl 16 priest myself but there are plenty of of players my level around.  I expect we will continue to see influx of low levels because people like to play alts to try out different classes.
---
What quest is it?
---
Anathema and Netherwind. Anathema is west coast, Netherwind is east.

good question. greed is basically useless, might as well remove it and just have a roll or pass. or do it like ffxiv, need is only available if your class can use it. would get in the way for enchanting sometimes but at least people would stop bitching at me over something they could easily prevent

Ashenvale

Explain how warlocks can make chests respawn over and over like layer hopping can.
---
This layer shit goes against everything vanilla stood for, don't like it
---
Totally. Remember, the game has been out roughly a week. They didn't release Classic to be a "ladder" (like in Diablo) to be rushed through and consumed then start over. You're in for the long haul! (if you so choose)... pick something that you enjoy playing.
---
To be entirely honest, if you aren't already at the cutting edge/top of the pack, there's no point feeling FOMO and like you're missing out. 98% of the playerbase is probably not even level 40 yet I'd wager.
---
For leveling it might be also advisable to buy a full set of cheap low level starless vendor armor to enchant. 
---
Some low cost skill ups may not be something you want on your leveling gear.
---
I guess my next question is what's a good horde server to reroll on?
---
You too
---
The succubus is very fragile, so if you actually froxt nova both the lock and succibus near each other, you can easily kill it in frost damage alone. You want to counter spell there shadow spells since it locks out all of their dots including their fears. The succubus can only keep the stun up if you have no dots up since it's interrupted by damage.
---
I've heard of all these "heal bot" nonsense (sounded like paladins just spammed a single heal during raids dungeons).  I enjoy having to think about what i'm doing.  Should I be concerned?
---
Whatever you say guardian

Is your brother named Gregor, by any chance?

in the mean time, as a mage I died soloing 2 at the same time.. shame...

yeah, you should at least be able to get ten coins out of each bar. so you should have 20g there as the vendor price. try reloading your addons

3 Hunters!
---
Hunter is pretty amazing, we had a hunter tank for our Gnomer run the other day, his pet tanked the entire dungeon insanely easily.
---
I don’t live long enough to verify this.
---
Yeh mob mentality
---
I haven't quested there in years, but I remember seeing how dark it was and thinking it would suck, but then it ended up being one of my favorite zones to level.
---
I made an account for my 7yr old son the other day. Put his correct date of birth in, all account creation did was ask for a parent and to put in parent's info as the account holder. Has flags all through the account highlighting parental controls that can be turned on now. Nothing at all came up about him being too young.
---
Hey dude, i saw a post of yours from a year ago talking about how Vanilla WoW raiding can be done casually about 5-6 hours a week.  Is this still a thing?  Im a casual player and ive got about a days playtime and im only level 20.  Would like to hear from you, hope this isnt weird.
---
Yo man join my group of friends man shajin is my game name were happy to take you on I'll even tank some stuff for you to level up we need a 5th

Hey that happened to me but it was Horde camping my body!  Once the teams evened out a little they sat at Tauren Mills and wouldn't come out and play.

"you can do things like take a low level to a spot where a high level chest spawns that isn't close to aggressive npcs" -- You can do that with a Warlock.
---
Layering does not guarantee the  chest appears there on every layer at the same time.
---
You have two different issues that you are trying to make a single issue.  The player's level is irrelevant.  You can box farm instances.
---
This just sounds like a lot of user error.
---
Still better than the Draenei landing in a magic space ship and actually being good Eredar.
---
people think he wasnt trolling lol
---
Mine looked beautiful if you can properly ignore all the pixels XD
---
Unspecified time, though I think Blizzard is hopping for end of the year.  
---
Phase 2 will also mean the removal of the layer, so solving that is a major part of influencing Phase 2 release date.
---
I played wow like 15 years and I never seen a person greed for a need
---
Is balance a viable option or is it too much mana cost for spells outside of dungeons?

They're WAY more fun to play than priests if that's what you play imo. 
---
That class is basically just using your wand while leveling alllll day long unless you heal a dungeon.
---
This week I crossed like a dozen enemy druids. I cheered and jumped around all of them. 1 waved at me, 1 jumped,  1 spat on me, the rest ignored me.
---
That’s not what I was asking. I’m saying a level 1 character is not a very useful scout in the high level zones where these resources are. They are gonna get wrecked. I’m skeptical that a bunch of level 1 rogues is indicative of a successful layer hopping strategy.
---
I wanna play so bad man but work is wack
---
New graphics and a shadow Tauren?!
---
If the ability triggers the GCD, attack before. If not, attack after
---
Initially the new server is closed to new character creation, only way to end up there is to transfer, so keeping the name is pretty much guaranteed. It's like that for 1 day iirc.
---
Emirates has really gone down in service the last few years. Etihaad is a way better choice.
---
I don't know the exact formula. 
---
You will notice it a lot more when you have a healer and pull bigger packs. Dungeons for instance,
---
make sure there aren't any ranged units in the pack
---
Sooo, he's a Huntard eh?
---
Haha I’m dead. Hilarious
---
I mean, if you’re not going to be raiding, why not just be a shadow priest? You’ll still heal top level dungeons fine, and you’ll be one of the most feared world PvP classes. Another option is to spec into disc more which will improve your world PvP potential while still letting you be a potent healer.
---
Do we know when it’s going to happen yet?

I've had to give up life to slave away while he has someone else do it. I dunno man I'm just salty.

Killing mobs your level or higher as a warrior is just an exercise in frustration.

I introduced my eldest son to WoW when he was 3. He was interested in what I was doing so I made a character for him, let him sit on my lap and we played together. Started with him just spamming attack buttons, then he wanted to control forward/backward etc and finally he took control of the mouse too.  
---
Fast forward to today and he's 7yrs old. Finally made him his own account for Classic and he's questing along like a champ. We have druids that we only play together but he's also made a couple other characters to play when I'm not around.  
---
Now my 5yr old son wants to play too...
---
Ya, but have you seen the great design of westfall?

They also have zero ways to escape and their only CC is on a 2 min CD, which will bring even more mobs to stomp them flat.

Same. Did you find a solution.

actually, there are new realms active now with the realm transfers. If you aren't transferring, I don't think you can join them right away.

The only reason why your mage is still level 12 is because you are not a hunter, your pet is waiting.

I used to play an ele shaman in tbc and it was Hella fun! I suppose low levels with lack of spell/heal gear elemental wouldnt be fair off a healer spec anyway?

People who play pvp can't say "this is the real hardcore version of vanilla" as long as they're horde. Im lvl 32 and can't lvl anywhere.

I'll copy paste my macro for you when I get home :)

Nostalgia feels are worth it
---
Suggestions threw memes wont go far

What/where is SFK. I only know ragefire chasm and wailing caverns
---
This should be in /aww. Or maybe a new sub called /wowaww
---
I’m not sure how the proper logic didn’t make sense to OP either
---
What server is this on?
---
You can’t do layering without loading, so there’s no way to only do the starter zones. Most likely, each continent is a VM (world zones), and instances are on a separate VM. Layering is just cloning a continent’s VM and load balancing players across those cloned VMs.

I love this so much. Jesus I can't wait to get back into classic.
---
Still has her stream, it was a slap on the wrist.
---
Back in the day we used something called AtlasLoot and AtlasMaps.  I don't know if they work on classic, but that could be a place for you to begin googling.
---
To more seriously answer, I unfortunately don't know Hoard as well as I know alli, but generally most zones have a cooking quest which will yield stat buff foods. You want to try to focus on the ones that are single ingredient foods so that it's easy to grind up a stack or two
---
Oh sorry I missunderstood they use the rogues on different layers just to swap the actual scout between layers. 
---
So old mate is farming let’s say lotus, he’s pretty confident he’s cleared the area, or there’s too much contest, the rogue invites him to a group and his layer changes so he can do another route looking for them.
---
It's actually kinda CUTE
---
Man....that low level scorpion really fucked him up

40 holy priest here (with usual 5 in wand 5 ST), its fucking easy dude. Shield, Smite/Holy Fire, SWP, Mind Blast, wand. Shit is dead so fast and I rarely sit. If im fighting something couple levels higher, Ill toss in an extra smite or two for like 3-4 pulls then on the 5th do the regular jam to regen mana. Sure youre inner fire ends up taking 3-4 hits but it doesnt matter, ST regens hp too. Really the only reason IMO to go Shadow is if you will never group (yes, no matter what yall say there is a sizeable difference starting at 40 between shadow and holy specced healers that only grows larger) or if you’re on a PvP server and you want nobody to fuck with you. Shadowform on a PvP server is like walking through a fightclub as a 7 foot Hulk, people will just not make eye contact.
---
Edit: correction, theres a second reason to play shadow, that is if its something you wanna do, do it. Everyone should play what makes em happy
---
Are you on Skeram? 
---
I’m a Rogue so that cool?
---
Sweeping strike zerk stance and whirlwind its not that hard
---
I ran around Stormwind for 2 hours today. And AFKed until I got d/c’d twice. I will be lucky to be level 30 at 6 days played.
---
I used to heal chain Cath runs on my shaman when I leveled it through Vanilla retail. Thats probably how I got from 36 to 40.
---
I mean that quest also gives a money reward lol, pretty sure you end up with about as much money as the 2 flights cost
---
Your UI gave me cancer.
---
Ohh for the new servers in particular! My bad wasn't sure how it'd work on the existing servers
---
People beating MC in a week should have told you that you had no hope to compete for anything in Classic.  If you're playing it to "win", you're doing it wrong.
---
Arrow keys sometimes work
---
Playing WoW on mobile is a thing.. Being 33 coming from a time when console wars was going on to this.. What a great time for technology and to be alive.
---
That's because the horse have finally finish hillsbrad and are ready for revenge!
---
Did you uploade this from your nokia?
---
You need a good strategy for interrupting their heal and dumping that instant dps goodness. It's much easier in higher levels for the mage.
---
Are you frost spec or fire?
---
Is there an add on like Atlas Classic for Dungeon maps that works?  Really kinda lost in some dungeons without it lol.
---
FTA
---
I know that feel. I level as enhance and heal dungeons. My current weapon is my healer staff, because I'm still waiting on the 2h weapon drop where everyone greeds so I can need
---
Dan taken? Try Dhan. Eron taken? Try Ehron or Erohn. Etc. Name still mostly sounds the same but is very likely going to be unique.
---
That gnome was probably corpse camped by horde earlier and is corpse camping you out of anger as payback.
---
And now you will do the same thing and the cycle continues.
---
This is why I don't roll PvP servers.
---
I play on my surface all the time.
---
This happened to me on Faerlina!
---
With my owl, PANT lmao lost it

These are bannable offenses and I hope blizzard follows through. This is clear exploiting
---
My strongest potions are too strong for you traveler. Go somewhere else.
---
Yes, but the axe has other stats too...
---
Dude weed
---
I guess it depends on the server, my old server, there were far more alliances than horde and it would be like this meme but reverse most of the time
---
Yo money gone.
---
There are many improvements that don't alter the core game by enough for it to matter, even taken together. Yes, purists will be angry, but current Classic isn't Vanilla either. 
---
The dungeon finder is too much of an alteration (even though I love Retail for having it, and I don't begrudge its existence at all), but updated graphics, QoL stuff like instant mail, barbershops, mount/companion tabs, none of those are excessive, not even when you combine them. It would be nice if models were a choice, though.
---
Of course, personally I would love some newer features too. I don't know if the dungeon finder would alter the experience too much, but I think it would. But I would love to see dual spec so we can PvP and PvE without wasting gold. Sadly, I think Classic is going to just slightly miss the mark for most people. Fun enough to keep playing, but with that constant feeling in the back of your mind that it's juuuust not what you want.
---
haven't had any issues, it's usually one person that creates a snowball effect
---
Why would I need to install 10gb of retail to play classic? 
---
Sorry I'm dumber than you, but I'm sure i'm not the only one who didn't know that. Just wanted to give a head up to other. Token where a new thing to me, I had no idea how the hell they worked, and I failed. It should at least be stated on their website that token need to be use in retail.
---
Lies no one has 20 irl friends
---
Wasnt that the beta players job aka the streamers that *know everything*  i could make a list of bugs but id rather play insted
---
Okay, so the guild master's name is Macho, right? His character, which was to be the main tank, is named Macho. This person, is the guild master. His character, is not the holder of the guild master title, but a level 1 alt on a second account. 
---
I understand people don't want to play the leveling part of the game and just want to log into a 60 to raid or whatever, and this dude is loaded IRL and can easily afford infinite accounts and power leveling. So currently the level 1 alt "Skunkape" holds the guild master title, while the "Macho" character is a guildless husk being played by a pair of Chinese men in a GameBang™ cyber cafe. The character (was) always on, 24/7, even while the actual Macho was playing other games / sleeping / etc. This person admitted in the inner circle of Discord / officer chats what he was doing.
---
Drama with my best internet friend and him happened. My friend quit, and me, by proxy, was kicked for being his friend. Now I have no ties to this "Macho" fellow so I have no reason not to report him for blatant cheating. 
---
Dude literally wasted months of my time with massive planning. I did everything for his guild, and acted 100% mature and level headed as I would at any IRL job. I was kicked unjustly so now he'll suffer the consequences and learn a life lesson from it. 
---
I told him I'd drop it if he'd just apologize for his behavior or show a token of humility but 99% of blue-pilled beta males are incapable of  "bending the knee" so to speak and are too stubborn. The man wrong'd me and this is his comeuppance.
---
I don't think you understand quite how the fight goes, between a level 30 rogue and a level 30 druid.  Let me tell you.  Rogue cheap shots you and just does PVE dps rotation.  If you get an instant root they hit sprint to break it.  From there, you can't get away, they apply crippling poison too fast for form shifting or even abolish poison to help.  You basically limp around as a bad warrior or a bad rogue and die.
---
Not sure about all bg's but I think Hunters make for good flag defenders on Warsong Gulch, so 1 or 2 are common in many team comps I think.

That's always been my go to. Unless it's a BoE rare or epic I will say I am rolling need, because even if everyone agrees on greed. One may need.

Didn't know the Vatican has a wow guild
---
Ah yes, MC is everything! How could I have been so blind! Blizz should honestly just hand everyone a free epic mount of their choosing and the riding skill to use it, then go ahead and give everyone every single tier set because who cares about playing to win or earn anything!
---
Go. Back. To. Retail.
---
Of course they will, and it still won't really change the game for me.  The people that hit 60 in the first week will always ruin the game for the casuals.  That's MMOs.  If you aren't atop the heap, you're playing catch-up.
---
Those guys with raid drops are going to wreck everyone else in PVP and it's only been a week.  I mean, how did you think you'd have a chance at anything in the game?  That's how MMOs work.

**\[Horde\]\[Herod\]\[NA\] &lt;YEETICUS MAXIMUS&gt;**
---
**About us:**
---
We at YEETICUS MAXIMUS are looking for dedicated raid team members to help us clear content in Classic WoW. We hope to progress through MC all the way to Naxx. Our aim is to create a relaxed, friendly environment full of players in order to achieve a common goal. Right now, our team size has plenty of room, but by the time we start raiding, our hope is that we have 40+ members. If you're dedicated to the guild, we have a place for you.
---
**Information:**
---
1. \- We will be raiding Tues/Thurs @ 7-10pm EST with an additional raid Monday nights @ 11pm-2am.
---
2. \- We will be playing on the East coast, PvP realm, Herod.
---
3. \- In order to determine where loot lands, we will be using a loot council system.
---
4. \- We hope to begin raiding on the 5th week after launch. This means that raiders should aim to reach cap within 3-4 weeks of launch. This is not a hard requirement; we will see how it looks when the time comes and evaluate from there.
---
**Needs:**
---
Currently, we have plenty of room for all classes and specs. Our primary focus of recruitment right now though is DPS and Healers. The need for tanks is not as strong. We also have close to enough Warlocks and Warriors, but all classes and specs are still welcome to apply.
---
**Requirements:**
---
1. \- Be over 18.
---
2. \- Be punctual and responsible; Show up on time for raids (15 minutes in advance is preferable). If for whatever reason you are unable to show up for a raid, don't worry, just let us know in advance so we can fill your spot.
---
**How to Apply:**
---
1. If you're interested in joining the guild, send me a PM on discord. We will be using discord for most of our communication. All guild announcements and updates will be posted there, as well as channels for members to mingle and talk shit.
---
2. My discord name is derwal#4650
---
3. Send me a private message with a little bit of information about yourself and what class/spec you intend to play. You don't need to write an essay, just a little bit so I can get to know you somewhat.
---
Once you get 5 point in hit it gets better. Also try completing quests where the mobs are a level or so lower. Cooking and alch never hurt either.
---
Wtf is your point then buddy? Just because she has tits that's why he's mad? Is that your frail point?
---
Games only been out for a week, and you feel left behind? Don't forget that after they raid a few times people will miss some, and some just plain out might give you their spot. Just keep playing how you like to play, and things will work out for you.
---
Youre supposed to kill boars in the forest until you are 60  or you are playing the game wrong!
---
PvE Player Vs Everyone, or is it vs Environment? that's stupid
---
Tanaris feels pretty even on my server. I mean the only thing you can really do about fixing the unbalance is pray tbh, though this should've been a predictable result.

Hello fellow frostmaner! I remember when this happened on Ally as well. Turned the entire realm from feeling small to completely different over night. D

Don't need either when you have a steep raw numbers advantage on pretty much every classic PvP server.

So I just tamed Broken Tooth. He is level 37 of course, I am level 47. I am looking for a nice spot to grind him up. Mob level 40-44 and ranged mobs so I can kill them quickly. Anybody got some ideas? Alliance btw.
---
&gt;weebshit

jk, this is impressive. A lot of "art" posted on both subs lately has just been game screenshots/assets with a few filters applied. This actually brings a little life and humanity to something that's usually left to the imagination. Good stuff.

Enjoy your mouth
---
You have to tame pets so that you (the hunter) learn their pet abilities and can then teach those abilities to other pets.
---
I just hit the random name generator.
---
What is this?

I rerolled my 24 Rogue because all of my friends couldn't be bothered to sit in a queue everyday so I swapped server and now I am a 32 Warrior

I dinged 40 today at around 98 hours of /played.

Or chew through as much hp as you can, pop your emergency fear/bandaid macro and ready the health pot.

so glad im not on this server..
---
you think people knew how to play min max bg's in vanilla?
---
Do you have links/clips showing this?
---
stop whining you'll be fine
---
There are ui improvements and specifically warlock dot trackers as well. Instead of hiding his debuffs, look for ways to make your own stand out more. You'll find more options that way
---
On whitemane even wow
---
Even if they aren't you can sell them to vendors and HYPERINFLATE the amount of gold in the game, this works with EVERYTHING, not just lotus.
---
This is going to be Venezuela 2.0
---
Yeah Horde overpopulate PvP servers because it attracts all the edgelords.
---
I did pvp heavily as a hunter, only to rank 10 but enough to reach exalted with all battlegrounds in classic. Did lots of premade pvp with high warlord groups due to my pve gear (raided up to first 3 bosses in Nax). 
---
WSG they are great for guarding flag room and defending flags in AB. In battlegrounds I never found myself avoiding any class. Duels vs mages or warlocks might be tough but in battlegrounds you can kite them pretty well since your max range is further than theirs. Your viper sting is also a pain to deal with. Frost traps in tunnels or roads is very helpful. Hunters mark and humanoid tracking help your team. 
---
I don’t think your rogue would be more sought after than a hunter.
---
No, but you can get timers for your own dots
---
Wonder what the world looks like from the point of view of a square-pupil dwarf

It's an OG vanilla meme about a forum user named Kralnor. Seen [here](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Kralnor).
---
So you report the a******. Layering has made these first couple weeks bearable.
---
It’s super annoying canceling wand auto attacks. Sometimes I’ll jump or strafe to the side to cancel. Yet it doesn’t cancel and I continue wanding. End up just spamming A and D for the 1.5 second GCD to get it to cancel correctly. 
---
I don’t remember it being this hard to stop wanding in vanilla.
---
Then share your wisdom, oh wise gold expert.  Tell us of how the market will be destroyed and we will suffer doom for years to come.
---
I am not going to stop until someone actually gives me a rational explanation of why a surplus of high end items is detrimental to a server.  Crashing prices isn't a good answer as that doesn't matter to the 99%.
---
And people say video games don't cause violence!?
---
Not my warrior. He just calmly and casually states "Need. More. Rage."
---
BAN THEM blizzard
---
Defense is useful for the rogue while levelling.
---
You reduce mobs' chance to hit and crit you, and higher level mobs from crushing you.
---
As useful as it is for a tank? No, but lets not kid ourselves that the ring is actually important for anyone at that level.  
---
If anything, the ring is detrimental to a low level tank because the main issue for tanks is losing aggro (and the DPS then taking way more damage than your shitty +4 defense will ever mitigate.)
---
Disclaimer: Am not a rogue and never will be. This is just such a retarded complaint.
---
Havent missed it in 4 years. Cant wait to see the Killers

It's going well enough for me

I only got a quick glance at him, sorry, I'm super new to WoW, I started on the 1st and never played retail before. Don't hurt me
---
Oh god, i hope people won't start doing this.  A good way to destroy vanilla
---
Where is the controller settings on iPhone
---
Is that not okay? The first part, I mean, the blue weapon and the shield. Are people only supposed to roll for a single blue?
---
I haven't ran a dungeon in Classic yet, because I probably will need to tank due to being a warrior (even though I don't want to), and the threat mechanics + loot etiquette unnerve me.
---
My new thing I swapped to in classic is always keeping my pet on passive. Was a big learning curve but only had 2 pet mismanagment issues so far due to tab targeting
---
Mage, hunter or lock.
---
Mage can self regen with conjuer bread and water.
---
Hunter and lock have pets to help tank.
---
Both would lower down time during limited play time and all are good at pvp.
---
-cheers
---
What program are you using and how do you get the joystick to show up?
---
Very sad. Thanks!
---
Yup, I actually look for it and found the same thing, didn't knew that tho.
---
you are forced to one realm if you decide to transfer, no choices..
---
This man did it. He beat the game

Spirit is great regen and agility increases wand damage.

So you want the post to mean, "Hey guys, this hat isn't ideal for my character!"

---
Lmao if it has to be explained to you then it would be pointless for me to take the time to do so. It's pretty obvious to anyone with 2 brain cells so uh guess you're sol
---
Classic is a different game. The type of players who like classic usually aren't the same kind of players who are happy with the state of retail.
---
That said, classic is fresh with a vibrant young community compared to retail which has died down a fair bit waiting for the next expansion. Pretty typical for WoW, but just based on that I'd say go for classic first :)
---
tbh i think most are not transferring, so i doubt that would be an issue
---
I honestly don’t remember the math offhand but I’m fairly certain I read somewhere it’s better with slower weapons. Something about swing timers.
---
He quite literally says the opposite. Fury/prot is still viable in dungeons/etc, but it is hindered by the lack of threat gear that is available during Phase 1. That is not to say that you can't do it, it's just that inexperienced warriors may find it a little bit more difficult than just rolling deep prot. After Phase 1, when more gear becomes available, Fury/prot becomes even stronger and allows for better threat generation, which in turn allows your raid to put out more dps without worrying about pulling threat.
---
The build I suggested works great for OP because he can solo/quest as fury (you spec 0-31-20) and still be able to effectively tank 5 mans all the way up to 60, and even during 60.
---
You don't have to be salty just because you have 0 idea how to play.
---
low level trinket that acts as a 1.5s stun.
---
Compelling question. My personal experience, I haven’t played retail in nearly 6 years after playing since shortly before BC (second expansion). 
---
I don’t think you can go wrong with either playing classic or retail. I think you’ll have a great experience either way.
---
Maybe start with classic, then once you reach max and endgame, try retail? Either way you have a grind if leveling ahead of you. 
---
Regardless, have fun.
---
Not a chance, game is definitely horde dominated now.
---
He asked if he could roll on it and I said....no as my current staff had like 5 int on it.  So it was a massive upgrade and I already had the offhand from graveyard :(
---
Yes get it right away
---
I've only had bad experiences fearing. Unless I'm about to hoof it any way. Not a chance I'm using fear.
---
This is why I refuse to fight people below level of any chance of contesting my effort. I'm all for pvp. But what's the fun killing a lvl 13 on your freshly mounted lvl 40?
---
Can you only transfer 1 character or can you do multiple?
---
Uninstalled it on the weekend, thought I might play both since I had a sub... but had zero interest.
---
Trust wand is better.
---
When ever I see a caster fighting I'm sure to throw up a drive by hunters mark
---
I tried that on launch day, reset my queue, it sucked lol
---
I can’t wait to bubble hearth away from these assholes and wave
---
40-60 really didnt get tested by the public
---
Vanish is removed but if they serpent sting you you'll just appear again anyway.
---

---
Same, I usually only attack the opposite faction in certain situations. Most of the time it's not in my favor to start a faction war because I want to focus on doing whatever I wanted to do.
---
Hard to complete quests when everyone has a vendetta against you. But if I'm waiting outside of SM for the group to arrive you're damn right I'll be attacking everyone I see.

I play ona normal server so I think that means you can have both alliance and horde characters. For the most part I’ve been playing unded priest, what’s paladin like? Fun for solo?
---
I’ve never gotten a lock to max, and I really wanna level one for Classic. The only other class I haven’t maxed is a Hunter. But I’ve disgraced myself as a hunter so I’ll never play it again.
---
Say whaaaa huuuh? I'm confused.
---
Do you still cleave when you have sweeping strikes? I'm leveling fury so I haven't used it in vanilla before.
---
Is ret viable endgame pve?
---
I believe that term involves a very specific spec of druid.
---
They're terrible for raiding but apart from that just pretty average and pretty playable.
---
I mean Ashenvale is right next to the barrens...

I play Alliance on Stalagg.
---
Happy cake day OP
---
We all did 😂
---
Isn't there a high elf at the Hunter Lodge in Loch Modan too?
---
Didn't realize gank requires more than 1 person. In my situation I was attacked by someone much higher level.
---
You're not making much money in the early levels.  Cheating out when you might get 3g over the course of am entire level doesn't make sense when you can speed yourself up several hours towards the late 30s where you're making 5-8g per *hour*.
---
Would you rather have a mount at 40 in 6 days /played or at 43 in 5 days /played?  Skipping skills you don't need is one thing, gimping yourself on weapons is another.
---
Wut? It covers a broad range of things. Ganking is basically just world pvp st the end of the day. 
---
I guess one thing it doesn’t include is big raid style pvp.
---
She has a pre-written email to the CEO of the company, a Facebook post, a Twitter rant and a text message to the local news station.
---
*Don't make me use these...*
---
Apologies, sir
---
I seem to remember lots of SM spam back in the day.
---
Are you using a swing timer addon?  Slam is best used just after an auto attack goes out.  AA&gt;Slam&gt;Instant, repeat.
---
You're assuming the default for people is to "quest optimally".
---
Before you say "look at my second sentence", the mere existence of your post means you believe that is the default, and that people who do not care about "levelling optimally" deviate from the norm.
---
That’s not true. You don’t need to be attuned to get to MC, but there is one that you will de facto need.
---
Ret is worse that most other DPS, full stop.
---
That said, it's "viable" to clear content with 39 people instead of 40.  Or 25 instead of 40.  Heck, I think Onyxia was 5-manned at 60.  So yes, Ret is viable.  Just definitely not optimal.
---
View wise, anywhere in STV, farm wise, Tanaris.
---
Holy fuck dude auto attacking to Oblivion while healing. Man great job.
---
Is he in Desolace? would actually give me a reason to go there
---
Enh shaman can use this while leveling. Staves are best DPS until the 2h talent.
---
It's okay. Don,t feel bad about it; if anything that someone worried about him is not a negative thing. As stupid as it sounds, a sense of community does create a sense of care or worry for other that we might not otherwise feel.   
---
Enjoy the game; as disturbing as it was, you worried about him. As long as he understood that (or will), there is no issue. Take it easy. :) I've went through some shit and the last thing I felt when people asked was a violation of privacy. I felt they cared; if I felt uncomfortable, I would usually simply say it and people respected it.  
---
Don't be so hard on yourself ! :)
---
I think you're reading it backwards.  Once you are hunters marked, you're fucked.  There is no Cloak of Shadows to save you in Classic.
---
I don't know if that's a good mark of success
---
I was on Skeram and I moved because I work full time and i am a full time student. I cant wait 3+ hours every night when usually, when I can play, its spur of the moment. Also, I was alliance and I guess Skeram is like 70%+ of horde.
---
Such a pity for me that they didn't add optional new NPC models for Classic, just like they did with ground clutter, water and shadows.   
---
Like having Sylvanas looks like Sylvanas won't make me feel any worse playing Classic.
---
Just to let you all know. My favorite thing is to find a solo warrior and team up. Priest/Warrior buddies!
---
&gt;what should I do?
---
ask for some?
---
Same reason why a 500 sheet stack of paper isn't worth $250,000 USD.

Dang, thought I was cool Remote Desktop fishing from uni today, well done brother.
---
When do you think blizzard will make a  app to play on mobile?

Pretty sure there's one in ratchet too.

I would hit up the shimmering flats in southern thousand needles.  You can also grab the gadgetzan flight path for when you're in your 40s.

&gt;Vanish now removes effects that allow the caster to always remain aware of their target (currently Hunter's Mark and Mind Vision). Patch 1.12
---
Vanish specifically removes hunter's mark in 1.12. It doesn't remove any dots so it won't remove serpent sting.
---
I have reinstalled the launcher but I don't see the WoW Classic option :/  [https://imgur.com/a/f7PMlwf](https://imgur.com/a/f7PMlwf)
---
That woosh is nothing to worry about, and is definitely not a starfire.
---
I’ve definitely contributed..
---
Oh don't worry brother today I a warrior of the horde shanked the shit out of gnomes in wetlands. Many homes died under my axe.
---
The racial doesn't give them immunity to stuns, it is just a chance to resist them, and if that happens you probably want to run away.
---
For The Horde!
---
Bro i also noticed! Are the instances easier or was I worse? I have way less wipes now compared to back in the day
---
General is, /say is not.
---
That's true, but they also have cast times that can be pushed back and cost Mana. Wanding is about regening your Mana so you're ready for the next pull. If you do a rotation like Smite&gt;Mind blast&gt;swp&gt;wand then the mob will die when you're at 75% or more Mana. This combined with spirit tap is what makes priests one of the most efficient chain pullers for leveling.
---
You're rolling need because U need something for disenchanting? Ooh boy can't wait to see you finding anyone to run with after a few weeks.
---
I have just over 25g at 28. I don't really sell stuff on the AH, but found a recipe where I can buy the full mats for about 6 to 7 silver off the AH, and it vendors for 12 silver, leaving me 5 - 6 silver profit per craft. Obviously, when I buy out the stock off the AH I have to just let it replenish, so it's not endless, but it does net me a few gold a day for doing nothing.
---
can you transfer more than 1 character with the current free transfer option?
---
Imagine complaining about pvp on a pvp server.
---
Yeah there is and his face looks like it's made of playdough
---
Don't be such a drama queen. It's an exploit. Yes it's a problem and yes, Blizzard should and will take action against exploiters like they always do.
---
But no, it is not ruining the game. I will be shocked if you see any long term, tangible effects from this. And layering will be going away eventually anyway, so it's a bit of a moot point.
---
Get him kicked from the guild, tell your gm, everyone in the guild can get banned for that. That’s economy manipulation/ bug exploiting and highly highly bannable .
---
Wow that looks amazing, is it some graphic enhancer?
---
Don't do it...don't do it!

...Then maybe...

Mana shield is your first mistake. I'd say you're going oom doing that
---
This guy sent those three messages before you could even reply, talk about issues.
---
Hunters are amazing in BGs. However, they are a very difficult class to play WELL. 
---
You NEED engineering, you NEED consumables.
---
Absolutely
---
Ret is hands down the worst dps in the game outside of  healing spec priests/shamans/ Druids trying to dps.
---
You have to go above and beyond just to be mediocre.

you seem mad at something

thanks so much! i will look into buying some as you say and see what happens. I've started hitting the gym so thats good news. That info is really great! I'm glad this worked out for you!

Pant the owl. Best name, what color is your buddy?

---
Has it gotten that bad? I didn't know. I wonder if the new server will be any different in the end.
---
Yeah I mean the problem is just that everyone has different things that they really want.. I think WOTLK is probably the best state that WoW was in for my personal tastes.. but everyone is different. Might eventually try a wotlk private server, but in private servers the community just isnt the same.
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
Wait, I used to have an add-on for tracking Ally's and keeping notes on why I hated them. It would pop up a raid warning or something when they were near me and I'd go find them and mess with them. Anyone remember what that addon was?
---
It does matter, lower level food gives less happiness per piece and eventually the pet outlevels it completely and just won't eat it.
---
Go to either loch Modan or Darkshore and start there, you’ll run out of quests in one place sometimes and you’ll need to just leave the zone and go elsewhere till you catch up
---
Frost is best for levelling, Fire gets better at 60, and Arcane... We don't talk about Arcane...
---
I've had most fun with hunters, mages, and druids, but that's just me.
---
Honestly, play whatever you want, that's how you'll best enjoy the game!
---
awww, what a nice Canadian person you are. mods.
---
turns out the emote solved it
---
I can't find "call to fire" for my 22 orc shaman, I just completed the water totem line, any ideas!?
---
Well that's good to know!
---
Absolutely not pointless. The game is about the journey and thankfully it's very easy to jump in and out of at your leisure. Take your time getting to 60. There's no rush whatsoever.
---
The time and effort are what makes this game great. I personally and I doubt many others are looking for ezmode gearing up or we would go play retail
---
Yes, I played retail and didn’t like , I now play classic and enjoy a lot. I bigly recommend
---
It's fixed now thanks guys, thanks!  [https://imgur.com/a/R4WIbgO](https://imgur.com/a/R4WIbgO)

Need to subscribe first to see it, well that's what fixed it for me.

Pre lvl 20 that is, oh what an ability piercing howl is, I call it the oh shit button
---
They were warned, they cared more about individual player leveling experience than long term market health.   
---
Also, no matter what he is doing, if he has 400 arcane crystals he would still have half that much on a normal server because he has litttle to zero competition at this point. 
---
If it is a game mechanic, then you are free to use it, you should mind your own business like an adult.

Run.

I'd camp STV arena until the realm got populated. ez trinket

Okay, whatever you say. Beat around the bush more, the guy above your first shitpost is right.

I meant phenomenon, as in "popular."    Her design did influence eastern animation, though.

How lit would it be if Classic got a mobile client like Runescape did
---
Who knows... I am just happy to play. :)

Absolutely bannable.  Layer was implemented to ease congestion from questing.  Unintended use is to infinitely swap layers to farm resources.

---
Being on the lower pop faction of a pvp server is truly a miserable experience. I rolled on a fresh pvp server once and the moment I hit the low 30s I just quit that character.
---
That is most impressive my man!
---
How smooth is it though? Are you experiencing any cutouts, lag or steam loosing connection?
---
I thought I was gonna do that. I rolled a priest and planned to spend all my time healing dungeons, but so far I'm having a lot of fun just questing. I'm 21 and only did RFC ones for the quests, and will probably do WC a couple times tomorrow to get all those done.
---
After I watched a hunter, MAKING HUNTARD JOKES ninja a spirit necklace from our priest who didn't even have a neck the other day I have a general rule of "No hunters that I don't know." ...the sterotypes are back in strength.
---
Lol 😂
---
i don't watch anime
---
Where'd you get it? I'd love one myself.
---
Whether you play Classic or Retail depends on what content you want to cover, and how you want to play.
---
Classic is a faithful reproduction of Vanilla WoW before any expansions were released.
---
Vanilla was significantly changed in Cataclysm, the 3rd expansion.
---
Retail is now up to BfA, the 7th expansion. While Vanilla content hasn't necessarily been further modified on a significant scale since Cataclysm, the gameplay certainly has. Both content and gameplay mechanics and play styles in Retail are a far cry from Vanilla experience.
---
In Vanilla/Classic, you need to put effort and hours into your gaming experience.
---
In Retail, gaming experience is a breeze, for the sake of getting you to endgame content quicker.
---
We have no word at all from Blizzard on how expansions will play out on Classic, if at all. Anything you hear or read will be purely speculation.
---
I personally went to Classic because Retail is boring. The story telling in Retail is top notch, but gameplay/play style mechanics are boring and linear.
---
Maul maul swipe heal yourself go to cat form rake rake, back to bear, charge, maul, heal yourself
---
Cmon yall ez pz
---
How much gold have you gpt because if you aren't close to 90 then questing while grinding mobs when running will be best to get your mount at 40. SM is a bit faster but you lose out on a lot of gold.
---
Okay thanks I’ll try loch Modan and see if I can start there thanks I’m new to WoW
---
No changes. This is classic.
---
This guy probably grew up in a toxic environment and knows no better. Not justified but feeding the fire probably not helpful.
---
Never admit your "mistake!"  Own it, and RP a chicken hating rager who goes out of his way to kill every chicken he sees.
---
Well you get both versions of the game under the same subscription umbrella. So if you don’t like classic you can switch to retail seamlessly
---
&gt; 30min+ cooldowns
---
Most of them are WAY too strong to not have a 30 min CD. Retaliation lets a good warrior with a healer absolutely smash anything in their way. 
---
&gt;Druid not having a res skill
---
It's a trade-off. Druids bring lots of great utility to the group outside of their battle rez. If you want a normal rez too then bring a paladin or priest.
---
&gt;Pally lacking basic tank tools, ret being a joke
---
This I mostly agree is bad but they do make up for it with their great single-target healing and buffs. 
---
&gt;Warr charge not being usable in combat, but the bear form charge is..
---
Warriors have intercept as well. Charge can't be used in combat because it gives you rage, it would be way overpowered if you could use it whenever it's off cd.
---
Yeah and tell his mom also.
---
You could probably google a list which will give you ping to different regions; resources like that are around. 
---
Or just create a toon on an EU server and check the ping in game (on your menu bar next to the main action bar).
---
Look at this guy who didn’t disable call waiting before loggin’ in. 
---
I mudded and played EQ on dial up. It was necessary.
---
Since Holy Paladins.
---
When is Arcanite Reaper coming online??
---
but you still need to turn on your pc ? or not
---
Line was also moving faster. 6K queue only took 2 hours where it use to take 3-4.
---
Nice
---
You could set up a weak aura for it.
---
So is stalagg...queues are dropping off as if the horde are camping all the alli away. Literally cant quest anywhere.
---
Quinn gave up the weapon because he's going to be dropping Classic to play the new Path of Exile league. So selfless.
---
Gonna go with: we were all awful. I know I was.
---
Its feeling pretty fuckin bad so far. A useless interupt you cant use in melee range. A stun that requires you to go into bear. A heal that has too long of a cast time to be used in pvp. Shifting costs a ton of mana. Your feral CD is so bad its a dps loss. You bear cooldown gives 20 rage, enough for 2 fucking mauls, and makes you take more damage. Dash seems to not work properly and still lets you get kited. The bear heal is completely useless. You move so fuckin slow in stealth that you cant actually use your opener on someone thats moving. You dps is also lame and cant at all compete with any other melee.
---
Pretty sure World Bosses aren't in the game yet. Supposed to be release in Phase 2.
---
you essentially abandoned nothing my guy, lvl 8 is real quick
---
Peacebloom is only worth it until they are grey. Peacebloom and Silverleaf are worth about 15-20 copper a piece on my server. Swifthistle and that thorn thing is where it is at.
---
Other than freaking out arachnophobes, spiders aren't great. They didn't get their web ability until post-Vanilla.
---
you could choose not to play with morons instead of avoiding women but I guess that's less convenient for you.
---
You fool.  Crack would have been less addicting
---
He's asking about leveling, you moron. No level 44 shaman is running around with unstoppable force. Regardless, you are wrong either way. Better weapon is all you want. Big 2h big numbers but it's the same % chance to proc. Big 2h is good in pvp cause of burst. I'm sure this is hard for you to understand, but it's correct. Stop spouting nonsense. Must be alliance.
---
Read mine again
---
Dunno.  My guess is probably about 6:4 Horde:Alliance.  Enough to notice a difference.
---
You're not going to get the validation you're looking for here
---
Classes are need, Professions are greed
---
A very firm YTA in this situation
---
How?!?
---
It is the next best thing from what I've tried. The shadow spells are fun, but I still miss my blessings.
---
I liked trolling more when it was parking someone in the middle of the deeprun tram with no hs instead of shit excuse to act like a dick..
---
Is there any way to tell what the ratios are?
---
lol already starting with the level 60 memes? Suuuuuuuure bud
---
and itll only get "worse" as classic ages. i enjoy pvp servers and the fact that at any moment i could get attacked OR attack someone. but those who get annoyed by it will be very unhappy a few months down the road when there are people who spend all of their time ingame camping lowbies because its "fun" to them.
---
That was a very long story.
---
Make sure you don't have any uppercases like Main.lua instead of main.lua
---
other than that I can't really think of anything that could cause problems
---
Went from lvl 31 mage to now lvl 20 hunter, sick of drinking endlessly
---
Where can I watch this get streamed?
---
What’s the current ratio look like?
---
Ony 5-man was easy peasy in AQ gear iirc
---
not looking for validation, just telling people to roll need is all
---
The upper echelon of power gamers have long hit 60 and are using layering to bulk farm rare materials and gold that will easily carry them for the entire life of the game. 
---
There are many pictures of individuals with 1000’s of black lotus, arcane crystals, gold capped, inventories full of high end world boe epics, etc. 
---
So worrying only about yourself and playing normally you might never notice this, but many people care about the health of the game economy and it is being very negatively impacted by layering at the moment.
---
Yeah I figure the same
---
Whoa there, relax, it's not a big deal, it's a meme at this point, shouldn't let it bother you THAT much.
---
Clique
---
Definitely worth respeccing imo. Those two talents make it so you have no downtime between mobs when you are questing. Wouldn't worry about deep holy build until at least level 50, you can heal earlier dungeons with any talent build.
---
Not funny.  Very very sad.
---
There’s a difference between pvp combat with mature players and then there’s corpse camping and griefing other players. Builds a toxic community on a server.
---
Well, if you knew nothing about how to play the gam, were playing on dialup with 2 sec delay, and 30 fps at 480p resolution, then the game would still be hard today I think. I've played with 1-2 secs of delay, it's like an extra difficulty level
---
Enjoy your ban.
---
This so much
---
And needing for disenchanting is not a thing, MR NINJAS OUT THERE.
---
10k damage means absolutely nothing if we have no idea how big or long pulls are.
---
Mik's battle text event trigger?
---
How do you do this? I work 1 mile away from home. Would love to do this
---
That’s a good one! Lol
---
Warlock. Have pets, utility, fast leveling, total badass of demonic energy, and have a sweet class mount. 
---
Also, your dps will be rough prior to +hit gear but by Naxx you will be a dps monster with how great warlocks scale. Similar to warriors, very gear dependent but bring a ton of utility to the raid other than being a glass cannon.
---
He’s done, gone.
---
yeah. i've been stuck at 38 for a couple of days because it doesn't matter where i quest, i will have a rez timer within 10 minutes of playing.
---
Midlife Vices out for blood!!! Death to Alliance!!!

I didn’t join a pvp server so I could wave at horde. You should be killing everyone you see

---
Hard disagree. We need to know who he is and tell him that Lemon told him to fuck off. Just once a day, nothing else. Just tell him "Lemon said to fuck off" and then put him on ignore

Where are the nameplate options in weakauras? I can’t find them anywhere.
---
Depends on the person and their personal goals for the game. I, personally, will be stoked when i finally ding 60 😊

boomer game idk

So did I. Then I had 15g at 32. Now I have 35g at 36 :) it climbs up fast dont worry :)

Cool guy zone only
---
&gt;a list which will give you ping to different regions
---
Thanks, just tried a few different sources and I'm getting an ping of 150-200 to European servers
---
That doesn't get bans lmao
---
I'm so mad I'm not max level right now. I would be totally abusing this.
---
I read Qualityfuckz instead of qualitybudz
---
Damn what server you on? My server is literally like 50/50.
---
Priest were easily the least popular class in vanilla - at least on my server. Druids could at least level quickly.
---
“Beware of an old man in a profession where men usually die young”
---
If it's common, sure. I think all of that is implicit when you group. But if you are joining with the intention of rolling on something not for your spec or if you are reserving something you say so up front. Like I might tank a (non-quest run) Gnomergan even though I've outlevelled the instance on the condition they reserve the Electromagnetic Gigaflux Reactivator. 
---
People who jack up instances are supposed to get a bad rep and find it hard to group. Removing that was the biggest mistake Blizz ever made IMO. 
---
I'm talking about out in the open world with some random player fighting next to a chest. Looting it obviously isn't the nicest thing to do in that situation but I don't think it's a big deal. And the better the item/spawn the more you should expect competition instead of cooperation. I would have no issues with a person who grinds like that in the guild assuming they can pull their weight. Now linking a good item after looting, that's dickish.
---
How is that a bowl cut?
---
did it work
---
whenever i ran from ratchet to shimmering flats, i had a rez timer by the time i made it half way due to being ganked. :\
---
They've banned people for less they are abusing a server side mechanic not a gameplay mechanic
---
Right.  Blizzard never bans people for exploiting.
---
This isn't my screenshot, just sharing it. But how would they be banned? Layering is what Blizzard and the fanboys wanted lol.
---
Good plan, I definitely think Priest should be your first alt. The great thing with Hunter too is that it's a pretty good farming class, so you could farm some gold and set up your Priest really nicely when you're ready to make one with bags and wants and gear etc.
---
Barak kodobama
---
wow nicely done lol
---
how did it go
---
When you get Sweeping strikes you almost always wanna be fighting 2 mobs though.
---
Yea I couldn't remember if spell reflect was in vanilla or not so I just went with it.
---
Serpent, auto attack, afk?
---
It’s a combination of everyone being bad back in the day and we’ve added nearly 15 years of experience in the game under our belt where even crazier mechanics exist. 
---
I remember using my warlocks dagger in Vanilla as main DPS until someone told me in Gnomer at level 31 I was an idiot.  I might still be an idiot but I don’t do that anymore.
---
He wont have much of a use for those crystals. Will take a long time for the cost to go up. Not many alchs will make arcanite bars this early. Hes just getting in early and while its convinient
---
You don't need to spec healer until 60 really. None of the dungeons are that hard to heal at all. It's best to just spec dps so you can level faster. 5 points in wand spec and everything else into shadow, respec at 40 to point all points into shadow.
---
These are the days of giants.  We are jolly green Hunters, walking Azeroth, with guns.
---
I think a mix of all 3 is good for leveling.  I'm going for something like this
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVRhsV0oZfotccbcZxM
---
Pick up Wand, then put the 7 in shadow, then back to disc to get divine spirit, then all holy from then on out to boost dungeon healing power
---
It's not great at anything, but you end up getting all of the stuff you need right around the levels you need it without having to waste gold on respecs.  As long as you keep a good wand you can kill stuff solo no prob and you'll blow away pure shadowpriests in dungeon healing and utility
---
Good thing they've made a statement on the side effects of layering such as this.
---
This is why you should kill rogues without mercy. 
---
As a rogue they deserve it for being unstealthed. The little shits.

You're so innocent bro I love it.

It's definitely 'best in slot'.
---
Gonna disagree with you there. The ONLY limiting factor in classic is time. In retail if you have a lot of time but no skill you will never complete mythic content. In classic (especially) and to a lesser extent tbc, time is the dominant factor my an extensive margin. So you get people who are just absolutely fucking terrible who are able to clear the hardest content simply because they play a lot. I would consider that much more casual because the vast majority of the game is based primarily on time to participate rather than skill, which is what is the defining limit in the casualisation of other activities and games--ie casual sports player, casual poker enthusiast, casual overwatch player, etc. They all might put extensive time into but still be 'casual' because it's a reflection of effort put in during participatory time, not just a measurement of the time itself.

Strongly disagree. All of these things were part of it, and it may not be perfectly balanced. It is balanced enough that all classes are represented in raids, though. Tweaking this game away from its original quirks just gets us closer to modern WoW, which I honestly do not enjoy at all.
---
I’m playing on Thunderfury and it’s fun
---
Plus a whole bunch you can kill in Azshara and other zones.
---
Same guys are you using iphones?
---
Depression, more than likely
---
Every time I see one of those scumbags I just vanish and let the mob hit them instead. Works every time.
---
I teared up when I saw Sara Baloo in Ironforge.
---
Oh, that diet's going to change, after the high frequency auction house traders crash the market and you're broke.
---
Should have been more vocal about layering , what did you expect? I tamed a fucking Broken tooth thanks to layering.
---
Please tell me where you're questing, getting 25/35k xp/h while questing would be sick
---
Is the Warcraft movie a good intro to wow lore? 
---
My partner loves the lord of things but it’s hard picking it up through the game and she never played any Warcraft games. 
---
I’m not a big movie guy so I never went to see it, could watch it with her if it’d help her understand what’s going on though.
---
Heh little do you know, the hunters already rollee need. X.x

I leveled aff during vanilla, can confirm. DoT + Fear + Death Coil = dead priest.

holy shit why do people let their cats do this to their monitors
---
Killing them softly his song....
---
Rogues are in a class by themselves.
---
Set graphics to max.
---
Probably private server.  
---
There's not enough gold in the market to play the AH atm. It's the same reason why few people are auctioning rares and epics because they'll wait when it's worth more.
---
Frostbite is far stronger. 15% everytime any melee attacks you, or you cast frostbolt or CoC or blizzard to root for 5 seconds.  
---
  
---
You should only ever skip frostbite if you're doing a dedicated AoE grind or raiding build.
---
Awesome! Thanks and definitely will. It's been a blast so far. Miss a few things here and there from new WoW lol
---
I thought mount neverest was? Or hyjal summit even. I’ll have to make this journey, though. I didn’t even know you could get up there.
---
I'm gonna be okay with that thanks.
---
LUL! i actually laughed out loud. this has been me too
---
Is improved Drain Life not worth getting? Instead of say, Nightfall?
---
Finally something productive to do in meetings or on the toilet
---
Classic threat meter will show threat for you and other players in ur party that have the mod.
---
Cool man, I hope you're toxicity takes you far.
---
&gt; As I said my only point of reference for mmorpg's is runescape 2007, so I'm not sure what reputation is really even for yet. 
---
Reputation allows you to buy items from factions for cheaper, and later on you can buy exclusive items if you have high enough reputation. For example, as a gnome you cannot normally ride a human horse, but if you are exalted with Stormwind you can ride them.
---
In Battleground factions, getting to the exalted status lets you buy really good PvP weapons and eqipment. 
---
There's stuff like that, but if you never grind rep then you can still have fun playing the game and still acquire some of the best equipment. Stuff like having a different mount is purely cosmetic, but people will still spend dozens/hundreds of hours grinding so their gnome doesn't ride a mechanical ostrich.
---
Huh. I'm on Skeram and I swear I'm constantly getting swarmed by Alliance.
---
I got this working. A god send for when the wife wants to lay in bed together

I'm trying to level my paladin but I'm not sure where to go. 28, and I've finished Duskwood and Wetlands. Time to go over to Kalimdor?
---
Idgi
---
Well some people apparently like to tear the wings and legs off of insects. I'm of similar mind as you in that there's no fun to be had for me with facerolling. It's why I moved to PvE all those years ago and then full-timed PvP battlegrounds. Even there, back when locks were ridiculously OP with Felguard pre-TBC release patch, I'd pick fights with multiple people rather than just 1v1... unless they outgeared me lol. The thrill of defeat was just as fun as victory when it's on your terms.
---
Nobody is saying it doesn't matter. You're arguing with an invisible opponent because you're upset. Report them and move on, can't do anything else.
---
There is one in Sunrock Reteat as well
---
Paladins have a ton of utility and cc.
---
Different auras which give different buffs, different blessings which give different buffs, healing, cleanse de-buffs, make allies immune to damage, free allies from immobilizing effects, stuns, casting seals which can do different things like generate heals or mana on hit, stop an enemy from fleeing, etc. They can off tank if they have to as well.
---
Paladins are the best support class in the game. Especially outside of raiding. If a 5 man dungeon is about to wipe Paladins usually are the ones who actually save the group. A clutch lay on hands or blessing of protection, or tanking once the tank and half the group died while doing a decent amount of damage, or healing because the healer died/is out of mana.
---
I’ve had more awesome moments playing a paladin than any other class I played from vanilla through WotLK. When you save your group or other players from dying/wiping with some clutch play and get acknowledged it’s awesome. You can mindlessly get through a dungeon/raid/pvp just healing everyone well with your rotation and do good - or you can use your full kit at opportune moments to make everyone around you better and rock. And pre-raiding you can fill any role in a 5 man.
---
Eventually you will get a goofy looking hat to cover it up though!

This is what I use. I love it.

Stupid cool, I wish I was on when this was going on!

Damn, you got me

You got a silver? Lucky so n so.

It isn’t, if you notice the 8 bags. Probably not from classic, if the image isn’t doctored.
---
That's when you say "inv for layer plz" in guild chat and just switch layer. I've never needed to but I'm sick of the constant layer invite begging in chat
---
This is such a good video. The hair, the delivery, the music. Everything about this is so perfect.
---
I like how people are realizing 6 months too late how bad layering is.
---
When the weekend is around the corner and you're a chef
---
This sounds cool! Do you have a link to a calculator for what talents you are using? I am probably going to be making another priest later on and would like to try this.
---
Be warned, it all goes to your main backpack so make sure its free
---
What guild? I’m looking for something like this.
---
The bread is named after the wand, not vice versa.
---
&gt; Although the word "baguette" was not used to refer to a type of bread until 1920,[10] the word itself simply means "wand", "baton" or "stick", as in baguette magique (magic wand), baguettes chinoises (chopsticks), or baguette de direction (conductor's baton).
---
Are you using ReShade? If so, could you link which preset you’re using?
---
is there any way i can get around the port zero block?
---
For your consideration: failing to receive any negative consequences for bad actions incentives bad actions.  Someone with a predilection for douchebaggery is going to continue their douchebaggery until it actually affects them in a way they care about.  So I would say that actually, you're encouraging their bad behavior and causing more suffering for other players on down the line.  Therefore, you just might be an asshole like that.
---
I joined a guild called &lt;The Cereal Killers&gt; who's officers were Oats, Cocoapuffs, and another cereal name I can't remember. 
---
It's funny because when they asked me to sign the charter, they spelled it &lt;The Ceral Killers&gt; and they were very happy I pointed it out haha.
---
Filthy orcs think they can come to our lands and enslave our beloved owls. You will pay this, Horde scum.
---
It’s insane. I don’t want to level by spamming SM but I am getting camped so hard in each zone that it takes me 5-6 hours to get a level in my low 30s.
---
forreal. nothing wrong with dying in wow.
---
RemindMe! 6 hours
---
layering is a mechanic of the game
---
I feigned death on my hunter so long i actually died. Had no idea that was possible
---
To actually train your pet there's a spell on your book called beast training.
---
To get pet spells by going to pet trainers for some and then taming wild beasts. Use petopia or cast beast lore on beasts to know what skills they have.
---
Imagine quite possibly being the weakest troll in the entire world.
---
Fortunately I was taking oral meds and not insulin so it's not so bad. Thanks for the tip however, I'll look into it.
---
As a warrior, I vote for Warrior/Mage so I don't have to do shit.
---
Finish finished? Or left some higher level quests?
---
Go to Ashenvale. I didn't finish Ashenvale, Duskwood and Wetlands until \~33 though.
---
Azeroth auto pilot. I’ve got several (human) toons to 16 in one sitting.
---
I got camped as well by a warlock yesterday. It sucks that I don't have the habit of checking/remembering names. 
---
Guess I'll have to kill every undead warlock.
---
This made my head hurt. Holy shit.
---
That yeti cave was the closest I got to ragequit. Being alliance on Fairbanks is no joke.
---
Adorable
---
Hillsbrad bro. You will outleevel the starting area which will allow you to blow through it and get your lvls to handle alteric.
---
You lost me on the first sentence. Why would I do that?
---
For sure, if the hunter is even near my level, the only way to run is towards them.  Sometimes you’re gunna die, might as well be facing the enemy.
---
Hunter. Not rogue.
---
I want to segment each vote based on whether or not they can actually give an opinion based on experience and information. It isn't that hard. If you're level 30 you probably don't care much yet about what happens at 60 since you probably don't even barely know what happens at 60 yet anyway.
---
Seems like Crysis accomplished his goal.
---
Ahhhh ok. So you went for it eh? I'm worried the new realm will be dead because not a lot of people will want to transfer. How's it looking? Lively?
---
Man what I would give to have WoW remade to look like this. 😍

Blammo was 50/50 according to the survey

Bullshit. Ganking was always a solo sport for rogues
---
Hi my name is phoneletics and welcome to my mobile phone locked ultimate iron man.
---
which 8 bags
---
Completely finished duskwood but I have the dark iron stuff for wetlands. I did some ashenvale as well, so I'd have to catch it up to my level a bit from where I left off, but that might be a good place to spend a lot of time.

Stash it in your bank forget about it for a month,  revisit selling it in a month

“World of Warcraft Classic is the original version of the game, but they should add everything else to it too”
---
-Basically that article
---
 
---
Saying it was written by a bot is an insult to bots. Oh and they think the level cap in vanilla was 40, so that’s awesome.
---
Everyone values free time differently. For me it is the most important thing in the world. I'd rather be idly pacing around my kitchen than be tending to some responsibility. 
---
So I set up my life in such a way to minimize my cost of living so I can get by working 25 hours a week at 26 years old. No car, walk to work and walmart. Don't eat out and target 300 calories/dollar at grocery store. Live in low income housing. Don't spend money on anything but computer upgrades and occasionally headphones and keyboards. It's pretty great, I'm happier than my friend who is a successful programmer making literally 11 times more money than I am.
---
As someone who just rerolled to Benediction Alliance a couple nights ago... shit. Maybe I should keep looking.
---
Damn nice
---
We all feel this way, but we’ve also seen what Blizzard caving to our demands has done to the game.
---
Do we need a realm first post for ever kill? It was mildly exciting at best when it was a world first last week. At this point, it’s a complete who cares.
---
I called him a nerd for evoking a troll list, not for playing wow.
---
Wut?
---
The...the ones in the picture?
---
Until you MC yourself for them and pop your long CDs for no reason.
---
That's so sad :(
---
Jesus I get its cool rn to hate retail but some of you needs are fucking UPSET at this post.
---
Hillsbrad was incredibly horde heavy on Fairbanks. I'm alliance and I wanted to rage at the yeti cave. The only retalliation I could think of was to just slaughter all the lowbies. But I am a ret, what can I do.
---
They're wrong ganking is murdering with a bit of stalking or other devious, spiteful, hateful, or other malicious behaviour thrown in.
---
You can’t kill most  people either if they don’t want to be killed though.
---
Cc and run is no problem.
---
It’s starting to fill up a little bit but a lot of places it’s late too so people probably started the transfer and just are waiting till they wake up. But yes in SW there is a good amount of people.
---
Tailoring/enchanting.
---
Unfortunately there wasnt money to be made on bags (i swear everyones a tailor on my realm) and DEing stuff instead of vendoring really killed the gold supply.
---
Ive been vendoring since 35ish, but still came up 30g short or so when i hit 40.
---
Im at about 41.75 right now and a bit shy of 15g short.  Would have been closer but i did the cooking quest which took a bit of gold (stupid alterac swiss).
---
edit: and fish dont sell for shit on my server, either &gt;.&lt;
---
That read was confusing as hell.
---
I recently hit 30 and drain life now does more DPS than my wand, not to mention it heals while doing it. With that, siphon life and life tap I'm pretty much never going to die!
---
"Developers such as EA have shown how beneficial it can be to just listen to players and add what they want in the game."
---
I stopped at this.
---
there are 6 bank bags and 5 character bags, which 8 are you referring to?
---
I mean, if he was he obviously wasn't doing a good job of it.
---
Back at the original launch I thought I was going to be so fucking rich once I skilled enough to mine gold.
---
This thread is kind of a shitshow but now I know there are more layers than I knew. I thought there were like 3-5 layers going on.
---
&gt; I will say one thing that has helped me as a bear tanking so far (level 30 now, doing SM runs) is pre-hotting myself before big pulls.
---
I've never really found a window in my tanking to do this. I've found it much, much, MUCH more reliable to simply build up a big pool of rage at the end of one pack via white attacks and then carry it into the next pack, allowing me to spam abilities in the opening seconds. If I popped out to HoT myself, I'd lose all that precious rage.
---
Sounds like you’re playing for fun and not just grinding?
---
Dont know why you're being downvoted, you're right lmao
---
As someone who learns from reading textbooks and has basically never been able to learn from being lectured at or talked at, and as someone who had a full ride through college and WISHED I had a laptop good enough to play WoW back in 2006 when I was in college, I vehemently disagree. This is not stupid. Mandatory attendance is stupid. Especially when not everyone learns the same way. it was a huge waste of time for me to sit through mandatory lecture. That was time I couldn't spend back at my dorm, studying or unwinding on WoW. 
---
For what it's worth, after college, my med school lectures were not mandatory. Less than 10% of my class attended lecture regularly. Everyone else used their time more efficiently by reviewing the material at home (or listening to the previous day's lecture recordings at 2x speed while looking at the slides, effectively halving the amount of time they would have spent at lecture...OR, waiting a week for transcripts to be out, then just reading the transcript while reviewing the slides. Even fucking faster.)  For the vast majority of med students, this was a much more effective and smarter use of their time. 
---
It's not stupid.
---
That's not true! Sometimes I roleplay that I'm a silent assassin whose mission is to stay undercover in Hillsbrad and wait for a Prot Paladin to wander in. 
---
I'll gladly let the gnomes gonfree if it means I get a bigger prize. The rare and elusive Human Paladin has such delicious meat.
---
Have you looked at hunters? Whether you're playing solo PvE or any PvP they have a ton of mobility themselves and also a lot of ways to control other players' movement as well. Their spells are generally instant or short cast time, and they live and die by positioning by either keeping out of melee range of melee chars or out of range entirely of casters.
---
It's a pure dps class, so you're not going to be doing a ton of healing and debuffing but they're probably the most active movement class.
---
When I said pretty much all cartoons have big eyes it means all, like Looney Tunes, Disney characters, simpsons, like, everything lol.
---
You run as an actual healer (ie disc up to regen talent and rest holy) and do what a healer does.
---
Holy honestly quests better than shadow too.  The only real standout in shadow until shadowform is spirit tap and you could even be a slightly less effective healer and grab tap as well as disc talents (though if you have dungeon gear you can smite level fine without tap).
---
where the fun and memes is at
---
Press wand hotkey, animation starts but sound effect stops abruptly, causing you to think the cast stopped so you hit the hotkey again. Now you're just standing there doing nothing while the enemy beats on you. You press it again but no wait, it actually *was* casting and you just cancelled it. *Again*.

Story of my life
---
Threatplates
---
cool guild name
---
That’s not what happened either. He and his wife were killing the Bristlebacks together and they both were overwhelmed. He was recovered by a Tauren, she didn’t make it. So they left her there. He fell in battle.
---
The Bristlebacks are also located just a little bit down past the camp you find his wife at. They’re close. It makes sense.
---
Exactly
---
Negative on the wand damage. First thing I did because I loved beefy pserver wands was check. Unless +4 agi at 13 wasn’t enough but it was on recent pservers so I chalk it up to not coding wands separate from physical ranged weapons
---
Dude just enjoy it. Grinding isn’t for me at all. Have fun with the game and dick around. Getting to max level already is meaningless if you didn’t have fun during the journey!
---
Nice try, but there's no way this image is from classic. You're worse than the person who posted the 6 month old videos trying to prove that blizzard was removing features.
---
well thats your problem, wrong time. every 3 hours, so it wouldvbe been 6PST next time
---
My life is 5 hours all day everyday. Sleep is da poop. Waste of precious time!
---
auctionator
---
In Classic WoW, every roll is a hunter roll.
---
Lol.  The article says the level cap is 40 in classic.  Nonsense.
---
How yall getting mounts at 40?? I have been basically grinding beasts 30-37 and I have like 40g.
---
And if we miss one auto-attack our chance to kill goes down to 1%.
---
It is clearly an exploit to infinitely farm the same node. That isnt something you can try to defend
---
Yojamba on OCE feels like it’s 2:1 horde to alliance. I haven’t been to a single zone over level 30 where you see even 1/5 the amount of alliance as horde, it’s fucked. 
---
Should be able to afford my mount tonight and then I might go have some fun purging the unclean :)
---
Agreed here.  Party member earlier was saying some poll from the server discord puts it at 3 to 1 in horde favor.
---
I wonder why Whitemane isn't up yet. Must be doing it a few at a time or something
---
Random as hell but If you think about it this is insane. If it was 2004 and you told someone they will be able to play WoW on a mobile phone in 15 years they would have thought about their 2x2 inch-screen Nokia for a split second, laughed in your face, and went back to grinding  on their dial up internet.
---
Imagine some all powerful mage coming by and changing you into a different random human being but only for a few seconds and you change back.
---
That sheep is super confused.
---
What’s the command to stop wand so I can put it in front of spells
---
Legacy-wow .com has a great leveling guide.
---
Depends what you want. Hunter if you want pure DPS, druid it if you want to be a Swiss army knife that fields every role in a "good enough" capacity at all times
---
Holy shit.
---
That lack of wanting to deal with it is exactly what got me to PvP better, as you needed it to survive. Played on a PvP server first, my first MMO PvP experience, hit a decent level range and practiced better ways to spot/trap Rogues and any other hostilities as I leveled. It exposed me to how people look for vantage points to exploit their surroundings and how effective (or ineffective) some things can be. That sort of thing even transitioned well into PvE.
---
Cool
---
Isn’t the succubus a demon and can’t be sheeped?
---
Congrats on your epic mount!
---
Thanks my dude! Right back at ya!
---
I mean, it wasn't 200 hours, it was like, what, under 100 hrs for world first?
---
You could easily get 20g for it now, in phase 3 it’s worth about 200g
---
Orcs are green which = evil, which means:
---
Tauren are the only valid race. They just wanna be peaceful hippies on their big flat mountains.
---
That sounds about right. Very far from ideal to play with, but not impossible. For the record, I'm playing OCE and getting single digit ping because the servers are located in my city. However, back in Actual classic, I had to play with 100-200 because OCE servers weren't a thing.
---
Always open your clams! I got two golden pearls in a row netting me 30 gold.
---
What you expect?  If I see my faction in a fight, I'll help out.  Regardless of the aggressor.
---
I was being sarcastic. I hope all gold buyers get banned.
---
Lol nice meme
---
Right...what the hell kind of name is "Soap", eh?
---
In 2D or I think even 2.5D, but 3D would have the x and y being the ground, with z rising vertically from that. See this, it might help clear up your confusion. https://images.app.goo.gl/UdNb32f4N7rVeT8Q7
---
Mobs that heal
---
When you demand classic servers of WoW to be brought back but still want to use memes from retail;
---
see image above.
---
I deleted my level 10 dwarf hunter just because I didn't like his black and wanted brown. I wish you could dye hair haha
---
Damn, bro. Just flex on everyone, whydontcha.
---
I've mostly done it with a hunter friend of mine and have only gotten to level 24 so far. Note that that is still well under the level where it supposedly becomes a fun class.
---
I genuinely think I would have had more fun with any other class. In fact, I doubt if I've had fun, so far. The class is absolutely barebones, even at level 24, because your main ability at that point is an empowered auto attack. And since you're supposed to be going for the biggest and slowest weapons, you don't auto often.
---
And all your abilities cost rage, which you only get through hitting and being hit. And since you don't hit often, and you don't really get hit that often either, you won't be generating much of your main resource. Having little of your resource means using few of your abilities, obviously. This is also why it's difficult to handle more than one mob. There is no useful CC, at least at this level. No mitigation except Defender Stance, no healing except potions, and no useful AoE except Cleave, which costs 20 Rage, and which can only hit one extra target. Talents are also very lackluster early on in both Arms and Fury.
---
To give you a TL;DR, it's hard. Or rather, tedious and slow.
---
Is there any way to see the alliance:horde ratio for specific servers? Seems like horde way outnumber alliance on pvp servers. I don’t remember it being this bad in vanilla, and I had a 60 on both factions (different servers though).
---
Back in the day we wanded in MC because it was actually good dps AND we regenerated mana with our uber spirit
---
Yeah Tauren are basically only in the horde because the alliance is full of racist and the dwarves keep trying to blow up their homelands.
---
I don’t know where these new criteria are coming from. They were in the list 😆
---
Ironically going to the Flats at level 33 after doing RFK was one of the better decisions I made. Only got killed like twice, super chill zone to quest in. Only downside is the xp felt bad, took probably just over 90 minutes to and from 6 turn-ins and all the kills I gained maybe 60% of a level
---
I think STV is the only zone I ever dread entering now, that place is gank city where every other zone the Horde largely leaves me alone
---
I heard a story of one once... but it was just too unbelievable to be true.
---
This is against the rules in the TOS
---
IDK if it would be comfortable to sleep against something with that many jagged edges
---
79 hours
---
Im doing a dedicated aoe build and the horde fucking knows it rofl
---
Don't mix trees until you get the key talents you are shooting for in the first tree. Before 40 it is more efficient in my opinion to go Fury, after which arms and fury are both good levelling specs. If you are determined you can also level arms from the beginning, it won't hamper you much. Go with the one that thematically appeals to you more, just don't level protection lol
---
Oh no!  That guys gunna have gold!
---
I'm pretty sure there were only a handful of Alliance dominated servers, at least in NA.
---
Most chest stealers seem to be Retail players that don't know better.
---
I've had to explain the etiquette with chests in classic in dungeons almost every run so far.
---
They can also attack you while moving and move faster than you using Aspect of the Chetah.
---
I didn't play a whole lot of modern but I've been playing this new classic since launch day and it just kinda hit me. What should I be focusing on when I wear things? As a gnome mage: Intellect, spirit, agility, ect. I tried looking this up but didn't really get a forward response.
---
As a rogue, we can stun your mobs but it's super hard to pull aggro off you. But nothing says "I'm trying to keep you alive like" stunning a mob and trying to first aid the person (if same faction). Or one time a TON of mobs got pulled, and I was able to just sprint and get aggro on them all by 1 tapping them. I sprinted as far away as i could and vanished.....they all ran straight back for my teammate that made a quick get away except for a particularly slow gnome
---
But detect invisibility doesn't work on stealthy bois, only mages/whoever uses magical invisibility.
---
Was that the warrior crying about the sword?
---
This is incorrect
---
Must suck seeing all these Rag kills while you’re level 25 and stuck in a queue.
---
I think my favorite part was the argument that Blizzard should remove subs and let people do a one-time buy, because “some people even have to pay for World of Warcraft gold” and can’t afford both.
---
What time?
---
Slam is for dps
---
What...what?
---
Ashenvale has a 20 chunk, that leads into 26, that leads into 29. Stonetalon also has two quests in Charred Vale that are a bit grindy too. Then the dark iron quests in northern Wetlands. If you didn't do gnomer or stockades yet, those quests too (stocks has 5, gnomer has 7+) but maybe hold gnomer till \~32
---
If you can get to \~33 via those zones you're smoooooth sailing because thousand needles, desolace, stv, and hillsbrad will take you to 40 without issue.
---
fake and gay
---
This is my worst fear,if the servers are not atleastttt 60/40,server is garbage,its a lottery for now,who knows.....
---
If you have full Shadow Mastery, that means you should be at least lvl 39, which means you should already have rank 5 Shadow Bolt, try that ;)
---
Although I agree, wands are broken.
---
What’s the best way to find a group for Deadmines? Is there a specific Discord for it or something? I’m struggling to put one together in-game.

I mean this game is created to be a grind, I’m trying to provide advice. I’m sorry I came across as elitist telling him how to play. I meant it more so as friendly advice if he was looking to check out some of the better quality of life addons people have created.
---
He seemed to take it how I meant it but a few of you are getting very defensive over it for no apparent reason.

---
Time spent to reach the "Goal" does not equate to if it is "Casual" or not.
---
Cookie Clicker is casual as fuck and it has the greatest grind of any game, theoretically infinite grind even.
---
Wow is grindy as fuck but it is also EXTREMELY easy compared to shit like retails mythic dungeons. How many mechanics to raid bosses have in Classic?
---
Grind =/= not casual. Wow was the most casual MMO of it's day and age and it is still more casual than retail is now.
---
Omg right! “You know how blizzard uses sub money to keep the game moving forward? Yeah well fuck that”
---
I was thinking maybe it was satire, but I don't know. Or maybe just someone who is forced to pump out articles to meet quota, and has no knowledge of WoW or the gaming industry.
---
I have always felt that this is the wrong way to do it. The simple fact is, there is a lot of reason to use a 2 hander in defensive and a sword and board in battle stance (you want to hit critters and build up rage with your 2 hander while tanking, and charge into combat with your sword and board, and interrupt mobs in battle stance.). 
---
Simply put, this functionality is just too important to be linked. I am fine with always attempting to shield bash when I switch to my 1 hander and shield, but I am not fine with dumping my entire rage pool every tmie I want to interrupt a healer.
---
What is the code?
---
Certain chests in higher leveled areas have decent spawn rates for certain world boes. Private server players have long known which spawn where and camp these on spawn to accomplish this in much reduced results. 
---
With layering they can farm the same chest about 100x faster. 
---
The gold cap is likely from someone full on automating mining on multiple accounts and just vendooring the useless ore.
---
Probably. Grammar and spelling are my worst subjects next to math.
---
I'm really struggling with what I want to play. I want to be a class that doesn't have many counters, is challenging, and fun to play in PVP (wPVP, Duels, Battlegrounds). Right now I've created an undead mage (11) since I love playing frost mage back in WOTLK and Cata. They have awesome utility, fun, and are relatively strong. I was thinking of starting with rogue, but I basically played Rogue all the way from vanilla up to Cata and I hate the fact that they suck to level, so I decided against it. The two things I'm considering is a Warlock(Orc, even though male orcs look stupid on the small horse mount) or Hunter(Orc). I know both Warlocks and Hunters require quite a lot of skill to play. Utility wise Warlocks look to be better. However, clothies are countered pretty easily by Hunter it seems, but Warlocks basically mess up most other classes. Both seem easy enough to level. Mage, Hunter, and Warlock all seem like good classes so it's hard to pick one. I just want to roll them all but that seems like an impossible thing to, so I need to pick one. Which one is the most fun to play in PVP? Which one is the strongest in each PVP area (wPVP, Duels, BGs)? Please help lol.
---
what server?
---
And abusing bugs/ mechanics is called exploiting. It's pretty obvious layering isn't intended for players to swap through quickly and automatically to loot the same node 20 times.
---
What?!  But Wataru will NEVER join a group now that you've blacklisted him!  Harsh.
---
Lol OP is so butthurt over other people having more virtual Warcraft items.
---
I can’t believe people in this world feel so passionate about such trivial nonsense.
---
Dude, go for a bike ride or something.  The game is still fun for the rest of us.
---
Ah dang, nice!
---
There are a ton of priests on Incendius horde, and seems like fewer warlocks some reason.
---
I took Friday off! Normally i might login to Destiny 2 to do some stuff with my guild there, buuut this might not happen due to me being just lvl 15 on classic 😂😂😂😂
---
&gt; The real solution was 
---
...obviously *your idea*.  No, server clusters and merges is stupid.  The same number of ore node would be getting farmed because there would be one guild on each server at this point that was farming them.
---
5 servers, five farmers.  Same number of nodes hit the economy.  Now they all merge into one.  Oh look, same number of nodes hit the economy.
---
Based on the spy addon composites it looks like Stalagg might actually be \~70/30 Horde:Alliance.  That is skewed because layering so it's impossible to say but I'd love to know, genuinely
---
One minor note is that a guild will need a lot more tanks than just the main tank for a raid. Generally you need a few off tanks every night.
---
Warrior DPS is also really good. Unless healing is your thing I'd really just go Warrior
---
But that said I'm a big fan of prioritizing the theme or RP that appeals to you. If you dig Paladin and that's the one you want to keep playing don't overthink it bro
---
1.12 talents, class changes, and itemization change things too.
---
This is clearly not intended and so abusing this falls under the exploit technicality.
---
Haha. Ha. ha.  
---
no. At least, not for long.
---
We were rolling on something in dm. I rolled a 6, other dude rolled a 1, and last guy rolled 100.
---
Not minted. Go mint it.
---
Luckily this macro can be adjusted to fit exactly that need. How this macro works is it filters the weapons second and the stance first. So all you have to do is equip the sword and board while in defensive stance then whenever you use the macro it will change to the 2h in battle stance, or vice versa. Equipt the sword and board in Battle stance then the macro will equip the 2hander in defensive stance
---
That's still five weeks at 20 hours a week, which is like working a part time job.
---
getting a fucking horse as an enchanter D/E'ing greens is an achievement fuck 60
---
They are genuinely dumb people.
---
It's understandable if they're auction house big dick day traders or if they farm and sell mats all day, but most people that do this I think are just too dumb.
---
For level 26 this is an amazing item for many classes. I didn’t get any helm till like level 38.
---
You and everyone else.
---
Ask in world chat or LFG chat.
---
Lol, people defending it are either abusing it themselves, or are pain too dumb to foresee the consequences of this.
---
I try being nice on occasion. I tried waving to a shaman one level higher. Guess he took it as a taunt. When he was at 25%, I let the kitty finish him as he ran.
---
The only reason layering stays is because people refuse to utilize xfers... stacking too many players on 3 servers forces blizzard to keep layering.
---
The majority of alliance starting zones are on the other continent. We're in horde starting zone territory
---
LOL
---
Thanks a ton! -Druid Tank
---
but was it worth it?
---
Check out weak auras, I'm using totem tracker (I think it's called). Works well but wish it had a range fader.
---
Yeah, countries should just print lots of money so everyone can be super rich and we can all live millionaire lifestyles! There's LITERALLY no downsides, it definitely never comes back to bite the average people in the ass!
---
How is this done
---
Yes it does.
---
Better crowd control.
---
Ive been marathoning Always Sunny for the first time while I wait in queue.
---
This needs to be someones guild ad message
---
It's not ninja looting if it was given to him/her.
---
nah he was serious he went on further than this after the fact in general chat lol and multiple people were calling him on his shit, dudes just an asshole, not a troll.
---
George Gray doesn't care.
---
&gt; You should not punish people for using a broken system to its fullest. 
---
You mean.. abusing a system in a way it's not meant to be used? It's called exploiting, no matter how you try to go around it.
---
You could actually do it in less game time if you take your time, just need to take long breaks to get your test bar up. Still would be making it possible in less “game time played”
---
Classic phone picture
---
The alliance are all assholes, every time I've seen one they've tried to kill me and my friends. We are currently planning a minor raid on stormwind and a few other lower level areas as payback. For the horde motherfuckers
---
Oh man, I remember when you got mounts at level 40.  I played this game something like 10 years ago and... I'd like to say that it's a totally different game now, but I honestly don't remember very much of it.  Things looked shittier, it was harder to fight mobs, and goals (eg mounts) were further away.  Not that I want to start a circlejerk, but mounts at 40 made them feel more significant.
---
Classic is life!
---
So you are furious 95% of total warrior playtime?
---
ElvUI.  
---
I don't need much else.
---
The best thing about the ravager is being able to do the spin move while my pet tanks.

---
Don't overthink it, pick something that appeals to you thematically. Two of the same DPS class in a group will not hurt anything aside from just competing for gear. Just don't double up on healers or tanks and you'll be good
---
Man the second I get a desktop PC, I’m trying out WoW classic. I was in elementary school when it released and played a lot of free MMORPGs, and my parents definitely weren’t paying for a monthly subscription for a game.
---
You mean like for aoe leveling? Does that even work at low levels?
---
The health bar is actually the mana bar, when the mana bar runs out, I die.
---
I am not sure we can help without more information? Where in the process are you dying? Are you dying when you gather the mobs up, when you hit frost nova, after you blink away?
---
If you only want the color, Brightleaf's Classic Class Colors or whatever it's called on twitch app will do that. I used it before moving to Threat Plates.  Advanced Interface Options also has an option for this I believe.
---
Nah, I'm running a Surface Book 2, which isn't the best laptop for gaming but isn't too bad.
---
Oh, cool. TIL.
---
I too just hit 40 on my warrior but can’t afford the mount. I’m at 60g-65g. What did you do or what should I do to get that final bit?
---
Do orcs make the best warriors you reckon my d00d
---
Imagine seeing a comment on the internet and immediately being compelled to move the goalposts for no reason other than to try and claim the other person is wrong.
---
Yikes.
---
Because they do legitimately have brain problems and I worry about them
---
Ok, wait in queue
---
40 is where the class comes alive. Grats man, and enjoy it!
---
The fix is that they'll ban a bunch of people.  It's not a surprise to anyone.
---
That's what I've been doing. It's only a matter of time before they put the stupid diacritics in their names.
---
There’s enough to play with the market. You just don’t know how.
---
Green shield from BFD that gives only +9 frost spell dmg
---
He hands the silver on top of his hand... that or his thumb is on the wrong side.
---
What would the new spell rotation be?
---
It's definitely enough to heal dungeons, it's not enough to be under-levelled though.
---
Same here, but there are ton of options for you to set it up tho
---
Lol I have never come across a single instance of a single one of the situations you mentioned. I also run instances constantly.
---
Not a bowl cut lmao
---
You'll have to do a ton of grinding later on anyways, both for XP just to level and for gold so might as well see them more as blessings than curses.
---
How long did it take?
---
No they wont.
---
Bailing on skeram tonight.  Too many horde and as a warrior it just makes it extra worse.
---
My ui https://imgur.com/gallery/IsBIHyU
---
Or just...
---
remove the ability to do it?
---
Why immediately jump the extreme?
---
I leveled fury when wotlk came out. I'm not sure out different that is. I just felt like it was riskier with taking more dmg. Managing cooldowns was important too.
---
Lol keep trying
---
Definitely shadow for solo levelling.

---
All 3 are solid picks, but when it comes to being easiest to find a spot for dungeons and raids, priests are not just the best of your 3 choices, but the best of all classes, rivaled only by warrior.
---
&gt; if a warrior took their bow and tried to argue that the extra damage on their pulls is more important (or even remotely on the same level of value)
---
It's not comparable warriors don't use bows as part of their dps rotation, if we were talking about 1 handers, then yes, sure it would be the same, but 2 handers are genuinely used to increase dps as a hunter.
---
The classic jokes are the best ones.
---
Yup
---
It fucks currency in game, it does have a negative impact on players
---
Yeah, poor choice of wording on my part. What I meant was they've not committed to anything at this stage.
---
Spam dungeons. Seems to be a great way to get money between grey, white and green gear along with mats. Plus doesn’t matter if you have mount or not cause you can’t use it anyways in an instance.
---
Currently have to wait till after midnight to quest in STV. Not because I mind the PvP, but because the horde dominates the server so much that there's 10 hordes in every small area for every alliance. You can't fight back and you can't do anything. Not terribly amazing.
---
Took 1½ hour to finish the last part of tiger mastery and Sin'dall for a group of 5 of us.
---
Though it'll get better once everyone is past the 30-40 rush.
---
Imo there is a big opportunity here. Pure classic 1.12 servers can always be a thing for those that dont want anything new. The emerald dream raid for example was a piece of cut content that didn't get put in because they decided to roll out BC. I think if we get some cool additions like that id be ok with community votes that would be neat.
---
Things id never vote for include lfg or flying mounts. Even If the cost was astronomical.
---
On Herod and still found it funny. Have an upvote.
---
Not that true at all. If you have a exp grp then you could get pretty good xp.
---
It's very good for inventory management:)
---
Ok
---
Generally you should be meleeing 90% of the time.
---
You do know that the number of people on Reddit compared the number that play is very different. You’re only getting a very small selection of people doing those polls.
---
Whatever makes you feel better, but responsibility also falls on the designers of a system so easily used in highly beneficial ways. Taking the high road has zero advantages if they don’t fix and punish said exploit ASAP, which they have no signs of doing.
---
There's enough on the AH, doesn't mean people have the gold to buy them. Most people are rushing to get 1100 gold to get their mount atm.
---
And now you put the link here on Reddit to. 
---
Isn’t it enough with the spam in game? 
---
You are just helping them. 
---
It’s very strange that the mods don’t delete this, but I guess they don’t care about gold selling.
---
this is great, nice job, would love to see more about WoW Classic.

Care to explain how a melee weapon is not good for a class that spends most of their time in combat hitting things with their melee weapon?
---
eat pant
---
Name one way that it’ll impact my gameplay negatively?
---
I felt that
---
Maybe I am misunderstanding... but it swaps both, right? I mean, any time you hit that button, you end up in different stance and with a different set of weapons, right? 
---
I like the sentiment, and If it's working for you, great. But I really feel that it's best to practice with 2 completely separate keybinds. As you get further and further, it doesn't stop being important to have the right equipment on and be in the right stance. It matters a lot more.

I wish Blizzard added queues based on minimal race population. Like there are 5k horde online, so queue for Alliance starts from 5.5-6k. Server imbalance on pvp server ruins classic more than everything else. Plus it would be great to see server pop before you create character (or percents like 30A\\70H).
---
Multiboxing. Apparently its totally allowed.
---
Special characters 
---
Mate, you just got shipped to Australia
---
That's all I've seen tonight in LFG on Grobbulus, it's weird. Like all of a sudden that's tons of groups either demanding specs, payments, etc.
---
Am also on Deviant Delight and agree. If you see the “Savory Deviate Delight” being sold on the Horde auction house chances are its me. Trying to capitalize on that server name connection.
---
Multiboxing my dude
---
It’s always been allowed.
---
Feeling left behind at 40 rofl,with what kind of tryhards do you play with,most of my servers average so far is 35-40max
---
&gt;I'm a lvl 32 rogue and I've recently hit a brick wall in **stranglethorn vale and thousand needles**.
---
Have you been to the five other zones with level 32 quests?
---
Yeahhh... I picked up drawing like a month or so ago again and I cannot, for the life of me, draw hands or faces. But I tried my best to portray it. My friends are so amazing at art while I kept drawing stick figures so they urged me to try to draw.
---
20 hours a week on WoW isn't that crazy. It's like my only hobby and the only game I play until something new comes out to distract me for a bit. I probably put in 35 or so a week.
---
I never played WoW in my life, neither have some of my friends, we all got it and havent had this much fun on a game since.
---
Haven't looked up many guides either just on what skills to pick on how I wanna play, if youve thought about buying it Id do it.
---
I like the unit frames with the fatter bars, how is this addon called please?
---
Definitely not 2004 anymore!
---
My WW Axe PSA:
---
At level 35 you can run SM Armory which has a 25% chance to drop Ravager.  The time it takes to farm WW axe at like 30-32, you can basically use that time to just level.
---
I opted to be 2-3 levels higher and eligible for SM over being level 30-32 with WW axe.
---
IMO Ravager is better then WW axe since it’s basically bladestorm as a weapon proc.  Makes grinding 2-3 mobs much more doable.
---
You’re tanks will hate you, but it’s like having a 4th or even 5th dps in the instance.  
---
Cleave dungeon groups wet dream.
---
This is why I went PVE that sounds miserable
---
You're like dead before second cleave
---
Higher than level 50ish maybe?
---
I can’t tell if the rest of the movie was complete shit or if that scene was just so good everything else automatically seems like shit.
---
Not so many trips that take more than 25 seconds? What level are you exactly?
---
Because no matter what layer im on I see like 1 alliance for every like 10 horde
---
Not on vanilla Nerzhul
---
I play horde on Stalagg. And I take great pleasure in killing alliance members any chance I get
---
Yes!  Makes things so much easier.
---
I named mine Craggy the Crag Boar. XD
---
Man, I was stuck for so long trying to get to 125
---
It's still generating rave just not the kind you wanted lol
---
Yes you really need a lvl 40 mount 
---
/thread
---
It's good for long trips, but the extra 24% speed isn't that big of a deal for a few more levels while leveling up  as by level 40 you probably have the majority of flight points anyway.
---
He didn’t tell you why he wanted it. Just simply asked for it and you were stupid enough to give it to him. It was probably more of a joke than anything and you gave it to him. Honestly you are kind of stupid. Lol.
---
Personally I'm hoping the massive and impressively positive reception means there is more on the cards than they indicated. By that I mean genuinely new classic content or 'alternative history' expansions where they try to release new expansions that stay closer to classic than some of the later stuff. Not that I dislike the later stuff mind you, I just think alternative new stuff would be awesome.
---
Qualifier: this is *strictly* wishful thinking on my pary :)
---
It will fuck auction house prices, it will change the gear people have or dont have for pvp, it will devalue gold between players. Game economy matters lol
---
Yeah. That guy is a bitch. I would've given it to Quinn just for that shit
---
Hey I played on Nerzhul in vanilla!
---
Apparently it’s a thing that horde have more players on PvP servers - the informal surveys that are sometimes posted seem to support this, but there are no official numbers
---
Damn, that’s some dedication to get there.
---
Just be happy you won’t have to play against Holy Paladins later on.

If you’re worried about UD WOTF cast fear twice.

Yea probably something in the rest of the pic that gives it away so he needed to crop.
---
weak auras allows you to set timers for every ability.
---
You have great taste in pets and inebriation method of choice. 
---
Im new to wow and unfortunately get stoned and just run around the world jumping off mountains. It's fun, i just end up levelling super slow!
---
Shit thabks dog I forgot it was Thursday
---
People are trying to get into that server cause it’s the “streamer server”. 
---
They should leave it the way it is for now or just removing layering earlier. 
---
Blizzard can’t help it if 50,000 fanboys all want follow streamers around to one server.
---
Most of the time while questing I use my weapon swap macro to build up rage with the weapon I am skilled in and then swap to the weapon I am bad with to spam sunders until I am out of rage to level up my weapon skill. 
---
Or I want to interrupt healers without dumping my entire rage pool.
---
What addon for the castbar?
---
Yeah its pretty stupid.
---
Why wouldn't it be?
---
Titanpanel and Bartender
---
Just trolls, really
---
Probably just a mirage.
---
How is this happening.  Teach me your magic
---
What does a typical 60 end game PVP shadow priest talent build look like? I've seen a few variations of it. Do some of the talents come down to preference in the shadow tree?
---
Any way to download this?
---
You go to ah. Prices are ridiculously high.
---
Sadly I’ve done all the southern barrens and northern barrens quests too but every time I try do the quests here I get jumped by higher level mobs.
---
Last to 60 wins
---
I think they should remove the special characters. Make people be creative and come up with their own name instead of having multiple people on the server with the same name.
---
I haven't gotten any on Skeram but got nearly a dozen in a day and a half on Fairbanks, it was bizarre.
---
&gt;Hunters require quite a lot of skill to play.
---
Wat.
---
I would recommend Mage just because Mages have never, ever been a bad class. Hunters/ Locks have good and bad seasons but Mages are always top tier.
---
Rogue isn't much better if you pull more than 1 mob before ~35-40. Only difference is you can escape but it's still slow as fuck leveling overall.
---
I’m new, what do you get from PVPing?
---
Gooooooood Anakin gooooood
---
Wait did Blizzard tease TWO expansions? Or are you twisting my leg?
---
This game just came out and they already have expansions planned? Man they’re really on the ball here. I wonder what kind of features there will be. I’m hoping alliance will get high elves. What do you think Horde will get? Ogres, maybe?
---
How is Zygor? Is it worth the money?
---
Is this on Smolderweb? I think I recognize a few names lol
---
Yeah moe money lol

---
I’m on Grob too haha
---
It's all about that class fantasy. I couldn't care less if they're the best or not. (They probably are)
---
If I stay awake for more than 30 hours, my brain just shuts down and I can barely think.
---
Not sure if you know but this is not real ray-tracing.
---
Looks like it is just increasing that amount of light volumetric fog receives.
---
This reminds me of the dude who opened a ticket because his weapon was gone and it was really in his bag, he just didn't see that.
---
Druid is versatile, which is nice because she can do whatever she wants. I’d go warrior or priest so that you can balance out whatever she does—if she goes dps/resto, then roll a warrior to take the heat; if she goes feral (tank), then roll a priest so you can keep her healed up. That plot will backfire if she bounces around though, so... maybe if you roll warrior so you can tank or dps.
---
EDIT: somehow managed to not read the actual body. My bad. I’d go warrior. You can be her tank.
---
Whenever I hit play it’ll bring up the battlenet launcher and then exit out. What am I doing wrong?
---
I'm sorry you lost your account over this.
---
I had something similar this morning but I reported the guy and lost the chat history.
---
The first encounter is a shaman and rogue so that's 1 healer  
---
The second is a priest and mage, again 1 healer  
---
The third is a priest and shaman, that's 2 healers  
---
The last one is priest and mage, 1 healer  
---
&gt;a bunch of solos with no healers  
---
Did you watch the video ?   
---
They won every encounter because the priest was supporting the warrior instead of trying to play like it's retail, like their enemies did. Also the warrior did some pretty big peels, especially on the first mage, don't think he got even a cast off.
---
WoW. /applause
---
Not in 1.12 it wasn't. At least not the shockadin people actually remember. You were just a gimped ret paladin with a mediocre nuke every 30 seconds until 2.0.0 where they reduced the cooldown on holy shock.
---
Never did any WotLK dungeons so I wouldn't know.
---
That's why I love the leveling changes they did a few patches ago. Previously everybody was just spamming dungeons for 60 levels and if you *did* decide to be inefficient and quest, you outlevelled each zone before it was even half done.
---
Now, if you want to level a character on retail, you actually get to finish the zone because the level scales with you. Sure, they're still not as memorable as vanilla zones but it was a massive step in the right direction.
---
Sure just tell that to everyone named John or Mike.  "Sorry sir your parents screwed up, you are the 10th Mike this month, please choose another"
---
i love him look at how HAPPY he is little sleeping cute
---
That is 100% feasible with this macro, you just simply have to change the parses, or null them with another added parse. 
---
Again tho it will always boil down to personal preference and what you feel comfortable with. 
---
This was simply somthing I posted for any warriors that are having trouble making a reliable stance dance macro. This one is easy and allows customization to fit needs. Or you can use it as is and it works perfectly fine.
---
Yes I am but when I cast slam it resets my swing so really is aa-slam-3.4secs-aa. but I guess it has its use since is basically a faster, but slightly weaker, HS.
---
I was wondering this as well
---
Pretty much, the people that see the writing on the wall on those servers are able to get the fuck out. The people that don't won't be able to complain.
---
Ok thanks
---
I have love for cat
---
except nobody wants to keep this quiet. you dont understand what the streisand effect is. you think the solution to this is to keep it under wraps as best as possible?
---
god i miss this type of shit.
---
Remember you dont have to join them.

If you go and do dungeon grinding, aka. Aoe pulling if you do have a wrong spec you will cause the group to pretty much wipe, wasting everyones time.
---
There is plenty of groups that need a tank for quest runs, most of those groups are slower to clear the dungeons and will be doing quests instead of aoe farming the mobs, and your leveling spec works way better there.
---
Same as soon there will be pug raids, some of them will tell you be specific spec and bring specific consumables. If you dont want to respec dont join them! Plenty of room for everyone!
---
If you’re both playing druids and she’s playing feral I would go balance or resto
---
If she’s going resto I would go feral 
---
She’s probably going to enjoy more starting with feral though as it’s easily the best leveling spec for druids

Except segmenting becomes really obtuse really quickly. Can you only vote on BG changes if you're exalted with the rep? Professions changes if you're 300 with it, class changes if you're... boss changes if you're.. quest changes if.. PvP changes if..
---
It's convoluted and garbage because any changes will change the game that everyone is playing - whether they are at the content currently or not.
---
Most people who aren't invested in the game and would be low level.. probably wouldn't vote at all because they don't understand it. But someone who has played the game for 4 months and hovers around 39 because he's loving twink BGs might be very invested in the future of the game.
---
I was thinking about kos list, but i wonder if i can just make that in weakaura. So whenever i see a player it will alert me to kill the fucker.
---
"Best Tank, best DPS, best Healer... oh, let's give you a bunch of spells and abilities.  Oh look, you can fly and pick flowers at the same time because you're a little Druid!  NEEHEEEEE SMILEY FACE"
---
&gt; Watch a speed runner from actual vanilla run through barrens.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/472755328?t=09h04m56s
---
Now try watching a good speed runner.
---
You mean remove the ability to group?
---
You should probably quit the guild.
---
Hunter require a lot of skill to be good, imo. You can't just face roll and expect things to happen is what I'm trying to say lol. I believe the reason why people call people Huntards is because people can't play them properly. Would you say Mages are more fun to play than Hunter or Lock in wPVP/BGs?
---
You are the bottom tier of your faction if you do this
---
It fell of a truck if you know what I mean...
---
Maybe it’s because I’m a low level dwarf priest in Dun Morogh/Loch Modan, but it’s dwarven priests and gnome locks as far as the eye can see , on Old Blanchy at least.
---
For imaginary internet points
---
Yes, that's correct. One of the many reasons mage is widely considered OP in vanilla PvP. CCs don't always last the full duration due to heartbeat resists though.
---
"A heartbeat resist is an early break in a spells effects due to periodic checking for resistance. The result is that the resisted effect ends prematurely."
---
tbh season 5's writing was kinda fucking weird at times
---
remember the whole arya thing with the faceless men and the waif?
---
Why wouldn’t you use Most Effective Tactics Available? 
---
If you know clearing a dungeon with 3 mages is the fastest way to do it then why not?
---
If someone wants to charge for tanking a dungeon then let them. 
---
Let people play the way they want and you play your way.
---
Sike worth more than that haha
---
imagine clicking greed when you actually need
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
My wife now thinks I am retarded because of my chuckling at this pic.
---
I know that pain. Imagine how many corpse runs it will take before getting to Gadgetzan.
---
Horde hillsbrad here, yah it's been lopsided enough I've noticed. Hillsbrad felt safe because the moment someone tries to jump you, there is always horde nearby. Especially the farms. Has to be near 20 horde players aoe clearing at all times. STV felt slightly more balanced.
---
I stopped KOS'ing since I noticed most people just want to quest. PVP is fun, but it won't buy gear or level you up.
---
And the Dateless losers win again.
---
I wish more people were like you. I leveled in Ashenvale for a bit and the sheer amount of Horde who killed me while being 5+ levels higher really left me annoyed and a bit sad, honestly.
---
I get that I play on a PvP realm. But we literally do not get anything for killing each other right now, and since the terms are so uneven in these encounters, I doubt people even get any real satisfaction out of it.
---
My friend decided all low level Horde were fair game after a certain point, and I joined him for a little while before I decided that no, they are not fair game because other Horde killed us.
---
did you figure it out or have an alternative for rogue CCs?
---
He grew a beard on all this time
---
No I meant remove the game, as you apparently just jump to the most extreme interpretation. In fact just remove the planet.
---
I actually laughed out loud when I first saw the high elf in the sw mage tower. I totally forgot how ugly they looked, lol
---
Shouldn't mess with streamers, even if they are their only viewer.
---
Honest question not trying to be dickish, have you thought about rerolling?
---
This.  If you go Nelf Druid too, you can be tank/deeps/heals depending on whatever she feels like each day.
---
He see's you when your eating, 
---
He knows when you're low health,
---
He knows when you go AFK,
---
So stay in the inn for goodness sake!
---
I'm more concerned about the slippery slope of first it's talent spec, then it's BiS only, then it's some fictitious addon gear score. I just don't want to all of that crap to slowly infiltrate it's way back into classic.
---
3:2 even
---
Hakurai's guide, adapted by shikushiku for Guidelime. It's pretty solid. It has some issues. Mainly, that when you have lead in quests that you are not eligible for, skipping that step skips the entire quest chain (for example, this happens in wetlands if you aren't a human, as you cannot get the guide quest and skipping it also blanks dragonmaw war banners, catapults, and the nek'rosh elite quest, all of which are well worth doing). And a few of the location markers are broken and take you to the wrong place.
---
And if you want to run dungeons you have to skip some sections or get hopelessly overleveled. This time through, I just skipped the second darkshore loop completely so I could run more BFD/Deadmines. 
---
But it's pretty solid. It also lets you in on a couple neat opportunities, like farming the ogre's strength recipe (drops off basically 2 mobs in duskwood), or the tigers in stranglethorn (jungle stew is somewhat unique in that it's a high level food that does not require spices, tiger meat can be turned into jungle stew can be sold for very signifciant vendor profit.). And as it is heavily quest slanted, you get the opportunity to basically consciously skip, or complete, almost every quest in the game after level 20ish.
---
Still a bit high tech for Caliban knights no? I always figured they were true medieval with just guns and shit
---
This is why I don’t play the charity game. If you need something that I have, you can either pay for it now or later in the AH.
---
Yours has excellent flow!
---
Hillsbrad has been the opposite for me as a Horde.  Hell, last night as I was fishing with my warrior I saw a lvl 32 Rogue fighting a Snapjaw.  They were at 32%.  I didn’t wanna start a corpse camping spree and it didn’t seem fair so I just walked by.  Rogue saw me, then turned around and went the other way.  Felt suspicious but hopeful.  About 5 mins later as I’m fishing that POS comes up, saps me, and then lights me up.
---
It’s okay.  I’m okay.  I’m just gonna KOS from now on.
---
Doesnt matter what time you fish there but Tanaris, its a beautiful spot all along the coast line. If you want a secret spot go for a swim along coast lines all along the world and wait to find land you can walk up and have a nice fish. 
---
My favourite though would have to be behind the stratthome instance, theres a route you can take to get out of the map and find yourself northwest of eastern plaguelands and north east of scarlet monastery. It has a dock some ruins and a large tower. It looks like its elven ruins which has been discussed at length by the wow exploration community about what it is and what people believe it to be a reference to in lore. If you need some help getting there send me a PM ill be happy yo explain how to get there :)
---
It's too daunting for me I rather have something simpler to set up
---
Hope he has pursuit of justice...
---
Typical rogues.
---
Or having a first gen dual core processor which did a similar thing.
---
I use that also.  Usually for people I see being idiots in LFG or World. 
---
Edit - Up to 11 ignored already.
---
Yes. For very large pulls, it's just not realistic to spend 15 rage on every normal mob getting it on you. 
---
Demo shout is not as efficient for threat as sunder, but when you have 6 mobs to tank? that's 90 rage in sunders, and it's much more realistic to just spam demo a couple times and hope that lasts long enough for the blizzard to kill everything.  Also, revenge is not tied to a specific mob, so you can target a minor mob for a revenge so you don't have to sunder it at all. Kind of a "mini" taunt for non elite mobs, as they probably die before the revenge threat is outpaced.
---
Demo shout is also very significant damage reduction, which decreases healer threat (as the healer does less healing).
---
well having a single player kill me by putting 10 DoTS on me in 1 second just feels very off.
---
Idealy you want to grind humanoids who drop money and cloth or you grind something like elementals which drop a lot of trash worth a lot of silver.
---
Grinding beasts gives you the lowest selling trash.
---
I think Macros won't help you learn to be a better warrior.
---
Finds level 19 twink wand.....
---
200 portions.
---
Is Wow worth getting into again? How good is it from like 10 years ago?
---
Very much so. I just hit 30 with my Warrior got Berserk Stance and then I remembered why I don't like Warriors and the stance thing limiting skills.
---
Just reroll and be happy.
---
Holy shite what server is this on!?
---
Flavour of the month and nostalgia mostly but I love the simplistic class mechanics and how nothing is handed to you.
---
Fuck man at 19 if take 7 gold.
---
In what point of the game I should be concerned about gear?
---
You never know on Reddit.
---
I agree. I once went into ashenvalle as a level 18. Got killed camped and killed again by a level 29. I have since proceeded to kill many a horde minding thier own business
---
can someone explain this layering change thing, I have wanted to get on a friends layer a few times but google shows nothing.
---
Honestly, after watching many videos to prepare, up until 40 the best spec is a mix of shadow and discipline. And it’s been working out well for me.
---
Name reservation typically
---
I’m assuming you did this on android. I’m using an iPhone and I don’t have a WASD preset sadly. I can launch them game and everything , but I don’t get a wasd keyboard preset.
---
Happens to me every day too. I get to my destination then teleported to the border of the zone I'm in, dropped from the sky then a yellow message appears in chat.
---
"instance not found: transfer aborted"
---
If they red they dead
---
Hes lying... that means hes played 20 hours straight and then got on for 2 hours every day after that until hitting 40 today
---
Yeah I made a female gnome with those big pigtails, zoned in and realized every single female gnome running around had the same hairstyle. Deleted it and picked a different one. Such a huge decision tbh when you have no way to change your appearance.
---
Not even remotely close to being pushy. Efficient =/= Pushy or speedrunning. I didn't say to tank pull more, do it quicker or so. I said that we have an option to do that and I was basically called a retail scum by "purists".
---
Uh, yeah, we know, we're playing it.
---
My husband went out to buy me a Polar Pop so as a reward I logged him in so the queue would be finished by the time he got back home.
---
You are the hero we deserve
---
The can _need_ a 2-handed axe, this is what counts
---
Why?
---
I created characters on the same realm before classic was released. I did it to save names mostly. I was planning on staying there before the release of classic!
---
They can. Warden does some NSA level stuff on your PC.
---
lol no.
---
the only thing similar about both images is they have a circle and both have purple in places.
---
Thank you, I certainly hope it works out too.
---
BFA is slightly behind schedule if you follow the legion patch cycle they tried to stick to.
---
Assuming the next expansion already addressed some of the main BFA complaints they could take the time to try and bring some of that magic back to the retail game.
---
Overhauling loot distribution quantity and rarity, 
---
Changing the quest chains from short little tourist guides through a zone to a more classic central town with quests spread out around it. 
---
Removing scaling and increasing the damage and health of mobs for leveling.
---
Its too late to completely rework everything but they could implement some changes to try and get this.
---
That's cool and all but why torture yourself with an iphone? Come to the android master race
---
I think I’ve seen exactly one rogue. I just made the trek to Teldrassil, so we’ll see; so far it’s hunters and priests.
---
Mine said 1-3 hours and took about
---
An hour and a half ish! When I go to change realms the new realm shows as “locked” but I’m still able to log in and play
---
Vergin lol
---
The comments say it was bugged on private servers which this guide is made for. Is it still the same on classic?
---
I’m enjoy combat sword rogue and can quite regularly take 2-3 mobs without a problem. Idk.
---
Stone(r)
---
If rez sick also completely broke all of your gear I would still side with you.
---
Can we finally debunk the myth of Vanilla being a slow-paced game? Cause I feel like people are slowing themselves down just to prove how demanding and difficult game is when it is not. You just need to know what to do.
---
Same and now I'm using macros for lots of things.
---
Good luck getting Dal or Iron foe though
---
Glad I wasn’t the only one screenshotting that cinematic
---
Let me disagree over there...
---
Woth all due respect
---
MUD!
---
ArcticMUD. DragonLance themed. Amazing.
---
For a select few goods that won’t stop me from playing the game
---
Always doing it from behind
---
"Don't lie or play dumb", well he wouldnt be playing...
---
At least you guys can kill mobs solo, although I’m super new so keep that in mind, if I run into a mob 1 level up on me I have a 50/50 chance of dying as a level 8 elf priest
---
oh okay, would you be able to post any data from some of these?
---
thank you that helps a lot, for some reason i can't move the nameplate down lower even if I unlock it, do you know why that may be?
---
As someone who has been playing on the server for the past two days, EXACTLY. It's been a regular server just like all the rest.
---
Yeah that would make sense it being hunters and priests over there. That's what I rolled my priest as. My hunter will be a dwarf tho and I'll roll a druid after my warrior is done lol
---
Their lvl 30 weapon is deadly.
---
Pvp.
---
gorilla gang
---
They vowed to kill the LFG addon. They're serious.
---
Druids are the best for wpvp. You have the best escape tools between cat form stealth, travel form, immunity to polymorph, entangling roots and natures grasp. Basically that means you choose your own engagements. At the end of the day though pay whatever you find interesting and fun. WoW is about enjoying the world and fantasy of each class and really you can’t go wrong with any class because every single one has at least 1 roll they can play as long as you put in the time to make it work.
---
Yeah I usually accept invites for quest grind, if I don't I need like 1 more and don't want to give them false hopes that I'll stay around.
---
Had a few people get upset, but no sweat off my brow.
---
Oh no! Someone will have more gold than me on a game with a shallow economic system!
---
Also we had several devastating wars, faction wars, Cataclysm, Legion invasion and another faction war of global scale. Where are all these people coming from?
---
Can't mages just counterspell you and it's all over?
---
I've been playing on Whitemane for the past two days and haven't encountered any of that, fortunately! Everybody is super nice. I'm on Alliance, not sure about Horde.
---
Yep, never set up Remote Desktop in my life until now
---
If they offered 7, ask 10. Try to haggle a bit. Take the 7 otherwise and it'll really help your mount cost. I don't think its a twink bis
---
I fully understand. Setting the pace is one thing, showing a possibility is another. Being called retail next gen player for providing an option is simply ridiculous.
---
Its just a matter of time, until word of mouth spreads.
---
Oh you want to make real money?  Just get that layering addon and you can loot that chest 20 times.
---
I can get the pvp wep without touching the AH.  I can go down bosses and hope for a weapon drop, don’t need the AH for that.  People are vastly overestimating the impact this will have.
---
underrated comment
---
All in the eyes of a pessimist.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Yes the value will certainly increase but also u gotta think about how much 7g can buy right now compared to in 6 months. I’d counter offer higher just to see if you can get more
---
Very few people are abusing this right now.  It is not mainstream yet but it is disturbing what can be done with it.
---
It needs to be addressed before it gets mainstream.
---
i would think people like you were racist if i didnt play on a pserver that was mostly chinese and russians after a little while. omg quarantine them all.
---
Check out console port. You can play with a controller. I've been playing around with it. It's no where near as good as m+kb. But for questing and walking around it's nice.
---
I know. Especially since I'm not on like herod or one of the other mega servers or anything, 7 gold is really hard to come by at this stage.
---
It's so tempting, but im worried i'll regret it if this staff skyrockets in price later.
---
Is Swamp Jaguar drop rate bugged? Killed about 15 and got one grey item and 3 large fangs. No wicked claws.
---
Layer abuse
---
You'll never work in this town again!
---
Echeyakee eats bread?
---
Hmm when I saw the title of this post I thought you were talking about that story about the pedo tutor of that family and how you go on a big like hunt to uncover what he did and then get to kill him, that was pretty sad stuff too if you read all the journals you get from each step :(
---
Need Scarlet legs!
---
Maybe use the healing spell in front of you, a fucking fake reaction from a stupid streamer to attract people, sigh
---
Is there a different between +healing spells and healing done on an item? All the BiS I've seen is healing done.
---
Think about it, if you do actually end up doing endgame and such then you might have 30 days played on that mage. Those are 30 fun days, instead of 3 days of boredom and then quitting.
---
how do you even abuse layering to level? I thought it was only abused to get mats
---
I wonder... suppose you did install this version. Is it even possible to upgrade it via the launcher, or is it so incompatible that Blizzard would force you to completely uninstall it and install the current game manually?
---
Hi, /u/Fidddy_
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/czw9gn/all_my_favorite_streamers_are_playing_classic_wow/). 
---
theres also ..of stamina as well
---
This is my first time playing vanilla wow (having first played wow in legion) and I'm struggling with what to play. I initially made a rogue because that's what I played in retail for a while (levelled up to 60) and I really enjoyed the dps, but I also don't like the combo points system. My main in retail is a demon hunter and I love everything about that class, particularly the fast movements and AoE damage. Anyway after getting my rogue to level 11, I rerolled a druid, having never played one before. I just hit 15 and I'm enjoying it so far but I only really enjoy casting wrath and healing myself? I can't get the hang of the bear form and am telling myself maybe feral form will be more enjoyable. I'm stuck and feel like I'm behind since my friends are already in the 30s range! I'm wondering if I should go back to rogue or try yet another class (maybe priest?)
---
It's the correct answer 99% of times people ask the question "What UI is that?"
---
Ogres are good because they have a unique drop table of Ogre loot + the normal green ones. For example there's some -intellect loot unique to ogres. Because they dumb. This stuff vendors for a decent amount, and some of it is good to sell on the AH(I got some hands with +3 strength and +16 AP req lvl 26 which were very good for a warrior)
---
At level 31 there's some good ones at the very south of duskwood, just east to of the road to STV. I play alliance so I don't know of any horde alternatives. They're level 25-30 (mostly 27-30) which is perfect as a warrior since you prefer to kill stuff that is your level or slightly below because of improved hit chance.
---
Then there's some Ogres in the center of Arathi Highlands. I think they're level 31-34. 
---
And lastly there's Alterac Mountains where they're level 34-37. 
---
The gorillas are Jungle Thunderers and they're in the center north of STV and they're level 37-38. They drop a fuckton of trashloot that sells for a lot to vendors and a lot of "of the monkey" gear which is desirable for rogues and hunters.
---
There's also the Mistvale gorillas in STV but I didn't kill any of them, I'm sure they drop about the same stuff as the thunderers though, just at a slightly worse rate since they're lower level.
---
You'll get like 6 stacks of Silk Cloth each level from the ogres which you can sell on the auctionhouse (50s per stack on my server), probably 5-7 green items which you can also sell + maybe 1,5 silver from each kill, and then some gray stuff to vendor on top of that. I'd say I got just below 10 gold per level in my early 30s and now in my late 30s over 25 gold per level. 
---
Decent xp too as long as you upgrade you gear (so you can kill stuff quickly) from the AH which is very cheap due to how many greens people sell atm.
---
As for bag space all of these areas are a few minutes of walking from the nearest vendor, most stuff is vendor trash anyway. Get a bank alt and send any greens and cloths to them.
---
Pray that these free transfers allow PvE to PvP switch, that’s all I got
---
Gingers are safe!
---
Your best option in phase 1 is ask a guildmate for an invite to change your layer.  Then you wont be camped.
---
You’ll never get to group with him, at least. You should thank him.
---
This. I mean, it's been a week. 
---
We have *months* until pvp actually yields gains. Get into  PVP Server NOW OP
---
I don’t believe that.
---
Is that an addon?
---
Going to STV *at* 30 is going to be rough, especially if you’re by yourself; you’re going to struggle to kill everything and are going to ganked out of your mind.  If you’re in a group, it’s not as bad, but you’re still in danger of getting jumped by the tons of people that are there.  
---
I would suggest getting a lvl or 2 from dungeons like Gnomer, SM GY, or RFK before heading into STV.   Desolace is another decent spot that isn’t *as* bad as STV is atm.
---
Kalimdor, top right of tanaris, the humans. EK maybe hinterlands?
---
36 now, tanking SM for the grind. This’ll be my third 60 ‘ classic vanilla’ warrior.
---
I just don’t have it in me anymore to no life. I will get 60 and tank and reach my goals but at a slower pace. The class is fun, classic tanking is fun. 
---
To all my warrior brothers and sisters out there, keep up the good fight.
---
Template Time!
---
Edit the post then to add a clarification
---
Shouldn’t that lil turd be playing Fortnite?
---
This is what we get with freedom in an uncaring world. I wouldn’t have it any other way.
---
But boromir gets killed by orcs in the movie! D:
---
Raptors are aggressive dickheads though. Kodos are friendly unless you fuck with them.
---
We don't know yet. Blizzard is going to figure it out over the next months. 2 months would be too short imo, we have 6 phases and vanilla lasted 2 years originally. 3 months each minimum, imo.
---
It's true. I love when idiots say they're blocking me on Reddit.
---
Oh so now I get to refute the dumb things you say, and you won't reply back in your defense? Likewise you'll never lobby dumb arguments on my comments?
---
Sounds great!
---
The wow economy will recorrect itself over time after layering is removed. Chill out.
---
Lol I actually have no clue.  I just saw posts about it.
---
I started at 22-23 in hillsbrad.went to 27 there and did some quest to 30.Now I’m doing SM farm runs.
---
Not as much as you'd think. I've had the ps4 running off it too once or twice. But, you couldn't do it everyday.
---
This site claims slam is better than HS when your 2h is slower than 2 seconds.
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Slam
---
There's also the slam rotation they mention there, not sure how applicable it is to classic vs pserver.
---
well you probably got a decent bank on lvl 30 (+-  10-15g) which you can use to boost up your new mage so leveling goes even easier / faster.
---
Having a nemesis is my favorite thing. I was a hunter on northdale and this fucking paladin and I were roughly the same levels in the same zones for literally days. Some levels I won, some levels he won. but in the end...I will always hate you &lt;3.
---
If you're getting killed fast enough you cant build up that much rage you're doing something wrong
---
Lol I'm omw to bfd  in bigglesworth. My group is there watching some horde guard it
---
In Eve, everything is balanced upon two things.  1.  Not whining when someone uses game mechanics.  2.  Your reputation as a player.
---
I could have told the group what he did, but it's likely that no one would care.  I could have let him lose a 4 billion isk ship in return for stealing a 50 million isk Microwarpdrive; but MY reputation would have suffered worse.  
---
I was already in a group making many times that per hour, each.
---
Think of it like this.  A Warrior on the way up to 60 steals a chest from you, then links a blue item that has a decent value on the Auction house.
---
Lvl 60, you find yourself in the same guild as them, and you're their healer for an MC run.  You're now on Sulfuron, so pretty much all tanks who can tank...  are busy.
---
You can deliberately let them die, and risk someone going through healing logs to find out there was a massive gap where you just weren't doing shit anything (effectively let them die) and the resultant raid wipe is on you...  Or, you can simply remind them of that time while doing what you effectively signed on to do.
---
Except STV has a literal arena.
---
Never had that issue, even above my level, try getting all mail
---
Im deadkevin btw c: almost lv 36 now though lol
---
Yeesh.  What a fucking toolbag.  Nice job keeping your cool.
---
No arenas in classic, that’s a BC thing.
---
You'd have to lay down for a minute.
---
15-20 geared people can easily clear molten core with a bunch of paying low geared people. Trust me it won't take long for that to appear in trade chat. I mean onyxia was 5 manned back then.
---
What server are you playing on where you get queues still? I haven't seen one in almost a week
---
I'm wondering if making layers continent wide was a mistake. Would it have been too much server load to make layering zone specific? So if there aren't enough players in high level zones to spawn a 2nd layer this never would have been a problem?
---
About 3/4 of the servers say high population. I haven't had any trouble finding people to do quests with.
---
If it isn't fun change now while its early
---
Hunter's have a deadzone in vanilla. A good caster will always be in your dead zone so you cant cast viper and other shit.
---
(aka i would frost nova you , frostbolt you in your deadzone)
---
&gt;force Blizzard to deal with server hogs.
---
Ah so you finally do realize that it is Blizzard who is at fault here ?
---
As they say, Nightelf is the fastest warrior leveling race because of the increased movement speed in spirit form.
---
If my friends and I start at three different races (Undead, Tauren, Orc). When would we meet up and begin questing in the same place if we stay on our natural quest progression? 
---
I have never done anything really in Silverpine Forrest and beyond on undead side because I always end up running to the Barrons to meet friends. 
---
If none of us choose to make the run to change quest lines when will we naturally end up in the same area?
---
Fucking alliance
---
Please do a video of you setting this controller layout!!!
---
Why would you follow em.. I want to have fun and following a dude like "assmangawd" is pretty stupid, besides for the LOLs when he says something stupid...
---
I have significant reason to believe this image is fake.
---
1. The same thread references an addon that utilizes `/who` results to distinguish between different players' layers. **The results of `/who` do not change after changing layers. I have confirmed this myself.**
---
2. The screenshot is oh so conveniently cropped -- probably to avoid things such as a keyring in the UI giving away the fact that this is a private server, or some other dead giveaway that this is not classic.
---
Factions are roughly the same on most servers.
---
Alliance zones look better and they have sexier characters.
---
In classic we're back to paladins being alliance only and shamans being horde only.
---
Can you not read
---
This still happens.
---
I honestly never knew how to level healers until now holy cow
---
If you've grinded for the better part of 30-37 on beasts and have skinning and are supposedly getting good drops from them and you're not even halway to a mount you're doing something really wrong.
---
Wont be long. I got a few awesome names aswell:)
---
I like capital cities that didn't get captured
---
Good luck in PvP against warlock with hunter 🤷‍♂️
---
You must hate the letter H. I understand.
---
Medihv and Khadgar.
---
You can buy mounts from other race vendors too.
---
They did however not want you to miss out on that full days waiting, which is why they grossly overpopulated every realm beyond playability and gave you that full day queue instead of install! You can thank them whenever.
---
That's not how layering works.... Layering doesn't affect queue size. At leaks know what you're talking about before sounding like a moron.
---
Can’t tell if you’re joking.  My experience tanking thus far has lead me to believe that the DPS and healers don’t understand how tanking works at all.  My taunt resists, my AOE is a lot less than a DPS, so if they start multi-DOTing or anything it becomes a whack-a-mole game with taunting on CD.  It’s pretty awful honestly, wondering if it gets better at higher levels.

What a waste... It's on a druid... Would have been better on a priest!
---
Wataru??? Watarthose!!!
---
For completely normal mob pulls? I would. But ideally, you save bloodrage for normal mob pulls, as that is also aoe threat. 
---
If there are elites in there, you likely want 1-2 demos just so that the first blizzard doesn't drop 4 mobs on the mage, and then you start revenging elite mobs whenever it's up and spending extra rage on sunders, so as the normal mobs die you are still building lasting threat on the elites or bosses.
---
I got Bonebiter earlier today at level 37 and thought it was now easy street all the way to at least 50, if not closer to 60
---
Tried to kill the demons in southern Desolace (same level as me) pulled two to Sweeping Strikes them down and I died in like 25 seconds, I got parried/missed like 10 times. This shit is BRUTAL
---
I haven't played around with any script for the view distance of nameplates, but I would like to get them to show up at least at my max spellcasting range - as a warlock I use KUI with auras above the nameplates to see what dots are on the target. It'd be nice to be able to sit at the max distance instead of having to move closer just to get kui to load the plates.
---
regret is for chumps
---
the only thing i regret is having boneitis.
---
you cant dwell on what might be only on what is.
---
Is this Kromcrush? Horde outnumbers us 10:1
---
"He didn't spoonfeed me even though I clearly demanded it. I now demand this commoner to be whipped!"
---
Yes, you've summed up this subreddit quite well.
---
Holy shit your bare are empty..
---
It's the all powerful inverted bowlcut!
---
You'll be quicker the second time
---
easy killer, he already admitted to being a newbie
---
sorry to ask if this was already answered but, which remote software are you using?
---
Found the retail developer
---
Nothing you can really do except tough it out. Higher you get the more people are paying attention. Low levels still hold a lot of the “new” players and people from retail who think their raider io translates to this. Theyll be gone soon.
---
Unfulfilling is the name of the game, hence why I bailed from retail last year
---
I just hope classic holds me when the nostalgia inevitably wears off
---
Looks like meat is back on the menu!
---
I do it from behind not because I enjoy it. It's to assert dominance
---
Did we find out what server? I will join you cause! Death to Gnomes!
---
Yeah just read it again and realize that you are still delusional,sorry.
---
If you put the 5 points in wand for leveling then respec at 40 to get shadow form it’s a 25% damage increase to shadow. I was like holy shit.
---
oh jolly good ive yet to ever see this joke a million times!
---
They were about to quit anyway.  This is just a handy excuse so they didn't have to admit "they thought they did but they didn't"
---
Okay, this makes me curious, is the staff still around in Modern WoW? This is somehow the first time I've ever heard of it, and I've always been a fan of quirky items. 0_0
---
Yeah, it's weird hearing these perspectives because as a Horde player on a PvP server, I have been getting fucking annihilated by groups of Alliance in basically every contested zone. I'm writing this right now while waiting 4 more minutes on my respawn timer, because multiple groups of Alliance have camped me while trying to do the intro tiger/panther quests in STV. I've been at it for probably an hour at this point and am halfway through both of them.
---
It's never solo Alliance, always groups of 3+ roaming around and stomping anyone they see. I definitely know that it isn't just Alliance who do this, but I always get a little irked when people (usually Alliance players) say "playing Horde on a PvP server is easy mode".
---
Come tell that to the hunter and two warlocks who are all 2 levels above me and circling around my body right now as I wait for my respawn timer to tick down, maybe they'll leave me alone.
---
Just hit 32 yesterday and I got 20g. Then I bought skills and bought new profession levels and I was again down to 10g.
---
It doesn't "bother" me. I'm responding to you because we're having a conversation.
---
Couple of questions. When you are healing that party are you healing them to full? Are you waiting 5 seconds for Mana to tick during combat ( also known as MP5). When you cancel your drink is it because someone is going to die?
---
My uncle used to say, "shove this right back in where your poop came from"
---
Alliance should be a bit better, because paladins have a better raidperformance than shamans (my opinion). I don't think that'll make a big difference.
---
Pretty easy to get it to work with Remotr, but it would be great if Blizzard released a solid mobileversion.
---
I was just in menethil at lvl 29 for my warrior quest as horde and had some fun times thought. Got the allies on the road to Arathi so they were all around my level
---
In the next phase they will release the honor system where you can rank up and get rewards. For now it’s just for fun.
---
ive literally designed my life around knowing all i want to do is play video games for the rest of my life.
---
Please just remember to hydrate yourself, eat proper food that isn't processed and exercise. General well-being is very important and I'd throw in checking on your family too! I miss mine..
---
I mean, 3-7 minutes of walking every 1-2 hours is negligible. Especially with good use of your hearthstone.
---
... this will lead to ' when you finally hit 250 herbalism and STILL see stupid Kingsblood.....
---
I got 10-15 minutes without seeing an alliance player on Kromcrush but I see TONS of horde at all times in every zone i've tried at 33. I travel in a team because it's the only way to not get chain ganked.
---
HAACH
---
BBUUHH
---
HHGGH
---
He said he has played with bad tanks and you started defending yourself. Sounds like you think you're a bad tank.
---
kids or job?
---
I need to try this
---
TBH I wanted to make the meme fast and hunting down a NPC high elf/blood elf in retail that also existed in vanilla sounded time consuming... whereas logging onto my pally with her fancy heritage set took basically 0 time.
---
Right now average player level based on wowhead data gathering is around 42ish.  When I plugged that data into Stata I found the Standard deviation is 4 levels. Median is 43
---
That's my secret cap. I always pick up weapon drops.
---
&gt;fully feeds a lvl 40 gorilla with one cast

I'll tell you what you won't do: find a group ever again.

Blood Pact helps created the large Horse community.
---
IS THIS AN OUT-OF-SEASON APRIL'S FOOLS JOKE?
---
thx this is great
---
this doesnt really have anything to do with classic (as i recall, the skill ill be talking bout was released in tbc)
---
but in the later expansions, when fighting a warrior if he managed to get you really really low you could nova him, then fake going for a shatter combo to force his spell reflect, then apply ice barrier and poly yourself via his reflect.
---
this would give you full health and the ice barrier made it so when he did connect on to you (as you literally just cc'd yourself), you had a cushion to get away unscathed. (some warrior's would macro it so they could 1 button apply and remove the spell reflect buff, but with high enough haste, another stat im dont think is in this version of the game, you could get the cast down to less then a second and easily get that poly onto yourself)
---
now obviously this doesnt meet the posts original requirements of ways to help the enemy faction, but ive always loved this interaction.
---
sadly, alot of the cooler skills the various spec's had dont exist in classic. which can be a bit of a bummer.
---
i knew going in, id never get ice lance or deep freeze but i still feel sad i wont get to use them :(
---
&gt;one and only tank spec
---
Correct me if I’m wrong, but I was under the impression that:
---
a) Warriors can tank 5-mans in just about any spec, and
---
b) Druids, Paladins, and even (with a bit more skill and patience) Shamans can tank 5-mans
---
I'd tap that.
---
there are a fuckload of people who got to like level 6 and then logged out and have been in queue ever since
---
everyone is all over the place
---
I don't get it
---
I'm level 37 and only have 30 gold. How can I focus on making money to get my mount? Should I just keep leveling normally and ignore getting my mount until I naturally have enough money? 
---
I'm level 170ish in enchanting and tailoring if that helps. Also Horde.
---
Game is free with a subscription yes. The PvP in classic wow is why I play. And I’m playing a Druid currently. Leveling is decently easy, pvp is super fun, though with Druid it’s a slow skillful battle. You don’t just bowl over other classes. You whittle them down. 
---
Priest is a solid choice as well, but leveling solo is forsure slower.
---
Horde all the way
---
I have a tortie to, she thinks the space between me and the keyboard is heaven on earth. Anytime a healer can't save someone from stupid I can only assume their cat stretched and jumped the  cast XD.
---
LVL 35. My leveling spree has halted tremendously since going back to work, going to gym at night and being a social human being again. 
---
There is that little itch at the back of my head telling me to delete all social media, quit my job, buy cans of baked beans and never leave my desk though...
---
There is a compare addon.
---
edit: https://legacy-wow.com/classic-addons/moncai-equipment-compare-classic/
---
Personally I'm hoping that they split off into some kind of alternative splinter timeline and create a totally new expansion after classic that keeps with the same style and gameplay... Could be because of chromies temporal discombobulator went wrong and sent us all to a different timeline?! Right now though I'm super happy we have got to go back home and will enjoy this for a long time to come 😊
---
Yes, just the montly fee
---
In general PvP servers tend to lean towards horde and RP servers lean towards Allies.
---
Horde side tends to have a shortage of priests. Druid when you roll alliance because you could fill whatever slot in a party, extremely handy in classic (but you can't switch between builds too easily)
---
Some top tier bullshit here.
---
The real hero, right here.
---
Downvote the shit out of it
---
I’ve actually done this and been told it was in my bag. Shame.
---
Better hope it doesn't start downloading an update in the background 😂 I was playing on my Pixelbook while tethered today. I found it quite bizarre.
---
Troll&gt;UD for horde
---
This game came out in end of 2004
---
We must remember that for its time this game was the best looking online PC game anyone could get for a number of years.
---
This game to me was like Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time on the Nintendo 64. The graphics for its time was a huge jump from the next best predecessor.
---
They didn't stop.
---
The image literally says 10% droprate
---
Where are you getting 4% from?
---
Should tag this as humour before someone misreads your intent and thinks it's a cheating accusation.
---
Day 3 is a lot different from day 9 though.
---
You're generalizing. I'm on a pvp server and alliance are every where. I don't think I've had a single fair 1v1 yet. Either they wait until I'm low and in combat, or until they're more than one.
---
/hug
---
How is bloodrage aoe threat if you dont mind me asking?
---
Beat it started playing in my mind before I clicked the link
---
man why you acting like classic raids are difficult?
---
When I can **comfortably**, I do heal to full.  Yeah, the 5 second rule has become my life. Yes.
---
Unrelated to Wow, but I just want to say Technical Writing is seriously the most zen profession I've ever experienced.  I'm a project manager at a tech company and currently in between projects so I asked the tech writers if they needed some help.  It's been the most peaceful 2 weeks I've had at the company in the past 10 years.  It's seriously a lot like creating a piece of art.  Then again, I also get nostalgic for QCing code and jump in to help out my team from time to time when I need to relax so maybe my mind works a bit differently lol.
---
Zygor
---
I LOVE fishing in classic wow. I’ve really missed it. I can’t wait for the STV fishing contest, whenever that is!
---
Cool, thanks for the update.
---
IMO it's more like these resources belong to everyone and everyone can farm these resources if they have the ability.
---
But I guess that's classic, there's tons of ways to play.
---
WoW mobile coming Winter 2017
---
They are one and of the same.
---
One cast gives 5 pieces of bread.
---
Not necessarily. You could use that 40s for purchases that increase your overall gold generation. Like if you bought cheap mats now or positioned yourself for better farming later that 40s investment now can turn into tens or hundreds of gold later.
---
sweet thanks for the response
---
but ughhh but i want rp and pvp. is there still rp on the horde?
---
Bear form bash is essential against rogues, as someone who's 2 mains back in vanilla were a druid and a rogue, if your bash doesnt connect and allow you to get the full heal off, you're probably dead.
---
Me, another gnome warlock :
---
*Chuckles* I'm in danger.
---
ah, sneaky...
---
Have a read through this https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warrior-leveling-classic-wow
---
Just curious. Is the general consensus of priests to power word shield straight away? I ask priests to let me generate some rage first otherwise even with blood generating rage or charge it's not enough Vs multiple targets to keep aggro
---
Stick with druid. It gets really great at 20 with cat form and feline swiftness. Also you don't get swipe till 16 or 18 i think so right now bear is not much besides some ~xtra ap and armor
---
How do I do this
---
Where can i find that?
---
Dammnit and I thought my orange boar named angrycheeto was a decent name, you have won the name game have an upvote.
---
If WoW Classic hits mobile I will probably get fired within a week. And be single again too. 
---
Time enough for maxing those secondary professions tho.
---
It's too bad that it's warrior-specific.
---
Please don't tank with a Shaman.
---
Can you show us a screenshot?
---
Make sure you're opening classic wow.
---
Engineering Gnomish Mindcontrol Cap
---
Check the top left corner of your screen, it crammed my tooltip and arrow behind my nameplate
---
omgggggg no way!!!\~
---
thanks for the response!
---
tbh tho i only started playing during BC
---
how is pvp different in classic?
---
Engineering is a lifesaver. Make some target dummies and they'll save your ass time and time again.
---
Try to actively find  it create a grp of your own. Only lfg often leads to no invite. Try to write down what you need. Lf heal 2dps or smthg like that.
---
Fairbanks still gets large multi-thousand queues in the evenings.
---
I wonder if server type plays in to it as well. Dunno what Kromcrush is, but I'm on an RPPvP server and those may tend to skew more towards Alliance than a normal PvP server would.
---
Starting him off with a rather difficult class. This kids going places.
---
So... not streamers?
---
Every time.
---
I remember reading about this. 
---
Wow sends super small packets. I watched it and wow only uses around 2kb a second at most! So it's very handy if you have a laptop and want to play on the train or commute!
---
I assume gold farmers don't sit in queues
---
People will tell you that priests have an easy time getting groups, it was true back in vanilla, but in Classic I'm finding it really hard! It seems like priest is too popular and every group I try to join already has a priest.
---
Dagger drops are rough, if you get a quick offhand dagger use it. I’m using daggers now... just got the coldrage dagger... I have sword of omen as my offhand since I’m going sealfate combat because I level with someone basically always .  I’m debating on buying a widow maker from the AH because that dagger alone I could probably use to 60 with there being very few top end daggers as high as that. Life of double daggers are rough. For you, don’t worry much about it, but if you choose a web you would want a faster off hand one for poison application
---
I got one. Accepted it. Don’t know how to leave. Somehow I own the channel now.
---
Its even more fucking annoying that you miss or get parried 25% of the time as well. As a rogue you still generate resource. As a warrior, you sit there with your dick in your hand, waiting to hit the res button. Sometimes on a single mob 2 levels below you.
---
$#%*#%&gt;*#$@&amp;
---
horse? lmao
---
This might be a good read too https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/deadmines-classic-dungeon
---
any idea what the herod stats are:?
---
Chill for sure
---
I had the opposite experience but I went to shimmering flats at 34 a week ago with 2 friends. That was some wholesale murder.
---
First off, no ones mad (except probably you). Secondly, you do not have control over what your brain does. That is literally science. Read a book or look up what happens when people try to multi task while listening to a lecture. It's distracting to other people. It's inconsiderate. It's not right.
---
And you say I should grow up. Laughable how backwards you are.
---
My captain! My KING
---
If it wasn't in Vanilla, it won't be in Classic.
---
I need to go fetch so I can cook and fish to 225. Is it worth it if I'm only level 20 still?
---
Or he confused a dwarf priest with a gnome warlock. That Horde hunter seems to be looting whole pirate ship worth of rum lately.
---
Adding the paragon levels is what made me quit D3. That and the broken real money auctions.
---
Thanks friend, I will definitely play the human side as well. Thinking of a paladin.
---
Do you think DF would be fine if it was server only and not cross server? Just used as a tool to make getting parties together easier? Or is just the whole idea of it?
---
Oh god, getting killed while escort is the worse.
---
that actually makes you stupid
---
Nah not going to happen. We‘re full in the evenings and high at most other times of the day. I think we’ll be just fine in three months. :)
---
The info is from anyone that runs census on a queued realm can easily see that current Classic cap is 15k, and that we know from interviews Blizzard's aim is to recreate 2005 vanilla's 3.5k cap or close to it.
---
no
---
Blizzard is already thinking ahead, they know they will be releasing more classic servers several years in the future, and I fully expect many players to be playing and replaying those. Bringing paragon levels Wilburn players out on classic content even more.
---
then a rogue can heal with bandages, you're just bad and take avoidable damage.  
---
&gt;Shit I held threat tanking Herod as a level 36 ret paladin  
---
cool, put that in your diary but we're talkin about aoe threat
---
When getting a wand upgrade always keep the one you have been using (unless its the same damage type). Learned that the hard way.
---
Within the first 24 hours we were in SFK.  Does launch day end at midnight or when you finally sleep?  Hahah
---
You’ve made it past the worst of it now! Warriors are a lot more hands on than mages are! Grind on through! Get that ravager and mortal strike!
---
Ouch. Next time /lick or /kiss if you are a nice person :p
---
salty
---
Whats your blacklist number ?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBlackList/
---
Oh I would be all over that like a rash
---
Paragon levels has a real bad stigma associated with it depending on the person.
---
For an example of a good "paragon" system, look at what GW2 does. The level cap is always the same, each expansion adds a gimmick, any XP you get goes towards a specific talent within the 'mastery' tree, these can be buffs to the gimmick of the expansion or other passive abilities.
---
I'm trying to succinctly explain the system but I think it's really great and I wish WoW took a similar route but I have a hard time figuring out what Blizzard could do to emulate it. 
---
ESO also has a paragon system called Champion points with guardian constellations you place points into after you reach level cap, this system is a little more similar to Diablo's paragon system (I believe - I never reached cap).
---
Depends if they're horde or ally
---
You're sitting at a machine fully capable of taking flawless captures of its screen, ya know?
---
Dumbass didn’t have a backup firearm.
---
In this thread: Posts that aged poorly
---
You can't say you're a hardcore pvper until you've been corpse camped by a night elf hunter who just sits invisible by your corpse waiting for you to respawn.  Gnomes and N-elf hunters are KOS.
---
We are old now man, its vyvanse
---
Why have respect for Knights, when my potions can do anything you can?
---
[This](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/training.php) should help you out. Short answer, pet trainers, and taming beasts in the wild that know the skill. Good luck!
---
Best life advice. Find a girl with her own interests. If she depends on you to have a good time, your both likely gonna have a bad time.
---
There is open thought about re-releasing BC and WLK, yes, but absolute new content that's never been a thing, not even in Retail, is not part of the original experience. Dungeon/Raid gear content is indication of progress beyond max level.
---
I never understood why they didnt just add a combination of those 2 tiers where you place 10 points in talents between the other tier where you pick an ability.
---
You won't regret it friend. It is lonely up to level 10, but once you have the ability to tame a pet, the game opens up in all sorts of possibilities. Most never available for hunters after Cataclysm.
---
Hunters have low skill floor and really high skill ceiling. Hunters are very hard when played correctly!!
---
Wait, the tooltip for cleave rank 1 states:
---
"A sweeping attack that does your weapon damage plus 5 to the target and his nearest ally." 
---
So based on the tooltip it only hits the primary plus one other target. So anything beyond two wont show any gains.
---
Hillsbrad, Arathi, Stonetalon, Desolace. 
---
Also you should probably grind 2-3 levels every 10 levels, I do it all the time and it's helped a lot. Also gets me that cash money for the mount!
---
Carasson dude you're really finding a way to feel offended, guy hasn't played WoW in a decade, let him put his nostalgic thoughts into words.. jeez.
---
You are doing god's work my friend.
---
Really reliable when tanking to apply threat to a large group
---
Dumbass. You get arrested for stealing a candy bar. I (the tank) will kick your ass from the group so quickly you'll feel it in retail.
---
I mean that's loosely explaining D3 system, it's absolutely an advantage but you're just explaining the fairly irrelevant mechanic of it.
---
I'm not fucking leaving! Im not fucking leaving! Im not fucking leaving!
---
How about waiting till layering gets removed one by one, not inviting any person that asks for layer swap and the most simple of all just don't care about the whole thing at all just enjoy your own experience ?
---
if you think healers grind slow  you havent experienced my suicidal tendicies while playing warrior.
---
Of course they will really have no way of knowing you are putting them on ignore. I mean unless you tell them beforehand you are putting them on ignore because they did not help you, and that kind of makes you an a****** also.
---
Normally when I do this it’s for strings of big AoE pulls, where my mages/warlocks have to drink or tap up before the next pull and I lose my rage anyway. Chain pulling though yeah, agreed. I’ll enrage between packs too to keep that rage high
---
What? I was the tank (warr was too low a level to even hit Herod). And no one mentioned aoe threat (which prot spec paladins excel at) till your post so pit down the edge before you cut yourself.
---
As a tank to other tanks. We are in charge of the group. We must mark skull and cc targets. We must watch the healers mana. Tanks are the group leader, manage the group or pick a new role.
---
Character Notes is one, Whelp is another.
---
I'm a simple man. I see a phone pic of a computer screen, I downvote it.
---
Unused is slightly strong. I remember using it in BC specifically when you needed to fill a specific class in 5 mans (or more often a specific role, tank/heals obviously) But it definitely wasn’t the primary way to assemble a group and was almost never used in looking for raids to the point that it was pretty much a joke in itself when one used it to look for a raid.
---
Would be a bandaid fix yeah, not sure if it causes unnecessary stress on their servers tho
---
The alterac vendor is 15 seconds of walking, they're in the area. There's a goblin who sells engineering supplies in a cave really close by.
---
The Duskwood ogre vendor is very close too, just walk to the northern stv camp. It's maybe 90 seconds of walking.
---
The Arathi vendor is in Refuge Pointe. That's maybe 1 min of walking.
---
Honestly, all of these vendors are really close by. Maybe the furthest you'd have to walk is killing the gorillas in STV but even then that's only like 2 minutes too
---
I've always picked horde because I liked the racial abilities more. (IMO most of them are better than alliance.) And for vanilla I wanted to play shaman. 
---
Pally is probably my favorite but they didn't really shine until WotLK with the use of beacon. Plus they didnt get a taunt until BC I think. Then, at least for BC, getting into a raid as holy was difficult if they already had one.
---
Thx
---
It's pretty hard to make gold out of the auction house now, since everyone and their mom are saving up for the mount themselfes. 
---
Go out and farm humanoids. There's always a decent price for cloth.
---
Let's introduce you to this wonderful idea of having P R I N C I P L E S.
---
I'd say each of you do your respective starting areas till level 5 then you should have no problem meeting up and doing the same quests for the rest of the zone (durotar, mulgore, tirisfal) then eventually I'm sure all 3 of you will make your way to the barrens and it will all be pretty smooth from that point on.
---
There’s a troll on the dock of shadow prey village desolace that gives it. Gives maybe 8-10g an hour but it seems more crowded now so you might not get that much.
---
I know of one such addon, and it's called vanaskos. It's also nicely coupled with Spy, imo.
---
Was doing SM cath yesterday and the group was absolutely fantastic, the tank was superb, the priest Healer had some serious +healing for lvl 39 and we were clearing the dungeon in around 20 minutes, so we ran it a couple times. The first run Triune Amulet drops. The 38 enha shaman says he is going to switch to elemental at 40 and rolls on the amulet, winning it. Sure, whatever, this was quick and we're doing it again, so even if us 2 locks and the priest also needed on it, it's no biggie.  
---
The next run, the mail legs drop, the tank needs em, but lo and behold, here comes the shammy rolling on it too, again winning it. The tank just says "how about that elemental man?" but leaves it at that.  
---
Next run some random green +int +spi ring drops, the priest needs it, and so does the shaman. At least the priest won this time. A few mobs later some +str +agi leather gloves drop and... Yep, you guessed it, here comes the shaman with the need roll! 
---
Finally the 2h mace drops from Mograine, the tank doesn't need it, he has a WW axe in his bag, so whatever if the shaman needs it. But the chapeau hat also dropped and there's the shaman also needing on it. Luckily he didn't win that. The shaman goes "k I'm done" and HS out and leave group. The rest of just stand there going "wow, dude, now after 4 or 5 runs needing on fucking everything you're done?" 
---
I expect to see the shaman still being enhancement if I ever come across him again later on. Fuck that guy.
---
Don’t they do it in classic? I forgot those existed, super fun
---
Aye I feel ya, enchanting and engineering are the two profs that make you spend money before you start earning. But damn it's worth it in the end.

Unless you're Scrooge McDuck you won't have your mount at 40, most players didn't even get the epic mount..

And op is specifically referencing the raid bug.

No consecration, no aoe build. Try again.
---
You're a piece of shit and Classic will weed you out as time goes on.
---
Thank you for this. I have just started leveling a paladin and was begging to worry as my group of friends needed a tank. I’m at 16 rn and we only really plan to do dungeons right now. So after reading this I think and hope I can be a good tank for that. Also if you have any suggestions about what to spec for leveling ,what weapons to level and when I need to respec and what not I would really appreciate it.
---
Where do you see spy addon composites?
---
Can't remember the message, but I have one that says "love your mom". Just about the only one I spam
---
Every person has a different point at which they think Warcraft was ruined. And for many people that point depends on when they first started playing and how long they have been playing. There will be fans who are excited for each expansion.
---
I'm at that weird level range of low 40s where spellpower starts showing up more often on gear but at the cost of stats. So I was wondering, for a spriest, is it typically better to go spellpower at the cost of spirit / int? One example would be my +6spirit +5int gloves vs + 15spellpower mageweave gloves. I know spirit tap makes spirit a bit more valuable than other classes, but does it overtake spellpower? 
---
Thanks much.
---
You shouldn't have to drink much as a feral
---
That was the joke I guess xd
---
let's go back in time before you started posting useless shit
---
&gt;My taunt resists, my AOE is a lot less than a DPS, so if they start multi-DOTing or anything it becomes a whack-a-mole game with taunting on CD. It’s pretty awful honestly, wondering if it gets better at higher levels.
---
"And no one mentioned aoe threat" go clean a toilet you janitor
---
Heh, more like Boarragnarok.
---
I made one tonight and got to level 10.  So much fun!  Plan on getting a bear tomorrow night 😊

I helped a friend get his Whirlwind Axe at level 33....
---
I’ve won 1 duel since

What's the point in even playing? The economy is such a huge part of the game. I'm seriously thinking of just quitting now before I invest anymore time in it. Less painful to walk away now than later.

---
Shamans are fine for tanking five mans, you just need to be careful and patient.
---
Good choice, Paladins are tied to the Human story by direct nature- almost all the early quests are about beleaguered regions seeking aid, and someone to defend them. 
---
Following that all the way through to uncover exactly what's going on with the Black Dragonflight, understanding the full extent of the events they've manipulated, and then taking the fight to them is some good shit.
---
Yeah and with the dynamic respawns?  Good luck.  There are areas you just can't clear to because your kill speed can't outspeed the respawns.
---
Yeah, I know there is decent hunters out there, just like there is decent players of all classes. But especially when it comes to hunter I usually just assume they are a retard until proven otherwise. Saves me the frustration when they do fuck up...
---
As all things should be
---
There is an addon for that on curseforged that is called spy that can do that. How many times you seen them how many times you fought theoretically. I never used it so idk but the description said that
---
I’m thoroughly enjoying my warlock. Never been into the evil aspect of the class fantasy. I like to think of my self as a once dark student of magic turned to the light and now uses his demons and curses for good! The utility set is just crazy so many ways to survive a fight. Really just a class in it’s on category.
---
Also so much damage, they are sundered by debuff limit in raids but on dungeon bosses and elite and mobs the damage is insane.
---
Such a game changer. I work in IT and had no idea that command existed - always used snipping tool..

I've seen a shadow priest tank Scholomance.

Thanks very much.

Smoke alarm are for sleeping people.
---
What the hell lol that’s a weird guy for sure. If anything he’s probably going to end up on more blacklists than you
---
Im going to read them know, thank you for the help
---
Ty :). But in the thread itself they say threat isn't a problem if you follow the standard rules. So I'm not too worried :)
---
I say!
---
What did you draw this with? It's amazing!
---
Stormrage US represent! I think it was 10 Alliance to 1 Horde by BC
---
I played for a few years from launch to the lich king. Then I came back and played for a few months with warlords of dreanor. Didn't even know there was a starter edition.
---
Which is really annoying since as a warrior you want to charge in headon and beat face.
---
Seeing as there's no active API for auction house data I'm going to assume there's no active API for any of what you listed.
---
I used to ride the boats around and mind control people off into the deep water where fatigue would claim them. Lots of "Fuck pvp servers" in the comments, but this kind of stuff is what classic was for me
---
This was norm and moreso than it is in retail now tbh, we also had gold pot runs in wotlk which were a dream for a well geared player with plenty of time and no need for uld25 or ToC 25
---
You will, but I won't see you because there are no microscopes ingame.
---
This would just make it easier to abuse lol.
---
Not a tank but if someone left out the a between we're and good I would distance myself from that group too
---
I feel more sorry for the healer when everyone just runs in.
---
Gonna save this post, this is happening to me as a troll shaman. You say the only addon you have is a DPS meter, is it Details? I have it too and it was giving me issues before.
---
Side note, especially when I group up with people, I hear the sound it makes when you switch tabs in the talent menu even when I don't have the menu up. Every few minutes or so that sound triggers.
---
Would love an update if you figure this out, it's been driving me crazy!
---
I'd wear that on a warrior. Agi gives crit and Spirit is super useful while leveling.
---
Other day we kicked a guy from SM lib runs. He was lvl 38 and pulling less dps somehow than our lvl 32 tank. After a while of not really paying attention, our rogue is arguing over a bracers upgrade of agi/stam leather. Turns out the warrior was needing everything basically. We tried to explain gearing, but he became hostile and basically told us all we suck. I kicked him from the group and moved on. Today he PMs me multiple times (with me on his ignore, so cant respond) that ive now been blacklisted on the server and no one will run with me 😂
---
But numbers shouldn't be wrong when you have a reference client guiding you.
---
If you are already level 60, you are a freak of nature, and should be locked away somewhere.
---
Soo, what is the Norwegian server? 
---
Im on Firemaw, and im scared! :P
---
No changes and please no
---
can NE hunters still charge up aimed in shadowmeld? that used to be fun (for me) back in the day when out of nowhere you get tapped for third of your health.
---
Down that path lies class homogenisation.  You don't want to go there.
---
Or perhaps you do, in which case I suggest retail.
---
What about boomkins.
---
Cat/feral form is very similar to playing a rogue, down to the combo point system. 
---
But druids are a lot of fun though. I like healing as a druid.
---
yeah here it is  
---
\#showtooltip Charge  
---
/cast Charge  
---
/cast Rend  
---
/startattack  
---
this will make it so if you're not in combat it'll charge, if you are in combat it'll rend, and when you charge/rend it will start autoattacking.
---
So if you double press it you'll charge, then rend then start swinging.
---
EDIT: Formatting
---
its all about the value applied with anything.  Demo is a flat value applied to all enemies in the area.  Battle shout is the same except since the party is each receiving the value, it become additive.  so that 60~ ap * 5 + pets becomes +300 threat x def stance multiplier.  
---
*just using a low level value to keep it simple*
---
First of all, I never said anything about it being a "disease". Secondly, too much of anything can be a problem. And that's my point. If WoW makes you feel like you don't want to do anything else and quit your job? Well, then that's a problem. Just like if work was all you cared about. Balance is important. And that applies to everything really.
---
This is vanilla+ and things have changed. Blame Khadgar.
---
I stand directly in front of my tank after he pulls. If we get adds, he can see it. If anything aggros me, he can taunt it off. If it's a tough pull I'll soothe and try to split for him with one single wand attack. Otherwise I'm behind him.
---
Lol “no changes” is dead.
---
The numbers weren't wrong, they just wrongly applied to raids.
---
There are some beautiful people in this community :)
---
You realize the human error element is still there when you have to revise code, correct?
---
It’s just a game
---
Wth is the context of that clip lol
---
As a healing paladin - this happens ALL the time. Just had it again in BFD. I tell them before the instance not to chain pull too much. I have a macro that says “DRINK” that I spam when I need to mana up. Do they listen? No - on they go pulling 6 mobs at a time and then blame the Healer. Fuck em
---
I’ll say as well - and I say this to groups. You’ll actually get the instance done quicker and it will be more fun if you go carefully rather than rushing through it and constantly dying and having to corpse run
---
The only thing I dont understand is why you cant comunicate to the other faction... There been a lot of times I wanted to say stuff like, dont worry I wonr attack you, or me saying that I just need a quest there. Coming from other MMORPG this is the most frustrating thing on the pvp here.
---
Just announce your noobness on the way in. "FYI, in case it seems like I don't know exactly what I'm doing, it's my first time here."
---
I think most people are much more forgiving of noobs than of people they think should know better.
---
That's what I've been going with, all set for the gains now woth the confusion out of the way!
---
Honestly, I'll keep that advice in mind thanks!
---
To bad ... if it the Damage is to low without consecration then ill probably just stick with the Ret build :/ 
---
At least that works without constant sip-breaks. Thanks!
---
Given that we dont know what all is in the reference...
---
A lot of people have forgotten about the highly invasive "warden" process scanner they ran years ago  I don't know if they still run it but it was notorious for false positives and resource consumption, not just privacy concerns.

when you're getting ganked, it's time for an instance or 12.

High dps wands should always be priest priority, period. No other class needs a wand the way priests do. Smart players will always let priests have first dibs on wands. 
---
Most players aren't very smart however...
---
Best in slot before taxes is going to be a 1-h + off hand combo. Go for the stats that's the other guy said. Wands are our main weapon. Dot em up and then wand them to death xD
---
That is depressing.

I love mages who attack me when I'm questing. I can almost always escape, then come back stealthy and almost one-shot that clothie with a lucky crit.

WW is like a lvl 41 green axe.
---
its incredibly powerful at 30.  
---
really good at 35.  
---
pretty average at 40.
---
if he had MS then this axe was not really great anymore.
---
so with going shadow at 40 and getting all these shadow damage buffs, would it be correct to get a shadow damage wand? would it buff the damage of shooting that since its shadow damage?
---
I understand but now you get that uncertainty of like what other numbers are wrong? Like I was stating prior.
---
Only the 50th time this has been posted here.

There are hardware options I guess if you are so maxed out. You have with that current setup what .. about 120'ish shortcuts set? alt, shift, ctrl, some 10'ish mouse bottons, numbers 1-6 combined with macros casting different things with different modifiers and or with mouseover friendly/hostile settings?  I'm a newbie so I cant keep more than a dozen shortcuts in my head. However, if you need more couple of (very expensive) hardware options:
---
* Wooting Two keyboard - its an "analog" keyboard, fully programmable, and you can make your keys do different things depending on how much you press them, say something happens when you bottom out and something other happens when you only tap it, can also run multi key macros. \~160'ish EUR
---
* Swithpoint Z mouse - an "analog" mouse with pressure sensitive keys, built in gyro as possible modifier (tilt left, right as possible modifiers, if thats not enough you can also use custom defined rotation around z axis as additional modifier, say you rotate 25 degrees counter clockwise and your mouse buttons do something different). About 50'ish functions can be assigned with relative comfort. But you really need to put in elbow grease to write custom script for it to do it all. Can also make keys do different things upon press and release and define custom pressure levels to trigger different things for 5 of the buttons.  This is fully hardware based, in mouse built in memory (it has built in memory and small ARM CPU) to avoid triggering anti-cheat stuff in some games. About 230 EUR so only way to spend more on a mouse is to get the gold plated one ;)
---
I mean I agree warrior is doable, I'm on my second one right now. That being said though when you say warrior is a reasonable class to level I feel it implies there is a class or classes that are more difficult to level alone. The simple fact of the matter is that warrior is the hardest class to level alone simply by virtue of having exactly zero utility. Rogue is a distant second IMO, but very distant. 
---
Now if you were to just fanatically instance grind that'd be another case, because you'll be headhunter for SM groups and the like, but solo questing require patience, and areas like STV right now on a PvP server can be incredibly frustrating.
---
its not a bad guide, but i would skip the shield block and just use revenge when it pops.  if you have 2 or more mobs hitting you, you're gonna block anyway.  save the rage for sunder, cleave, hs, shouts, w/e
---
How can I take advantage of these broken wands?
---
so just because i don't continuously remind you that i'm talking about the one tank class that can aoe tank means the conversation has somehow shifted? that's not quite how it works.  
---
just a reminder: we're still talking about aoe threat
---
Trickle down economics bruh
---
I'm horde and did all of shimmering flats today.. stood right next to maybe 10 different alliance and we all just kept in our little spawn circles questing. I dont get the point when we all just wanna level. If I'm attacked okay but just sitting there farming mobs what's the fun in ganking
---
Well not really, it runs off the modern client
---
must be doing something wrong. i was absolutely fine at 25. smite &gt; mindblast &gt; pain &gt; wand until dead
---
As much as I know the sites I listed functioned off of players have an addon and then uploading the data they recorded onto the site. More people in the raid recording increased the accuracy of the data. The Armory features, like seeing gear, functioned in a similar fashion. 
---
But I have no idea how these things work on a deeper level. Was just curious if a system was already in the works/planned.
---

If you were some hot shot like you're acting, 7$ for hours of entertainment wouldn't be a problem for you. You'd be financially smart enough to figure out that it's incredibly lucrative for such a low cost, and you get a huge amount of entertainment out of it. But, sure thing pal.
---
You complain about the sub, you complained about a transfer cost and wanted it to be free. Then you keep saying it isn't about the money. It IS about the money. I'm cheap and careful with my money, but in reality I wipe my ass with 15$. I wipe my ass with 100$. That doesn't mean I throw money away, in fact nobody would guess I have as much money as I do because I live so below my means. However, 15$ a month for hours and hours of entertainment is a steal and a deal you won't get ANYWHERE else.
---
Ha i was just playing BFD yesterday and I had to tell others in my group “lol disarmed you’re going to pull agro”. I’ll take BFD any day over Gnomer though. There’s a bit of a drought between SFK and RFK on horde side that can be spam filled by Stockades runs on alliance so I ended up doing a lot of BFD.
---
I was tanking RFK today though and that place is a shit ton of fun. Mobs aren’t too nasty so you can pull 8-10 of them if you and the healer know what you are doing but also there’s still a lot of interesting stuff to do during the fight with interrupts and killing totems specifically

I had 6 days off. I had around 60g at level 38 just from vendoring drops and questing. Turning silk into bandages and vendoring them, smelting iron and mithril and selling them. I had 78g when I dinged 40 and earned the last 12 by doing 4 SM cath runs with my friends and rolling need on all the drops (their idea), which the boss’s are worth 2g at a minimum.
---
There's a stable master in every big city and a lot of the smaller cities. There you can stable 2 pets. Although you have to buy the slots but the first one is only 10 silver iirc, just stable your favorite pet and go tame the other with the ability you want.

Hello. Ummm, yes, but honestly, it would be the first time I'm doing it so I don't know how it works.

Brill or Undercity.
---
Ask a guard for directions.
---
Not even a warrior can hold threat if the DPS doesn't manage their threat and just goes hard on separate targets. Further, the main advantage of a warrior, the taunt, just puts on the same line with the current top-threat player. If the dps has already passed you once and keeps going taunt isn't going to save you more than one mob every 10 seconds. Now consider having 3 dps going on different targets, possibility of your taunt getting resisted etc.
---
Warriors are THE raid tank, but as far as threat generation and 5-mans go, paladin and druid are competitive.
---
Why would one let himself be ganked instead reviving at the graveyard and porting home after you realize your getting ganked ?
---
Between being rage starved, misses, blocks, dodges, resists and parries, it is almost impossible to keep up with the tjreat. Especially if you have 3 dps going ham on 3 different targets, before you even had the chance to tag any of them.
---
Tanking is frustrating fight now

There are some addons (completely irrelevant to what you're after) that does track data and it's exchanged between users of the addon, I've noticed it's generally restricted to friends/guild only though so there might be something deeper that prevents anything in depth

Congrats on rushing to 60 and killing a boss with strats you devised and no one did in 15 years. The having to kill Majordomo twice was lol!
---
Tanking in classic is impossible when DPS keep attacking the target I'm trying to pull off of them. I have a feeling you're that guy.
---
not even max roll.
---
Is there any addon that, for a healer, shows a timer for 5 seconds rule?
---
I had 6 days off, but I’ve played a lot of vanilla in the past. This was actually a leisurely pace for me and I just leveled up from group quests and a single run of dungeons for the quests.
---
Undead Warlock. You wont pull top damage but you will be everyone's wingman and will have great solo potential.
---
It does not work like you describe, because on the different layers it still takes an hour for the nodes to respawn.   
---
Currently you only have a select few who stuff their bags full of high level herbs and crystals. 
---
Now once more and more people reach level 60, this will not work anymore, because more and more will hop layers. If 5 people hop layers it gives them hundreds of gold an hour. Have 50 people hop layers and it will not work so well anymore.
---
Point is that only very few who got to 60 first are abusing the hell out of it, but once more people are level 60, this will not work as well anymore.
---
What results is few 60s will have massive gold and will be able to control the market in other areas much easier. Like elemental fire which sells for 30s and later when BWL releases for 5g, same with elemental earth, firebloom for AQ opening and many other areas. 
---
Having a lot of wealth early on spirals into even more gold later on and even more control.
---
Apart from the economy, there are more implications that simple AH trading. Why do raid guilds AH trade lotus? Because they want to raid and rank PvP. A dedicated ranking group with their warriors running around with +1200 health by titans flask and their casters with +150 SP is *huge*. Combine that with all the other consumes they can stack currently by layer hopping  and the hardcore guilds with lots of 60s now will get even more of an edge in world bosses and the like.
---
A little bit of trivia for you : 
---
The word baguette actually refers to anything that would look like a stick. So when French people say baguette, they actually mean “baguette de pain” which would be a bread stick, but they abbreviate it. In the same vein, “baguette magique” is a magical stick ! And is sometimes abbreviated as well, depending on the context. 
---
Btw, if you think that’s funny, I encourage you to read Harry Potter in French, you’re gonna lose it
---
Damn y’all ugly as fuck. Cute pic tho
---
It's not OP's mom, notice the other person says "my mom"
---
yes they can, just demo shout and clap.  
---
special boomer reminder: we're still talking about aoe threat
---
I dont think you watched the video because he said it wasnt serious at all
---
I don't get how we never got one tbh. Even in Wotlk, the scarlet crusade was a major enemy and was entwined with the main story.
---
Gotta love it when they parry your execute. Sigh.

I had these two random people seeing a lonely warrior trying to clear the path to get the egg, sitting right next to the egg and they came and stole both eggs (it happened twice).

So when I confronted them, they went like...relax man it's only one egg....
---
Get a sword and shield. Get a bow/crossbow/gun and some ammo. Most of the time you can charge in with battle stance and then swap to defensive stance, but sometimes you can use the bow to pull from range safely.
---
Start slow and make sure your healer has mana and is behind you. Watch for patrols from behind.
---
Pull extra carefully as you make your way up the boat, it's easy to aggro a couple extra mobs that might wipe your group.
---
This is so true yet so sad. The worst feeling is if you don’t do it then you feel like you’re missing out on a ton of money. That’s me in a nutshell
---
check this drain tanking guide out from a lock in the community. super helpful. i switched from just imp + afflic build to drain tanking at 30 and its been great
---
if you have the wand from BFD it will out dps your drain life a lil but again, wand doesnt heal you
---
Sunken Temple class quests aren't in this phase.
---
Yeah, Whitemane is getting better 5-6 at like 6pm.
---
Dude just have fun and enjoy the quests. Do you know how good the story connecting elywnn, westfall, and Duskwood are? This isn’t a race. I blew through it because I love the story and gameplay and couldn’t get enough. Being single and having 6 days off doesn’t hurt either 😛
---
Never said it was OP's mom.
---
Im assuming they had 20 trial accounts doing it. But Classic cant be played on trial accounts.
---
Hah, https://legacy-wow.com/classic-addons/moncai-equipment-compare-classic/
---
How? I have nothin to do at work
---
He does, he’s just attached to his WW axe.
---
I was hoping this was the case. Got a little worried when I kept reading people making this comment.
---
They should really fix the lighting.
---
How is traveling somrwhere in 1 minute ever worse than 2. Save up for yer mount
---
For the most part, that sounds about right for the population in general... However, rogue varies a lot. Rogue seems to be a very popular class on PVP servers and a very unpopular class on PVE servers. Rogues are lower even than druids on my realm, at least last time I checked a few days ago.
---
The economy will be broken anyway when Dire Maul opens. Have fun with hunters farmin 900g/day.
---
Woah this looks perfect what app is this!?
---
/u/vredditshare
---
Theres not a starter edition for classic. My friend had this same thing happen to him, after a relog or two and an hour later his account was normal
---
Personally, I think that making grouping automatic takes away the human communication factor and makes us less social (more toxic). 
---
Also, it looks like trying to make things happen faster makes us impatient and we end up constantly thinking about the next thing we'll do instead of enjoying what we are doing right now. It makes our perception of time go by faster and without quality.
---
Getting teleports to the dungeons makes the size of the world irrelevant and warlocks / mages lose some of what makes them awesome. We lose a whole lot of immersion and we  destroy the sense of travel.
---
Lock has all the advantages
---
Go play bfa then or get hit CAP and dont complain about it.
---
I have to ask... but how is this done ?!
---
Bought 8 FAp recipes due to layering and made about 20 gold profit
---
It depends on how effeciant you are. Ive spent about 8 hours catching up mining and engineering
---
The biggest question I have yet to see answered is ... why? 
---
Surely it's more comfortable and easy to play on a PC?
---
black lists are real tho

Is it a "big" accomplishment? Not really. Just takes a long time.
---
Will you feel extremely accomplished? Yes.
---
Now you HAVE TO macro: "**/y Trifling gnome! /cast Arcane Shot (rank x)**".
---
Do you have any guide on how you set it up?
---
Will do. Thanks!
---
From what you say,  join a high pop PvE server. You'll make lots of friends even at 15 hrs a week and you'll never be wasting time being ganked and ruining your version of fun. 
---
I will say if you can spare 15 hours a week,  you can raid....
---
BGS are worth being 60 for anyway imho.
---
Welcome to the game! For a first class, I'd go warlock,  you get a tank pet,  soulstone AND mounts and summoning and etc...
---
Have fun!
---
No Blizzard never stated that layering would only work in starting zones. That was one of the most frequently made demands from users on this board prior to the launch, but Blizzard made it clear from the beginning that layers are basically parallel worlds within the same realm.
---
I'm not allowed to play with you anymore. Sorry. ;)
---
DoTs + chain fear is dead...anything really. its kinda messed up. a ?? druid (i was level 29, party mate was 28) ganked us and i just chain fear + DoT'd til he was dead. poor guy couldnt do a thing
---
til his ?? mage buddy came and phucked us. to be fair, we woulda killed him to (with fear and DoTs again) but he locked me outta shadow for 5 sec and bursted me down...feels bad man
---
they started it!
---
anyway, yeah at least til 60 and people start getting some raid gear with bunches of +stam (or i guess a druid in bear form) chain fear + DoTs is basically "jesus take the wheel" for whoever is getting the ass-end of it. feels cheap, but still fun.
---
Yea that was earlier dinged 47 tonight will get there eventually
---
Hey everyone!
---
Thanks a lot for your awesome feedback!
---
More will come, somehow in an order of an actual leveling journey. 
---
P.S. Yes, the sad green husband will make an appearance down the line, but it will take a couple more scenes for us to get to the Barrens :D
---
Multiple servers were xferring to 1 server so someone with the same name xferred from the other server first
---
OR
---
once you've xferred 1 character you can create new characters on the new realm and so someone may have nabbed it.
---
It is paper though, the paper is just made from linen and cotton. Paper can be made from all sorts of things even rice, still called paper at the end. US defines it's currency as a paper currency, but it would be funny if they defined it as a "clothes" currency.
---
Nice thanks!
---
Get yourself a refund, that's what I did!
---
I mean yeah but the whole server I am in erupted in this debate and I thought i'd share here. Main argument point was that dungeons seem too easy.
---
I play on NA servers from Korea with an average ping of 177 and it's honestly not that bad. Only time it sucked was when I got a bad shard from a dungeon group and had 2k ping but it went back down when I left.
---
No, not at all. There's a sword quest reward from WC hordeside that is much better. Hell at 21 random green would suffice, just try to keep your mainhand a bit on the slower side.
---
&gt;swords are better for PVP
---
Depends on what you're going for. Daggers are great for it but you'll rely on a lot more burst. A hemo swords spec will have you generating plenty of combo points to keep your target under control, but honestly if you don't have it down you're just going to be hitting like a wet noodle.
---
What? I thought on vanilla there was no Autoshot for wands?
---
Deadmines on day 1, but they just hit 40? Haha
---
Hell yeah brother
---
Yup. But it is very fragile. That said mage is going to struggle vs other casters and hunters. They get to have a field day vs warriors and paladins though
---
That's exactly me running from Rachet at lvl 21
---
Nice bro 2 gold from vendor!
---
I've played on a PvP server since the very beginning, so nah man dying isn't an issue. 15v1 isn't pvp. Getting spawn camped every single time you get on, in every single zone, by 5+ people isn't pvp. I have a ton of tolerance. I'll die and run back maybe 10 times before even getting annoyed by it.
---
When someone replies "Hey ive been killed by alliance multiple times", and I've died maybe around 200 times so far to huge ganks, that's not the same conversation. Horde outnumber alliance HUGE. People like you going around bullshitting because you like to abuse the population imbalance doesn't help the game. I've never complained about pvp, go ahead and check my posts -- you'll never find a single complaint. Hell, you won't even find me complaining about the game at all. This is an actual issue so far unless it changes.
---
P.S: I even said it could be unlucky layering, it could be my server, could be lots of things. I didn't discredit anyone. The "minority" means he might be on a server with more alliance, which IS the minority, or he's gotten lucky in layering. Coming to tell me im "wrong" is some dumb shit. I can't get enough of pvp, and I wouldn't be playing the game if it weren't for pvp. This isn't pvp
---
Probably a bit. That's the nature of complex computer systems. That's why there are things called bug fixes.
---
Last night I actually lost position as well. At first I was position 5400ish, time remaining said 130min. Three hours later I was position 5900 with a time remaining of 143min. Ended up going to bed before I had a chance to play.
---
Potion seller, you’re a RASCAL!  You’re a RASCAL and you have no respect for Knights!
---
PvP won't be a focus for you really, BGs aren't released for a while and you probably won't find much world pvp at your level (you're still kinda in friendly zones)
---
Hey I’m also an enchanter. What I did was check if the mats I got were worth more than the actual vendor price. If it was I’d DE the item and if it was not or it was pretty close I’d just vendor it. I believe enchantrix is the name of the addon that shows the possible mats you’d get from DE’ing an item. I downloaded auctioneer ( might also be bagnon, can’t remember tbh) and enchantrix came with it. Just make sure you check the market price at AH for the most updated price and not just check the market price on the tooltip. Oh and get vendor price to be able to see vendor price on items.
---
Perfect, I'll check it out thank you. I'm extremely new to WA, so I don't know anything about Wago.io or any of that.
---
No prot needed. Skill into arms and take tactical mastery for extra fun while dungeon tanking. 
---
Dont be jerk for your healer: equip 1H weapon and a shield. There you go
---
You can easily tank as arms up past 40. Just use a sword and shield and rock defense stance. And when you find yourself not really needing heals just go battle stance and pump out damage. Some groups you can get away with using a 2h and just getting heals dumped into you.
---
I believe it’s the same. Both just add more spell power to your healing spells only.
---
Arugal (PvP) is definitely the most populated realm on Oceanic at the moment. 
---
You don't *need* to gank anyone, I rarely do and most people are chill and doing their own shit anyway, world PvP is definitely a staple of vanilla WoW though if you're after the "proper" experience. 
---
Rogue is always fun, especially on a PvP server. Easy escapes, easy ganks, good survivability if you're decent.
---
Professions are fairly personal, depending on what you're after. You can just do gathering professions if you don't want to spend too much time and you'll still make some money.
---
Exactly.  Real life example, DeBeers.  Even trickling out mats, you can generate enough money to control whatever resource you want.  Someone puts up a lotus for less than what you set the price at? Buy it and relist it.
---
I was Alliance on Skeram, and STV is actually unplayable. Horde groups ganking everywhere to the point where you can't even kill more than 3 mobs without dying to a gank.
---
The server I transferred to is chill as fuck.
---
wow classic would actually work on mobile.  
---
Unlike retail many classes legit have ONE BUTTON rotations. THats not a joke, meme or exaggeration.   
---
Like as a lock you shadow bolt. THATs. IT. You might apply a curse here or there but ur actual dps rotation is 1 button.
---
Can you help me out by telling me how you distributed your points? I just reached level 31 and want to switch to subtlety. Combat swords makes me sleepy.
---
Only dungeons at level 60 are difficult enough that you should be the correct talent spec. 
---
All other levels, having a shield is enough to tank and having healing spells is enough to heal.
---
Today I was on my mount making the Badlands run from Arathi.
---
On my way through Wetlands I would wave at all the lowbie alliance.
---
If they waved back, they survived. Those who didn't wave back were very rude indeed, and they deserved what they got.
---
Don't worry brother, warlock is a class that alot of people play and can't master and claim it's shit.
---
But if you can master it, in my opinion it is the best class in the game by far!
---
This is my opinion only and I hope no one gets extreme butthurt over my opinion.
---
Add my battletag Serthrakk#1943 any questions bro hit me up. Played a lock for 13 years
---
New Druid here... this seems like a logical strategy on paper but in practice I have found it goes more like this...
---
1. Entangling Roots + moonfire + wrath
---
2. Shift to cat/bear
---
3. OOM. If I don’t kill them now I’m dead. 
---
As a new Druid (spec’d feral) how important is it to have int gear for more mana? Does this get better with levels? I feel like if I shift twice I’m OOM. Can’t heal, can shift to run away, can’t CC.  All the guides I’ve read say to wait to take the balance tree talent that makes your shifts 30% less mana until higher level but I’m thinking I might go for it early. Is this a bad idea?
---
Very true. Never thought about the warlock/mage thing. Class identity is so important to making the game feel good.
---
Yes if you let it time out you die for realz. I think the timer's 6 minutes?
---
Oh yeah, I've been using that guide already. I could go find a wand that does a few DPS more but that's a lot of work when I could just drain tank instead.
---
This much in 2 days, i thought maybe 5-6 max, what an idiot...natural selection i guess
---
How. I wanna do this
---
Ive had dungeons wipe due to any role fuck up. I've even caused a few myself,  but I've learned from my mistakes.  I won't blacklist a low level tank or healer bc the caused a wipe. I will though if they're offered advice and respond like an elitist prick. Try tanking yourself,  then rethink this comment.
---
Customer service is your friend
---
Ive been a tank through vanilla a few Times now and I didnt go prot until 55 just to lvl in dungeons the last bit. All you need is a shield and defensive stance, you dont even need to pick more than rank 1 in revenge. I deffo recommend lvling as arms and tanking when ever you want.
---
I play from west coast US on EU servers. Ping is 165ms. I never ever noticed it.
---
Maybe it matters for competitive pvp, but otherwise it just doesn't matter.
---
Are they farming devilsaur? I've watched alot of them streaming and they're all doing dungeons, mostly UBRS, all of them say they haven't done devilsaur yet. Unless this changed very recently.
---
F in the chat, no wand.
---
Mage and rogeu good.
---
 Hunter and warlock are easy.
---
Warrior is hard.
---
All healers are easy and boring.
---
Worse things in the world to fap to.
---
I haven't so much as rerolled as I am making a dwarf preist, however I have made almost every alt, for professions I want to lvl and character builds I want to try ^.^
---
I will probably take forever to get to 60 however my tailor / enchanting mage is now starting to level and my skinning / leather hunter is about to come online :D
---
&gt; Dont be jerk for your healer 
---
Na been a healer for a long time I know how stressfull some tanks can be thats why I wanna prepair with knowledge to not be that kind of tank.
---
Thank you very much for your help.
---
Captain Phillips
---
Take the imp stealth mechanics and pick in SM lib.
---
zocken und RTL2.. gefaehrliche Kombination haha
---
Just a small PSA to all the Warlock homies, you can skip low ranks of demon abilities and just buy the highest rank tomes once you hit 60. You save a handful of coins that way.
---
Obviously you're not going to do that for the pet you're leveling with, but you can do it for the other 3.
---
Thanks for letting us know you play on a pvp server
---
Good, I hate gnomes and I'm alliance.
---
Enjoy your long disease from your vape.
---
For the alliance
---
What I've been seeing on most threat guides is to spam battle shout between 4-5 mobs and with 5+ spam demo shout, is this not true?
---
It’s miserable but it’s also pretty fun if you’re not getting camped, which to be fair you are a lot, but the thrill is pretty cool lol
---
Can you show us how to set this up. I'd love to quest lying down in my bed all warm and cozy.
---
Gonna try that thank you very much.
---
Lol what a little brat.
---
Are you the guy who swooped in and ninjaed the abscent minded prospector, died, declined group, and tried to do it again?
---
In MC most plate stuff is tanky stuff anyways, the mt will get gear first and the ot gets whatever the mt doesnt need. When the gear starts making sense in higher level raids I dont think the MT will try to grab non tanky gear unless hes a dick.
---
I think SM is probably your best bet, I see a lot of rogues farm it.
---
This, but unironically
---
Yeah... I'm 18 at the moment and I'm about ready to quit and reroll.
---
Single, no kids and 3 weeks paid vacation from work in my case.
---
How do you do that quest for the whirlhing axe? I was looking forward to do it but it has elites and a ton of materials that looks expensive... My weapon right now has a dps of 32, the whirling axe gives 35 is it really worth it to go for it for me?
---
Remind Me! 10 hours
---
It looks just how I remember my first time playing
---
Nah you're right. Holy Fire is pretty useless / inefficient.
---
This is "creepy-uncle" cut. Bowl cut is where you put an actual bowl on your head and shear of anything that sticks out from under it.
---
Theres also a quest in Arathi where an old Orc wastes his life away in misery because he was denied to die in honorable combat with his warchief. 
---
His troll friend is doing everything he can to make him get his mojo back. He just hates to see his friend like that. I love finding quests like this
---
Yes. Swifty said that skinning and vendoring the leather alone should make you enough gold to get mount.
---
I think this guy buys every spell there is or something.
---
15 bucks isn't it a lot to pay for a game nowadays. Hope you enjoy it.
---
Amen - i did exactly the same and everytime they can get  a Jump on you Trust me they will.
---
Just Kill them in sight to be sure
---
Love playing my hunter as well.
---
Don't love playing "the dead zone game" in all the cramped instances. Like in Scarlett Monastery it's pretty much:
---
&gt; Do you want to see or do you want to be able to auto attack with your musket? Nevermind, cause now they're fleeing anyways
---
This. Classic wow is strongly suited to casual players. Time investment is everything and the time you put into Classic goes a long way. You know that the time and effort you put in now isnt going to be meaningless and wasted in 4 months when the new patch drops. Doesnt matter if it takes you 6 days or 6 months to hit 60 everyone will be raiding MC and Ony  together. Theres only one difficulty of raids so there is no shame in being in a "normal" guild vs a "mythic" guild. The only differentiating factor is the speed at which you clear content. Even the most casual part time low effort raiders will be able to clear naxx 2 years after it comes out. They dont care theyre having fun.
---
Id rather put an hour here and there towards bettering my toon in classic than rolling m+ boxes and trying to pug curve before the next patch in retail.
---
Now you spoiled his plan to the others
---
Wow this is a troll don't bother. Need is for making huge profits or using the item and greed is for vendor/DE/memes. Always ask your group unless you want to be blacklisted.
---
First of all, thank you for keeping this conversation civil.I can understand your disappointment. I see what bothers you, what the issue is. I apologize for jumping the gun. Hope your gaming experience will be as fun as possible.
---
Undead racial lasts 5 seconds. You stun with a engineer bomb which is 3 seconds.
---
Never use death coil on an open for a 1v1
---
He'll have to balance his gear well. Im a prot pally in classic. As long as he learns how to play it well he will be fine for 5 man.
---
It's either called multiboxing which is someone having multiple subscriptions and multiple accounts they're playing at once. 
---
Or its called a person with 4 friends having a laugh, and they've right-click followed the first one.
---
Will Blizzard allow realm transfers (paid or not) to anywhere eventually? 
---
I came back to play with friends but we all planned for whitemane and that has since no longer been an option for most of us. So now we are spread across 3 realms and now the Whitemane guys are going to xfer to their new realm but in order to join them we would all have to reroll. 
---
So frustrating.
---
Is there somewhere else more work of you? Even non-wow related?
---
It ain't just streamer servers that still have queues though
---
Well, the amount is still way less for the average person as taxes also pay for free medical care and other social benefits they might have.
---
In my best Abraham Lincoln voice: Ohhhh, now you fucked up! Now you fucked up! Now you fucked up! You have fucked up now! Now you have fucked up! Now you fucked up! Now you fucked up!
---
Which is the best class for farming gold: hunter, mage or warlock? Does it change in any way when DM is out?
---
nope, said it requires plugins but there is none which I can find.
---
If you're mostly interested in steadily making progress towards 60, you might want to go pve. If the idea of wanting to sit down and do some quests but getting distracted by being murdered for an hour is a headache, go pve. On the other hand, if you're game for that, and want to do some murder yourself, roll pvp.
---
Class, professions... just take whatever seems coolest or the most fun to you. They all have benefits and drawbacks. Just enjoy it.
---
Download auctioneer addon
---
Didn't think so. Oh well thanks for updating.
---
Biggest thing was the lfg that we have in retail today was mostly done in wotlk. I can't recall if the lfg tool in wotlk was cross realm yet though.
---
Windows - Shift - S.
---
Tried holy shield grinding from 40-42 and didn't find it efficient. You just don't have the sustain that proponents tend to suggest.
---
I wouldn't say that it's totally non-viable, but the bigger issue is that it's a very delicate balance even in the best case. Fundamentally you're going to have a lot of trouble with aoe farming if you're not already well ahead of the masses (say in your 50s). People will gank you or just ruin your pulls and there won't be much you can do about it.
---
I dont see why not. Look at osrs, has its own legacy feeling website. Blizzard really should give us a legacy website to use. Would be a lot of fun
---
Asmongold needs to see this
---
56 now.  I've done every zone aside from tauren/undead starting areas, silverpine, and hillsbrad. Otherwise I've pretty much done them all.  Lots of running
---
I know Outland in Norway sells these. It's a geek-store.
---
Might not help you much though :P

Human paladin. at 12 I started doing every area that gave night elf rep for that sick tiger.
---
So blizzard are just Warlocks then, right?
---
That's definitely what I'm trying to look more into :)  so far alot just seems so geared toward pvp. And the quests are generally just kill x amount of mobs. I've nearly cleared every quest I found in goldshire stormwind area (not alot in the city) and moved on to grinding quests at lvl 12 in westfall
---
Brilliantly written.
---
If you are going for Sword pvp you will have to go Hemorrhage spec (Subtlety)...imo this is the worst spec to lvl by far
---
(you rely on stuns and wile lvling these get resisted a LOT)
---
Best lvling  spec is combat swords,remember u need a slow ,hard hitting main hand and a fast offhand
---
for pvp ,daggers are best 
---
lvling with a pure pvp spec can be fun due to world pvp but hard cause  some talents will do little to help you in pve
---
Off I go then.
---
I'm playing since the second day of classic release, Tauren Shaman, and I got level 14. But I really don't play a lot, maybe 30 min to 1h max per day. Only in weekends it is slightly more, and I found it really fun, not using questie or any of that, only few ui add ons. Quests are little bit challenging in general because you don't have exact spot provided by a qestgiver, so often you roam and look for some stuff. But you feel more like a human being where you have to ask people, group and journey around the world.
---
It is worth playing classic even if you don't have a time for it, there is still plenty of people around with similar level or lower one who just started a game. Give it a try!
---
I have been whoing daily on my server. Of coz it’s not a complete survey;
---
PvE horde 
---
Hunter 
---
Warrior 
---
Shaman 
---
Warlock 
---
Mage 
---
Priest 
---
Druid
---
Rogue
---
Rogue is extremely rare
---
Isn't ElvUI available only on their site anyways?
---
Damn, that axe does serious WORK at level 30. I farmed my ass off and only got it at 35 and it still felt like a gamechanger. You're set for your 30s.
---
I really like it when someone takes what is probably an overused meme but gamify it as OP has here.
---
Yes and no. While leveling it sucks. But as long as your end game guilds are ok then you get all the advantages. Tighter community and PvP advantage in battlegrounds. Helps you gear up when that rolls out and get av honor and such.
---
Given that this is the server with streamers on it, it’s maybe a bit more relevant from the community perspective.
---
The TomTom arrow showing you where to go?
---
Used to happen with my heirlooms when they were a physical thing, GMs always found them no issue
---
Nice.
---
Blame the healer, we can simply stop healing you. Then we have the mana we need for the tanks.
---
Doesn't allow you to take control of other characters in the sense that you can walk around with them. It basically just makes them behave as pets, ie the other person stays by your side and you can tell it to attack stuff.
---
Were on Thalnos and there’s been a 6k+ queue to this day around 9pm EST.
---
Fear ward so I can have a mixture of morons in my raid without it completely screwing up the raid.
---
Hold onto that. 7g is not a lot of gold and when you hit 60 a twink priest would want that. Easy 500g
---
this one goes to eleven
---
Is it possible to have wow officially on mobile?
---
Thank you for this, I heard about Steam Link mobile a while back and was sad to hear they were having trouble getting it accepted on AppStore (no problem with Play Store ofc) and had since forgotten I was waiting for it. LOVE IT and it’s awesome how I can also use steam controller with it.
---
I wouldn't say any of classes are bad, some of the specs could be in an end game scenario, and its not even that there bad, there just outshined a lot by the other options available.
---
We forgot about the coffee cup because it quickly stopped being the most jarring, immersion-breaking thing about the season.
---
I’m actually a Warlock so, spot on friend haha
---
FOR THE HORDE! because their story is much better. Orc and Trolls are the coolest and Alliance are just gay.
---
Same holds true for alliance...
---
Im telling ya - sure in world pvp without friends life sucks. But BGs is free friends and if your half decent, the heals will follow
---
No tabard... Pleb.

To add to this, prior to about 50% block chance you'll want to use it mostly if damage is becoming a bit harsh, or as a guaranteed protection against crushing blows/critical hits from bosses.
---
I played horde for 15 years, time to play Alliance for 15 years.
---
Yeah my groupe since classic release runs a warrior tank, a shaman who tanks and heals(mostly both) and me as druid who also does mostly both, tanking and healing. We had no issues so far and even manage to run most part of certain dungeons (like WC) in a groupe of three.
---
Sure it takes time, especially because we don't really bring AOE but its challenging and fun. 
---
I'd say go for it, play your paladin, there are plenty of warriors around anyway
---
Yeah going as a dps is the easier way to go, and try to be at least 2 levels within the final boss.
---
That's not really fair.
---
Warriors can tank, too.

Or you could have just helped him? This isn't funny? This just reminds me that retail players should stop preventing me play in the server I want (queue). Go back to retail with that attitude OP and his lovers/supporters.

Which version of reshade do you use? Been trying the latest version but nothing happens even though it works fine for BfA as well as other games. I had an old version of reshade working however my game would shut down on loading screen so obviously had to disable it again. :-/

actually 7 minutes of walking every hour is over 10% of your time.

It is 5 months from now.  You, through friends, various alt accounts and an agreement with other major holders of black lotus, set a price for lotus.  Demand for lotus is always high for raiders, meaning you can sell a fair bit.  You probably represent 80%+ of the lotus on the market.  You stockpile gold for a couple weeks.  Then you buy out all lotus below your arbitrated price point.  You relist it at your price point.
---
The rest of the server has 3 options:
---
1. Pay your price and like it.
---
2. Farm their own.  Lotus is very limited, which is why it's so expensive to begin with.  Farming your own consistently is going to be nearly impossible post-layering.
---
3. Go without.  You're not going to reach a point where enough people are willing to go without for it to become unprofitable for the lotus mafia to continue maintaining a stranglehold.
---
Eventually, with access to hundreds of thousands of gold, the ruling cabal can manipulate (almost) any resource they want.  Even if they lose money hand over fist for a few weeks, eventually they can make the reality of the market whatever they want.
---
This is prevented (somewhat) in the real world by anti-trust laws.  That is not the case in WoW.  Any sufficiently rich player(s) can do this, the hard part is becoming sufficiently rich on a level(ish) playing field.  This is a much easier path to market manipulation, because it doesn't require much time investment.
---
Thinking about buying the game... looked at the classes and races, is Paladin fun?
---
I'll pass this on then cause I've had rage issues with druid and now warrior. Thank you!

Hi, /u/12kmusic

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/czx6p5/hmmm_these_growing_communities_seem_related/). 
---
Honestly gnomes shouldn’t of been able to be warriors
---
Taking the transfer is a terrible idea man. I know the ques are bad, but you want to be on the populated server.
---
5 points for 10% increase isn't worth getting on the first lvl imo but yeah, you can give up 2 in nightfall (it's really useful in pvp tho) or maybe 2 points in suppression (not sure how much you need against same lvl mobs). Also after 30, if you don't take the slowing curse you have 4 points to spend where you want before unlocking shadow mastery.
---
&gt;15k is more than what the current servers are serving.
---
Oh, you work for Blizzard, or know somebody that has access to server information that includes concurrent logins?
---
you can get "gems" from pick pocketing sometimes, and health potions. I believe the pick pocket lock boxes have a very very small chance of an epic dagger, according to wowhead
---
That’s definitely wrong. Skinning maybe made me 10g on my way to 40 by questing. That being said, I was able to get my mount and the level 40 skills I wanted without going out of my way to grind any mobs for gold.
---
I think troll is better if you're on a PvE server because of berserking but undead is better on a PvP server because of Will of the Forsaken. 
---
That's basically how I chose between the two and ended up as an undead priest.
---
So how does this precisely work?
---
Thanks for finding this out though :)
---
Hah! What a nerd thing to do
---
You sound the rare type of priest :)
---
I ran into one that had his pet on agressive in Redridge. I had to leave that one
---
How are the queue's now on Herod after they opened up free server transfers?
---
Rogue level 29 here. Considering rerolling cause the constant sinister striking gets boring. I have an amazing main hand sword so no Way to play assassin style...Does this playstyle change at any time?
---
I favor warlocks myself, but since you are new, I’d say make one of each and try them out, by level 10-15 you should have a good idea of what you want to play as.  Alternatively, pick the race that most appeals to you and work with what’s available.  I think all the classes have something fun to offer, so don’t stress your choice!
---
Ahh i see, ty :)
---
That's what I loved about Legion - class fantasy overrode the faction war. You could go to your class hall and hang out with a bunch of people from whichever faction, didn't matter, you were all there to ruin Kil'jaeden's life.
---
I once killed a mob that a hunter was taming. I didn't need it for a quest.
---
Fuck hunters.
---
Every class is viable, some moreso than others. Some classes will need to put in much more effort than another class for similar numbers but preference comes down to what is *fun* and not *meta*
---
&gt;I'm thinking there was both a WL and a priest maybe.
---
They probably thought it a fun idea to MC him off the boat instead of just killing him. Morally grey....
---
No, if your level 21 your better off doing wailing cavern quests for the WingBlade, quest starts in barrens with checking out the oasis and getting turtle shells, then sends you to thunder bluff to get the WC quest
---
feigned death so long that even Death was fooled
---
No
---
When they add the pvp sets, will they be only available if you reach a certain rank like they did it at first back then or will you be able to get the set just for honor farming (they added this later on in vanilla)?
---
Druids and Paladins are fine/excellent dungeon tanks. Druids can tank SOME raid bosses. Both of them require more work than a Warrior.  
---
Depends on what you want to do. The issue is players come with a retail mentality of "oh, I'm going to play a retribution paladin" and start whacking mobs with autoattacks, not doing anything else, which is not only wrong, but harmful to you and your group.  
---
As a hybrid, your primary role is not dealing dps, even when specced into your "dps" tree, your primary role is still supporting the group. Now support doesn't always mean heal, it can imply heal, but not exclusive.  
---
For example, as a druid, if you're choosing to go in as a dps for some god awful reason, if you see a mob run to the healer while the tank is being spanked by 5 mobs, you go bear form and taunt it off the healer. If the tank is taking more damage than he should, you cast a heal. If the healer dies, you are the healer. If the tank dies, you are the tank. Your role is to make sure the group doesn't competely wipe, NOT dealing damage. That's what rogues, mages, warriors and warlocks do.  
---
Apply same logic for paladin.  
---
Now, hunter, is a different beast. They are truly the one class that got the biggest shaft in the game imo. They are a dps-only class that does meh dps in any spec. Should be fine in dungeons, but in raids you're there to apply tranq, not do massive damage.
---
Lol dude. If one instance of wrong numbers messes you up like that. Then maybe stop playing. Its safer. There might some other numbers that are wrong. And then life is just not worth living.
---
Reading an algebra textbook might be better
---
I prefer the original model, got some W3 vibes to it.
---
That reminds me of myself. My dad played back when i was around your sons age, and now i'm playing classic.
---
Ah yes. The great Servermaker who think the can controll the RP. I hope for the server this will not happend that such a thing normal becomes.
---
Player made wands are much more dps than non crafted ones at the same level, like the lv 5 lesser wand is 12dps, whereas my shamans 1hand axe didnt hit 12 dps till maybe level 14?
---
your words mean a lot, thank you! &lt;3
---
Have you found a working moveanything addon?
---
Nice little Persian Rug moment there
---
This bait is so bad I wonder why so many people took it.
---
IRL Over-hydration is a thing. Nice idea, but not well thought out.
---
What?
---
Turning cloth into heavy bandages increases vendor price and levels your first aid at the same time
---
What I do (warrior) in these situations is kill a caster first. If you lose threat they do almost no damage and buys you time to get threat on the others.
---
Make sure you have the wand from BFD.
---
Gordo likes
---
I would of loved to transfer if they let us pick a low/medium pop realm. I'm not interested in going to a brand new server with zero economy and the population relying on transfers.What happens if alot of people don't transfer and the server is dead. Now you're just stuck unless you reroll and start from scratch. No thank you. It's a pretty shitty way they handled it imo.
---
It doesn't work for spells. Only ranged attacks like bows, guns and throwing weapons
---
Gz
---
Should be fairly obvious brah. Horde is for adults, alliance is for children and pedos.
---
such a scam. Same with silver bar. Sell price: 1s.
---
Like OK dude. Obviously you can make many silver coins from a BAR.
---
RemindMe! 3 hours
---
Lol
---
Correct answer, computers used to come w/ cup holders.
---
Oh, didn't read ranged mobs, nvm.
---
Don't worry too much about that, you're a healer, you'll have an easier time finding groups than dps. You could also try to chat em up before going to the instance to get a feel of what kind of people you're grouped with. If they're the chatty kind, I usually find them to be more patient than the other kind, or atleast then it's possible to explain your dilemma, and perhaps they'll be smart enough to listen.
---
No. Thats a miniscule upgrade.
---
They aren't global server swaps, Blizzard is choosing specific High pop realms to transfer to a specific realm, there's no user choice.
---
No i'm a muscular orc with a 10 inch penis
---
What's blacklisting? Sounds retarded
---
How other people spend their time and money is not really my concern. If they enjoy doing it, who am I to say they shouldn't?
---
Like... do I go buy water? Do I wait between fights? It's not clear cut like respawning
---
I still remember a couple of names from the opposite faction from 15 years ago. Expecially some of the 3 minute mages who just kapow oneshot someone in the southshore - tarren mill constant tug-of-war.
---
Yes, Gank everyone
---
Skinning is probably the easiest
---
That $100% happened
---
Haha all those level 20ish players complaining about something so minor acting like its game breaking look so ridiculous. 
---
Honestly at this point, i wish layering stays just because it fucks with those guys;) for my game, everybody i encounter is enjoying their time leveling up in a chilled fashion, nobody could give 3 fucks about some ultra dedicated people using everything possible except cheating to get to the max level as fast as possible
---
How far into the xp bar you are considered rested.
---
No I meant with a grp in the lvl range of the dungeon ofc xd
---
The farther it is the longer you get double xp (also known as rested xp), when you log out always do it in an inn or a major city to accumulate it.
---
Fucking furries
---
The trolls have moved onto people swapping layers to hoard end-game mats as their new scapegoat as to why the game is bad. Unfortunately for them, many, many people are enjoying it anyway.
---
How rested you are, from being logged out. You get bonus exp til the mark on your bar
---
Which is really not that intensive as farm as games go, I think there is more texture on polygons in Kratos left knee than the entire field of view in wow.
---
Thank you so much this helps a lot
---
It's like a threshold indicator, of how much rest XP you have left before you resume to "normal" xp gain rate.
---
This may be discussable. Imo you can generate better threat with 1h and you take less dmg
---
Right, which is not what the OP was talking about
---
hmm, what i mean is like when is it for eu? na has their transfers now right?
---
How can you say you're not trying to spam your channel when the only content you've posted is pertaining to your twitch stream? Go away
---
How much rested Xp you have before it turns to regular Xp
---
I was 12-year-old and I thought the same.  
---
Skilled mining as a mage. 
---
eh
---
A lot of people browse reddit on their phone.
---
That's exactly what it is
---
Dude I saw a kodo run by me in Org today and a gaggle ot people chasing after him and it was beautiful
---
and this is ok for blizz? that's insane
---
Mouse over it. 
---
It's showing you your rested XP. Mobs you kill give 50% more XP until you reach that icon and you will no longer have rested XP.
---
Healing as a priest has some complexities to them, that most people will say no too but I am gonna try to give you a crash course in preist healing.
---
First and formost, regardless of what priest you are going to be, I suggest getting 5 talents in spirt tap (leveling), 3 in holy renew and 2 in healing focus. 
---
These are good for leveling and helping you out in dungeons.
---
Now that we covered that, the next thing is before you even get in the dungeon, have 40 water / milk / mage water / w.e.
---
If you are able to buy the 5 silver mana restore (forget the name) buy the milk instead. You are going for quantity on this one.
---
Now you are in the dungeon. First and foremost, your healing priority is always the tank. Always. No, ifs ands or buts. Until the tank drops, your top priority is them.
---
That being said you do not need to spam your heals on them as until you get the regen, you are learning mana control.
---
How this works, basically, is that usually on none boss pulls (dungeon mobs) you can usually keep the tank topped up with a renew and one or two lesser heals. Which keep mana useage and threat low.
---
If you accidentally pull aggro use fade and try to get closer to the tank, so they can get threat back. You're greater heal is usually for bosses or if the tank drops below 50% health.
---
As for drinking, until you get use to healing, drink after every pull. This is why you grabbed the one lower mana regens and if able, also grab water off a mage so it lowers your mana down time.
---
On a side note, do not power word shield a tank useless a pull went badly and they have dropped to about 20% health, as this will give you time to throw a greater heal on them.
---
On another note, until you hit higher levels, you will most likely only be able to do maybe three or four greater heals, before having no mana.
---
As for healing dps, they are usually ok with a renew, more so if you spec some talents into it and even with crazy pulls, one or two might just need a lesser heal but you can usually use power word shield on them as they don't need to worry about threat.
---
Following these tips should help with learning how to heal as a priest with the bonus tip being, don't ignore first aid, even healers can utilize it.
---
YOU HAVE BROKEN THE TIMELINE, YOU MUST GO BACK AND PREVENT YOURSELF FROM TELLING BOLVAR!
---
Why do people keep reposting this fake image?
---
Thank's
---
I thought I was the only Zygor user Haha. 
---
Best addon ever made.
---
Thanks this makes me feel safer in my choices
---
How much data does it use?
---
That's how much of the bar is rested XP. When you log out in an inn, you'll log in and find that icon is a few bars ahead of your filled-in XP. Those bars in between are "rested" and you'll get double XP for killing mobs. When you only sat in an inn for a few minutes, the icon appears but it won't be much, so the icon is right at the end of your XP.
---
There is counter play to this ya know...  simple as a free action potion, not to mention other options.  FD to drop targeting near end of cast, scatter shot, intimidation stun even if you can blink it buys time.  Grenades.  It's not so cut as dry as "hunters have a dead zone".
---
So cute. This indicates that you have rested exp, which means until you pass that marker you will get more exp from mobs. Have a nice day in Azeroth!
---
Pretty sure it's just heals
---
Should still be able to corpse hop into / past the instance portal gate located in Winterspring.
---
I pretty much tanked DM and Stocks as a lvl 25 rogue, I feinted as much as possible and waited for the tank to get aggro but I was doing to much damage with just my auto attacks.
---
Closest polar pop was 5 hours away?
---
The extra hit rating only effects targets 3+ levels above you, so it doesn't actually make that much difference.
---
I hate it. Sure those people can do what they want, but it feels so anti social, hardcore farming, not-enjoying, stressing, weird and ridicoulous.
---
I'm playing on an RP server. Why multibox there? Pff.
---
&lt;3 voice to text

Anyways enjoy it! Tons of studies coming out showing people dieing and so on.

Goodluck!

When noobs try out balancing. Giving warrior charge in combat would break pvp

Agreed. I'm on dd and the server community has been wonderful so far, but this person is certainly a blemish. Grobb will be flooding in soon when they open transfers, so we'll see if the community stays as nice as it is, I hope it does.
---
this isnt an ironfoe
---
I'm leveling a  priest healing in dungeon as shadow/disc hybrid too it all depends on group you get good groups and bad groups I usually carry a stack of mana potions to save/carry the bad groups but if I wipe because they keep pulling and I can't recover mana it's 100% on them. I usually always drink upto full soon as I leave combat.
---
Usually put renews on ppl who have aggro only pw:s to save someone who is going to die without instant healing.i mostly use lesser heal to keep tank topped off try not to overheal or spam to low rank heal while a medium heal would work and I use heal when there is alot of damage on the tank I still go oom just wand and try ur best to heal when u get mana back
---
All of my friends wanted to play horde...but here i am playing my heart out on a paladin because I CAN MAKE NEW FRIENDS LOL also they re rolled alliance when they realized i was serious.
---
the magic of classic :3
---
PVE
---
Warlocks are super fun 
---
If you aren’t serious about professions, take mining and herbalism; you can make money off of them, or stockpile mats for alts if you do decide to take up a profession.  
---
Cooking, Fishing, and First Aid are your friends, make sure to grab all three, as they do not count toward your 2 profession limit
---
With that being said, welcome to classic!
---
My server too, Gandling EU. Im a level 29 alliance warrior just trying to do my warrior quest in the Charred vale, but oh boy is that nigh impossible. Doesnt help that warriors are basicly free kills early on, as a ranged class can basicly kite you forever and you have no tools to deal with it, unless you get the initial charge and hamstring.
---
Im so close to rerolling on a PvE server, its making me miserable not being able to quest in my favorite zones without rolled by a group of 5 horde while im hidden in a corner trying to kill my quest mob. But its like two weeks of after work grinding, so its gonna take me a while to get back.
---
I thought it was clear I'm not talking about rushing with higher levels...
---
God damn it. WoW fan art/comics are no longer available. I was trying to find that old wow comic about paladins vs paladins and other pvp themed comics of classic stuff are gone. I remember being in high school on the computer during computer lab classes and reading the forums and the pictures. I printed out my favourite ones on my family printer (I still have some still in some old binders I never threw away). There were several funny comics and I think machinimas about it but I tried youtubing them and can't find it. I did find this old classic [Ballad of the Noob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM2rFZGujhk). Lol I loved the [murloc song](https://youtu.be/FUsF8weJJWs?t=627) too. I gotten so off topic rewatching old machinima.

---
&lt;3
---
I did this once when I leveled a mage on a private server. It's too much water.
---
That’s what I was hoping was the case because the game is really fun and I enjoy paladin but I didn’t want to be absolutely useless either
---
What level do you begin SM farming?
---
I would guess it has something to do with purity of the bar? Maybe the gold used for bars isnt nearly as pure as a gold coin?
---
Having played hunter and mage in vanilla, both with good gear, I'd still say hunter was more fun for me.  Mage is definitely a blast, and you wont be disappointed.  Just doesn't suit my play style as muchm
---
Ashamed to admit I'm one of those... I play Night Elf because Blood Elf isn't available :)
---
It's the only decent looking race in vanilla for me, plus best racial mounts. Even though Human is quite a bit superior objectively for a rogue, I will always stick to elves, damn me.

/Petfollow

To get those precious drain soul Mana regen procs
---
This is definitely from a private server because if you go into the orgrimmar bank in classic the minimap will only show the room you're inside. So why do people keep freaking out about it?
---
Yep. Gotta admit, that took me a sec.
---
I can't stand horde.
---
I don't find levelling them fun at all I dunno why.
---
Darkness doesn't. However the debuff from shadow weaving increases all shadow damage dealt.
---
&gt;  makes me suicidal. 
---
Not the WoW-grind though ;)
---
And who is it? Linking something would be really nice, especially when you tell us about in the title...
---
Mine ran away too, because it took me a while to get to Darnassus to get feed pet ability. I didn't even read the quest, just complained to my friends about how Blizzard didn't think this shit through. When I finally got to the trainer in Darnassus, I smacked myself for being a dumbass.
---
I think you can skin every 9 and under, I think 10 = like 50 skill, and then every mob level is +5 skill.? Really once you catch up to 50-75, its never an issue anymore
---
OK, but top of the hand would be so bm that it fits perfectly into the comic lol
---
So you're saying that the only weapon in the game not usable by a warrior is broken? Go figure.
---
Polymorph to let the enemy regen, that is really insane IQ, holy shit!!!!
---
Some say kos, or some say kosm
---
Roll another char and don't tell him. I'd try a druid if you would like to to tank, but still have some flexibility. 15 years ago my first char was a warrior.... I can tank! I can hit stuff - I will level so fast! How wrong I was :(
---
Didnt think about it. Thanks for the tip.
---
Character transfer is extremely limited at the moment, no word on if this will change. Doubt you'll be able to transfer from oceanic to USA anytime soon. Joining a guild is dead easy, there are loads recruiting at the moment as it's so new still. Not sure on PvP sorry
---
Do you know of the "finding Hitler" game on Wikipedia?

Hit random once, then you have 5 clicks to get through related articles and get to Hitler
---
YouTube AoE farming.Theres camps and if you’re horde you can go AoE the farm in hillsbrad.
---
Time for some WSG.
---
I love the fountain statue thing outside of the bank in SW. Climbing to the to the top was a fun puzzle for sure!
---
Are you enjoying classic brother?
---
i know what you are saying and how the combo goes, its not exactly rocket science. however garrote still doesnt silence in classic, at least its not saying so in the tooltip. also i didnt downvote you lol
---
And I started at 30.
---
Should break as soon as they start casting, but still a bit surprising.
---
Yeah leveling a warrior is ass. Not worth putting points into prot unless you're respeccing at 60; you can tank everything with just a 1h and shield until then.
---
A combination of questing/grinding worked best for me as warrior, but that's before classic and I'm not sure if that's better than the dungeon farming people are doing now. I'm leveling hunter first this time around so I wouldn't know
---
Primitive by choice, the way I like it.
---
On my server hillsbrad is teaming with horde. We tried to party last night and fight them off   but they have double our numbers no matter where I go
---
I think with layering breaking up chat it is making the game feel like there's a lot fewer
---
Both I guess lol. My monitors a little fucky
---
What is this sorcery? Please tell me your secrets
---
Having multiple characters is no issue. It seems you are worried about about getting into groups (raids) with certain classes while at the same time you don't want to play an overpopulated class..
---
Play what you enjoy, and if you have trouble getting into groups start your own. If you find good / friendly players, be sure to whisper them during / after the dungeon and become friends.

I'm lvling a warrior and tanking dungeons so something I am forcing myself to whisper people to start conversations and in turn (hopefully) make friends. I've got 4 Healers, 1 other tank and 6 dps on my friends list at 48, and I regularly get whisper from them to do stuff togather, and all it took was a whisper..
---
Because they haven't had anything new to be outraged about in over 48 hours.
---
No links at the moment but Blizzard has banned for way less in the past.  There is a very good chance they will take action at some point so it's better to be safe then sorry.
---
&gt; without a fucking table!

Rogue question:
---
I know the basic strat is slow main hand fast offhand, but I'm only level 21, so my options are limited. I've just been equipping the highest dps weapons I have regardless of speed, as well as keeping a dagger in mainhand for Ambush and Backstab.
---
Would it make a difference if I used a faster off hand that did less damage?
---
*Resist*
---
It is infamous for just Auto Attacking (not using abilities) enemies down, which is why it is not really cosnidered to be a fun playstyle by most people.
---
But later on you have many powerful abilities which make you really impactful.
---
Well it's on a vod of a stream.. so.. crazy how things can happen
---
agreed
---
Run a few instances or grind some mobs if you want to avoid the pvp heaviest zones.
---
Choosing between chubby cows, rotting corpses and girls with toenails on their heels I would prefer greed and healthy momma like one dancing on this mail box.
---
Hey he weeded out himself at least. I was recently in a DM group where the priest gave me shit for using arcane explosion in a not optimal way once. Then he AoE-feared every time a mob came close to him in the entire instance. Would blame it on the tank if his feared mobs aggroed more.
---
I'd hang out in Duskwood for as long as possible, even if that means grinding mobs, until at least 35. I am only lvl 14 but don't want to put up with STVietnam with my very limited playtime per day lol.
---
Please update us when you hit 60! That would be a legendary achievement
---
It's almost as if someone is forcing you to work.
---
Is it up for EU yet? I wont be at home till tomorrow evening.
---
Oh god it definitely does. 
---
But I’ve recently lazied out and bought a Keurig. Mainly just for those times I just one a single cup of coffee quick. Not a whole pot, I can just squirt out one cup fast that tastes alright and not deal with grinding my beans, boiling water and then cleaning it. Usually I use my French press on the weekends now.
---
My sister told me that a well done pour over coffee is apparently the best though.
---
I badly wanted to play Alliance with the release of Classic as I never played through them in Vanilla. I levelled two characters, a Druid and a Hunter to level 18, and just, well just couldn't stand it! I don't know if it's the story/characters or what, but I just couldn't get into it.
---
So I guess to answer your question, it's something more internal for me. My heart and soul belong to the Horde. No matter how damn ugly Durotar is...
---
I thought kids didn't play wow classic?
---
the realm is new, noone knows
---
only people from herod can go there (and maybe one more) and only for 1 day
---
transfers wount be possible anymore after that but everyone can make chars there  then
---
If you flip a coin and get heads both times :D
---
You should see the messages I got for killing someone in Gurubashi for the chest. Will make a post shortly.
---
But people, at least here in the US apply the term paper to mean wood pulp paper like they usually see in every day life, which was my main point. Currency is closer to a cloth than what people usually define as 'paper' usually.
---
I suppose legacy would make sense but I don't see an app happening as that never happened in classic
---
Good to know. I like druids that much more now. Ty.
---
I’m playing on 1!
---
That's Gnomish Engineering for you.
---
Using distract to get enemy players to walk off ledges from high places.
---
Favourite one used to be the bridge in alterac valley outside the alliance main keep, death by fall damage!
---
I don't think layering breaks up chat unless they've changed it. It didn't even break up local comms channels like /s and /y. We tested this.
---
I just googled. Its a friend of a wow developer that had died and they receated his first character to honor him. Pretty awesome !! Thanks for the post
---
Join us on Ashkandi
---
Same dude, and then I ambush into backstab alliance killing them, EZ
---
Azeroth has a sustainable monetary system and counterfeiting is illegal.  Bitch.
---
I started vanilla a little after launch, so I wasn't part of the zerg. However, post-zerg it wasn't unheard of to get camped in Tanaris, STV, WS, etc. for over an hour. This was pretty common for me in vanilla.
---
thank you! 
---
my inspiration comes from propaganda and movie posters from old, i love that vertical format. But i agree isn't the most comfortable of aspect ratio, thats why im working on making the 16:9 version of all my posters. :D

&gt;More people have probably wiped in RFC in the past week than people have wiped in any dungeon on retail in the last 5 years.

I went through RFC/WC/SFK while literally falling asleep. Actually the most brain dead stuff I've ever done in wow

Not yet, but given US started, I assume we will follow today.

Ye I'm lvl 38 and I'm at 40 gold. I have skinning, didn't buy useless skills, never bought an item from vendor or AH.
---
Vendored all skinning mats (and even sold the Heavy Leathers on AH). And I'm still not even near, what should I do?
---
well if I had been on stream for more than a week... if i had ever played wow before...and if my reddit account was older than 3 days... and if you saw this post every week (if my account wasnt 3 days old and years old lets say) Then yes I would be "spamming" my channel. Just like I said, here for the community and make friends... you might have to click on my channel to achieve those things. Obviously it wasn't meant for you guys so and that fine.

Fuck dude I'm usually hitting lower level players with a /wave on my rogue. What does that make me?
---
There's no need to make posts like this as it clogs the subreddit and is just reaffirming the opinion we all have. That's the issue.
---
Trying to hamstring a mob chasing me.  Literally took 7 tries.  Parry, parry, parry, block, parry, parry.  I'd have been better off just running and letting it leash back.
---
Some people are just too much into those supposedly "vanillla rules of conduct" : yesterday I tagged a mob from a guy I didn't see because he was casting from behind a texture. No way I could see him and our fireball pretty much launched at the same time. He then proceeded to say in /1 that I was a f\*ing mob stealer and I should'nt be invited to any group on this server. For a random mob identical to the other 10 spawned in the area. I mean common.
---
Bro, I will group with you(even if I have to make a new char on your server).
---
there was a scripting hack used to do it, they did stuff like this.

Shaman is a really great class in vanilla, the early levels can get a bit rough but once you have a good array of totems and abilities it really opens up. You can heal dungeons, do good DPS, solo well and sustain yourself, have utility like astral recall and reincarnation, and you’re great at both PvE (though only as heals) and PvP as any spec at 60.
---
im an UD warlock and have a similar philosophy
---
sorry, i rolled on (RP pvp anyway, grob), to do just that. not just at 60. but at 15, at 25, at 45, at 55, etc.
---
i see people run past alliance all the time, i dont get it. i dont care if you are 3,4 levels higher than me, imma try and phuck yo shiet up. (skulls i dont really mess with, but they sure like to mess with me)
---
my view on it is: i take every fight i can get, and every fight that comes to me. you win some, you lose some. however, if i've killed this poor nelf warrior in the same general area as me 3 goddamn times already, and he hasnt gotten me once, ill let him be(with a respectful bow). unless he keeps coming at me(they never do...)
---
i dunno man. call me a dick, or just call me a pvper. i welcome any and all world pvp. i love that shit.
---
Thank you for liking it! i'll be honored if you print it and hang it on the office wall :3
---
thank you. I will get frostbite right away. I appreciate it!
---
It's what I'm trying. First run of RFC was a mixed success though. Some pulls where I couldn't get or hold aggro, some where I did fine. Gonna try a second run tonight and see where I end up.
---
Gotem
---
Mages are OP against Hunters, at least before PVP trinket and proper Engineering.
---
Stop getting trolled by this.  It's from a private server.
---
This is the main reason I am pretty frustrated with tanking right now. It is just awful how terrible seemingly a LOT of people are when it comes to aggro management.
---
Look at the server stats. Pvp realm populations favors horde on the majority of the servers
---
If things aren’t going well after a couple pulls, I try something like this
---
Hey All, I can run out of mana pretty fast so keep in mind that healing tank is my top priority.  Hang back, let tank get aggro and target tank’s target to help pulls go smoothly.
---
If people won’t listen to this then just suffer through it or leave group.  When you group with a tank who sets up pulls, marks targets and cc targets, ask to add them and offer to heal other groups for them.  Same on decent dps.  When you get a good group, let ppl know you are looking for people to run dungeons.
---
It is crazy how much mana you can burn through just applying renews or a few lesser heals on dps.
---
*Print Screen*
---
Pedophiles love diddling kids. Who are we to deny their happiness?
---
Nice slippery slope btw.
---
Gives you a shield when you get ganked or overpull.
---
At any rate most people take Improved Voidwalker to make it worth a damn in early levels (and to get bigger Sac shields). That being said its ability to hold threat is really more contingent on what rank of Torment it currently has. 
---
Even then, it can hold aggro on stuff while you do other things (like skinning, mining, herbing) and your dots tick down on their own. Even if it kills the.mobs slower you are getting time economy by killing a mob AND doing something you would normally have to do after the mob is dead.
---
How do you report them if you don't know about them. 
---
To report go to Social/who and type their name. Then send them a whisper telling them what you think of their practices, after that click on their name in the chat window and report away.
---
Darkshore is the best imo. It has a lot of quests and can usually take you up to 20, especially if you did all the quests in teldrassil which takes you up to 12.
---
Is 15 high or something? Ive been playing a couple hours a night super casually and am far beyond that.
---
Hey thanks for the reply. Just a quick question - do you have to download a different client software or something? In other words, did you download classic WOW from the NA website or something? Also, how is the experience? Is it really laggy?
---
Oh Im having a similar experience. Shimmery flats mindi g my own business waving at all the horde. 3 more turtle shells to get, and then a gang of 2 shamans and a druid corpse camped me for 2 hours. Cant wait till I meet one of them again in the wild by themselves.
---
Duse you can easily hit 15 in a weekend, even if you work full time and sleep 12 hours ffs
---
Debeers also controls mining of diamonds. We can always go find these mats ourselves :(
---
&gt;Now I have to know how to make the "prnt screen" hide the UI so I can do that while fighitng
---
That's actually an amazing idea.  
---
If you ever upload it, send me the link please, I would install this addon.  
---
I don't have the technical background to re-create it by myself.
---
Azuresong/Horde
---
Well when you put it that way...
---
Not high enough for dungeons yet. Do we have to use CC and marked targets, or is it possible to just AOE everything down?
---
Nice 2 hander you got there. What's the dps on that baby?
---
Rage potions my friend they do be good.
---
Group content indeed is different from questing, but also more rewarding once you get the hang of it. Since you're playing with friends, it might be worth it to just ask them explanations for actions taken.
---
What class are you playing by the way?
---
Yes.
---
The screenshot isn't from Classic.  It's a troll.
---
It's literally impossible to have farmed that many Rich Thorium nodes in the 4 days or so between when anyone was high enough level to mine them and when it was uploaded.
---
Agree. I just barely bought my first food at level 27 warlock and that's just to finally be nice to the priest so shes not wasting mana on my life tapping dead ass (undead lock)
---
Yeah my guild did this in vanilla, server remained Low - Medium pop for the remainder of the game and felt like a ghosttown.
---
It's Starbucks', AKA paid promotion campaign.
---
Just because you saw that all of the high elves around Kael'Thas side with him, doesn't mean that those were all the high elves in the world.
---
OFC there would have been families, and towns that were settled away from their 2 homeland zones in the north of the Eastern Kingdoms since they were part of the Alliance at first and could travel and trade without being seen as an enemy.
---
Seems pretty justified to me
---
Well said sir. Annihilate all alliance scum! Zug Zug
---
Do all of Redridge. Do all of Wetlands after that. Do all of Duskwood after that. Do Stockades. Do Gnomeregan.
---
Filter all the things!
---
tell me about it lore wise there one of the more interesting villains
---
To be honest, I still find female blood elf ugly.
---
Reroll Alliance if you go for the best PvP racials.
---
If you know his username you can just summon him . /u/literallyablackbear 
---
That will be 50s.
---
Windfury and my GF wants to play horde
---
Grats ! And well done
---
No, master loot only works green items and higher. It can, and often is set to epic or higher, which means that all other loots such as cloth and mats wil be group loot and given to whoever gets its turn on loot.
---
And when time comes to distribute loot, the master looter has an option on each item to send it to somebody's bag. Hence the /roll to decide who gets it, the game doesn't take care of that part.
---
All of our characters are fucking more than rabbits do. They must all have a harem hidden somewhere where they go after we log out :)
---
Unless you're on the level right before a new rank of Torment  (ie level 29, 39 etc) your dots on their own shouldn't be ripping aggro if you have Improved Voidwalker. If you're laying into a mob with a high damage wand sure. But my point is he can.keep aggro with dots up while you mine, skin, herb, make bandages etc...Warlock is about efficient than time econony.
---
*laughs in enchanter*
---
Yeah I'm done with being merciful towards horde. You let them live, quest and grind nearby, but as soon as they outnumber or outlevel you, they attack you. Now it's kill on sight.
---
Mate with Princess Theradras
---
id love new content but i dont trust the new (acitivision)blizzard to do anything well.
---
Sell later if u want mount
---
It's very good for druids. Other tanks, not so much.
---
There’s an alliance guild on Fairbanks that posts this in trade all the time haha
---
Strange, arent Warriors supposed to be a Rogues worst nightmare? Unless they perfectly stunlock you and never let a Warrior touch you.
---
I see you are a man of gruik gruik as well.
---
Only ignorant people say that. Paladin are fantastic tank healers and provide some of the best buffs in the alliance.
---
Yep, this applies to me
---
Unfortunately all my friends play Horde :/
---
Is that underwater village just east of the coast of Tanaris? If not, there are two underwater villages I guess
---
You should have answered to his last message "Sorry, the account you are trying to send this message to has been permanently blacklisted on all Blizzard Worlds. The person using this account has also been blacklisted in all other games too and will never be able to talk to anyone online again, ever. Thank you for your understanding."
---
It depends. Usually I try to at least tip the material cost, but since conjured water or food has no material cost, it only costs the mage a little bit of time to give it to you.
---
I don't feel bad when I don't get tipped for it, especially when in group. But if asked for a portal, I ask a fee.
---
Second this, I loved my daggers sub rogue in vanilla
---
clearly you are mistaken, humans robbed those camps in duskwood and are now wearing those faces.
---
That'll teach you to steal one of our owls!
---
Yeah, finding German scientists etc are a sure way to victory
---
Something I get back from draining your ass.
---
Every single druid that has been dumb enough to try and 1v1 gank me has been hard shit on even at a 5 level disadvantage. Not even close.
---
Print screen.
---
The itemlevel addon I spy on your other slots is making me unreasonably sad.
---
*Why*, man?
---
I agree with you partly on this but there are points when someone should just hold off attacking that creature. Here’s 3 examples that I come across that I think is kill stealing or whatever.
---
1. I’m running up to an enemy to kill them when someone dashes in front and takes it. (This I can ignore most of the time because it mostly happens in the middle of nowhere and the guy got there quickly or thinking that I’m heading somewhere else but when it happens next to a cliff that’s when it slightly annoys me, I still think well done you got there but still come on)
---
2. I’m charging up my spell on an enemy with nobody that I think could come and get it but then am wrong and a rogue throws a knife, aggro’s the enemy and tags it. (This annoys me more but sometimes I let it go. Before you say anything yes I have a wand but everything resists it so much I’ve forgotten about it)
---
3. I have used my instant casts on the enemy like curse of weakness and corruption and anyone can see it and it’s pretty much 2 ft away then someone gets the tag because my spells don’t tag. (This annoys me the most as others can clearly see that it has my two spells on it and it’s right in front of me. Only time I cut a tiny bit of slack is their ui doesn’t show them my spells, it was slightly difficult for me to find my spells with my ui am using but I got used to it quickly)
---
You cast shadow word pain, and wand them down, a mind blast sometimes, a powerword shield before pull if it's a strong mob.
---
Barely any down time, no need to drink ever with spirit tap.
---
But yeah, a lot of wanding. Lol
---
Deep Wounds sure is.
---
Am a mage, can confirm. Frost bolt, frost bolt, wand till death. Full mana for the next mob.
---
Is this true though? I hear most rogues say they fear Warriors. If they get caught in melee by a Warrior they go down in seconds. I could be wrong though.
---
So stuff like this doesn't happen.
---

Is there a website with stats yet?
---
Participating in a feature in a game means you deserve to die irl. Gotcha!
---
He still gonna be wearing a dress if he was a paladin. Paladin plate in classic is mostly trash for healing.
---
Now this is what I'm calling ultimate vanilla journey experience
---
it was the nostalgic choice to do. And good thing too because it seems like Alliance is the bigger faction on Razorgore, should make for fast bg queue's later
---
Internal 2nd  roll
---
Are you a hunter as well?
---
Feel like I have put a ton of money in bullets and repairs (im quite carless so I die a lot 😅)
---
Judgement set was so bad ass.  Every time I got a piece of that deck I was stoked. Then at level 70 we got purple judgement, which made me feel like a holy pimp.
---
I'm Japan for years, so likely will get my fill and/or maybe they have a jump available then?
---
Good to know otherwise, I enjoy healing and loved being the "backseat driver" on dungeon runs.  I loved letting people play nontraditional roles, but still ensuring the group had roles covered, and obtaining success (e.g. I was a main healing druid, but always brought a Paladin for res, but didn't care if he was DPS or Tanking).
---
Looking forward to at least getting to that one instance around level 40... Red Monestary or w/e?  I dunno if I'll ever have the time to raid, but just seeing all the old places would be fun!
---
&gt; The class is absolutely barebones, even at level 24, because your main ability at that point is an empowered auto attack. And since you're supposed to be going for the biggest and slowest weapons, you don't auto often.
---
negative. heroic strike is only for threat in dungeons when you have rage to waste. sunder and rend give you way more damage per rage point spent. 
---
what you want to do is start off with a charge and a rend, then 3-4 sunders (5 if it's a bear, turtle, earth elemental, etc.) now all your autoattacks are doing heroic strike damage (because of the armor debuff) AND THEY'RE GENERATING RAGE while heroic strikes prevent rage generation.  
---
then you autoattack till it dies, and you're looking at 50-60 rage to start out with as you approach the next mob. doesn't matter if your slow 2H, fast 2H, or dual wield. stack up the sunders, autoattack to generate rage, and start chaining the mobs together. 
---
this is what i did at 24. sword and board versus yellow mobs, dual wield against green ones.
---
He's putting all that intellect to good use
---
Not for a huntard. That's standard practice. Remember, arrows take up valuable loot space for other people's loot.
---
I was on Shadowsong too. Mystic Circle
---
And then you remember your wife wanted to spend some time with you and watch the new Lion King... Damn it!
---
Wotf is like a third trinket.
---
A screen printed on paper? What's that gonna do?
---
 /s
---
I'm aware, and I think that's negligible. And that was my absolute worst case scenario. No hearthstone, the worst zone. You'll do that maybe once while grinding in the spots I mentioned. 3 minutes every 2 hours is actually more reasonable.
---
It really does invite silly behaviour. Lifelong alliance player, who went with his friends Horde for Classic. It's really fun to just say "for the Horde" constantly as a generic response to doing quests or killing someone 😄
---
I still miss Ironforge tho. Got a level 10 Dwarven Hunter on an RP realm for that.
---
I mean, it's not actually wrong. Dungeon xp is kind of crap if you aren't cleaving through super fast. Did RFK last night and barely managed to get quarter of a level.
---
Depends what you've done so far. Probably finish Redridge and get started in Duskwood.
---
Hey I’ll group with you.
---
I have been lopking for same kind of addon and when i ask people just say look at minimap 🤦‍♂️
---
If you find one pls let me know!
---
I'm glad to hear this answer lol. Everyone has been patient and helpful w/ me so far, I was just getting the impression people were a little more sensitive about noobs in dungeons and raids, which made me kinda hesitant. Thank you :)
---
If you roll on a pvp server then don’t be surprised when wPvP comes a calling.
---
If I remember correctly, SFK is decent for wool as well.
---
Can confirm this spot still works, I did it 2 nights ago. The jumping was weird though, took a while to get it
---
Amazing work! Zone names/labels would help.
---
Back in the day I worked as a security guard and some drunk Australian tourists threw a beer glass at me
---
Yup, this is why I just play 4DD and 1 Heal. Makes it way easier. No DD's taking aggro from a tank.
---
ohh man what the hell lol
---
I rarely drink when healing dungeons. You gotta get good at that 5 sec rule.
---
Nah bro I love you both more
---
You lose your nose after smelling so many flowers ? Can anyone confirm this ?
---
Ye I know you already said that I just disagree it's not griefing it's having a laugh.

Allowing dualspec in no way enforces that attitude, though. It's a choice people make to make the best builds they can for the activity they want to do. That's what people can do now, except if they ever want to change, they have to pay gold to do it. That means you have to level up a second character or spend time farming gold if you want to switch often.
---
And yeah, people can find those features in Retail. Along with everything else they might not want. I really don't understand this "just go play Retail" argument and I honestly almost tune out when I see it. Retail isn't Classic with a few extra features.
---
Haha, our queues on Pagel are generally 30mins or less these days it seems.

No, private servers were never OK for Blizzard
---
What a weakling you are. "Enjoy your report".
---
Ohh ok. Maybe that was a WOTLK thing where it did.
---
Alliance are blue tho.
---
No that’s just fair game, it’s a pvp server.
---
Lol savage
---
Wands turn to shit late level. Scale terribly. I got gravestone scepter at like 25 or 26 its over 29 dps. Last wand upgrade i got was a green quest in STV level 42 quest and it's 32 dps. I'm now level 45 still nothing better, in 2 or 3 levels i can do maura and try to get the blue wand off of Noxxion which should be a good improvement again, finally. But trust me that OP wand thing doesn't last, not enough easy to get/afford blue wands. (I'm a priest too btw)
---
how come your box doesn't have the sheet with that fine ass mage on it
---
If so, deserved
---
Yep
---
Works for me. I quit game in an instant logout area and back in no problem. Not sure if it works with 20s logout. Scared to try with 9k queues.

---
Simply: No. All the classes are great.
---
I think they could release new content without it being *endgame* content. That would be the best way to do it.
---
Marginally better, what are the minimum specs? Some mobile games are built on engines similar to WoW and are even similar looking.
---
Yes, you can also switch pc's.
---
To a degree yeah, it's still simplifying everything but it's close enough. Rogue can be fairly competitive with aoe with blade flurry but because it's a long CD it's not that consistent.
---
Night elves have been my favorite since Warcraft 3, they could have been in the Intergalactic Spice Federation for all I care, I'd still have joined them.
---
😂you mad❓
---
dont lie or play dumb i can easily just wowhead it
---
Whirlwind Axe
---
Actual sheep should be immune to polymorph.
---
Mages have no issues with stuns or roots, the only thing that gets you is fear/poly, WotF is all you'll need trinket wise.
---
&gt;If they can't get those right isn't just a waste of time playing then?
---
Yea my chest armor piece I got today was 69 and I specifically remember it being 74 in vanilla back in the day. I immediately uninstall, unsubbed and I’m super angry I wasted this much time. It was such a waste.
---
Spy addon even sees the enemy before you can see it visually ;)
---
Ah, you see, night elf physiology is quite different, they need to sleep a lot so they can produce lots of sperm.
---
actuallly today was the first day i was eligible... the ohter post were in wrong groups...but they were nice  enough to point towards classic wow thread... as i was in RPG thread. so what you are seeing is me trying to my first post 4 times... only after the 4th did i get an actual post out because its a 72 hour wait period. but really everyone can gripe all day long...its not their for you guys that think its spam... its there for the ones that actually want to interact. Grace and mercy go a long way. not beating a person up on the internet because they are jumping into new things they dont fully understand. bet all of you are swell people in RL. 
---
ill delete the thread... you all have a wonderful evening, morning.. whatever it is for you... and try to enjoy life. dont go around pissing on peoples day... you all are better than that i promise.
---
Why do you think you’ve made a mistake?
---
Nah hunter are op during levelling, their pet that can't be kited nor cc and that is fast and hit as much as a warrior will shred through anything and then there is the actual hunter on top of that.
---
It is night and day difference with arms and fury talents in the early levels. While I'm doing fabulous in terms of rage generation (arms) my dude on fury talents does struggle a lot. You could get your ass to reset your talents but is just #nochanges and l2p not more fitting?!

This exactly, the transfer servers are ghosttowns and most people prefer the popularity.

---
&gt; Is there something I'm missing here?
---
Yeah, you shouldn't be prot at level 21.
---
&gt; threat != damage 
---
I never said it did. And no need to act snide, you're free to disregard the whole business of paladins being excellent aoe tanks in 5-mans if you so wish, *that's your game* and leaves more tanks for us to group with.
---
You are reading too much in what I'm saying, sorry :)
---
All i was saying is that for the time this weapon came out, there wasn't yet a class for which it was meant for.
---
How do u get that transfer?, would like to tranfer mine if my server ends up dying after the hype
---
What have you unleashed
---
Thank you for confirming my choice of playing PvE this time around.
---
Ooff scrolling text was a missed chance
---
Warrior as nelf is bad. You don't want to dodge since dodging means no rage
---
I'm sort of learning as I go along (always played priest). 
---
It's crucial to get a head start, so I'd wait until level 15 to start tanking RFC. I tried it at 14, but losing all my rage after charging in because a switch to defensive just hampers threat building too much. At level 15 you can put a single point already in tactical mastery, so that should help.
---
Secondly, defensive stance is important. You do less damage, but you generate a lot more threat. By being in defensive, and putting sunders on mobs, I could easily retain aggro on 3 mobs at once.
---
Third: it's very important to have a shield. Preferably a good one.
---
Thunderclap and sunder depending on stance
---
There should be one called FiveSecondRule
---
Global chat channels like world are 100% not layer-segregated. As of the final stress test you could hear (read) says and yells from other layers. Haven't tested it since.
---
I guess the whole idea of it. I don't necessarily care for the human aspect of it, but there is something neat about having to actually travel to a dungeon. It makes the world feel like an actual place to live in, instead of just a videogame.
---
No one is pissing on your day, you're being rude by not adding to our community instead you're trying to take from it. Learn basic manners of forums and people won't be so quick to dismiss you.
---
That's pretty much it, however a lot of classes have nice tricks in 1v1 PvP: rogue is great but best can be argued.
---
Also, some instances (like Blackwing Lair) require rogues to do some trap disarming or stuff. And with low gear CC is a priority, so warriors need some time to be picked over rogue IMHO.
---
you need more spikes on your buildings, puny human
---
Stance dance recommended?
---
Damn to have 11 people trigger you so hard you had to ignore them already is nuts.
---
I reached 250 enchanting today and did my first and last trip to uldaman with bags full of mats ( the 225 trainer is located inside ) and now allows me todo enchanted thorium and leather and these 2 are goldmines.
---
Aswell got some bis enchants now so my services will be sought after on a regular basis
---
Wataru is probably a rogue or a hunter anyway. The most expendable classes in a dungeon.
---
Early dungeons are pretty simple strategies so you can generally basically  just follow along. Some dungeons have patrols that walk around so be mindful of where you are standing—don’t get too far from your other party members in case you accidentally aggro something. Some of the larger pulls need crowd control so keep that in mind.
---
A few basic dungeon tips:
---
Target And attack the tanks target.
---
Let tank get some aggro before you start dealing damage. 
---
Bring a couple healing potions, bandages, buff food if you can.
---
Don’t initiate damage on anything that is cc’d (crowd control like mages sheep or rogues sap).
---
Don’t run ahead of tank/party.
---
If you have buffs, like mage AI, buff your party.
---
If you are a mage, offer food and drink.
---
If tank marks skull target that’s usually first to kill.  Moon is often sheep target.
---
Because i dont want to play a human(oid) in a fantasy game, and the lore for the Horde is more appealing to me.
---
Death to all alliance !
---
Poor mages, their leveling seems to be so difficult and slow. /s
---
(not saying there aren't actual issues that definitely should be fixed, I just thought it was funny to see a mage complain)
---
Haha, if you knew me you wouldn't be saying this but obviously as redditors we're strangers to eachother so I don't blame you for making an assumption based on a few comments. You're overestimating my emotional depth however. I liked mythic raiding in retail WoW and to me it was only a big annoyance to traverse trying to find people to play with who wouldn't instantly be weird because of my gender. If you were born a woman, I'm sure you'd find that very irritating as well.
---
In Defensive stance u deal 10% less dmg  thats why ur stats are red and ur shouts will generate threat for multi target

&gt;Best 1v1 Class in PvP
---
Awesome! Glad you had fun and made some friends along the way.
---
Domino's add on for me is a must. I'm fairly new to WoW and had dominos installed from day 1. It confused the living shit out of me for about 3 days. However I'm not sure I could ever use the default interface now and I'm probs not even using all of its functionality.
---
Finish Redridge, go to Menethil (there's a quest for a 10 slot bag !). 
---
With some Stockades run in between the quests, you'll be able to go to Duskwood kinda fast. 
---
If you clean Wetlands + Duskwood and run Stockades a few times I think you might be able to go to STV
---
Lucky you. I have to work on the weekends. I got Monday and Tuesday off.
---
In what way? The hunter slows down the mages dps in a way that the mage can't do to the hunter. If he CCs the hunter the pet keeps killing him anyway.
---
1. Yes 
---
2. No one knows, Blizzard is interested but they're taking it slow and will work alongside the community to see what's best for both parties.
---
Some people are weird man. I had a fellow Paladin go off on me because I won a need roll on a 2H mace. He said because I wasn't in close proximity to him and didn't strike the killing blow I didn't deserve to roll on it and he would report me for ninja. Nothing ever came of it.
---
Is is possible to be on another network or do i have to use mye data?
---
good lord is that a priest rotation? Zzzzzzz
---
Posts like these must make educated Americans feel ashamed to be part of America.
---
Your pet may have lost too much happiness and ran away.
---
I try not to focus too much on when I lose threat. It's going to happen and unless the mage goes full stupid them getting threat for a few seconds won't kill them while leveling. I focus on debuffing enemies as much as possible and keep threat where I can so when they inevitably change targets they're hitting for less.
---
Things will likely change at 60 when mobs get deadlier.
---
cool, understood. take care
---
But your name is Drswole . Whoops...
---
We are. I am an Orc tho.
---
Gnomes are the worst.
---
I also had an alliance mage polymorph me yesterday so i'd get my health back, what a nice guy.
---
My dude if it was that simple I wouldn't be here.
---
Not at all, you can strafe with a/d and hold both mouse buttons for quick movement. 
---
I suggest everyone rebind their qweasd buttons, w/s is forward/back and a/d is strafe left/right. Q and E are such valuable binds that should not be for strafing.
---
Zug zug
---
Unless you need to pull mobs with a ranged weapon to split them, charge -&gt; tclap, switch to def stance and start shouting.
---
Might as well be for the third too if you think about it
---
There are no classes that are outright bad. But there are classes that have bad specializations for certain roles.
---
Change /cast Charge to /cast [stance: 1] Charge; Battle stance  
---
If you're not in battle stance it will instead change you to battle stance letting you charge the next time you click.
---
This picture is from a private server. It's a lot harder to switch-layer farm on Classic, just some naysayers trying to spread panic.
---
Yup in classic a warlock fears you. You WOTF and start beating his ass. Finally he fears you again and thinks he's safe you use pvp trinket and finish him off
---
At the start of Ten Storm server EU I noticed a lot of shamans.
---
Nothing is bad because it's still personal preference but if you mean a/d turn as in you rotate in a 360 degree angle if you hold one key down then yeah that is bad.
---
Turning isn't great, it's slow and not deliberate
---
This Lolol
---
Howd you get the robe of arcana
---
There are arguments about whether or not they're good right now or bad, but from experience healing the same warrior for ~40 levels, they both work.
---
he's with the stable master, still best friend rank
---
didn't work
---
Gnome mages literally everywhere
---
Lol true. The high shadows just makes everything look darker and grayish. It's just more vibrant with it on low. I like it that way.
---
Beastial Wrath isn’t until Lv40, so before Lv40 a Mage should always win.
---
Even with BW, a good Mage can bait it and outlast it with Ice Block, then sheep the pet after.
---
A good Mage can just chill in the Hunter’s dead zone without much worry.
---
Yep and yep ! Did you go hunter again this time ?
---
Thanks for the advice. This helps a lot.
---
I see a lot of Warriors and Paladins (EU - PvE realm)... Well i'm still low level, maybe around lvl 40-50 i'll see less warriors.
---
Warlocks, Hunters population is quite high too.
---
His mindset is pretty clear from the beginning. He asks you but also thinks you are going to try and deceive him in some way to deprive him of the location of said pants. I mean why even ask at that point. What an insecure little fellow.
---
Smells like a retail rat
---
If it was this past Monday, a lot of people had the day off(in the US, atleast) because of the holiday.
---
Did...did you just call out your own logical fallacy? LOL.
---
BAHAHAHAHA
---
This is priceless, absolutely priceless
---
I started a Undead so all I see is rogue
---
Do Hunters mostly get that bad rap from being the “noob” class who is played mostly by people with low skill? I’m generally curious because so far their toolkit to me seems very nifty in a lot of situations. I’ve never played one before.
---
Lol why not just play retail then, pussy
---
OP sounds like a massive pussy
---
[Nope](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10504/green-lens)
---
On part 2 of your point, I personally wouldnt like Blozz to just roll through the content again, we have already done that. Id love to see some sort of classic 2.0 with entirely new content.
---
I think the AH was an hour for like a week or so when they added the 1 hour timer in whatever patch it came in. 
---
I do remember a blue post about them making an exception for the wait, but I could be misremembering and just thinking of them adding the instant between alt stuff.
---
Oh my goodness. That is devilish. I like it.
---
you can put them in the bank if you're not planning on going back for awhile. just don't forget to take them back out.
---
Don't rank up nova, The mana increase vs the damage isn't worth it.
---
I feel like I remember being able to do it too, but from what I've seen it's intentional in this build, it's been this way for close to 6 months (that i've been aware of)
---
I believe this falls into the category of prevalent bugs from the past that have been fixed.
---
There are dungeons where a tank paladin is really useful due to their strong AoE abilities, but the lack of a taunt is really problematic, so you need good communication and a slightly slower pace through dungeons to accomodate a paladin main tank. It's also advised to take holy spec up to consecration first for this, as it's your bread-and-butter AoE ability.
---
With regards to healing, paladin is definitely on par with priest for single-target healing, but falls of immensely for raid healing. 
---
Retridin DPS is extremely subpar though, but it's a great spec for PvP. If you want to group up, better to either go tanky or healadin.
---
I used to "RP" in my head when playing my warrior in Legion and BFA. 
---
He hated forsaken, but he still did all their quests. You just detach the story from the gameplay every now and then.
---
Yeah not deleted I believe it’s sent back
---
What os lag switch? Ive never heard of it.
---
Thanks for the heads up. Shared with some of my lock friends for info.
---
Classic Twat
---
I just play both sides? Got an orc shaman on Mankrik that I play with my horde buddies, got a Nelf Priest of Ol Blanchey to play with my alliance friends. Yeah it's slow to level but I'm loving it so it's okay.

---
Fo da hooode!
---
You level holy up to consecration for group content either way. After that it's gonna be protection or further on into holy, depending on healadin or tankadin.
---
Forged by betrayal, tempered with the steaming hot tears that ran down his cheeks. Orc stronk.
---
And another world PVP player is born
---
Yes! I always wished the guys who made Castlevania(wich is awesome! watch it right now if you havent) for Netflix would make an Warcraft show.
---
Hitting a mob and breaking your cc isn't a reportable offense.
---
oh wow, you saved me 5 gold :/ 
---
sucks tho that is a bug imho
---
Tanking in classic requires a lot more than it does in retail. Not only from you but from your dds as well. They need to have a threat meter so they know when to show down on the damage or they need to give you a sec to build up some threat before attacking. I have a macro to remind players if this every time I start an ini.
---
Ditto
---
I'll always remember how amazed I was by bear carcasses being worth over 1 silver. I was so excited and convinced myself I was going to earn enough for my mount by hunting bears in darkshore.
---
My highest death count was at level 18 with 9 deaths while questing. Mostly, because I added more than 1 mob my or below my level
---
It'll slow right down in the 40s. 42 or 43 is the exact halfway point in leveling. 
---
If you aren't doing aoe grinds in dungeons then you can expect a few hours per level
---
That’s crazy because Shamans don’t seem too popular on my server as far as I have seen. A ton of warlocks and druids though.
---
I tried farming the recipe for a few hours but it didn't drop so I bought it off AH instead.
---
53 healing that's more than the T2 head, wow
---
Mages and warlocks are everywhere. Notice a clear lack of tanks. Good amount of healers though.
---
You just need to grab em by the Small Leather Pouch
---
You don't have to be in character all the time. Not everything that you're doing on an RP realm counts as RP.
---
Sooo, my only question is.... where DID you get those overalls?? I’m entirely too lazy to look it up 🤣
---
Lol we've known 1.12 items would be here months before launch
---
&gt; Are dungeons on Classic vs the retail version of the game the same in regards to spawns? I think I will run the dungeons I plan to do once or twice w/ dungeon finder on retail if so, in order to learn spawns.
---
I don't think it'll help much with spawns, but it may be worth running dungeons solo on retail just to make sure you know the layout.
---
Q/E for strafe and W for forward even thought most of the time it’s double mouse buttons. Turning with the mouse(unbound turn keys to learn it, worked like a charm).
---
I didn’t understand why me as a Druid was gonna kill faire dragons, daughter and sons of cenarius in Stonetalon Mountains.
---
I didn’t read much into the quest though but they didn’t look corrupted or anything.. hmm
---
I got dagger drops from BFD and Gnomer and I'm having a blast world PvPing in the early 30s while still being able to tear down mobs easily. My next sword isn't until the SM quest so I'm enjoying daggers while I can
---
Healing got nice during WotLK though, with some fights deliberately designed to be a challenge for the healer (valithria dreamwalker for example).
---
Multiboxing is not against tos.
---
The rain in classic is just so peaceful and beautiful. The weather effects are so much more noticeable. Questing in the pouring rain in Darkshore was almost scary since I couldn't see anything hardly. Made all those nightsabers feel like a real threat. Love it!
---
except error speech. thats been off since day 1 lol
---
I'm so not changing my server. I intentionally chose one of the top populated servers in the EU.
---
Hows the price on your server?
---
There weren't mobile phone camera's in vanilla.
---
I got a blacklist message like that too a couple days ago. It went like this:
---
He says “Hey I remember you, you’re that one toxic asshole piece of shit, blah blah blah”. I respond to him “I have no idea who you are”. He then responds with, Enjoy the blacklist, no one will ever group with you again. “ 
---
Such strange people these days...
---
Wtf.
---
This makes char transfer as unattraktiv as possible to most people...
---
How does everyone move their character portraits to the lower center of the screen?????
---
you rely very much on getting hit to gain aggro. If the dps doesnt give you the extra 2-3 seconds initialy, it is understandable that you have trouble
---
I got Cookies wand at 16 or 17 and it does massive damage. Drain life gets interrupted and it costs a lot of mana. 
---
Not reading all of your documentation but seeing the wand vs drainlife chart, there seems to be a turning point around level 40ish where drain life becomes significantly stronger than most wands.
---
I find my survivability with voidwalker (early 20s now) to be much better. Two or three mobs can easily be managed, and simply dotting immo/corr/coa and finishing with wands can make you go on forever.
---
Yep. I think they have to be very careful though especially if they decide to add dungeons/raids. Naxx raid gear is so far above everything else that adding a tier above it would just skew numbers significantly.
---
Will add this to my tour list ! Thanks OP for the heads up.
---
Let's talk Rogue weapons.
---
First off, Ranged. Any reason why I would choose a bow over a gun or thrown over a gun, or knives over axes?
---
Second off, Meelee. Any reason to choose fist weapons? Any reason not to choose swords? Any reason to keep a sword in main hand and dagger in off hand? Or two swords in both hands?
---
So many salty people in here. Good job op. Hope you got something good from the chest.
---
Man, I swear it took me a whole weekend with my shit computer back in the day including all the patches etc.
---
Downloading classic I literally blinked and it was downloaded XD
---
Food is physically addicting.  Try stopping for a year if you don't believe me.
---
Starting a Troll yesterday I died on purpose in the northern cave in the starting zone after picking up a certain Pickaxe so that I could spirit rez 30 ft from the quest giver instead of running back - when I rezzed I did so in Razor Hill for some reason!
---
Pathetic
---
I'd say it depends on the situation. Sometimes it's good to go ham with sweeping strikes and 2H, sometimes you need to shield up and go def.
---
Monkeynews adapts well in dungeon runs, worth a watch. (moo\_uk on twitch)
---
Priests are broken, spirit tap ftw
---
I'm pretty sure a dude in the YouTube comments pointed this out on day 1
---
I'm relearning my muscle memory to use esdf(walk and strafe) for movement so I can reach more numericals and have Q and A open as well.
---
What professions do you have? Im only a lvl 16 rouge but have put lvling on hold and I'm spending my time now grinding my skinning/leather working. Its already paying some dividends
---
WARLOCK HEALTHSTONES ARE THE SOULS OF PEOPLE!
---
Yeah we know. They're delicious.
---
Seriously tho, I love the tidbit that I need soulshards for demon summoning and Healthstones. I'm literally sacrificing souls of others.
---
Overall best PVP class to play?
---
I have druid buffs on me basically 24/7 atm but the joke was still good
---
Depends entirely on what kind of games you enjoy, they're completely different. You have access to both with your subscription do just try both.
---
And we don't know that the expansions will be rolled out again. If they did they'd stop at the second expansion.
---
Lol comparing VW to fullfledged tanks is dumb. VW is super gimped in classic and cant even hold threat against 2 dots + wand
---
Two people - one called Goodnews, one called Badnews.
---
Shh, the more people that use ilvl addons the less people that will need on your BiS items that have a low ilvl
---
I am pretty damn sure dynamic respawns are a thing. The other day I was doing the first Defias quest in Westfall, near the hill close to where you pick the quest up. There were 4 other dudes and spawns seemed real fast, like 1 minute from each other. Eventually they finished before me and left, then I had to wait several minutes for the spawns after that despite killing at the same speed as before.
---
Yeah, I don’t get why wouldn’t you kill people in a contested zone on a PvP server. It’s part of the game and lore(?)
---
Maybe it’s because I played Rogue for so long and find it extremely fun. Rolling Mage this time though
---
Oh man, I remember saving up stacks and stacks of gold bars in my bank because I thought they were worth so much. My friend was watching me play one day and was like wtf are you doing?
---
ah to be a noob again.
---
You answered your own question, it's the dynamic spawning.
---
Yes they are in the game, they are not as rare so not as expensive. 
---
No one knows, hopefully we get separate servers to transfer copy’s of our characters to play BC&amp; Wotlk.
---
Them young lesbians, kissing in a tree
---
S’right!
---
Ran into my first one in Ravenholdt lol
---
Vanilla aggro is high for all casters. To properly heal you need threat reduction talents. Heal only when necesary.
---
If you're a priest use fade to drop all threat.
---
It might take some time for you to get used to it
---
I gotcha fam. I perma whitelisted your account.
---
I wave. If I don’t get a wave back I consider it rude behavior and kill them.
---
lol.. So,   
---
If you're waiting for someone to finish using the toilet, I can jump ahead of you as soon as they're done, because one person isn't a line?   
---
If you're waiting in the supermarket for the cashier to return, I can jump ahead of you because you're a single person and not a line?  
---
If you're waiting to use an outlet because your phone is running low and you're the only person waiting I can skip you when the socket is free because one person isn't a line?   
---
Get out of here with your either sarcastic (which i hope it was) or your incredibly ignorant comment.
---
Get auctionator. I’m lvl 19 and made 3g in 30 minutes just buying underpriced silk on the AH and reselling it.
---
You're a legend
---
I used to do that in tbc, or mind control people just to fuck with them.
---
You are right though, it's a dick move, but funny
---
A 4k queue is nothing, I sat through a 17k 9-hour queue last week.
---
They've gotten a lot better this week, people went back to work.
---
Have you watched Drakedog videos? Warlocks get some colossal crits.
---
Get grid2
---
Not an expert, but maybe try using smaller heals. And also the warrior doesnt have that many abilites yet. I think it evens out more on higher levels than 20.
---
It means its so long it needs 6 slots.
---
I put in tin ore and the eastern kingdoms lit up like a Christmas tree (almost all of it) while kalimdor looks like there are no hits on it.
---
i dont believe that for a second, sweeping strikes, greatly increased hit chance, 10% isn't enough.
---
Implying you're good enough to kill a chad gnome lol
---
Elv UI is half finished. My tooltips wouldn't show people level and I couldn't see anyone elses debuffs on target let alone their durations.
---
Use tip top and Luna and turned those elements off in elv and it works perfectly now.
---
It's buggy af. Try /rl
---
That's literally what this allows.
---
RemindMe! 6 Hours
---
Thunderclap does awful damage and super low aggro, it’s better to demo than tclap.
---
Depends on how you like to play. In 1v1 rogues are extremely dominant. In group play where you have healers, warrior is king. As a healer on horde priest is best and on alliance paladin is best.
---
I’m torn between priest and druid, I want to find groups easily at 60, either heals, tank or dps doesn’t matter to role. It would also be nice to be able to farm gold but I feel priest might be lacking in that area, but if I choose Druid I’m worried I won’t find groups easily. I just don’t want to spend weeks leveling a character and regretting it. Any suggestions would be great
---
Herod was initially picked as the streamer server, but after community backlash it was mutually agreed upon that it would switch to Faerlina instead. Herod is still popular though because it was one of the initial set of servers and the name has a lot of nostalgia for people I think.
---
/sit reckoning doesnt work here. Was a bug on private servers afaik
---
I would suspect an addon as the culprit. Disable addons and recheck.
---
Guarantee all those orc females have ganked multiple alliance. That said, grats to all you guys on the achievement :)
---
Find a good healer mate to level with.
---
My SO is leveling a priest and I m having a blast running enemies down with backup heals.
---
When she s not available, I dual box her account so I always have my healbot around. Very efficient.
---
I've been doing this randomly, cast polymorph then laugh at sheep, carry on walking. I used to do it back in the day as well.
---
Imagine being this stupid
---
I tried to get into Stalagg today in hopes that some transfers reduced wait time... NOPE LOL
---
Light wills it!
---
They were considered lacking bad in the day, but honestly, we how educated and skilled the players are compared to 15 years ago I wouldnt be surprised to see it happening
---
Don't forget to chamge your macro when.you find a new weapon/shield and make sure it's soulbound or else you'll be unarmed when starting the fight.
---
 Also you'll need adv charge talent for the buff to work. Charge only gives you 9 rage and it costs 10. Bloodrage doesn't give its rage on time to fuel the shout unfortunately.
---
Warlock is my absolute favourite class. My only concern for you is it’s probably the most similar class to a priest - a shadow priest that is (which is what I assume you’re levelling as). If that’s not an issue for you then to go for it, you’ll have a blast. 
---
Do you have tailoring/enchanting on your priest? If so it can make the Warlock experience a breeze by constantly feeding it fresh armour/wands.
---
Paladin is probably the most boring class I’ve played. I actually mained one in the original classic days and constantly wished I’d initially rolled something else haha. But it’s a pretty straightforward class with easy rotations, so might be suited for relaxing alt sessions where you’re happy to mentally switch off and auto attack mobs to death while you never come close to dying. Their armour sets on classic were pretty saucy though (but not as much as the Locks ;-) )
---
Amazing! Keep em coming &lt;3
---
Had an asshole in my WC group the other night. 
---
Joined as warrior DPS with Shield and 1H.
---
Rolled need on everything mail related. He won the blue belt from Lord Cobrahn, then won the 1H Mace from Lord Pythas then said: "Oh, I can't even use maces yet", then later rolled need on a green belt he clearly didn't actually need. When I asked him if he was serious he responded with: "Why? You jealous you can't win any rolls?" and then tried to convice the party leader to kick me the tank.
---
Overall really offputting person, tried to pull way too many mobs too quickly and very annoying.
---
But I remember people like this existed back in the days aswell. Not too worried. Ignored and done. I won't tank anything for this guy anymore.
---
If you're a priest use fade. It decreases threat
---
That's a power move right there. Well done.
---
That's alot of healed damage
---
Hunters use them for ammo. They blast through a dragon's skull like it's no big deal.
---
It's been misused for at least as long as wow has existed, so may as well get used to it.
---
This is the sense of community I signed up for
---
It is the same in PvE but in PvP you use most of your abilities especially once warriors start getting gear and eviscerate tickles them.
---
Got excited and thought that was real shit. Chests in the dwarf starting zone were no mercy. Wanted to see if I made anyone as angry and their emotes made them appear to be
---
They jacked respawns so launch week wasn't so painful.
---
This only stops the pop up. It still shows in chat for me, kindly reminding me I have channel invites blocked and still presenting me with the ad. Is there a way to disable that too? It's basically just a gold spam whisper now.
---
That’s correct, but if rogue gear drops it’s wasted, might aswell bring 1-2 rogues.
---
You need to download Map Modules for it,Atlas is just for the main part. (map addon is in the description of the main page i linked)
---
hey man..
---
very easy to answer this one, just try the nightelf priest.. healers always find groups, and if you show up u will easily get a raid spot.. trust me..
---
i always played alliance rogue, now i play horde for the first time and i love it..
---
just use the addon questie and it wont be too hard to lvl and find the mobs
---
cheers
---
Weirdly enough I opened the box before pickpocketing the key. Make sure you learned the lockpicking ability and trained it!
---
I think this will not resolve the queue issuses.... Most people on my guild I've discussed the matter with have the "let's wait for others to transfer" mentality.
---
The market decides the price. Post absurdly high everyday, drop 5% the next time
---
He looks surprised.
---
Just asked my buddy for you and he said it’s either exactly the same or such a minuscule improvement that he didn’t notice.
---
Nolife
---
Little did you know that you'd also need to learn Minting, a profession exclusive to Chinese realms. 
---
Luckily they were all too happy to share their exclusive profession with the rest of the world.
---
Which server you playing on? Exact same here on shazzrah with horde outnumbering
---
If you're a priest don't PW:S warrior unless he dangerously low
---
Classic is easy - like, really easy. Every boss in the entire "expansion" will be oneshot and killed within one hour of release. It's super easy. You could probably down every raid with 40 priests and no tanks given that the players are competent. Unfortunately people will most likely just invite warrior tanks for pugs though. But if you find a guild, do whatever you want. You'll have a hard time finding people who do not discriminate against non min-maxers though.
---
saw him by chance yesterday gave him a deserved /salute
---
well there kinda is, but only in vanilla, can't roll it in classic since they changed potential rolls during vanilla and we have the latest patch
---
So far I've had 3 Fiery and 1 HP5, need Shadow.  Thanks for those odds, I was afraid I'll get a million Fiery ones.
---
$11
---
The god damn Cities. Thunder Bluff sucks, Orgrimmar is ok i guess while Undercity is a god damn abomination of bad architecture. On the other hand Stormwind is a land mark, the perfect example of a Capital of pride. Truly the home of honor and pride. And Ironforge omfg i have no words. The legendary duels outside of its mighty gates, the warm cozy feel of gnome jokes and sweet cash flying in from the AH, while dancing on the bridges. Damn man, feels good to be home
---
I’m at 27, you need to slow down!
---
So you prefer a queue instead of playing?
---
Thought I should warn you that warrior has the absolute most painful and frustrating levelling experience. So it’s highly probable you’ll go back to your Warlock.
---
What is it about warrior that entices you so much?
---
Ask them to roll you through dungeons. 
---
They get to feel super powerful while you get all the loot and you get the quests done. 
---
It's not perfect but it's there.
---
He was my first hardcore guild leader and it was amazing. Wipe Club in my heart!  
---
Any other vanilla EU-Boulderfist people here?
---
Yes I am using details.
---
I’ll try and turn error speech on again today and if it’s still not fixed, I’ll do what u/cruxis18 did and just uninstall and get recount instead.
---
Thank you guys again you just saved what’s left of my sanity lol.
---
Btw fuck Darnassus and their hippie trees
---
Yes, the hype is going to die down
---
You're probably seeing misses, not dodge.
---
welcome home brother.
---
How? TeamViewer?
---
That’s not a Bowlcut dude lol
---
Is there a higher res  available?
---
Hey guys I hear OP is blacklisted stop commenting.
---
RemindMe! 20 hours
---
Played a protection warrior since wotlk wiht my friends inthe horde. Made all of them roll alliance so I would be a paladin. My leveling is terrible? Yes, but still loving that class.
---
Because every druids gets several PMs a day asking them to tank.
---
I beg your pardon?
---
Never played wow before kinda sad I went hinter, they sounded cool but they are pretty over saturated I've found :(
---
Lol exactly what I was thinking. I like the way you worded it though :)
---
I still constantly run into peaple who are barely past 20. Find a more casual guild if you want to enjoy the leveling experience.
---
Right, I remember now. I avoided all that stuff so I wasn't sure
---
Then he waits 30 minutes to do it again.
---
Nice, I dusted off my World of Warcraft Atlas and I'm actually using it a lot. Screw Google!
---
Well, I agree. They are not comparable but both are manageable. If it can't hold aggro with 2 dots then drop the weaker dot. And anyways, you can ditch VW at 26 and tank anything yourself by talenting to Fel Concentration and Lifedrain tanking.
---
dynamic respawn was always a thing, even back in vanilla, NO CHANGES :P
---
Collect all quests for it and go atleast once. Low lv dungeoning is a fun experience
---
Do you have the +25% wand damage from talents? That definitely helps.
---
yea 100% lag switch, you had/should report it. There were alot of people using that in Vanilla aswell.
---
Naw there’s mages fucking everywhere spamming “LF spell cleave SM speed runs” annoying af.
---
Ngl, besides the obvious joke about focusing on WoW, it'd suck hard time to be dumped by someone just because they want to play a game some more time.
---
I'd also be quite mad if my SO did the same, quite shitty thing to do.
---
Most efficient way is actually 1h + Rockbiter. But any way is fine just go off your preference
---
It is all a matter of preference, and games do it differently. In plenty of games Z is up in world coordinates. You must be thinking camera space, where Y is indeed up and Z is towards/from the viewer depending left/right-handedness.
---
I'm sure it is known which coordinate system WoW uses for its models and world since the game has been extensively datamined, but that doesn't even matter because to the player it makes no difference.
---
I remember my friends used phasing to become millionaries within a week farming seals in legion
---
then later on phasing got changed so that only people in your zone would be able to phase you
---
also typically the higher level player phased the lower level player
---
confused why these two basic mechanics aren't present with layering?
---
I did the horde version of that quest on Monday and had another rogue also there ask to group.
---
He hadn't trained pickpocket or lockpicking...
---
Hello mage buddy ! 
---
I think that murloc run too fast, even with improved blizzard etc... you may want to try other humanoids like humans or orcs, see if it majes a difference
---
GET TIDAL CHARM DUDE! NOW!
---
Well, no matter the overall quality the intend of the drawing is made clearly, I do personally like his "hmmmmm" face though.
---
Interesting. I’ll be sure to whack an ally every time I see them just to let them know I’m aware and I not looking for a fight. Hmm hamstring maybe? Or a charge.
---
mind sharing the site? I'm low on gold for my mount lul
---
Snipers take the shot
---
lol no
---
not at all
---
its simple balance adjustments so that a warrior can actually use the one CC he has when needed in a game where others all spam 30 second long CC all day
---
Wait what, so is Blizzard the ones not allowing non-RP names on the servers lol?
---
I will do! Really appreciate the thorough response. Than you
---
For ranged weapon you're just looking at whatever stats are on it, there's no abilities that use ranged weapons for a rogue.
---
If you have a bow with 5 agility and a thrown weapon with 1 agility then the bow will give you more damage regardless of the damage on them.
---
Weapon depends on spec, if you want to use fist weapons then combat has the talent for 5% crit when using fist weapons, for damage I think swords will be better but the difference won't be massive. Finding two good fist weapons will probably be more difficult than finding two good swords though.
---
If you're going sword spec two swords would be best to make full use of the sword spec talents.
---
Keep trying kiddo one day it'll work
---
I mean, they should probably take away layering a lot sooner than phase 2. But this is just dumb.
---
Is this an Avengers End Game spoiler?
---
Will do, thanks!
---
Just wait till the 40s :^ )
---
See the post on the frontpage about using Steam.
---
You will notice that asset is used in many areas up until cap. Definitely had me going wtf as a kid.
---
Da fack did I just watch lmao
---
Take my downvote and press print next time
---
It dropped yesterday for the hunter in our group!
---
I really wanna get one for when I start leveling my paladin.
---
So another way of saying Baguette would basically be "bread stick" ?
---
Slightly shittier.
---
I'm not economics major but my guess is that these would've been the primary money making methods for most players, and if only this sector of the economy is inflated then they won't be able to generate the gold necessary to buy other, not inflated things --- BOEs, repairs, potions etc
---
We didnt want you any way
---
"Holy shit"
---
Ok, and how did you do? I want to play on my phone too but cant find a satisfacting way to do it.
---
Hunters should be pumping their cooking skill, and thus, have food out the bum.
---
Nobody is transferring from what I know
---
Not yet.
---
GMs are recommending players hop layers to solve bugged quests too, so not all requests are nefarious.
---
There was a post a few hours ago from a guy who only leveled his character on his iPhone so far. Essentially, you'll want to set up something like Moonlight or Steam Link. You'll have your PC running to stream the game, and your phone as input and screen with the accompanying app.
---
You'll likely need a decent phone, a decent PC and a very good internet connection on both ends. Though, it shouldn't be too hard to set up, so you can give it a try.
---
The *miss* thing is very overblown, your white damage and rage generation with +0% hit is about the same with a 2her or DW if you have equal power weapons. Mortal Strike is worse than Bloodthirst. Your overpower hits less hard but you get nearly 4x the opportunity to use it with DW and flurry. Sweeping Strikes is nice but at the end of the day is only 5 extra attacks for 30 rage so not super powerful, and enrage, deathwish and imp execute are all very good talents.  
---
I tested both for about an hour at lvl 45 and found 10% to be about the difference.
---
 at level 32 you have collected 25% xp to level 60
---
at level 44 you have 50% to level 60
---
it gets slower and slower realy fast from 30 on
---
for example, from level 59 to 60 you need as much xp as from 1 to 12
---
Yeah, might go with mage for her. The portals will be very useful as well.
---
Stealth has a pretty small radius even for rogues in classic, but you'll be able to as long as you don't get too close.
---
Because rogues have the reputation.
---
Make a friendly emote, at least waving. If an enemy rogue does not communicate with you =&gt; he is likely an enemy, and everyone wants to prevent rogue going into stealth before the fight.
---
acutually deleting it and "reinstalling" it from another source did the trick
---
Wataru doin'?? He just wanted information!!
---
Good stuff, great to see new players immediately understand why Vanilla is the most fun version of wow :)
---
What about wow overtaking relationship advice?
---
Ranged: throwable till twenties, then get whatever gives you more stats (agi, strength, stamina, spirit, whatever), don't forget proper ammo. Use it to pull safely from a distance.
---
Melee: Your sinister strike/hemo does main hand based damage. This means that (at the same DPS) a slower weapon will be optimal, just check the damage range. The offhand is pretty much used to apply poison (level 20+), so the faster the better.
---
If you go deep combat talents, the most popular choice is swords (slow main hand and fast offhand), but any other is fine. Just take advantage of whatever talent you pick. Also there are a lot less of fist weapons.
---
I find it best to get a balance between optimal and what fits you. Playing what you like is key.
---
Nothing is changed
---
I'd love to know. I didn't get this to work yet.
---
I don't get it.
---
A rogue killing greys. Never seen that before.
---
'Druid code' = If we fight, we'll both be here until next week or until someone interrupts our 1v1
---
Or just right click on minimap icon for the quest browser.
---
I also use the exact same button layout after 15 yrs. For example, an interrupt has always been the 6 key on every toon! lol
---
* Lay a trap.
---
* Drink/Eat.
---
* Send pet to attack a dude. Then pull pet back with follow.
---
* Mob triggers trap. Spam your "YOU FELL FOR MY TRAP CARD" macro.
---
I think it's easiest to do it like this. Every time you drink, lay a trap on top of you. then pull mobs on it. It's not really that efficient to offensively trap otherwise, imo.
---
You haven't picked up Cleave?
---
There is a macro in which you feign death then place trap within combat
---
Easy. You take his character's name and run it through the neural flash frame network. Syntax the output through the encryption database and defrag the extrapolated hash with a 64bit dehumidifier. Boom, Account name obtained. 
---
Put that on a post it note and send it to Blizz HQ through pidgeon courier. BAM, blacklisted!
---
Few days ago I was doing Echeyakee, used my q item, 2 guys came up, steal my tag and then start berating me how I was 'close to steal it, but should go farm my q item'. Had no idea what to say.
---
Some people are like that, it's often visible when you're joining bigger group.
---
Annoyingly hard to get boar as a horde hunter in 20-30 lvl bracket.
---
Should be an option to turn on Floating Combat Text, in interface options, I'm fairly certain there's one in there although I'm not able to check in game at the minute.
---
avg age of the playerbase was 24 iirc during vanilla
---
WoW is a trash game only losers play it fortnite is best UwU
---
This is an exploit and It worries me that Blizzard seems comfortable with this bullshit.
---
And you made about 7-10 instance runs to get it, right?
---
Yeah it's sad, I mean they obviously have had somebody mess with them before, but if that happening makes you go around speaking to people like this you won't find folks jumping to help you.
---
At least you'll be invisible for what seems to be the duration of the Vanish buff. Had a fight with a Rogue this morning who Vanished while Marked.
---
Teabag those gnomes with pride, brother!
---
Green Whelp Armor is just the best, so sad that it doesn't work past 50...
---
Druid grind isn't slow at all.
---
Set up shop in a kindergarten and make the little ones happy with free enchants.
---
Gratz ! We wanted to do it on Sulfuron on Tuesday but not enough attuned ppl yet...
---
Hopefully we'll be following soon !
---
Think my guildie is the same. I don't know too much about wow so I dunno if there's a benefit to it
---
Either way good luck leveling, man!
---
what level is he?
---
Farmed crocs, scorpians and hyenas for 5 hours in Desolace yesterday... Between skinned leather, vender greys and all in 6 BoE greens I made about 30g in 5 hours.
---
Don't know if it was worth it or not but going to buy my mount when I am home from work today
---
Is that the armor that puts attackers to sleep?
---
I sent money by mail to my own character, but I didn't receive any mail. I've tried to send mail without money and I received that message... What do I have to do to  get my money?
---
I can't wait to go back. One if my fave zones from ehen I started.
---
 I don't think this post is real at all :)  
---
good try chum
---
Definitely
---
Honestly I'd probably just emote at them angrily a bunch, fully expecting to die
---
Miss
---
Does /follow work in battlegrounds?
---
grats ima have to apply now
---
wait, you can fear tagged mobs but i cant poly tagged mobs? life is not fair :(
---
Extraordinary that you feel threatened by that.
---
They gotta be selling those accounts at a certain point.
---
Yeah it was, but wasn't anything like zone wide instant respawns we had on Classic launch. Very convenient *bug* for them to fix. It's not like anyone's complaining though. It's far less of a change than layering.
---
Maybe they just snuck it in there though!
---
plot twist, his first char is the bottom one
---
Gotta be a horrible experience
---
Not sure if sarcasm
---
r/freefolk
---
Should just start from your warlock trainer
---
I’ve done it plenty in low level dungeons so far and it feels so nice to pop out of cat form and either use that 10 minute cool down taunt or heal the tank at the last second
---
We wont't be starting in a whilre, since we are on vacation. What i will say is that I will try to steer her away from Warrior and Rogue, due to the timing and reaction time they require to not be complete garbage. However, if that's what she really wants I won't strand in the way.
---
It's laggy but not really noticeable. I have about 215ms latency average. I did nothing different than you when downloading and playing the game. Straight from tbe battle.net launcher. My region is set to NA. If I want to, I could choose to play on an oceanic server for less latency but none of my friends do, so I suffer a little so they don't.
---
That’s because the item was bought out :)
---
You can rebid on items otherwise.
---
Level 40 with 250 herbalism, everywhere I go I get gray herbs. Just made my way to Tanaris, should be a lil better now.
---
how do you see the full list?
---
I can’t i keybinded my printscreen button :(
---
Haha thats what you get for Standing next to a campfire when you log out xD /s
---
Top guilds exploiting raid xp and mats to shit on people who actually enjoy the game wooooo!
---
It's time for people to understand that Druid and Paladin tanks, feral dps, enhancement dps, ret dps, etc... Are all viable enough nowadays.
---
The biggest problem is going to be to find a guild with a leader that thinks the same.
---
So I wouldn't worry about when to actually join a raid, but start looking for guild leaders that are open minded enough to actually consider bringing you in the first place.
---
EVERY expansion. There's a fuck ton of them and they all cost upwards of $5. Most even in the $10 to $20 range. You can go to some pretty great dinners for less than $500.
---
spend way to long looking at the shadows and wondering what was wrong...
---
Yep, you can, as long as you can find the item again. 
---
If you got out bud because someone did a buyout though, the item will no longer be listed.
---
So what? It’s cool I remember farming it back then in vanilla and being so happy having full set. Let that man be happy
---
This makes me angry and I can’t help it
---
I know, thats the reason I asked if reckoning is viable without /sit bug.
---
nobody on my server read this.
---
Enchanting mats always seem to be an easy RoI (although I haven't tried anything higher than magic essence so far).
---
I've been buying greater magic essence at about 12 per, turning that into 3 lesser essences, crafting lesser magic wand, and selling for 7.5-8s each.  I make about 150% of what I spend (assuming all my current wands sell). Going to look into tailoring bags and seeing what the RoI is there.  This isn't viable to get all the way to 100g or whatever, but is easy way to build up some capital for bigger investments.
---
What level creeps are you hitting? I have the Runic Darkblade at lvl 24 and don't 3 hit Lvl 24s.
---
Much obliged, you gave me exactly the kind of answer I looked for. Thank you.
---
??
---
It's worse when they don't wipe after you already vanished :D
---
I know I had an addon for this way back when but cant remember which one it was. It cant have been WA because if it took any time at all to setup I know I would not have bothered.
---
I will look into this and others when I get home from work, its really easy to miss those procs.
---
Ah nice job trying to weasel your way out of that blacklist with this post.
---
Not gonna work on me buddy.
---
Yea I'd be pretty pissed too... but you gotta be thinking, if the relationship is worth breaking up over WoW... Wtf were you doing with them anyway.
---
Shazzrah-EU has ques starting from 13:00-14:30 with petty 1200-1700 ppl and peaking at 5000-9000 closer to the evening. Given it drastically decreased from 20-24k mark, which I’m really happy about.
---
You must be new here.
---
No by a long mile.  
---
That's geared SL locks and Shadow Priests overall.  
---
For spriests especially, that's their entire shtick, 1v1's.  
---
Rogues are also countered by warriors, paladins, hunters, druids and go even with mages.
---
&gt;Not minted. Go mint it.
---
We can't be condoning committing crimes in here
---
The final bits of Wetlands, Thousand Needles, Duskwood and even some in Redridge. The early parts of STV, Arathi, Hillsbrad. Most importantly, grind some parts of the levels, and don't forget do instances: you can do Gnomeregan and Razorfen Kraul, and Scarlet Monastery Graveyard and Library with a decent group.
---
If you find a decent spot, grinding is surprisingly quick and not too tedious at all (imo). Depending on your route taken, 28-32 is a bit of a hole.
---
There are a bunch of nice long chains to do for good quest rewards, which I recommend picking up if you haven't done them yet, such as:
---

If you're leveling with a buddy, get started on the materials for [Whirlwind Weapon](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=1792/whirlwind-weapon), starting with the trolls in STV and moving on to the elementals in Arathi (I recommend a group for these at level 30-35).
---
Im dealing with bad response from the servers, when Im looting it takes a while before it takes all the stuff, sometimes healing just cast bar goes through and I move somewhere and it heals me after while. During fights its bad often
---
When I played Tichondrius in Vanilla stranglerhorn vale was sometimes dominated so hard by Alliance on weekends that they had raids setup to cover the graveyards and surround Gromgol basecamp. There was nothing horde could do about it. That server did change a lot over time.
---
Happens to me fairly regularly when the servers are packed, when i log in during off peak times (morning) its fine.
---
Someone doesn't know how to time-line.
---
/golfclap pretty much exists for those situation
---
But.. Is Azeroth.. Flat?!
---
*makes Hank Hill noises*
---
remember lifeless stones sell to vendors for silver
---
I kinda see wpvp as zonecontrol for your own faction to quest or farm.  
---
So its everyones responsibility. (Easy justification for murdering)  
---
How hard can it be to justg roup up with ppl in zones of great danger if your questing? The tiem u spend sharing xp and qitems most likely is worth it compared the downtime of death.
---
It is completely different. Disc doesn't heal from damage in vanilla. That's shadow priest territory.
---
I just had a whole dungeon where the warrior would charge in before I could even auto attack the first mob. He never died, but he has a ton of aggro the whole dungeon and it was just tough for me to get it back. I almost let the last boss kill him when he tried that but I’m not that vindictive
---
Oof. 
---
My bad hahaha
---
I hope so, I sure do. 
---
It sucks that people like you are allowed to help the gold farmers here. 
---
Not sure if kiddo is meant as a insult, I’m probably older then you 🙂
---
Yes you did, most people had much fewer alts back then.
---
Wish I knew where mine were, I kept the classic and TBC disks for ages but must've lost them when moving appartments. Maybe I'll be able to reclaim my first account with those.
---
These kind of things become increasingly more valuable after the twinking scene starts to settle in.
---
If you want to make money off of this, your best bet would be to store it on the bank and wait 6-12 months before selling it.
---
Right now, people just don't have the money to buy this axe at it's justified value, so you're not going to be able to sell it for much. Also, there's no real need for it to be bought because people are leveling their mains.
---
At a certain point in time, twinks will start popping up, and people will have had enough time to farm money on their mains that they will start considering buying things like this.
---
Also, within that time frame, this axe will have had a more stable price, so it wouldn't be as much as a guess to decide how much to ask for it.
---
&gt; Some cell towers block port 0 which stops Steam link from working.
---
Port 0 is the a reserved port and has nothing to do with the application layer. It's usually used as a way to signal to the OS that you want a randomly available port. You can't route traffic over port 0.
---
I think you read him wrong on purpose. He didn't say people should stop trying to have better gear, but that there is no need to require everyone to have BiS or ultra optimisated gear and spec for running dungeons or raids, because guilds shown us what mattered was not being dumb as a rock, not being super high-level or ultra geared.
---
Or mayb I bring out better of ppl.
---
Of Course those guilds are way more experienced, I just remember that our Group back then raided in mostly blues and a few Greens. Of Course Progress is easier if everyone wears "BIS" but its not a must, especially today where most of the People know what they are doing.
---
i kill every alli on sight i dont care about the level, we are at war
---
I think it takes an hour when sending items
---
Blizzard and Cone of Cold are acting differently to what they did in vanilla.
---
Yah but it's a pain if you wipe :)
---
Something to do with layering for sure
---
Yes, fishing in Booty Bay (1g book) and cooking is in Ashenvale in that building at the pond south-east of Astranaar (1g book as well) - fora Alliance.
---
Those are easy to get (except for the cash) for sub 30-35 - the hard one is first aid in Stromguard castle in Arathi Highlands....
---
They could just make the bosses harder &amp; new mechanics and add higher stated gear just like they do rolling out BWL, AQ, NAx...
---
I only buy a new weapon once in a while. Even then I don't go for anything above 2g 😅
---
You cant fail classic, thats the beuty of it.
---
There are people who go all hardcore and people who take it slower. Everyone is winning.
---
I mean there's a big difference between ultra @ 30fps and ultra at 144+ fps
---
Something like this:  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0zZVhtI0zL](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0zZVhtI0zL) then. It doesnt matter much though, im sure you will be able to hold threat fine with just consecration from holy (and ret aura). Just be sure to use max rank cons at pull, then lower when fighting to conserve mana. 
---
This build  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0uzxZVhtI0zvo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0uzxZVhtI0zvo) should let you heal effectively in raids even and you will still be able to tank 5man/10man at 60 with tank gear. 
---
Either way, it will still be slower than ret to level in prot spec, but as you say, you duo level with a mage so the first build shouldnt be much of an issue with questing time anyway.
---
how?
---
/join *name*
---
you cannot join other town or zones chat channels no, the only real global ones are going to be LookingforGroup which is an official in-game channel, or world if somebody made it, however world will be owned by somebody (unlike Pservers) and they can moderate it as they please.
---
It's something that blizzard wants to avoid doing. But if 2 realms are equally dead, and have a suitable faction balance (either both 50/50 or one is 30/70 and the other is 70/30 or something) then the realms will merge.
---
Blizzard doesn't like it because it's a lot of headaches to solve the name and guild name conflicts etc.
---
Of course it's crowded at 8pm. People are done with dinner and not yet in bed.
---
Do the chances of getting green drops and grey vendor items from mobs get lower if I'm higher level than them? Let's say I'm level 36 and I kill level 32 mobs.
---
The cat should be faster
---
Convince them to level a char with you that they only logon on with when you play.
---
go to the cave in southern wetlands, there is a quest ore there than anyone can mine, it has like 40 spawns in the cave with a fast repsawn, you can easily grind up the gap to iron there.

---
Dude. Game's been out for over a week. How do you not yet have 300 hours sunk into your Mage alt that farms for your level 5 Warrior main?
---
Understandable. Though in some areas the shadows makes the zone super atmospheric. Like my favourite zone, Duskwood.
---
or hold onto them until they are sellable?
---
What other services do you provide?
---
My pet is strong enough to win every 1 on 1 on same lvl at least. 1 lvl above as well but depends on the type of mob a bit. Which is great for farming. Send pet, Hunters mark, Loot mob, Skin mob, run to pet and mob is already at 50% HP. Start auto shot, send pet to next mob, rinse and repeat. No downtime what so ever.
---
So you're saying you're still getting rage when not hitting your attacks, just not where you want to.
---
Damn that's almost full price. Any idea where your money went before 40?
---
I believe in phase 2 the Honor system gets implemented, but no BGs yet. If I remember correctly, they start getting added in phase 3.
---
no every kill just rolls loot
---
I’m a pretty good tank tbh
---
I killed the same warrior 4-5 times in swamp of sorrows just like this. It feels bad at a certain point
---
Gj man! Managed to get 3/5 for myself and it fel like acomplishment to see that sweet set bonus. Good luck in future drops!
---
&gt; today where most of the People know what they are doing.
---
Maybe you haven't been looking at this subreddit for the past week and a half then.
---
As long as none of these mobs were mages then it is doable... but taxing on your sanity...
---
Can you please ecplain what lag switch is? I was killed by a feral druid in the same way, he moved so fast i didn't know how to react.

I don't believe sharing an account among family is against ToS. This came up with Jokerd's 60 run and it was stated it was not against ToS for his brother to play

29 here, spent the first week sitting in queues all day, rerolled to a low server so I could actually play
---
Not from a Jedi
---
Im ready to clear my schedule for an entire day and do a full run. Lol
---
Without layering all areas would be full of people and you wouldnt be able to kill mobs.
---
Layering is fine and temporally. It can be improved but it's fine.
---
I don't like to wait 30 mins to kill 20 mobs to finish my quest! If people are abusing the system, it's ok, you can do that too. Ask for an invite in your guild when your area is overwhelmed.
---
Layering would be bad if it was permanent. But they will remove it soon, so it just helps people to play their game and not to wait and /pray to find mobs to kill.
---
**Even with layering there are areas that are full of people, imagine that without layers.**
---
Nice one. I also forgot that we used to play in 4:3 or 5:4 aspect ratio back then. I also don't remember when I made the switch to 16:10.
---
but I won it with the same roll being the second person :o
---
Level definitely matters. Warriors scale great towards the end. https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/czpn6n/my_personal_classic_wow_mobile_different_networks/ez1t8a5/
---
&gt;The game's rage per dmg coefficient only scales up 6.15x, meantime a geared L60 Warrior has 30x more health than a L10 one. An attack that takes off 10% of your health at 60 will give you around 6.5 rage. It would only give you around 1 rage at L10. Your attacks still all cost the same amount though.
---
I found a false wall without collision that just plumets to doom.
---
i cant find it...where did you get it from? thanks!
---
Yes, it's 1 in a million for 3 people to roll 36, it's 1 in 10000 for 3 people to rolle the same thing.
---
But to answer your question, the game rolls again in the background.
---
That’s still a waste, you really don’t need it. You get plenty of good weapons from quests etc. look up weapon progression if you feel like it :)
---
And if you cant alone, crew it
---
If you keep it up to date as you level, the gear you craft can fill in spots you lack, specifically Shining Steel Breastplate, Silver Bronze Shoulders early on. Later you can craft resist plate for raiding.
---
What do you need the rep for? I don't think you'll be exalted before you have the level to go through Feralas and Felwood.
---
Frostbolt slows and occasionally freezes enemies, which makes up for its relatively lower damage (though it should still be significantly better than your wand).
---
For Arcane Missiles to work you need to invest in arcane tree to get interrupt protection (or else you'd only get a fraction of a cast off when mobs are in your face) which is just less efficient since you miss out on AoE farming and all the utility frost provides.
---
I suppose he could Hug them with Daggers :)
---
Unfortunately, Both of your options there sound like they REALLY gimp you. I think losing AR would be the better of the 2.
---
I'm about the same as you. 36.5 with just under 50g in the bank, and I've been grinding since 33. Not sure if I can make the remaining 40g in 3.5 levels, if not I'll just start questing again and get it at 41 or 42. Cheetah aspect will be good enough until then
---
Thanks! I must have missed it somehow as I try and go back to the trainer every few levels, especially at level 20. Every time I googled it I could only see what Blizzard does and not how to get it. I guess I will stick with my missiles for now but maybe I will see how it changes later. Its cheap enough to buy both anyway.
---
&gt; Shamans make awesome tanks. Kinda disappointed they can’t tank at 60. Had pulling like a mofo and doing great in BFD
---
They can tank at 60 and even do raids. It just requires more attention and a good guild to pull it off. I suggest [this.](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150)
---
? Hamstring walk away
---
Did not know that trick, thanks for sharing!
---
How did you set this up???
---
not a single Tauren
---
Possibly not? I will have to visit the mage trainer again and figure it out, maybe I missed something! Thank you.
---
That's the real achievement. A group of 5 to clear Deadmines without planning it ahead of time.
---
15% discount at revered vs 10% at honored, that's 5g less for my mount. If it's not too far out of the way it could be easier than doing 5g worth of quests elsewhere.
---
Shouldn't be too hard to make. But as stated under, there's an addon for that.
---
I see his computer is also from 2004. I admire his dedication to nostalgia!

Was not only a bug on private servers. It used to work on vanilla back then. Google kazzak reckoning bomb one shot etc. 
---
It wasnt as much a bug as it was an exploit of game mechanics
---
always won through countries.
---
Another way to play is by reaching 'fat joe'.
---
I always took it like you smashed in their skulls so much that they're unusable.
---
The chance to roll 3 times the same number is (1/100)^2. The chance to roll 3 times 36 is (1/100)^3. But I assumed it was the former case you were referring to
---
People are probably not going to like this, but in the end, it's true. I have truly forgotten about the frustration of being killed by alliance that are a) higher leveled b) kill you while mobs are pulled or c) kill you while your HP is low anyway. So why would I not return the favor? They don't mind doing it to me, so why would I? Of course there's players out there that are nice and want to quest in peace, but... That's kind of the deal of a PVP server. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.

Considering how often me and my friends went to each other to play together, looking at IP information would be a bad way to determine if an account was being shared.
---
It is, the messages are silly random garbage.
---
Even though it will still show up in the chat log. . . least it gives me a reason to go into the social panel and block that player.
---
The thing with the butcher its very slow, so the dmg is very high, so your abilities which scale on weapon dmg need a slow high dmg weapon in main hand. 
---
Tell us your main hand weapon attack **38 - 72 Damage**
---
but i'm quite sure Nothing beats the butcher ....
---
Relationship advice is spiking solely on people asking how to deal with their significant others playing classic wow 10 hours a day.
---
My favorite thing to do right now is to stealth behind unsuspecting casters, wait until they sit down to drink, and show them that when you're sitting, attackers get 100% crit against you.
---
Bloodrage generates 10/12/15 rage immediately and another 10 over the next 10 seconds, enough to do a shout immediately  after using it so you don't need adv. charge talent to do it.

I guess I should have been more clear in my post sorry about that. I meant for the leveling process.  Thanks for your answer for 60 though!

Links dead :(
---
Honestly, you hit the nail on the head with saying you aren’t pushing for the most top end world first, top 1% parse. That being said, if you really enjoy pvp, I would just setup the pvp spec you like and it will honestly do fine in most pve circumstances, especially just around the world stuff. 
---
If all you are doing is dropping into a casual MC run, as long as you keep your uptime good and play the spec as optimally as it can, you’ll be fine.
---
Ah that makes sense. I could never do that 😅 I even skin every single mob.
---
&gt; Leveling a warrior at the moment currently level 20 (only able to play few hours a week at the moment) it's painfully slow.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I played back in BC upto the start of cata mostly as a tank was a druid bear and a paladin.
---
&gt; Started warrior as heard they are the best (only viable tank) in classic.
---
&gt; Is it possible to have a paladin as a tank or is it true that these are the bottom pick from warrior and druid.
---
&gt; End game would be looking to get into raiding guild/groups.
---
&gt; Am I best to stick with the warrior and grind it out even though not having fun with it so far.
---
&gt; Or go against all the stigma and go the prot pally.
---
Paladins can tank raids, but its all a matter of how much effort you put into it to make it work. I don't suggest it for new new players to wow classic though.
---
Also shining steel breastplate and both Silver Bronze Shoulder and Helmet make some good stuff to sell at the AH to make money for the mount BTW
---
If you think that's being an ass then you're the problem.
---
The most dickish thing I did was finding this Dwarf who was running south in the Barrens (around my level), the poor fucker had Ress sickness, I decided to be a friendly player and sent him back to give a complaint

---
I would look at it mostly from a percentage standpoint. The butcher does over 25% more dps. It also has a bigger number for the top end of its damage range making it a better main hand weapon (so your special abilities like sinister strike hit harder). I doubt a few attack power is worth losing that.
---
Don't forget that the agi on the butcher gives you  a little bit of attack power, crit chance, and dodge chance. The stam is nice while leveling too.
---
Just send him to the nothing ever happens subreddit shadow realm thing
---
That’s what I say all the time!
---
All the zhevra running around the Barrens with only one hoof, too.
---
I'm pressing on, looking for the strong specimens with skulls.
---
I didn't even know you could get a bigger mount discount than the 10% other than the PVP Rank 3 discount.
---
So... Many... Warriors... I don't get it, I truly don't.  Why are half the fucking players warriors?! Surely it can't be fun.... I know it isn't, I'm one myself. But I'm one because of a personal ambition, I want to tank Four Horsemen in vanilla naxx.. I don't get why the other 39.9999% of my server seems to be playing them. They're AWFUL levelers, and they only become top tier dps in full gear, which isnt something you can count on in vanilla. WHY?
---
TinyTooltip. Very customisable
---
I think I'll do it the other way around. Quest to 40 and grind for mount.
---
Yea I know but you said herbs are rarely sold. Wild Steelbloom also seems to sell fairly well, though the price has been dropping since last week.
---
Cool drawing. It's got a nice atmosphere to it.
---
I actually had a gm fuck me over on his last day, he was just fed up and overworked. I only found about this because he got chewed out about this case, and there was a review over my ticket. Long story short, my email got compromised, and they got into my account 3x in a day. I locked it down, got an authenticator and when i contacted blizzard support, the GM told me in short "since you have proven you are incapable of securing your account, we will not be removing the lock" I couldnt access my [battle.net](https://battle.net) account at all, which effectively locked me out of all my blizzard games.   
---
Fast forward 6 years later, I'm working in a NOC with a lot of ex blizzard employees and share my story, coworker asks "was your toons name X?" (pretty unique name) I go yes and start laughing. Apparently they used my ticket and the way this guy acted as an example of how NOT to handle tickets for new trainees after that event. He suggested I open a new ticket, they gave me WoD and all previous xpacs i had missed for free, and 60 days of free gametime once they saw how my previous ticket had been handled. AND they left all the items and gold the goldfarmers had gotten when they had my account lol. So now I have an account that has roughly 200k gold that i havent touched in over half a decade. (granted idk if thats a lot anymore)
---
Ah ok, do you recon I roll on the same server as my main for gold otherwise im kindof tempted trying out alliance
---
Once people start twinking it will be worth a fortune.
---
Its the min-maxers that are affecting the game, it is a complete joke.
---
They should go back to retail if they want to maximize their efficiency or quest alone in classic.
---
This is also the reason why i rather want to create my own groups.
---
Such a shame..
---
That's quite depressing. Donate 30c a month to feed a crippled zhevra
---
Crazy not a single Tauren Warrior
---
Not at all. You'll face Ragnaros, Nefarian, C'thun and Kelthuzad. Maybe in 5 years for Wrath of the Lich King Classic \^\^
---
(Not so) Funny when you meet your Boss ingame - in working time...
---
Oh man. How dickish would it be to just hang out in level 20-30 zones and drain all the casters mana. Find one and just follow them, draining their mana and fearing if they start getting close to town. 
---
I feel like griefing was against ToU at one point.
---
it happens, it was worst for me on launch day, but I haven't really experienced it lately.

Update it through Github they update that constantly. The tooltip bug got fixed but it's still in progress. It's hard work if you really want to use this addon tinkered with it for 4 days to finally get it how I like it
---
I'm trying to decide if it was worse back in the day.  Now it's a cross of old school cats who get it, and absolute fucking bellends with zero  self awareness or social skills.
---
Running very well on 4-5 hours since years. How much sleep people need is very individual and also a thing of habit. If you do lazy stuff you'll get lazy. If you're always on the fence your Body will adapt to it, which is no problem till you're 40, after that i'll take it easier.

Shouldn't it be 5/10/15/20 depending on reputation? Or that wasn't the case in classic? Guess I'll find out soon enough.

I would comment on this thread, but Wataru said I'm not allowed to talk to you.
---
wow, how much data are u using for this?
---
Redridge duskwood and wetlands, you're going to end up doing all of them.
---
You won't do them from start to finish as the quests will out level you, so start them in that order and move on when you start to struggle, coming back later to finish the zones off.
---
There's a concerning amount of people talking about maintaining shared server shitlists where people using it don't group with anyone on the list and don't invite them into guilds.
---
Hopefully the idea will due to its lack of practicality, lack of a shared consensus and general recognition that it's a fucking terrible idea that's so wildly open to abuse by power tripping list editors.
---
One of the good things about the way classic allows server communities to form is the fact that communities naturally become self-enforcing and push out people who abuse that community. The toxic issues and drama occur when that power to enforce is put in the hands of a few people. The list pushers don't realise that, because all they can see is the "good" that a blacklist can do when it's in ***their*** hands, which incidentally is exactly the sort of person who shouldn't have that sort of power, like the douche canoe in the screenshot.
---
Im tanking on my first ever wow go, this is pretty helpful. I am focusing on 2 handed weapons, is that right to do? Or are we saying shield and 1 hand is the way to go? I keep slapping all my talent points on arms... seems like a good plan so far.

I could my first level 60 there back in the day. I was around 54 or 55, and saw two alliance dueling. Timed it right and got a lucky hit in as the duel ended and killed him. The guy he was dueling just laughed, bowed, and ran off.

43 Shaman ganked my 37 ass in STV whilst I was on about 15% health fighting a gorilla. Spread this message.
---
Uhmm that's what I'm saying right? He and his brother got there after the other group. I would be considerate and wait, not kill the other group to get the escort at their cost. What are you saying?
---
The problem is the hype cycle games lives through their life. Game are hyped in the begining and population stabilize over time.
---
A great chunk of people already left as we see by reduced queue on serv. 
---
Another great chunk of people will leave around lvl 40 because of how sluggish the pexing experience is around those level. 
---
Another chunk will just get bored of the game.
---
If you enough servers to not have insanely long queue and no layers then good luck picking a serv not dead in a month. On the other hand, having few server&amp;insane queue&amp;no layers in order to be sure to have healthy pop, then you deal with bad PR from everywhere and Blizzard don't want this..
---
Moreover, Pserver don't really care about population control when you see mega serv with 10k concurent player. Vanilla is not designed to have so many players so blizzard try to get around 3k concurent player for the serv to be healthy

A lot of people want me to kiss them...

I'm guessing he started fighting the Tauren..
---
I work full time, go to school full time, and have a wife and 2 young kids...the struggle to fit wow in is real.
---
There you go 4 work Days a 6h in a week ist not very typical full time Job. Make it 5 Days a week a 8h + travel and its a different game.
---
What about the rogue code?
---
Poorly

God only knows what I'd do without you.

---
What unit frames are those? I like the minimalistic, simple style.
---
Sometimes cross faction help is a thing. I've been in a similar situation back on retail vanilla. I was doing a big chain quest on my rogue at around level 45. While in Aszhara out of no where a UD rogue unstealths. He does the same thing pointing at the elite mobs I need to kill.  Dude helped me for well over an hour. I'll never forget the dude, his name was like Cryptic, I believe.

**Basic Information**
---
Server: Firemaw (EU PvP)
---
Guild Type: Semi Hardcore Raiding
---
Raid Nights: Monday, Thursday and Sunday
---
Raid Times: 8:30pm to 11:30pm CET
---
**About us**
---
The main focus of our guild is our community. We prioritise building and maintaining a community of friendly players that are willing to support their guildmates above all else. We believe that having a group of supportive players is a huge benefit in Classic as there is such a focus on cooperative play and that ultimately having a friendly group of players at hand will ensure we all get the most enjoyment out of the game.
---
When you are levelling, we want a community to be there to help you with that quest or to kill that Alliance dog who has been corpse camping you. At endgame, we want to gear up together and have fun doing so.
---
Although we do not have an age requirement as such, we are an adult guild. The majority of our guild are 25/30+ so should you wish to apply please take that into consideration.
---
**Raiding**
---
We plan to start endgame content as soon as we can. We intend to host raids on Monday, Thursday and Sunday 20:30 - 23:30 CET for progression raids, although we do not expect we  will usually need all 3 days to clear available content (particularly during early phases)
---
If you do sign up, we expect you to be on time and prepared. That said, by no stretch of the imagination are we a hardcore raiding guild that’s pushing for world firsts or expecting players to sink every minute of their time into Classic. We're all a bit older now with life stuff going on. Our goal is to clear the content before the next patch roles out but also enjoy it, so know your class and bring your best.
---
Although the guild is fairly young, we have filled the majority of our raiding roster. We do still have some spaces available and our needs for each class can be found on our website. However, if you see your class listed as low priority or even closed, we are always open for exceptional candidates so feel free to still apply.
---
For loot we're adopting a fair and transparent Loot Council system for raiding with a management team that’s been running raiding guilds for nearly 15 years.
---
We also have future plans for alt raids, however this will be much further down the line.
---
**Other guild activities**
---
Whilst our main focus will be on raiding we also plan to host some PvP events. A lot of our current guild members and I love Classic's PvP content! We are hoping to do some World PvP, Battlegrounds and to raid capital cities. There has also been an expressed interest for twinks by current members, so I imagine we will have a community on this as well.
---
**Member expectations**
---
We only expect members to be friendly to each other, willing to help their fellow guildies and be able to have a laugh while doing so. If you're raiding then we have separate expectations such as turning up on time and so on. If you feel like this could be the guild for you then please visit our website https://rising.shivtr.red/. You will need to let us know a little about yourself to ensure that we share the same values. If you have any additional questions, or would just like to have a chat please do contact us directly on discord @Boo#0059, @GlenCoco#3702, @mizi#3868 or @QFierced#7447.

Do you have any idea how much 64 bit dehumidifiers cost? Not all of us can afford to blacklist accounts with the premium prices of fantasy electronics...
---
I transferred from skeram horde side. Honestly my only reason for transfer was my entire guild and playgroup was transferring. I like it on skeram and I'm nervous this new server will be too low pop, but we will see how it pans out. Hopefully if this server dies they have paid realm transfers
---
Gotcha, thanks for the info!
---
You mean the warrior ones?
---

---
Bindings can be the weapon cant be obtained until bwl anyway
---
Man I miss the days of grinding hours like these.. Make the most of it man before you got to work, wash, eat, spend time with gf and family with not even an hour a day to game! Well done though man, well worth the grind.
---
I call BS on this. DeadMines on Day 1 is really unbelievable.
---
Ah, the memories... I remember setting up a Mind Control Cap rotation while battling alliance for Emeriss back in the days.
---
(Green Dragon world boss, the annoying mushroom on death one).
---
two - you can escort another one
---
Haha yes!!!
---
  It was changed 0.6 of vanilla. "Players can no longer use ghost form as a means to travel to far off locations. Having a spirit healer resurrect you in a graveyard other than the one you appeared at when you died, will always teleport you back to that initial graveyard." 
---
  There were ways to get around this like logging to reset to the one you're at instead of the one you started at. Whether that works or not hasn't been tested to my knowledge.
---
It's worth rerolling if you think that's what will bring you enjoyment. It's a game bruh
---
Thanks guys, useful info and think I'll stick it out.
---
Do people actually buy often from AH at the moment?
---
Also I'm guessing armourer will be better than weapon master? or whatever the profession paths are called haha
---
It mostly because of repair costs or getting camped that I never wanted to join a PvP server in late BC (when I first started).
---
I'll keep this in mind tho.
---
Unless you're going to take it somewhat seriously races aren't that big of a deal. Any class could be good for you. I would just suggest watching some videos about picking a class. They will breakdown the interesting differences for a new player.
---
Do you like melee or ranged? Damage or utility? Interested in managing pets or not so much? Do you want to sneak about or charge in? Be annoying to kill or dangerous to be around? Answering these questions may help steer you toward a good choice.
---
I think it's now grey out since a couple of patches ago. Vendor it!
---
I use buffwatch

You had no good reason for taking a phone screenshot
---
how does threat work in duengons? i always get focused hard as a mage(lvl32) whenever i cast flamestrike or blizard or anything that does a lot of aoe damage or whenever i crit hard.. what should i do?  sometimes i die too and it gets annoying
---
I played the pacifist as well, waves and bows for all. Until a paladin decided to wait until i was drinking with around 180 hp to attack me and dance on my corpse. After that the gloves went off and me and some buds went on a rampage through STV.
---
The funniest thing about that is they used you as an example for years, yet it never occurred to anyone there that being proactive and contacting you themselves would be a good idea.
---
Just add engineering!
---
That's 100% true. After i finished school i was sleeping for ~10h a day for almost a year. Then i got enlisted in the army and since then i adapted to sleeping ~6h a day.
---
Unsure, I'm a shaman so all my macros include rank since I often de-rank spells. Without rank it SHOULD default to highest rank, but I included it simply because I do not know and don't want to spread false information, I know 100% this works, I'm about 80% sure it works without rank. Can you confirm for me?
---
I'm surprised at the amount of warriors I've seen, yet every LFG message is people looking for tanks. Hmm...
---
You mean rllrmrmgmr mlgrmrllmlmrmrglllglr generator.
---
Today I tried "body pulling" (I was out of throwing knives) a mob and pulled his beefier orange ghoulish friend too. So I popped vanish and instead of the mobs evading back to their original spot they aggroed instantly to this poor tank who was already beating down mobs a bit down the hill. I think he survived? I hope so anyway.
---
Just using Elvui classic
---
Horde has to wait for tbc
---
Cant both ambush and backstab though
---
It doesn't, unfortunately
---
😂
---
&gt; Do people actually buy often from AH at the moment?
---
Yes, strike while the iron is hot as people will soon have what they need and level out (by soon, I mean probably 3 months. People will continue to roll alts until they find a class they enjoy.)
---
Armorsmith is superior for pve raiding, weaponsmith will be superior for pvp.
---
He's using the SteamLink which you can Stream to your TV instead of your phone if you want. It also has USB ports for a mouse/keyboard, Xbox controller, or PS4 controller.
---
So yeah, as long as you have a solid connection (preferably wired, but strong WiFi will work), you could play on whatever TV your console is plugged into.
---
You could go one further if wanted and install the ConsolePort WoW add-on, which makes the game decently tolerable on a controller, lot more function/ease of use than OP's mobile phone setup.
---
this guy just experienced a WoW classic gank. Welcome to old pvp WoW my friend. You now understand why we fight the alliance with such ardor
---
Heard of that one before, tried it at a random page of book 6 iirc, it was indeed hilarious !
---
/Cast !Attack should also work (not near a pc to test this though)
---
Bloodrage and battle shout gives huge amounts of aggro, i suggest staying in defensive stance and do this rotation. range pull &gt; LoS if possible (let the mobs come to where you wanna tank them) &gt; bloodrage &gt; battle shout &gt; demo shout and then spam revenge/sunder and shield block if youre taking too much dmg.
---
Leveling with prot isnt bad imo, defense skill is OP
---
Same on my server, I'm playing Warrior but try to avoid doing more than 1 dungeon a day, tanking in classic is miserable and not fun at lower levels right now, everyone's retailed trained.
---
You shoot a bow at an enemy that probably misses, and your range dps have unloaded before it reaches you, so you spend the fight basically running around taunting off CD with no rage, not fun at all, more enjoyable to quest.
---
So my slow enjoyment of leveling needs to end. Im 34 and guild is starting to ramp up recruitment and i really want my preraid bis before raiding starts. The amount of warriors is getting up there a little and i need to compete. Whats the fastest way to level from here on out?
---
Horde needed a pretty race to balance the population (vanilla had a huge imbalance in favor of the alliance). Originally, Blizzard were going to introduce both high elves for the alliance, and blood elves for the horde with TBC, but abandoned that idea due to being too World of Elfcraft, and it being counter productive to balancing the factions. After that, they went in a different direction when adding new races. As for classic+, I’m not sure what they’ll do with blood and high elves. Right now the little bit of data seems to point towards the servers being balanced, as many people seem to transfer their post vanilla horde loyalty to classic, and rolling horde. So introducing the blood elves again in classic+ or classic: tBC would probably heavily tilt the population into a horde bias (much like present retail). I guess it will be a tricky decision whenever blizzard decide to move forward with classic+
---
Just leave it on 24/7
---
Shift rightklick buff that you dont wanna see it adds them to a blacklist 
---
Or go under options and add them yourself
---
Yes! That's still the case even in BfA (highmountain tauren obviously get one too)
---
Those people are idiots. Enjoy!
---
What software are you using
---
In vanilla this is how mage pvp was against druids and priests. You would be oom trying to dps them down and they would just out heal it.
---
At Least until I got some naxx gear and a proper spec. Something involving POM and Arcane Power can usually burn down a priest, if they don't fight back.
---
This shit is getting beyond a joke so many people don’t known to take a screen shot
---
Hi there, first time WoW player (actually played during legion but only for a month if that counts).
---
I am wanting to play classic because I want to explore WoW and most of its contents without being on auto pilot mode. In legion I played a resto druid but most of it was auto pilot spamming dungeons. I never got to experience the world maps and story line. Hence why i started classic.
---
Right now Im torn between priest and rogue. I dont really care about what role (dps/heals). I just want to experience the game without having much issues a long the way. Content like leveling up, raiding and dungeons. I dont care too much about pvp. 
---
Can someone explain to me which class would be better for this out of the two or maybe another class?
---
Tbh I dont see myself playing this long term. I just want to play enough to understand the storyline, level up a character to 60 and experience some PvE content (raids and dungeons)
---
It is most likely irritating to play through the phone
---
"panicked human screams"
---
Also, free mount at 40. So they got to get your gold at some point.
---
That's weird, I've started there, but for some reason have no memory of that. Lucky, I guess
---
Ho fuck, didn't see [Bash.org](https://Bash.org) in AGE ! This website still rock?
---
While I'm not really going to argue about which race is objectively better, devouring plague is pretty lame. It can be easily removed by priests, paladins, all dwarves, and anyone with a jungle remedy or disease removing consumable. It has a three minute cooldown and its high mana cost pretty much requires it to be cast with Inner Focus which you could be using for something else. Touch of weakness is also bad.
---
Hex of Weakness (one of the only healing reductions outside of mortal strike, and you can spam it at rank 1) and Shadowguard will certainly get you more general use.
---
When looking at racials, WotF, which is admittedly strong but not impossible to live without, and perhaps Cannibalize is really the only one I would consider vs trolls.
---
That's a long time to stand in one place, he even grew a beard.
---
How? One simple question. How?
---
Buddy, he literally states it repeatedly, and each time more menacingly and stupidly. The fk its got to do with prejudice? I was watching the guy myself before he revealed his psychotic mindset. You're a fanboi, wake the fudge up.
---
lmfao
---
yep
---
I am guessing you did not buy additional frost bolt ranks at the skill trainer. Frost bolt does significantly more damage than your wand.
---
That is a low, low standard you have, and a major character flaw 2.
---
I think you did find it funnier than it is
---
The tanks aoe threat generation is probably weaker than your aoe. The tank could fix it by attacking each target in turn for a bit which means you'd have to wait to cast blizzard, or you could just single target whatever he's targetting
---
&gt;good raptors are tight
---
Not sure if you mistook the term "riding" in this respect?
---
What addons makes the nameplates look that way?
---
thank you, where can I get it from
---
That big ass hair at the top.
---
What levels do you get improved frostbolts? I don't remember seeing the option to improve it yet, pretty sure it is still level 1.
---
What does the tooltip say? If it doesn't specify gun/bow it should be fine. The dps in you character wiev should show dps difference also
---
Probably a non pvp active layer then. Ive noticed that different layers differ a lot in pvp. I guess its bcause people getting inpvp invites other from other layers to help them.
---
Posts like this really make me wanna drink bleach
---
Exactly. At least on my server (flamelash) the horde AH prices varies from 45s - 70s for 1 charm. And in 1 hr you can farm like 20-40. That's anything between 9-28g per hour.
---
How has nobody taken Ankhbank yet?
---
OP have you checked out consoleport? It's an addon that turns wow into completely controller friendly. You could probably set it up to work with a PS4 controller connected to your phone.
---
Do it for the Horde
---
They kinda had a "out of sight out of mind" approach. I just boycotted their products for years, never submitted another ticket because of how fed up I was with the whole ordeal. My buddy said I likely wouldve gotten the lock reversed if i had just submitted another ticket right after the refusal lol. But honestly there were a lot of factors that stopped me from playing that week.
---
I just shift right clicked a buff (fort) then asked my mate to give me the buff and its still there lol. Thank u for ur help, not sure why its happening
---
Guessing it took you around 5 days playing time to hit 60? Just calculating since I’m bored in bed.
---
You say that, bit this type of thing is literally what led to class homogenisation. You are playing a warrior, deal with the fact your cc is hard to obtain.
---
For leveling I'd say a mix of affliction and demonology, to get improved corruption/curse of agony/drain soul as well as improved voidwalker/demonic embrace for start. After that you can add points to affliction until you reach siphon life and shadow mastery (at higher lvls). For low lvl PvP this will also be fine. Once you reach higher levels, for PvP you can spec into affliction/destruction (the popular SM/Ruin build)
---
You need an ammo pouch if you're using a gun. Quivers only hold arrows.
---
It wouldnt have been the same at all. All of the end game competition in this phase is cut short because of layering
---
Shadow with wand spec for leveling. Makes a huge difference while soloing, you can easily heal without any talents specifically for healing until 60
---
I sure do hope someone does, though.
---
Nah. Having something like what OP wrote happen is much more special on PvP realms.
---
Whenever you buy a new spell, do you put the new rank on your bar?
---
If you don't replace the previous rank you are still casting rank 1 frostbolts.
---
At least have the decency of sitting way in the back so you don't distract the people behind you.
---
Probably a stencil
---
Put a ring on it. Great taste filthy horde scum
---
My dude, *that* is a kazoo

---
It's about time to finally stop the gnome plague. I will help you.
---
don't reroll, what is killing you is that you played and killed shit a lot in a short time.
---
Just use your next 2/3 days of wow doing professions, talking with peoples, helpings the noobs warriors in areas, or visiting the world to have all the fly destination.
---
Will make you feel good and change a bit your actual gameplay loop. After that, go back to killing shit.
---
There are exceptions to the rule. If you're a rogue and you get killed by a rogue you may disregard the love of rogues
---
As a pleb noob healer this is helpful too. Note to self, if the tank is good and DPS pulls aggro, don't heal em.
---
well some SO do not want them to play at all. i can understand my SO doesnt like it when i play the game when she is around, but if they try to prevent me from playing once in a while, shes getting dumped. i did this myself once
---
Fulltime job and 7-8 hours sleeper here. I play during basically all my free time at the moment and im level 30. I do focus on professions a bit, but yes it's mainly sleep
---
Future stonks for investing in that name
---
I probably would but the irl friends I play with all refuse to play on one, lol.
---
Just becayse they aren't top dps doesnt mean they're useless. The people who get to be concerned are the ret pallies, spriests, and oomkins and even they will be fine in most raids because 40 people is overkill.
---
Can I loot the stranglethorn pages even if I dont have any of the quests in my quest log? Been in STV for some hours now and didnt loot a single page.
---
Is there a spike in subs? Any source to that? And how do you k ow that there isnt any further development?
---
Yeah this, dont forget to put your new spell ranks onto your bars!
---
It is slow-paced to an extent, but slowing it down in order to make it more real and calling me retail scum for being efficient is just ridiculous, isn't it? 
---
I don't mind RP, taking your own pace but we can wreck our enemies even faster, spread devastation and engage into it while slow walking. Up for it. But don't make it harder like: we need to pull two mobs at once, otherwise we ruin #classicexperience and you shiuld go back to retail if you don't like it.
---
OK it's really hard. I must be a god.
---
A spammable low mana cost spell. It's like frost armor that stuns.
---
Yeah then you are doing pathetic damage. Every few levels you unlock a new frost bolt rank. I have no idea how you didn't see it yet if you indeed visit the class trainer every few levels. Rank 4 does about 85 average damage per bolt compared to rank 1's 21 damage.
---
Also it is possible you unlocked it but never put the spell on your bar. Each rank is it's own spell in the spellbook.
---
Crysis switched server.
---
you will never get your revenge.
---
Man, its really worth it. Are you a kid? Try talking to your dad maybe. He might sign you up.
---
Create a alliance toon. They work 100% of the time against me
---
maybe it's because the leveling wall, it hits really hard, so i think maybe one expects to keep doing 1 2 level a day, and when he cannot or has downtime gets frustrated ?
---
Honestly i would love to "hide" xp bar after 40
---
This is exactly why I'm trying to get my gf to play, the scenery and music literally keeps me hooked.
---
Good pic man, I'll be showing her more evidence.
---
Thanks for the info man :) good luck out there
---
It usually happens if you're pvp flagged and the shaman isn't.
---
Hes about to get dazed
---
I think the biggest issue with something like Blacksmithing, is after you get to end game with pre-raid BiS, it kind of lacks further purpose?... 
---
Sure, you can make the hammer for Sulfuras, but...
---
This isnt a bug, its exactly how it is meant to function, FD has a chance to be resisted.
---
Lich King is the finale boss of the 3rd expansion. So sadly not.
---
Shaman, but all of those are very useful.
---
Why would you always harmstring a mob first ? It only slows and do a bit of damage right ?
---
Maybe, but also consider: 1. fatigue, people who are 40+ have been actually grinding away at the game for a good few hours already over tha last week; 2. frustration, everything takes more and more time and becomes harder as you go from 20s (where you can do whatever) to 40s (where every level is more of a grind)
---
Thanks man, I've watched a few videos so far but they've made me more indecisive tbh, the guide posted in this thread is fantastic though its helping a lot. I doubt ill have the time to sink into it to make races matter then which is good. With my experiences on other MMOs I've been more interested in charging in with melee, either dangerous or hard to kill I like. A lot of these videos are talking about how you need to know what you are doing if you are going to play certain classes which is making me hesitant.
---
How?
---
Do you have any idea how to remove that window? https://i.imgur.com/WRS8lOJ.png
---
Other than that it is pretty good
---
This
---
It's white and there's no roll. I have seen the parrot and siamese drop countless times and no one has ever asked to roll on them. The drama is supposed to happen when the ring drops (give casters priority).
---
Right now im playing a druid in classic, but in retail im playing an *enhancement* shaman
---
I’d like a source on this aswell. My understanding of layering is that it’s kinda like sharding, except instead of having copies of each zone, you have entire copies of the whole world to manage overpopulation and competition in the early zones, and to make it less jarring for players when they move between different zones. This prevents other players, nodes, NPCs etc. from fading in and out before your eyes. I don’t see how it affects realm capacity.
---
Yea i feel you, really is a shame
---
The only one being "blacklisted" is himself. Oh the irony :-)
---
She is a keeper for not rolling a mudhut dweller.
---
I'm confused I have a full time job but I started Friday last week and am level 15 as of 2 days ago, it just means that I don't play another game alongside it
---
f
---
Yeah for shaman I suppose you require rank but warrior doesn't have lower ranks of spells in their spellbook. Thus it'll choose the highest rank since that's the only one available. I can confirm because, well, I am a warrior :).
---
I really, really, really wish they sticked to the original idea for Spirit and make it affect proc's too.
---
Or maybe give each class a talent like what Priest has that converts 25% of Spirit into your primary stat.
---
Nope, its the anxiety of seeing guildies @50s and thinking "I'm gonna get left behind if I don't go hyperefficient. Fuck that random noob."
---
The best women out there are the ones that hates computer games. Just saying;)
---
This is the most warlock thing to do. It adds a bit of survival of the fittest to it. Maybe he'll live if he can heal enough to kill the other two mobs that just got pulled.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyPXP6bZ\_g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyPXP6bZ_g)
---
I hope this explains it, didn't watch it.
---
How do you strafe if q/E is bound too spells?
---
She’s a keeper. Horde filth.
---
Haha! Really? Or someone insists on rolling for every pearl if you dare to open the clams while in group.
---
You don't get damaged gear when you die in PvP...
---
It’s all realm dependent. Grobbulus is pretty balanced faction wise and there’s been some amazing battles. Horde usually win the small skirmishes but when push comes to shove in raid battles the alliance ends up crushing.
---
To add: You don't generate rage from being hit, when you are shielded by a priest. 
---
Tell your priest to not shield you at the beginning of the pull. If he doesn't do it - remove the shield manually.
---
I think you might need battle.net installed for updates etc. I wouldn't run the game off a portable HDD, better to copy it to the local storage on your laptop (if possible).
---
Priest is really flexible, leveling is easy, you will be invited to dungeons and having two end game playstyles is pretty cool. I might be biased, having a priest since release though.
---
Hunter has literally nothing to CC Mage with while leveling except for Intimidation, which is avoidable if you Frost Nova the pet. Other than that, Mage just Blinks into dead zone with a million slows and stays there forever.
---
What do you CC with? Concussive Shot? Nope. Can’t even shoot it. Wing Clip? Sure, but the Mage is still in melee range and you still can’t shoot him because you’re just as slow and can’t get distance.
---
It is literally impossible to kite a Mage. If you’re getting kited by a Hunter as a Mage, especially before 60, you’re a bad Mage.
---
Likewise, if you failed to kill a Hunter by the time you’re OOM with Viper Sting, that’s on you. Viper Sting takes forever to OOM a Mage.
---
And another tip is to buy the missing one from the auctioneer if you are nearly got one quest done and sell your spare ones for the same price
---
Ive noticed alliance is so much nicer than horde...
---
Like an ally 15 lvls higher than me will come over, help me kill a mob and pat me on the head. I would not hesitate to gank if the roles were reversed.
---
This is great because /hug is the best way to let someone know you completely destroyed them.
---
Seriously, and I was here just stuck in queue till 10pm then had to go to bed an hour later.
---
Maybe turn tutorials off in interface settings? Not sure
---
r/wallstreetbets rocking strong in this game I see
---
Very useful, thank you.
---
Wuttttt?

Ha its funny cause I also rolled a paladin at the end of classic just before tbc hit and was always missing some action xD. I played warlock in tbc and had alot of fun. Priest is my main and I am rolling alchemy /herbalism on it with wand /shadow spec.
---
I consider paladin because it could be a nice variety in terms of healing for end game but warlock would certainly tick a lot of fun boxes. Well, i have another 30 levels to decide. Need to get that benediction.
---
Looks like a Titan from attack on Titan, scary shit
---
Well there is a guy in the guild called “ Banknwank” are you sure it’s not your server haha.
---
Kinda shitty that the servers who opened 4 days after the rest didn't even get to have a own realm fist lvl 60. Now it'll be flooded with instant 60s. Also rip economy.
---
Got that heel nail?
---
it is with curse of tongues, that spell is amazing
---
You got the lowest one possible, better keep trying!
---
You can leave it at 1 til 60?
---
Trolls and Orcs are way better than Female Blood Elves. They look like little kids
---
Yeh you probably don’t notice your fellow faction members as much as the enemy because they don’t stand out.
---
I think this is a real possibility, I'm pretty sure it was said to be a possibility by a blue post. All of the expansions except Cata could be really good content-wise, as long as they don't reintroduce the same elements that ended up ruining the game.
---
It's not much but its honest work.
---
I'd love to know what realm he's on so I can put him on my blacklist, but giving out that information probably counts as doxxing.
---
Yes Fury is the way to got for Damage.
---
Note that you will have to Research a bit because you won't just be able to equip a set.
---
Some Rare items will be Best in Slot for you for a Long time and you will also be wearing Leather and Heavy Armor (I think heavy armor too although can't think of which item)
---
Yet they are very strong in Raids when they are played and equipped well. You just have to know which items to get :)
---
Check out Skarm - he is an amazing Warrior Youtuber I think he might have something on Fury too :)
---
i sold alot of runecloth bags and my buddy loned me 200g for the last bit, going to pay him back in a day or 2
---
So i need to smoke pot to play my warrior?
---
It takes 5 minutes for the pvp flag to disable. 
---
Try to ask the shaman to flag. Then his totems should affect both flagged and nonflagged players.
---
I heard it's really bad in STV in Classic?
---
It honestly isn’t bad at all for a month in. Good work!
---
That's probably "night light" for windows. It allows you to cut down on blue lights.
---
Have to say, started a Warri 2 days ago, did 1-10 in like a few hours. I bought greens for lvl 5 with my mage and a 2H sword. You really have no trouble killing anything then. 
---
But also have to update every now and then. 
---
And not pull mobs like 3 Levels higher so you don’t miss 20 Times :p
---
Awesome. Yhats for the input dude.
---
I was playing private Wotlk server yesterday and even there is a pain in the ass to get those livers
---
 Now all we need is to ressurect wowbash
---
I have a list for scumbags.
---
Dude, I would buy it for 100 Dollar.
---
Legit works too once you get used to it.
---
Only issues I find are targeting can be a bit hit or miss as you have to rely on tab targeting.
---
There is a built in healing support as well which helps for those instances, although I've never tried it myself.
---
you should try getting off the internet once in a while
---
Don't worry there will be people like me with no friends playing healers in BG's :D
---
Run of the skytotem flight tower without a bat under you.
---
Hillsbrad is a much higher level area for alliance than horde. The quests given are like 5+ higher level for alliance.
---
[Hope this clears it up for you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX1dPTAQ5_U)
---
You want a one hander and shield if you are tanking. The shield from Scarlet monastery has 1800 armor. Two handed is fine when questing solo but in dungeons the old sword and board is the way to go.
---
You're being anal, he's mocking that. You've misread the situation in your anality
---
So the devs are wrong and you are right?
---
Bad.
---
With a priest or paladin pockethealer: Godlike.
---
It's relative. You're saying you can kill mobs just fine. While you 1v1 a crab you look over and see a mage killing 6 enemies at once while pushing 2 buttons then drinking for free while taking no damage.
---
We had a tank die in sfk stupid early on a boss fight due to some bad rng (I'm pretty sure he got crit a couple times in a row, his health just got chunked) and me as a lock ended up tanking him for like 80% of his hp (drain life is pretty good!).
---
I don't know what people are talking about. Warriors are absolute beasts to level. Super fun too.
---
Same here, all my friends are split up -.-
---
Looks fine to me, i've seen much worse
---
Awesome looking dude.
---
Ashenvale is even worse. I’m just a night elf trying to quest in my pretty forest. Luckily this random lvl 47 warrior came by and decided to help me out because “I love watching the horde freeze in terror, wondering whether or not I’ll kill them”. That being said; many, many horde died that day.
---
Welll.... If you are not planning on Raiding a lot I would go Rogue.
---
They are also gear dependent but they don't completely suck without gear and also are not as heal dependant.
---
Warriors become insane when they have enough rage and a good weapon with some Critchance.
---
Without a healer you will barely ever get enough rage to really put out insane damage. 
---
Without a good weapon it will be the same.
---
As a Rouge you would be much more Independent indeed.
---
TBC and MoP are the best expansions, change my mind.
---
Google spell coefficients classic wow to get a understanding how it works. For example shadow word pain would get about 17 extra dmg from 14 spellpower. Which means faster killspeed &amp; more mana efficieny. But you have to weight it against other stats, would take for example be worth it over sacrificing 100hp? Hard to tell
---
Yes they will likely put this in eventually.
---
As my guilds main offtank as a feral druid, I can safely say that no class is bad and every class can be good if you are prepared to put in the hours to make it work.
---
My goal in playing Wow classic is to experience every raid and dungeon once. Will i struggle to complete these as a priest healer? I chose priest cause i want to help people, but maybe its the wrong choice if i am a casual player?
---
90%
---
Best in slot !
---
Good job!
---
A hunter rolled and won an int/spirit staff from BFD. I'm a priest..
---
[honestly doesn't hold a candle to the actual authentic raging produced by angwe](http://liquidcode.org/~lostman/wow/dkeserver.se/stuff/angwe/)
---
If you plan your actions, queues are not an issue.
---
Either have another person put you in queue or do it yourself remotely.
---
I got the chest on my first run, but haven't found any of the green parts after that.
---
I mean none of that is impressive if you just ignore it for a week. The point is that people can't just put everything on hold, sleep 3 hours a night and do nothing else for a week as they get to 60.
---
A lot of people here have kids or responsibilities they can't just ditch for a week while they play non-stop. That's what people are talking about.
---
Anyone level 60 right now has taken time off of "life" to do it. That's what people are talking about.
---
I watched a warrior pull 6 raptors in stv last night pop retaliation then instantly die was amazing
---
A 12 year old doesn't even type this good.
---
This is a grown entitled manchild.
---
Yeah, so again, people play a lot. The people that are hitting 60 in the first or second week likely play at least 12+ hours a day.
---
Lfg and flight made me lose major interest
---
Strenght also increases block dmg reduction, the consensus seems to be that you should be able to hold aggro good enough with consecration and the increased defence from Divine Strenght outweights the SoR dmg talent.
---
Mount is worth it but I'm not sweating it really. Not going to go out of my way to farm gold just to get it right at 40. An extra level or two being a little slower isn't so bad.
---
Druids: We honour and respect each other
---
Rogues: \*Shanking Noise\*
---
Some people are bad!
---
Very old. From a brief consultation with Google, I got immaturity, it looks cool, symmetry and just for flair.
---
Keybind wanding to rightclick
---
/r/classicwowplus/
---
What spec are you?
---
Shadow is definitely the go to for levelling.
---
I definitely would have preferred a pve server, ever since I started in bc I've never understood the appeal in being corpse camped for an hour by someone 10 levels higher than you, lmao. Then again, I've always mained priest, a bit squish I suppose
---

 ***The Art of Loving*** (1956) by psychoanalyst and social philosopher [Erich Fromm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Fromm)
---
And what If im planning to raid a lot? Afaik rogues do some pretty good dmg in pve , no?
---
I look at the meters for efficient XP cleave runs. But this is not the only thing I am looking at.
---
For example if I am taking a warrior for a cleave run and he barely does DPS then I am going to replace him, I am not there to run it normally, I am there to level effeciently.
---
But if I am taking a feral (which we did quite a lot), I will also take in to account the support they give (such as clutch heal when our shaman was oom because some mobs ran away and pulled some more).
---
All in all I don't want to waste my time when I am farming, but I gladly take people with me when I am just doing a dungeon chillin.
---
This also changes how I am looking for people in world/lfg/general chat. If I am looking for effecient runs I am looking for farm + cleave and add the minimum level requirement.
---
Totally understandable! Slow levelling should be like a smooth chilling vacation.
---
Yeh this. I was like saving up alot of space as well before downloading. It felt so massive back then ... but its actually a glorified mobile game now hahaha

Disgusting.
---
[wowclassic.live](https://wowclassic.live) Thank me later
---
Low quality memes :'(
---
I truly hope it does! and if it kept the same feeling as Classic with very little changes made to classes and keep the same style for the talent tree (Which is one of my favorite parts of Vanilla WoW).
---
Then they could release the expansions out over time, in the same manner, they're doing with the Classic phases, but with the introduction of making slight changes to the storyline to keep things fresh and allow people to reply old expansions but experience it in a whole different way! That would be a dream come true :)
---
Congrats! And sit lvl 15 with 94 silver 😂 The economy on my server is still growing so i actually can't make a lot of gold yet.
---
woar dude thats amazing !  really like that !   do you have that in high Quality ? want to print that on my Mousepad (=
---
Yikes, what server are you on?
---
Is this a kids react video?
---
Hunter is the archer class, as others have pointed out. Just wanna tell you they are a great class, but the first 10 levels (especially 8-10) are pretty rough, since you don't have a key yet. Dog get discouraged, after that you'll be a solo machine, no one else even comes close.
---
Okay just been to Orgrimmar and realised that I have just been oblivious to how the mage training is laid out. I was scrolling beyond arcane so I have missed 3 ranks of frostbolt and blizzard... This would explain a lot!
---
Thats simply mean! Thanks for explaining friend.
---
No different then retail.
---
I do have a question for you out of curiosity, was 2h fury a thing back then for raiding, I did not play so I will 100% ask someone who did.
---
I was under the impression that because 2h fury needed less hit and as such were better earlier on. 
---
Obviously, not going to use a BRE (unless you are the raid buffing person I guess), but would they be a thing?
---
Was it something that people did, since the talent tree naturally pushed people to go arms 2h and fury dw. 
---
Or was this something figures out long after the fact?
---
It was not about getting more spare time to play a game, it was about the fact she claimed every single spare time i had. it wasnt a healthy relationship, i used to work at a pub, she made me quit that job because she didn't like me working there, i blew off a vacationtrip with my dad and sister because she would be alone for 2 weeks, she always threw a fit when i would go out with my friends. I am far more happy now than i was back then. now i play casual games get to go on trips and my current SO doesnt mind me doing things by myself.
---
i get what you mean tho, if it was just purely to play more games it would be an addiction orso, but this was not the case with me and her
---
One thing i've noticed with single player leveling guides is they make the route so that you are always as high level as possible with the quests still being yellow. I have a leveling guide open strictly to give me an idea of when and where I should be leveling. I followed it for places like Desolace that are miserable, but for the most part I have just done my own thing.
---
He never said he wanted the system, he was literally talking about a way to do if it were to be implemented.
---
Top speak for myself, i am Brand new to WOW.
---
Why do people think priests level slowly? If you can single pull you’ll basically never run out of mana/need to drink. Inner fire + bubble means your health stays pretty high. You can solo rares. Fear + dot for world PvP. 
---
It used to be you got good groups for dungeons too, but now that’s there’s so many more that’s dried up.
---
+Healing (and all other kinds of Spell Power in Classic) specify that they add "up to" the amount to spells you cast from that school. The amount of bonus damage or healing you get is based on the cast time of the spell (or duration for over-time spells). 
---
Without getting into it too much, normal spells get a percentage of your Spell Power based on how close the cast time is to 3.5 seconds. If the spell takes 3 seconds to cast, it gets 85% of your +Spell Damage bonus added to it. Over-time spells get a bonus based on how close the duration is to 15 seconds, so a 10-second DoT gets 66% of your +Spell Damage. Times greater than 3.5 or 15 get 100%, not extra.
---
At that level I think you can already go to the first dungeon. The equivalent of Ragefire Chasm for Horde. Run it a few times to finish all quests in it, you’ll get a couple levels and good gear from it.
---
I would just like to add that [they got to meet Wes Johnson.](https://youtu.be/qYHXsa5AaY4) And it was great.
---
Wow (pun intended).
---
If one would make a progression series of painting in this style- that would be insanely awesome! :3
---
If you're with someone who puts you in a position where you have to dump them, where they want to control what you can and can't do to relax, then no it's perfectly justified.
---
And why the hell didn't you dump them before?
---
Undead, can confirm.
---
Pro-tip: Don't train ability ranks of stuff you don't need. Some abilities you just want for the debuff they provide, and only the damage increases.
---
Same for heals. You'll be using rank 2-4 of your healing spells, the higher ranks are a mana trap.
---
Farmed welps for 2 levels, 2-3 levels questing and 2 levels random beasts. If I focused on cats or basilisks only I would have made more.
---
Yes read what he said
---
Nonetheless the only way to determine it.
---
Nothing wrong with that
---
Had to give up on Arugal. 730pm and a 5k queue? Nah I'm good thanks.
---
Wow so judgmental, and you don't even know the full story. I bet you're a fun person.
---
Sorry bruh it suck
---
Ironforge. Central spot, easy to navigate, huge and monumental. The true capital of the Alliance. Stormwind can suck it with its slums and rivers and where the fuck is that fucking warlock trainer?
---
*Huzzah, a man of quality!*
---
unlike retail there is basicly no aoe threat : as a warrior about your lvl i have thunderclap that only exists in battle stance (shitty aggro), cleave (expensive and only 2 targets) and a mass taunt with 10 min cd. Other than that it's tab targetting so yeah if you are proactive (precasting flamestrike while he charges for example) you very likely will pull aggro from him, so don't. 
---
As a war i try to pull when the casters are halfway drinking, gives me time to stabilise aggro before they join the fun. Also if you have a mob on you run towards the tank, not away from him if possible.
---
If it makes you feel better: Thunderfury vendors for around 25G, lol.
---
Well... I am about to become a hell of a lot more powerful! Appreciate the help!
---
It was V. Not sure how it got turned off lol but glad it's back on.
---
Have had it checked since day one. It's not working, at least not for me. :(
---
I feel like people are so much better than I remember. That being said, only a fraction are really good. But that fraction isn't small.
---
Blizzard uses unique formulas for pretty much every spell in the game. You can find them on wowhead, in their game systems category.
---
Basically, spell power affects every spell slightly differently, and is scaled with level, so you're SOL trying to calculate the increase on the fly, I just know it makes my numbers bigger.
---
you're crafted a pretty good troll persona here, 7/10
---
It's not about proc'ing enough, it's about how you'll win a % of 1v1s that you'd normally not win if the talent did not proc. It makes it so your win% is higher than your actual skill level.
---
I really hope they go ahead with it! Just as long as they keep that Oldschool feeling of Classic and keep it really challenging! 
---
I'd also like if they kept most of the functionality of the Classic WoW in terms of Levelling/GroupFinder/TalentTree/Mob Difficulty. They could make slight changes to the storyline as we currently know it so that in future returns of past expansions with have a different story to make it seem fresh to players; I think this could be a really cool idea!
---
Just think about it this way: You're damaging the parts you need in the heat of combat.
---
Oh, people pulling for me drives me up the fucking wall. I'll raise rogues using expose armor in instances though.
---
He isn't wrong though, depends on the context. If you are solo and need to lfg every time, it is definitely and absolutely a horrible way to level, unless you are a prot warrior i guess.
---
Don't wipe problem solved
---
Thanks it worked
---
Full time job, plenty of sleep and I'm sitting at 32. Not even rushing or anything, just casually questing. 15 isn't that crazy.
---
It rewards a nice ring, though.
---
2 to that (Y)
---
I know enhancement is recommended until about 45 then its advised to switch over. I think defcamp and melderon have a good build
---
10-05! For the Horde!
---
Man, druid already has a lot of spells,  adding 53 more is just an overkill.
---
The problem is that when you get to higher level instances where you do need to take care, nobody will know how.
---
Rolled a paladin the first time around, hated healing so yeh; There's your sign. Had to reroll, chose to go Warlock. Took too long lvling, lock spots were taken. FML spent months in a raiding guild without even seeing the inside of MC. Luckily my guild was pretty understanding about my fuckups and decided to boost me through all the instances constantly and had a lvl 60 jacked up mage within a month, doing BWL and topping the damagelists.
---
Whats your addon for the hp bars thingy
---
&gt;The player base determined IF was the main city since vanilla.
---
The location of the only AH did.
---
I had one like that, and I dropped that group like it was hot.
---
Oh no no no no \*wheeze\*
---
Levelled a holy paladin to 60 in Vanilla. Took forever, but she was invincible.
---
If it’s like the US transfer once you get one character you can create new ones and snipe names, so watch out!
---
I’m in the same boat with Redridge, but there is a quest from the general in Lakeshire  that sends you down to Darkshire and I think that will get you up to finishing the Redridge quests
---
You mainly tank in arms, running down the defensive tree to get only a few key abilities because you the dps for threat generation. There are hundreds of tanking guides out there.
---
https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/warrior-tank-pve-guide
---
Here's a decent enough guide to get you an idea. Also get you a good threat meter. I use details! and don't be afraid to tell dps to slow down or even let them die when they draw aggro to teach them a lesson. This isn't retail. You run the show. 
---
I'm actually a warlock main but I have been playing since vanilla. I'm sure somewhere else here can go a little more in depth. Welcome to classic brother.
---
Literally the first result when I googled it told me the answer. It says Fury for PvE.
---
If there are only 5 alliance in stonetalon and over 10 hordes camping that spot it won't help. The horse simply have a critical mass that cannot be broken in ashenvale/stonetalon
---
Shadow. Disc is the backbone of either spec.
---
I have the same experience that I cant loot them at all. I remember back in time i could loot EVERY destroyed dummy. And as you can read from wowhead olds comments they were all lootable and they get many things out of 10 dummies.
---
I hope this will be fixed. Meanwhile i try to get some from the ah by people got them from running gnomeregan.
---
Yea this so much, also quest mob grabbers, I open with a long cast spell, the amount of times people run up and instant cast or auto shoot to steal the mob is insane.
---
Best one was a guy claiming I'd tried to steal from them... Yea my 2.5 second cast spell hit a split second after your instant cast dot, I think you'll find you stole from me arse hole.
---
Slowly I've noticed people being overly salty about basic.. well nothingness. Last night I put in trade chat that I'm selling 10 slot bags for 30s, a guy messaged me saying I should sell them for 20, because you can get them on AH for 25s. I said they're also on AH for 45s, then I'm being accused of being a scammer and all sorts, then he said I'd never sell them for that price. I call him salty, he blocks me and periodically messages me for the next hour all sorts of shit.
---
Ofc not all Alliance are nicer. Was afk on my Tauren druid in Moonglade when I heard combat noises. When I looked what had happend there was a Nightelf dead on the ground. He tried to kill me but was too close to the guards 😉
---
I will gank an alliance player in honor of this message. Know that you’re responsible.
---
-5 charisma
---
Have put out an update, which is available now on the App Store. It should fix the issue you found. Thanks for highlighting it - if you come across anything else please let me know!
---
25% of the times it works every time.
---
Try warlock, you blink and you're lvl 20.
---
I would also like to know tho
---
i have nothing but the most tip top respect for those sheilas.
---
Nope. Great choice.
---
All he said was "what we could do but most likely wont do is blacklist people who grief us to the extreme", I 100% agree with that, if you're a moron who spends 5 hours griefing a streamer and there's recorded stream evidence of it, just blacklist that shit, some players seriously need to learn about consequences, because right now there are none and theyre free to be complete waste of oxygen
---
r/ChoosingBeggars
---
Yes, means it can only Miss. Damage absorbtion happens after the hit
---
Just do what I did, pick the exact same characteristics as you did when you started. My mage looks exactly the same as I did back in 2005, gotta be true to my choice man.
---
I did have a thought similar to this that it would be fun if you were able to do the kind of street view that Google Earth allows with the different roads in WoW.
---
you sure its called scripts?🥺 cant find it...can you upload it, pls?
---
Yeah once I get to gnomer level I'll run it for some wiring myself.
---
45 min, you can't get soul link and maintain instant cast corruption until then.
---
Well, I'm horde and I'm constantly getting ganked by ally players so I dont really agree with you.  
---
Had to leave Shimmering Flats after less than 30 min because I was constantly dead lol.
---
neutral auctioneers will have some of the pages for cheaper
---
Imagine being on a pvp server and not taking the chance to mildly inconvenience every red player you see, doesn't make much sense to me either
---
Same. I have played in vanilla and I didn't level my secondary professions. Not this time! This time I'll level all of them as I level up my character  :-)
---
Yeah keeping the professions, first aid / fishing up to date during levelling is something I always swear I will do. But never does.
---
This time though, I’ll do it!
---
I also promised my self this time around I will play with some moderation. Let’s see how that goes.
---
The sheep of Theseus
---
How could you miss that...
---
Damn your not smart :D
---
yikes
---
You must have sold ALOT of portals.
---
Great, I wont be home till tomorrow evening. FML, prob gonna miss the transfer deadline.
---
Most people are trash. You and me included.
---
Why's that?
---
Yep. Feigning death involves not breathing, and the hunter is REALLY determined to continue not breathing until told otherwise in classic.
---
&gt;...is not a Hunter weapon
---
Uhh... I don't understand. This sentence doesn't make... What does that even.... Not a hunter weapon? That doesn't sound right.
---
People who race MC are gonna get bored so quickly. Blizzard is not rushing content and BGs are not out. Running 5 mans and griefing low lvl players is all they can do. Why wait 15 years for classic and then rush it in a few weeks?
---
Taking it slowly is the way to go. Join guilds, make friends. Classic is a casual game.
---
I think I did the opposite even. Everyone around me were very hyped for the game and I was not. I do not care about other peoples opinions, however you can lear something from the : "Assumption is the mother of all fuck-ups" statement.
---
&gt;AND they left all the items and gold the goldfarmers had gotten when they had my account lol
---
That's actually their standard practice since it's nearly impossible to tell what was yours and what was the gold farmer's if they don't have an exact date for the account loss.   I had my druid hacked during a break from the game one time and when found out and finally got it back I had all my bags and a bank stuffed to the brim with full stacks of herbs and primal life
---
Idk, my profs will maxed when I hit 60.  I will have the gold for my mount at 40.  I will have lots of lvl 60s.  I will have either way.
---
It's all server dependent but I believe both of those can be in the low hundreds of gold iirc
---
Just remember to wear your helmet. No need for anyone else to get hurt
---
well guess some people reverted to 2004 as well
---
I agree on everything you mentioned except for keeping the Level cap at 60 (Unless they do something like they plan with BfA with the Level Squish) so that they can introduce new Talents in the Talent Tree (Which I found to be one of my favorite parts of Vanilla getting to customise every class they way you want to play them)
---
I'll say it. I miss reading the relationship section of craigslist.
---
Works well, thank you for posting it!
---
That's not true. Any contested zones have mandatory pvp flag. It's been a nightmare but also very fun to try and level in Hillsbrad. What he described is literally the PvE server system.
---
U can Tank in every specc Up to lvl 50 roughly.
---
Just stay in deff Stande, and use sunder Armour to generate threat.
---
You dont really need sword+ shield, but its preferred For netter rage gen, maybe dual-wield.
---
I'm not surprised but I'm only lvl 16 lol
---
Ironforge is the best city.

I think many modern ppl don’t see this. And they are not ready for issues coming along the way when they start to mix the roles between friendship and love. 
---
I have seen wooo many times when ppl break up. And one of the part is stating: but I don’t understand....we were such best friends!!!!
---
Sauce?
---
Not surprised about a bunch of private server pros downing Rag in one shot. I am certainly surprised they got to him so fast. I am only level 21 and I thought I was going good lol
---
Was this some loot drop overalls or the tailoring item?   Because doesn't the crafted item have a "made by" line of text that would have been a huge clue where the item comes from?
---
Omg

Dear god

There is a blue post - specific high realms can transfer to a predetermined list of new realms
---
Ban those users, they will kill the economy.
---
Damn, your taste in pornstars is terrible :(
---
I am absolutely loving it. It's perfection.
---
My only concern is that I'm about to enter into a few years of disconnecting from the larger gaming world because all my time is spent in WoW.
---
On the flip side, I've been maim healing WC and every single tank so far is constantly jumping and running all around like theyre trying to kite the mobs.
---
They don't seem to unserstand that my heal wont fire if I don't have line of sight as theyre jumoing around corners, behind stickout walls and rocks, and all the vertical columns.
---
I also cant heal while moving so when I do finally catch you it might be too late.
---
If a healer asks you to llease stay as still as you can after the mob is pulled, dont keep running and jumping around like an idiot.
---
Next warrior to not stop after I ask is a deadman.
---
Are you saying i need to i stall 64 bit windows?
---
There are hundreds of posts on this subreddit about it.
---
Better off trying on your phone.
---
OMG it is all coming back to me.
---
From 30-35% A to 65-70% H!
---
You have data on Stonespine EU discord
---
So it's mostly horde realm
---
And that bitch next to you is Onyxia.

Stuck either uses your hearthstone or kills you so not really.

Oh shit idk than. I always thought that if you tie the first person to roll wins. I guess not

Goblin hunter main here. Pets are expendable, gold is not.

Uh... wait till 30+ Hahahaha
---
Not really surprised at the 60s and people killing rag already, a lot of people rushed it and no lifed it to 60 which is fine. I’m having fun going slow and leveling with my brother.
---
Anyone who likes mainstream pornstars is wildin.

Amateur or gtfo
---
Thats what I mean. They are not worth as much percentage wise to quests my level/current experience needed. Thanks for the input
---
I read your title, was mildly impressed by your usage of "rent" to mean a rip in the material, then realized it was most likely a typo.
---
Ya but now you got mud huts.... WITH SPIKES!!
---
Add something about layers.
---
And that thing about /r/relationship_advice being in top subreddits.
---
What makes warrior hard in terms of questing? Will it be easy to find groups to gear up at high level? I want to play tank
---
In Sweden people only work 30h / week since studys showed that the productivity of the Workers is the same if they can work 6h instead of 8.4 while doing the same work. So our Company adapted that, so thats a "real work week" I sleep only 5 hours which works for me since years, here everyone is different.
---
Lvld a Warrior so my /played at 60 was 4 days and 23 hours.
---
Yeah maybe i got lucky on that session, your number seems more consistent. You should be fine soon :)
---
I'll tell you later this weekend :) it can be a lot of fun too. Even in STV in pservers it was never hours of tanks. And you can always move to Desolace/Shimmering flats or do some dungeons and avoid STV.
---
If you only want the color then I would suggest downloading the other add-on I suggested.
---
Die, but don't give Horde your scull
---
Mobs never straight up ran through an entire blizzard without getting hit. I might be wrong on CoC, but Blizzard is definitely having some strange issues.
---
It is really annoying because i can barely play the game like that when my mouse speed goes insane :/ im gonna try the other comment solution
---
If you're already 60 you are almost surely committed to a guild already. Very few serious guilds will make the switch. So I doubt it will be a huge problem.
---
As a bear, ignore everything about stances, active mitigation and defensive cooldowns. You have none of those.
---
I just preemptively rejuv myself for some extra healing aggro, pull with 1-2 moonfires and then switch to bear form. If you start in bear, you cant moonfire and you don't get that extra rage from Furor.
---
Play dnd if you want to rp.
---
If you're a hunter I'd say keep it. Even if you're not it might be worth saving as I doubt the economy is all that strong yet.
---
gz
---
Honestly just keep it max level 60, fill in the empty zones with new 60 Content and items, expand the world we love without changing core gameplay mechanics.  
---
They can still add increasingly difficult content without player power creep.
---
Windfury Crit them!
---
Please PM me your Social Media Account so we can have a chat there. I wonder if this would be the first time that someone actually contacted me after insulting me online. Keyboard Warrior, keep bingewatching Netflix

They are the only tanks.

Im not following speed guides I just need to make better use of my questing time. While it isnt all time spent leveling, I have broken 2 days played and am only level 21

---
Wel yeah but 20 times half an hour spread over all the starting zones is still less than 5h per character in one starting zone.
---
Which is fine if you're having fun, but you aren't complaining about it
---
Just a side note: it's not going to worth the same amount compared to the non-layer era prices. It's a widely known method, a lot of players abusing it and will undercut others heavily.
---
I swear to god, Horde are just assholes. I emote at anyone lower level and basically never attack (except for the occasional Mind Soothe which does nothing) because I'm a Priest and in return every second Horde that is at my level or above ganks me and camps by corpse. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that a *edgy* faction like the Horde attracts *edgy* shitheads.
---
That makes 0 sense
---
I fixed it by kowering my mouse polling rate from 1000hz to 125hz, dont really rely on twitch movements in wow.

Causal players should not roll warrior.

Trust me. I was there when the deep magic was written.

very cool
---
The most efficient way to quest is with a partner. It'll cut into the grind experience, but it'll also ensure you live a majority of your encounters if you're doing green/yellow quests with minimal downtime. Make a friend out there!
---
I would sell it for mount.
---
Thanks, waiting did the trick indeed
---
layers will be gone by phase 2.....
---
Similarly how yesterday I was killing a named mob for a quest in Stonetalon and an orc warrior arrived at the spot to first say "stop, inv" at which point I stopped attacking the mob to invite him, but before I could do that, he called me a moron at which point I killed the mob before his very eyes and left.
---
"Moron".

Good for you! I hope you don't struggle with the little Sleep, theres a reason Grandads always say "Do lazy, get lazy"

Think it’s a bug I’m sure 2/3 CoC should take priority
---
Don't you need to dowse the runes before you can summon raggy?
---
Lmao way to screw up your game when it’s picked a lot of traction. They should have disabled layers after 45.
---
You mean terrible lighting, terrible quality and terrible angles? Enjoy.

Where are you getting 1M+ gold exploit from? No where in that post did it say anything close to that.

Walking around as a lvl 11 rogue slaying a crocs at the barrens hoping for the amulet to drop. Oh, Adult life is so much fun.

Lol who uses social media anymore?

I really hate how this whole Jokerd ordeal and Method commenting on it has made everyone think it's somehow okay for family to share an account. The ONLY time at which it is okay to share an account is if the relation is Guardian/Minor. There is no other situation in where it is okay to share your account.
---
I might whisper him to get on this list. It sounds like the right place to be.
---
yes it is possible, it's called Retaliation, you learn it at lvl 20
---
Ah you ignorant slaves, finally taken notice have you?
---
I mean extensive griefing yeah. But if you just troll people evenly it should be fine
---
Those claims need proof, but I do know that a certain POE streamer has been farming satyrs non-stop, hopping layers. That will make him extremely rich. Some people here argued that layering wouldn't affect economy. It definitely does.
---
Sorry for going off-topic, but do you have any working mouseover macros (for, say, Bandage)?
---
Or are those not supported yet in this patch?
---
It is where i'm coming from, studys showed times and times again that People can do the same work in 6h instead of 8h, its also very motivating and family-friendly.

Just saw the free movement post; Razorgore to Bloodfang :)

You only have 2GB of ram too.  WoW is currently taking up 1.4GB for me, not sure if that can be reduced with no addons and lowest graphical settings but I would think your computer barely has enough RAM to run Windows 7 and a copy of Excel at the moment.
---
The launch is over. Layering needs to die. Fast.
---
Layering does not affect queues, just affects amount of people in a zone. Just remove it.
---
Not exactly a simple question, but can people suggest some good macros? Specifically general ones as well as mage and priest. 
---
Feel free to post ones for other classes too as I’m sure people will find them useful also
---
 Humor
---
Depends honestly. The 39 twink bracket is usually meh on servers or at least was on pservers so I’m not sure if it would sell to someone thinking. The reality of it being that most people won’t spend 100g on an item for leveling when they will be spending money on gold/skills. I’d check your auction house and see what others are selling for and just undercut the lowest one by a copper. If there are none, maybe try 100g and see if it sells but you probably won’t get more then 35-50g for it on a fresh server.
---
Not necessarily. I did the opposite in Vanilla with my rogue. Specced for pve and learned to pvp with it. Rogues, regardless of spec, are monsters in pvp with any spec if you play the character to whoever you’re facing. If you plan on raiding at all, go with a pve spec. It’s going to be hard enough getting 40 people together to raid without having to carry a rogue that can be easily replaced. But... as people always say and I firmly believe this, play whatever makes you happy. It’s a game after all..

Where are you getting the mana for this?

I've played a Druid to 26, Mage to 28 and now Warrior yesterday til 12. It wasn't that much difficult to level the warrior than the other two. I just have to play a bit carefully. Rather than just pulling carelessly like I do on the druid cause of heal availability or mage because of CC, the warrior I try to body pull and pick my moments. 
---
Right now is probably the easiest time to level a warrior too because of the availability of dungeon groups. Run dungeons for experience to over level your quest areas. Rather than later when the lowes levels thin out and it's less people running the lower dungeons as frequently.

---
Groups: Extremely easy to find. Everyone will want you to tank, but luckily so do you.
---
Questing: Slow. Take one mob at a time, and you will need food breaks. Leveling with a priest makes for the fastest leveling experience.
---
Extra tips: Put talent points into arms or fury (depending on what you want to level as), and just slap on a shield for tanking dungeons. No actual points in Protection spec needed.

You would think these wannabe McCarthyists would understand that in order for anyone to give a fuck about your wish to exile someone, you’d first need to be someone whose word actually means something.

A few times I had priests try to jump me as a shammy and they always open with mind blast. If y'all are gonna ambush me, start with a Mana burn. Tremor totem + windfury = rip priest

There are a lot of new players. It’s a low level instance - cut people slack.

You don’t know what anal means at all.

But just for the sake of humour here;

Your argument that I’m “anal” for commenting can be said about you commenting on my comment, and we’d be caught in an infinite regress of analism (?) so now, the only way for you to prove how less anal than me you are is to not respond.

You’ve trapped yourself.

D&amp;D is for noobs. I play an huge number of tabletops and Karl games but, why not giving a try to WoW as well? :)

---
I'm level 23 and still loving every moment. Back in the day I used to play WoW for 10-12 hours straight until WOTLK where I played less and less and then from Cataclysm onwards I only played occassionally if that.
---
Nowadays I only spend like an hour at most on a game before I get bored and move on to something else so I figured I'd just grown out of it, and while that's true to an extent I've found that I've been playing Classic for an average of 6 hours a day since it came out which is crazy.
---
I've been really taking my time with things, leveling up my professions, exploring the world (i've done several quests where to only objective was to move from one zone to another only to then run back again) and i'm loving it.
---
I think what helps is that I decided to change things up this time around, back when I was a WoW addict I strictly only played Horde characters and I was usually a healer. Now I'm playing as a Paladin and i'm leveling as a tank. It's been a blast and I feel like I've recaptured some of that "first-time experience" feeling because of it.
---
As for what I don't like? Hmm, I suppose I would say it's a bit disheartening knowing that my spec isn't viable when it comes to raiding and the tier sets are pretty much only viable for healers anyway. That said I've never been much of a raider anyway so I'll probably just pvp once i'm level 60.
---
If there's one thing I would change about Classic it would be the class balance and talent tree updates TBC brought. That's about it.
---
Going forward though I actually don't want TBC or WOTLK added just as they are, I'd rather we get Classic+ that adds some of the cool stuff from each expansion without the stuff that leads us to retail, obviously there will be a lot of debate about certain things, but I'd rather we have the debate and come to somewhat of an agreement than just following the inevitable path to retail.

That's exactly what I want to do but I'm not sure how I can do it. How did you do it?
---
BRD and BRS, are the most insanely well made ”zoned zones” in the game.  Huge caverns, caves, tunnels and a god damn bar.  So many different routes to be taken, such a broad level.
---
r/gatekeeping much?
---
I didnt even know that. Still tho!
---
that's her bestie on the right
---
Hate was just my choice of word. Don’t take the word itself seriously. It was just to make the point.
---
economy? layers do not affect the AH, they do not affect trade chat or general chat...its just how many people you see and therefore have to send/receive data from in a given area.
---
Ill try that!  
---
Mines are Banksy and Bankymoon
---
Druid isn't really much different.  The bear kit is basically warrior-lite. Use Faerie Fire to pull. Enrage and Demo Roar to start. Maul is your big threat ability, you should be using it on the main target as much as possible. Once your threat is established on the kill target you can tab to the second target and hit it with a Maul before the dps switch. Swipe with 2-3 mobs, Spam Demo Roar and tab Maul on AOE (or you can use Challenging Roar, but I prefer to save this as an "Oh shit" button).
---
It's almost always better to pull mobs to you rather than charge into them. Use line of sight wherever possible to pull caster mobs closer to you. If you have to then you can use charge to interrupt them and pull them back closer to you. Since you don't have a lot of cooldowns to save yourself, your only job is to focus on threat and managing the battlefield.
---
Yep, it was a hoot! I'd never seen so many people in Stormwind.
---
How have you setup the UI for moving and casting ect?
---
they probably play 20 hours a day; if you're doing the same and still at lvl 21 you're correct tho
---
awesome idea. hope you do some alliance pictures
---
wow.
---
how many were below 60
---
To my knowledge it only became clear at the AMA that they didn't intend to release gear progressively as they had earlier given the impression of. 
---
They did write something like "we want there to be things to figure out so we won't tell you the specifics" 
---
And yeah I find it kinda sad, would have been cool to need to go back and do 5-mans after being in raid gear as new stuff was added.
---
THats almost an understatement!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Sell price is stack price while vendor price is individual price it's a stack of 1, the two prices are the same.
---
lol that nordic deadpan humour is going right over people's heads
---
...it’s a reference you’re not familiar with?

How so? If they can manage to take all the ressources across all layers, it would be even easier to take them if there were no layers.

no new addons or other bullshit just leave it alone

Man I love the undead starting zone!
---
Nice picture ;)
---
This is why I'm an altoholic, retail it started to become a grind to level anything and with the lack of max level alts I started to lose interest. Classic however I'm totally immersed in the leveling and I feel like I'm enjoying the game and not zipping through 120 levels of rubbish to hit end game.
---
I think it’s tukui
---
I really doubt that they'll only give a 24h window to transfer.
---
My friend tried to log in around 10pm est and it was a 2100 queue.
---
Well, every layer has its own ore/herb/chests/monsters. So you can grind infinite resources without moving your character. How does the AH getting flooded with items not effect economy?
---
Well, sadly, I'm not doing commissions at the moment. Sorry..

I guess you really live up to your name, you take this pretty serious huh buddy lol.

N'Zoth freezes us in animation for 600 years at the end of BFA -- only us. The hero. As the world plunges into darkness for 600 years, we then awaken. Some Naru uses their last spark to awaken us from our prison. Gametime.

I would definitely have lied to that kind of person. I would have said I got it somewhere faaar from there, but not far enough so he wouldn't go there. Just to see him go there and enjoy his whispers of rage when he realised I just wasted his time.
---
I aoe grinded 2 mages to max level in classic. I am almost positive this is how it reacted. I remember mobs always taking about a second to be slowed, aka waiting for that tick.
---
Now I could be wrong but I'm mostly sure this is working as intended.
---
I love how everything is pretty much vanilla except the shadows, which I think is using the more modern system.

What? This is the normal WoW classic he is paying for, he is just playing through remote desktop.

Gandling

I did that vs. Mythic Argus when I accidentally survived for too long and had to die asap. Sit down, get crit, repeat.
---
Because people spent a long time pre classic talking about how there were blacklists for griefers. I guess they think there is literally some list you submit a persons name to.
---
Warrior tanks need a few seconds to generate threat and rage.  Dps usually cant wait 2 seconds so then you get messy pulls with mobs chasing everyone and the healer going oom every fight.
---
Atleast we have decent flight paths.
---
*cries in retaliation*
---
So on which spec do i level Warrior? I saw some guides on youtube but they were based on strafe kiting mobs with Hamstring and as I understood thats not working on Classic. So do i still go Fury or go Arms with 2H weapon ? :) Thanks
---
Because you don't want to sit in 5+ hour queues, obviously.

Watch the video of the class you chose!

Damn Grats dood
---
They are comparable level wise and their geography (close proximity to starting zones for each faction)
---
The person thought the factions were extremely unbalanced due to the heavy horde presence in ashenvale and stonetalon but the equivalent alliance heavy presence is in red ridge and stonetalon

They were made separately.

You seem to be quite intelligent :D have you heard of the concept of demand and supply?

Why would your waste your time cooking food if you can just ask a mage at every corner for a couple stacks of food.
---
Hey! You're in my guild too!

They're also very gear dependent especially their weapon. So you will have to be resourceful enough to replace your weapon every few levels, and make sure your armor is high enough to tank well.

As a warrior, why would you not equip it? It's pre-raid BiS for Fury and it's a good 1H to tank with as well.
---
But that was less than one generation ago &gt;.&gt;
---
Pallies need even more seconds 😉
---
Yeah on a casual level that’s  true. But when both players know how to play the matchup rogues are in favor and win pretty consistently.
---
If both just hack at each other throwing random cooldowns warrior usually wins.
---
You must have done something else, you don’t fuck your spine to the extent you stop growing by sitting normally in a chair. People sit in chairs all day. This is some other factor.
---
yeah cuz zelda is super cereal stuff
---
Yeah, it's a stark contrast to how it was on Light's Hope where most Hunters I grouped with not only knew how to control their pet and their own aggro but even use Freezing Trap and Frost Trap as crowd control on more complicated pulls.
---
It's amazing what they actually can do in the right hands.
---
The draw back to pallies is no hard taunt
---
This is a bit of a decision you will have to make yourself.
---
First of all, you will need to understand what each stat does. Since you are a warlock, the damage on your staff is (or should be) completely irrelevant to you. If you are using your staff to do damage, stop, buy a wand and use that instead.  
---
Now intellect increases your mana by 15 points per point of intellect and you gain some spell crit chance.
---
Stamina increases your health by 10 points per point of stamina.
---
Spirit increases your mana regen while not casting and your out of combat health regen.
---
Spell damage / Shadow spell damage / Fire spell damage will increase the damage of spells of the respective schools. So if you get 9 shadow damage it will increase the damage of a shadow bolt by a certain amount, up to 9 (there's some math involved there, but the coefficient for shadow bolt in this case would be 0.857, meaning you would get 7 or 8 damage, depending on how blizzard rounds this. You can look up coefficients on wowhead for example).
---
For leveling people often recommend stacking spirit, as it reduces downtime, however as a warlock this gets a little more complicated because we can freely exchange life for mana (lifetap) and mana for life (drain life) and every point of spell damage we get increases the efficiency at which we do this. Lifetap profits from 0.8x your shadow spell damage and drain life 0.5x. So the more spell damage you have, the more mana / life you will gain compared to the life / mana you spent on them.
---
So, for me, who is specced into drain life and life tap and built towards never having to sit and drink or eat, I would most certainly take the Staff of Soran'ruk. But, if you'd rather have some more health, mana and regen, you can go for that as well :)
---
As a warlock, or any caster really, don’t even look at the damage numbers of the weapon you use.  It’s all about the stats on it. The damage number is basically the baseline if you’re physically hitting your target which you will never do. Look at how much intellect, spirit, stamina etc. The second staff would probably be my choice since it affects all your stats and survivability. The fire damage boost is ok but not as good as overall star increases of the first particularly when leveling.
---
there are a lot of GFs but just one classic release
---
Yeah lol, been reading through it during all of my lunch, thx for the link
---
You have to go to a weaponmaster in the major cities to learn different weapons.
---
 I'm not sure where you have to learn axes as horde but just ask a guard for the weaponmaster
---
-growl on manual
---
-wait a tick after pull
---
-bindings for pet control

You are now top tier on server ^^,

Just curious, what were the pants? Asking for a friend.
---
Can you share that preset with me? I’d love to try it out. How much better does it look?
---
I think your backstory is fine, there are probably quite a few orcs that were shamans turned warlocks and are now on the road to redemption. And they wouldn't start with much as most of the warlocks are shunned and forced to be separated from the rest of the population.also Just say you were a lower level support warlock with not much experience to also back up the fact that you started only really knowing shadowbolt. From what I understand higher level spells can go horrifically wrong and kill the caster and you'd need years of experience ( levelzzz) to do them properly.
---
What app you using? Ima have to try this on my hunter.

I like to think that you don't get a skull of every one because they sometimes get crushed in the fight

I preferred demo for leveling voidwalkers are broken.
---
How you do this sir?
---
Had a group doing an elite quest in the wetlands yesterday, 2 lv 40+ horde came and killed us ( group was 25-29). We respawned and camped them for a couple of times. Felt really good actually. Came together as a group to take down much higher level gankers
---
So because everyone can do it that makes it okay?
---
We're talking a huge influx of what should normally be rare mats/items being farmed via layering and creating a massive supply for them which can then be used to make a ton of high level stuff easily or sold for money.
---
Blizzard needs to do something about this or else propel will just flood the market and sooner or later this will fuck up the economy of the game making everything more expensive

\#showtooltip Shadowburn

/stopcasting  
---
/cast Shadowburn
---
when you use this it will stop casting/channelling whatever spell so that you can cast the insta cast when you need it.

Oh, no. Happened what had to happen: people changed and 15 years of game expirience allowed people to find fastest way to level
---
You should do this for a living
---
Well it obviously isn‘t meant for English speakers as it only concerns German ones and realms, so I don‘t see the harm in clearly stating in the title that this is a German post. :)

And they did say, in German, that this is available on every realm.

Very cool heatmaps for world drops! Thanks for your effort!
---
My gf and I went and tamed Bjarn for her yesterday. He even eats sand.
---
I use /start attack /cast rend and same thing for heroic strike. This way even if you don’t have rage you will still auto attack the mob until you have enough rage to actually use the move you’re looking to use. No need to right click on them or have a button just for auto attack.

Croutons in a soup is a recipe for sogginess. If the soup is thick enough to hold them on the surface of the soup it can work, but that doesn't sound like what's going on here. Come on!

They can give us the same game, byte by byte, but they can't undo collecitve gain of knowledge over more than a decade which happened since then. People play and think differently.

Also, nobody ever stops you from inviting only the people you want to your group.

I'm going it alone. Although my main friend who used to play asked me yesterday to reserve his preferred character name because he is considering joining.  
---
Ultimately though, I'm fine doing it solo. I have been adding good players to my friends list, joined a social guild, and when the general population reaches the higher levels the community will flesh out and people will start developing server-wide reputations.
---
I bought all the pages off the AH today. They're only like 10s each

The stupidity of people who gank rogues... smh.

Did you want to get anything done today?
---
I understand if that's not what you'd like them to do and you've every right to feel that way, hell I'd probably hate it too if they did it in the wrong way, I'm just asking people on their thoughts on it. 
---
But to say you'd never play any Blizzard game again seems like a bit of an overreaction, at the end of the day they're a gaming company, and though the corporate end just want to roll in the cash, everyone else there love what they do and just want the best for the gamers since the majority of them are gamers themselves.
---
I like it when people post meters to see how much my wand spam did over the run. It feels good to know I contributed a chunk of damage as a healer!
---
yes supply and demand seems like a fairly relevant topic.....but what i was saying in my last post is that the method of layer hopping to exploit nodes has limited to negligible use, so the supply is not going to be extremely different than what it would be with no layers. 
---
additionally if everybody exploits it and there is an over supply then the prices will drop making it not worth people's time to do it....so then they won't do it anymore
---
I think it has always come down to when raiding the raid leader has the option pally or warrior tank and they generally pick the warrior, even though a Pally can do a decent job most of the time.
---
The Liferoot in WC taunted me for so long!
---
Why the Hell didnt you just roll Shaman then? There better healers and DPS than Paladins, you also dont roll against the tank in early game for gear and Totems are outright superior buffs thanks to the fact you dont need to keep track of everyone's Timers, just slap em down and the problem resolves itself.

I agree with you mate. Just saying that you don't need an addon to abuse layering.

Try following a leveling route while being a level or 3 ahead of it.

Can you tell me what this is originally from?

What are you talking about ? If now layers would be disabled you would get 1fps from the amount of people there are in a zone notbto kention that you can forget about killing a single mob

Ayo brother. Warrior is a fine class and at all gear levels above green has the potential to really shine. If you're like me you enjoy seeing that needle move every time you get an upgrade. I think warrior is fine to play casual, and in the past, I have really enjoyed gearing a warrior up in blues from quest greens to see how much stronger I can become.
---
Don't let em getcha down.

Definitely for you own good trust me.

Unless they blocked access in all campus, then that’s a scumbag move.

Great rogue twink boots. Maybe enchant em later n keep to sell in a few months. Mail to a bank toon

Ya, see, I wait until the opposing faction player finishes off the mob before even thinking about attacking.
---
1) It's a dick move.

2) You just make yourself look weak; for needing 'mob help' to kill.
---
Hahaha big brain

Just saw Huntard on horde...incendius, was that you last night

It’s not the new model, just different skin tone/facial hair combined with Classic’s improved lighting and shading.

1. That's not a hack, that's a glitch

2. Economy is a matter of supply and demand, not just supply. He needs people to buy the stuff and a endless supply makes the prices drop = economy regulates itself. If he just trades to vendors he may become rich, but that won't hurt economy very much. Gold grinding has always been a thing in wow.
---
3. Do you really want layering removed right now just bc some idiots are misusing it? On my server nobody would be able to complete a single quest (except 40+ maybe). 
---
Why should they ruin the game for everyone just to regulate some ***? They will always find ways to grind their gold and xp in ways that are not intended.

Yeah maybe thats just how it feels maybe for everyone who mostly quests on his own.
---
Any source on the population stats, or is that just feels? On launch, skeram was 55/45!

Thank you for ur nonsense answers. Tou gave me the motivation i needed.   I found a driver update software and it detected my exact video setup on this crap netbook.  Now it works. Id make a screenshot but this is marked as a question.
---
Yeah, that’s the point of using the swing timer.  You want to use slam as soon as possible AFTER your auto attack goes out.
---
So the Quest for whirlwind Axe you can also chose whirlwind sword
---
Not really.
---
Even if you have one toon that's 10+ levels above an alt (or main lol) you often will have enough greens picked up randomly for it to be helpful.
---
Warriors do struggle with being pretty gear dependant but I'd say it's a meme rather than a rule.
---
Didn't have a problem leveling a tank main in vanilla or the few that I leveled on private servers.
---
Last time I had a priest on a private server around 10 above my warrior that fed random greens to him and it made the process much easier even with just mildly half decent greens and a couple gold here and there until I gave it up waiting for classic at lvl 40.
---
You can make pretty good money selling herbs on ah though.

Sorry to ask so many questions but you’re super helpful and I really appreciate it!

Ah okay, so it’s just a rumour and, in fact, spell damage coefficient = element spell damage coefficient? 
---
LAST 2 questions I promise! :)
---
1) when people refer to a ‘tick’ do they mean 1 second? 
---
2) I’ve been wondering, the Drain Life TALENT, can it still activate if your inventory is full and a soul shard isn’t technically created due to lack of space? 
---
Thank you oh wise one
---
Definitely keep those in your bank until P2 is close :)
---
Nonsense, I still had the crescent staff at 30 and I was pathetic. It took 8 gold and an hour in stranglethorn with a 34 priest to get my mats. Then I just asked another friend that I met on launch for help with cyclonian. Worth every penny.
---
How does one do this?
---
I dont understand how they can already get to Ragnaros...
---
normally you need to extinguish the fire at each boss right? and you can only do that after getting revered with the hydraxians, which is impossible to do without a few run of MC...
---
There is an easy fix for this - just restrict switching layers to like 5 times per hour.
---
This guide is for private servers, states using potions to reset your swing timer, and how druids will need to give to innervate so you have mana to keep tanking. This guide floats around but avoids saying that this is a niche build. You have not convinced me that it’s viable.
---

My wife an I were killing Satyrs for the Horns in Ashenvale last night.  
---
That's 32 horns, which probably translates to 100 or more Satyrs.  
---
Some lvl 20 rogue (Satyrs are 26-29) came along and said: "inv".
---
I explained that we're already two people and it'll take a year already.  
---
He said: "Suck me dick".  
---
Then we watched him die a few times.
---
I like how both druids are mid air, as if they're excited to get their kill.

In case you didn't know you can use the Bartender add-on to hide the xp bar. It can do a lot of other things with your bars too.

Based on other things people have been banned for, this would certainly qualify.

The main issue I see is that the system is still in place, is not going away any time soon and is super simple to exploit. They need to find a way to prevent this asap.

Warrior levelling is tough, but sometimes you'll charge in with a decent amount of rage, get a massive heroic strike crit and an overpower proc, and all is right with the world.

You probably have a shitty monitor is why.

I spent 7 hours getting Verigans fist on my paladin. I didn't do it for the weapon. The experience of travelling around the map and meeting people feels like a huge epic adventure.

dont think you are taking getting the drain interrupted into account (maybe?)

i was just going off what the guide said. seems like my wand does \*slightly\* more damage than my drain life (im level 31 using gravestone scepter and latest level of drain life)

Why tf do mages always get so popular. Back in the day my mate played mage always got invited to do stuff. Me, the huntard, had to wing clip myself to 60 on my own.

Actually only tier 2 has a robe bottom. And tier 2 is amazing, even on male paladin

I'll try to find more)
---
What I've heard too. They're just so much better as a tank or dps, si the party gets to have a real healer, why the "dps" and "tank" druid can just full in for the healers and use his powerful support cooldowns like brez, and innervate the actual healer, without taking up the healer's spot... Weird. 
---
I love druids, aesthetically. But they're a mess, why do you need so many macros too :x
---
It has potential NR?
---
Huhuran gear.
---
It definitely was not worse.
---
Unless you're playing it on a smart fridge, I'm pretty sure you can alt+tab flawlessly between WoW and a browser.

Dude, I live in Sweden and so do a lot of people on this reddit. so no point in trying to sell  the 6h work day to me, it's not a common thing and only being explored in very few instances.

A real work day per week is 40 hours in Sweden. If you played 4 days and 23 hours to get 60 you really went tryhard with low amount of sleep and playing 12+ hours a day.  Any normal person with a social life, wife, job and kids can't do that.

I’m having a bit of a problem with sticking to a single class, and it’s making me enjoy the game less. I’ve levelled a warlock to 22, a hunter to 19, and a warrior and rogue to 18. Out of those I enjoyed the warrior and rogue the most, but I’ve heard a lot about how poor they are for levelling as well as how overpopulated they are and it’s putting me off a bit tbh. Should I just play one of them anyway? Or is it nearly impossible to get into any kind of guild at 60 for raiding as a rogue?
---
As someone who never played wow before classic but experienced the oldschool runescape release, "no change" only works to a certain point. 
---
At some point you'll get bored and you want more content. The majority of people want a vanilla-like experience not vanilla till the end of time
---
Death Coil is a game changer. I still remember how amazing it was when they added the horror effect on it, totally changed how world PVP encounters went from then on.
---
you hand in to her two quests, then she gives you another one which is for the wand, you cannot end last quest without picking the wand
---
It sounds mostly right to me from what I experienced in vanilla and BC.  I remember back in vanilla people preferred ranged dps over melee and for most of Burning Crusade this didn't change.  Fuck even late BC there were heroics you really were gimped in if you had melee compared to ranged.  
---
Shit was just easier with ranged.  It wasn't for the zerg rush shit the streamers were doing, it was for cc.  Sheep and frost trap are the best cc in the game.  Add in that ranged wouldn't get hit by the mob or boss so it was easier on the healer b/c only one person ever took damage.   Most of vanilla/BC you'd roll with full cc and the ideal would be to only ever have one mob being attacked at a time.  We were too undergeared and underskilled to do anything else (it was also more fun but w/e).
---
I do remember willing to take up to 1 rogue back in the day for a group.  But I really hated having a dps warrior in my group b/c it meant we lost out on a cc and I liked to run with 3 cc and everyone would have to work noticeably harder  (I don't remember seeing dps druids and lolret wasn't worth the hassle unless they were a friend).
---
5% hp though! Also slick meele leeway
---
It makes sense because you have no way of communicating with the other player AND one is able to destroy the ither. It's harmony, a ceasefire, a random and unspoken friendship that dissolves never to be seen again. And that's beautiful.
---
These are actually firefin snapper. they have the same picture as the deviate fish.
---
This is part of the reason I think WoW Classic will succeed long-term. 
---
We have people doing things like this, just because they can and technology provides a way. 
---
We have Ultimate Ironmen running questless, bankless, AH-less toons because they can and want the ultimate challenge. 
---
Challenges like these often create entire sub-cultures, and I believe will continue to draw in attention and fresh faces through things like Twitch for some time.
---
imagine being in a group of 2-3 so bad that any amount of mobs some dude like you could pull would kill us LEL
---
whoever you killed deserved to die, especially if they weren't solo. bad players.

Yeah but look at that sick angle. Add a filter to that thing and you got yourself a perfectly good IG photo.

Leveling as a warrior with a priest friend has been an amazing experience. We’ve gone pretty hard sitting at level 41 atm, but we still take time to enjoy the scenery. 
---
I love the world pvp that I’ve taken part in so far, since priest+warrior combo works really well for clearing out horde filth
---
The only thing I don’t like is the focus on cleave groups for leveling in dungeons, thankfully it’s finally dying down a bit. But holy hell being a tank I have discovered a newfound hatred for DPS that can’t wait until I’ve even charged a mob to start AoEing.
---
It’s just the best pet until you get cat with dash in lvl 32

Even if this is not meant for the Tony Stark from Iron Man.....now i,an avengers fan, am sad again.....

Hillsbrad is usually 30+ for alliance, not a great idea to pick fights there :)
---
It is not impossible, that word has been thrown around a lot in this sub leading up to classic. MC 1st week was done despite the naysayers, most of which never played pservers.
---
This reminds me, back in BC there was a kid in our guild who was annoying as all get out. Standard 12 year old. Obnoxious. Made up crap all the time and tried to make it seem like he was the shit. One day my cousin and I convinced him that there was a profession called Dic farming and he could only get it in Stormwind by talking to a secret hidden orc NPC there. 
---
2 hours later this kid got in vent and started RAGING about how he couldn’t get out of the city because he was getting auto ganked by players and guards. He raged about how his dad was the president of Blizzard and how he would have our characters deleted. 
---
I’ve never laughed so hard in my life as my cousin and I did that day.
---
You mad man, the axe can proc whilst proccing
---
Most of the US is sleeping or about to wake up, EU is at work/school.
---
Apparently it's "a stupid thing to say" that Ironforge was a main hub for end-game back in vanilla. Everyone and her uncle hung around there back then. Maybe it was just my server (Stormrage/EU).
---
Current level 50 that got their mount at level 40 here. 
---
I practiced. A lot. The year leading up to release I practiced leveling over and over again to pass time and made an optimized personal route. Mostly 1-30 because I knew that getting ahead of the pack quickly would save me a ton of time. I can pretty much level any class/race combo I’ve been interested in 1-30 in what would seem to others like no time. 
---
Aside from that, being conscious of your efficiency is important and knowing how to play efficiently is also big. Many standard guides will break down your time into 3 segments: in-combat, out of combat, and travel. Knowing how to reduce these times on the fly while working through the initial leveling rush and playing for (literally) 38 hours straight on release put me in a great position. 
---
After that I was able to chill. If I kept that up the entire week I was off I’d have definitely been 60 by now but I was trying to remember that I was on vacation too and wanted to at least try to enjoy the leveling experience. 
---
Sprinkle in some dungeon farm (I’m a mage, finding groups isn’t hard) and 11 years of hardcore WoW experience and I just came out very far ahead. When you master all of these things the mount kinda comes on its own, you just learn how to save the most money while simultaneously making the most you can while blasting exp.

Question about paladin healing:
---
As a level 15 paladin I am using the spec here for levelling: https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/class-guide/paladin/leveling-1-60/#stuff
---
This is great for levelling but are my options restricted if I want to join a dungeon party as a healer? Would I need to respec for the dungeon and then respec again for levelling?
---
Or should I just stick to DPS?
---
Maybe some people prefer 100 viewers that can spell clueless rather than 10000 who cant
---
I was thinking over re-rolling off my hunter around level 20. Kinda glad I didn't. I'm at level 31 and it's gotten a bit more interesting and Aspect of the Cheetah (30% movement speed buff) is just too good. My talents are also getting better.
---
This is why you stay clear of RP servers. Most toxic and passive-aggressive cesspools out there.
---
You need honored and the elementals in silithus gives rep. You can easily aoe grind those as a mage.
---
Filling the spot because the group couldn't find another mage.
---
The addon I use is called "onebag".
---
I leveled a warrior to 30, then decided to try out warlock. Holy shit it's so liberating when you dont have a heart attack everytime you accidentally pull 2 mobs
---
Which addon did you use for those lines? Mine never worked and its hard go get everything lined up without them '^^
---
Already did. They said waiting time is around 24 hrs. I am just wondering if someone knows how to fix this error.
---
Like 1s per hour or 1g per hour bank?
---
Terrorist!
---
I play on Gehennas. Peak time ~5h queues. I wont change, doesnt matter. I just queue in around 15:00 at work through Teamviewer. When I come home, the queue is almost done.

you need some points in the ice tree for that
---
Maybe your on a twitch server all these kids are idiots.

bg and exp came out way, way later. like mop later.

Did they really just flat out say [[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19019/thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker)?!

how much skill did u need there? 150?

I meant just for MMOs, or any online games really.
---
WoW and Runescape were the first MMOs that really took off and made the genre known. Runescape was successful for being the best horizontal progression MMO and WoW was the best vertical progression.

Yup, pretty much. I'm a druid though, so my aquatic form comes in handy here.

Interesting. This is just via Steam, which is always running on my PC anyway. Pretty harsh to consider that cheating.

I just tamed an owl but it doesn't have screech, so I have to find another one? :(

It's in the hide out on the way to the instance inside the building but not outside as in in the open world.  There's a purple area to the left where the undead is.

Theres a ton of dalaran mages in eastern Silverpine that might fit the bill
---
I mean... its ruined, right? Might as well pack it up. Classic is over.
---
You forget all the staff weapons, they seem to be great too.
---
Wouldn't a really simple solution be to put on some sort of layer swap cap per hour similar to the 10 dungeons cap?
---
The only alliance character I ever played was a dwarf hunter, and my god was it magical seeing the gates of ironforge for the first time. Then travelling inside the belly of the mountain and being greeted by a warm orange glow. So cosy, love dwarves :D
---
I still have my original box for World of Warcraft as well as the collector’s editions from BC-Legion. I skipped the BFA collector’s edition because the contents looked bad.
---
Whàt....
---
Revered is required to get a "permanent" quintessence, otherwise you have to ferry them over from silithus to MC one at a time, which is not too bad if you're stacked with warlocks. And the permanent one has a 1 hour cooldown anyway so it's useless until you get multiple players with it.
---
Wtf does only wanting to pay for 1 subscription have anything to do with this? Sharing an account with your family is ONLY okay if it's a Father/Mother and their MINOR (under 18). Please, PLEASE show me anywhere that Blizzard has said it is okay for Jokerd and his brother (or whatever other siblings) to share an account. I bet you you'll never find it, cus they didn't.

I told those boys to stop whackin in my tool shed!
---
I actually just partied up with another lvl 30 warrior and we went to STV to farm the trolls. We invited people that quested there anyway and just took the scalps. Took two hours but we got it done for both of us. Bought everything else from the AH for about 8-9g in total on my server. I'd say its worth it since I've been using that axe for 8 levels now. 
---
Plus it looks *SICK*
---
That’s coo,, congrats!
---
I think the AH was in SW in vanilla too. Or did they implement it later in vanilla?
---
Join a guild?
---
Our guild got our first 60 this morning, and a bunch of us are 50+, but the rest (like 80%) are all just chilling out and having fun, I see internal "LFM" all the time and even the SM groups are taking any DPS, any tank, any healer...
---
If you're in a guild and they're excluding you due to class, maybe find a new guild.  People have different styles &amp; priorities.
---
so the only comparable drop is the ravager and it can be obtained by running a dungeon for level 35+
---
i would say it is definetly worth it, since it is guaranteed, you never know if the axe will drop and you will get it.
---
Threat meter is essential
---
Happened after?
---
So glad I can’t wait to take the tanaris dragon all the way there
---
OP is mentally ill
---
Hey that's me!!!
---
i mean you get 1.2% hit chans with the sword which is really good in the limited world of classic with giving you hit chance but damage wise 1.2% is not a lot it just adds consistance.
---
On Stonespine it's Diamond Hammer haha
---
I know you're not serious but do people actually care that much about 2 extra points?
---
So, someone makes a shitty mod and we're back to hating on layering? Do you really think this launch without layering would have been anything but a horrible experience?
---
Dont worry, the time limit is for when people not transferring can begin creating characters on the new server. They want to keep the servers closed to creating new characters for first 24 hours to hopefully allow transferring players to retain their names on the new server, and minimize amount of people who need to re-name characters.
---
Im lvl 53 rn, could only take a week of from school so that kinda fuckt me. Have had to afk to stay avoid the queues a lot so my /played is already like 5 days something. But yeah I think ive died to PvP mb 10 times in total. 99.9 of my exp has been from cleave grinding
---
I play a warrior and my RNG to get Mage gear drops is unreal, feels like I’m farming for a mage alt I don’t have while having lvl 7 belt and cape at level 18.
---
Yeah, I'm hoping my GF gets enough interest in WoW to start her own character. Would be nice to have a priest, druid or shaman to run with...
---
Why not just get a low level one and have it farm some low level mobs
---
Waitaminute... You just said that you need two healers to kill a mage. And made it sound like that's a good thing. Am I beeing woooshed?
---
Do you have improved blizzard on your talents to slow the mobs down?
---
Ahhhh I have a deja Vu
---
Don't overdo yourself, your health should come before WoW
---
THIS! I only tested all addons for 1-2 month after Woltk and this SW capital thing bothered me real hard, because i loved IF from vanilla.
---
Now I have to play Horde because of my friends, but after seeing this picture I will defenitly roll an alliance character aswell.
---
you need to train different weapon types  at the weapons masters in the capital citys    each races weapons masters teaches different weapoms so you have to run around to get them all
---
Man your char is EXACTLY like mine....I was scrolling and was like: "WTF!? Someome took a screenshot of my toon?!"
---
The fur color, the horms, the beard and the face: ALL ON POINT! I also had the set a few days ago and the crescent staff as well, replaced them as I leveled...what mind freeze you gave me for a few seconds.
---
The only difference its that I am a Druid!
---
visit weapon master in capital city and learn it
---
Skeram horde

Haven't checked in for a few days, but as far as the Details Discord shows there are no plugins working yet, including tiny Threat.
---

---

---
Im happy now
---
I think you might need to go to a teacher and learn how to use 2-handed weapons...
---
Get a low level one and have it farm some low level mobs
---
I want rank 2 charge.
---
I don't think that screenshot is real / from Classic. Sounds highly unlikely that someone has managed to farm that many Arcane Crystals since launch, no matter how often he switches layers. 
---
Other than that it is a system Blizzard introduced and that is working as intended. If people at high levels use it to farm ressources, let them. The system allows it. No hack or anything involved. So if Blizzard does not like it being used that way they have to remove it earlier than they wanted.
---
Ok, I'll say it for you: classic is better.
---
Idk about the rest of you, but I find this far more engaging than retail.
---
No I quit before mop and it was out. It was the beginning of wrath I think. But yeah either way I don't think we'll see it in classic
---
Yeah, imagine being a lvl 8 dwarf priest running from goldshire to eastvale camp and see 2 guys followed by a fucking dragon.
---
Most of your mount gold is made from L30-40 if that's any consolation. Start saving!
---

---
There is also a memorial in the barrens, but i guess you already knew that...
---
Dont try and understand classic balance, its basically non-existent.
---
In a standard dungeon it often breaks CC at the worst of times. I remember back in 2004 wondering why sheep kept getting hit and the answer was the axe. It’s fine if you don’t use sheep or sap, or keep the cc away from the axe.
---
lol exactly, it's like coma
---
Love it to bits, been leveling with another warrior and its been a blast. Theres no point in comparing myself to other people because everyone enjoys the game differently.
---
If you don't want to abandon your current professions, fishing is an underrated way to make gold.
---
You need to visit a weapon trainer and pay 10s to learn each (2h sword, 2h ace, 2h mace).
---
For horde, 2h sword is in UC, 2h axe in org, 2h mace in TB.
---
You need to purchase the weapon training for it. Talk to a guard in a main city ask where the weapon master is.   Talk to said weapon master and he will either train you in the item or tell you where you can find the correct weapon master for that item
---
idk i fought plenty of mages so far - not really an issue

you can only lock one school of magic at time I have 3 schools magic all of which provide some kind of healing or defense capabillity

Shocked I tell you!  Just goes to show how little they're used--at least, in my life.

Check Pettopia it might help

You get more gold as you level :). Big bags and censoring trash and questing adds up.  Download auctioneer and auction what you can.

Wow!

where is the evidence?

Deadmines on day 1. You should've been 60 a few days ago.

---
Classic Threat Meter is probably the most common. It is also compatible with DBM so even if someone does not have CTM but has DBM you can still see his Threat in your CTM window.
---
Don't know, I died, but I think the dragon died.
---
That's pretty nice! Thanks :)
---
Are you talking about dual wielding 1 handers? I think you learn that at level 20 from the trainer if I remember correctly. Just check your trainer for the dual skill. Dual wielding 2handers is not possible in classic.
---
If you mean you lack the weapon skill like 2hand sword, you have to learn it from a weapon master in major cities. Each city offers different weapon skills to learn. Swords in Undercity, Axes in Orgrimmar and Maces in Thunder Bluff for example.
---
Depending on server faction dynamic, you can make some easy quick money. My server is appx 70% Alliance, meaning we are getting pages in droves. Horde on the other hand, not so much. 
---
Visit your Faction AH and Booty Bay AH, compare prices. You will stand to make $$ flipping between the two. 
---
Higher faction Pop, buy from faction AH, list on Neutral. Lower faction pop, buy from Neutral, list on faction. 
---
Made all of my mount money two days ago this way. It’s evened out a bit now, but it still works, just did it again at a slower rate for some extra pocket money
---
But you're on my faction!
---
Ok that’s fair, in that case I take back what I said. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have jumped to conclusions
---
The screenshot is fake. But layer-hopping needs to be addressed, prohibited and hotfixed hastily.  It's not a vanilla experience and thus shouldn't be the classic experience.
---
Nothing will happen because layering is essential to keep the servers up rn and the kind of people that care enough to know this has already scuffed the whole economy don't make up enough of the quarterly earnings report for Bobby kotick to care
---
But I enjoy being prot!
---
now you know how hillsbrad feels for us
---
You'll be taming beasts for their higher rank skills as you level. You can learn Beast Lore at L24 which tells you what a beast can teach you if you tame it and use that skill(s).
---
You can also make a lot of $$$ from a piece of paper.
---
Rogues seem low on Grob Horde but I expected them to fall off. Hunters everywhere, warlocks more common, a lot of druids but it is a RP server, shaman were numerous but I keep seeing less of them as I get closer to 30, and finally, my leveling partner is a tank so haven't had to worry about LF Tank but as usual tanks are in demand in chat.
---
I’m exactly in the same position. Ive heard that enchanting is a decent way to make money. Something like buying cheap greens off the auction house and disenchanting them for components and then re selling the components on the auction house. Not sure if that’s actually profitable but that’s what I’ve heard. Another way could be fishing but that’s easier for horde players to make gold on pvp servers since the prime fishing spots are on kalimdor. I think some of the more sought after fish go for over 1 gold per stack.
---
Crescent Staff is very good and is hard to replace until your mid 30s, when you can run Scarlet Monastery: Library. The final boss there drops not one, but 2 upgrades:

---

---
[Hypnotic Blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7714/hypnotic-blade)
---
Dagger
---
If you have a nice off hand, the dagger is generally better.
---
I had the battle chest and would read the guides every so often, I really liked how they put class descriptions and how your personality can affect what you would probably be best at.
---
&gt;enjoying causing pointless pain on others and driving people away from a game you play    
---
      
---
You seem like a fun dude
---
Is it weird having people sat around you watching you play? :P
---
Do you mean not being able to use a certain weapon? Classic doesn't give you every weapon skill from the get go. You have to train them at different weapon masters. Ask one of the guards in Orgrimmar, Under City or Thunder Bluff, and they'll mark it on your map.
---
Not all weapon trainers can train the same weapons too so check the guide below to find where you need to go.

Got 2 young micro panthers living with me. Whenever there on my desk and i am sitting in orgrimmar they will go ape sh\*t over all the moving players
---
Ok, to break it down step by step here. First, stable your active pet. Next go out and find a pet with the rank of the ability you want. Now tame it. Once that's done don't even bother feeding it, just go directly into battle with it against whatever mobs are close by. 
---
You'll quickly learn the new ability rank. It'll even show up in the chat that you learned a new ability.
---
For example, as Horde when you get to the Barrens with a good cat that can learn both claw and bite. Start by stabling your cat. Then go across the bridge leading to Orgrimmar and a Venomtail Scorpid. It has Claw rank 2. Go fight with it for a minute and learn Claw 2. Then abandon the Scorpid. You'll now permanently have Claw rank 2 to teach all pets that can learn it.
---
(If this is your situation for real then go tame a Saltwater Oasis Turtle close by Whailing Caverns to learn a new rank of Bite also.)
---
Exactly this. Also: Tell your group BEFORE what gear you want to roll on. You'll most likely have to decide for either Healing or Ret Gear as your "Need"-Gear and roll Greed on the 2nd set.
---
Of all the things to rage about this one ranks well down the list.
---
Yeah idk, I just spent more time on my professions. My husband is like at least 5 levels higher than me and another guy we started with is already lvl 40.
---
So you can be even more broke
---
I'm a level 23 Warrior, only put talent points into arms so far. 
---
1. Is there a recommended rotation I should do at this level? Single mob rotation, multi mob rotations?
---
2. Should I learn the hamstring method, and bind A and D keys to strafe?
---
3. Is there any good levelling guides for alliance players?
---
It's maxed
---
Thanks everyone, i can see that the consensus is that i keep it, so i'll bank it and wait for battlegrounds 😀
---
do you know for alliance where id learn swords?
---
inb4 OP never wakes up again
---
3 minute mages and 30 minute warriors

Are you saying I could play healer and use that gear for Ret?

Are you ele?

Yes, Retail :3

Holy shit that’s a great idea... If only I knew what was worth selling in the AH so I could do this too, haha!
---
Not sure if it's an addon of mine, but my rogue ranks get replaced automatically, while my mage's doesn't. Just check if you have multiple ranks in your book.
---
I agree with this. Having said that if they do develop new content. I hope they put a few classic only servers where people can copy their chars over to and continue to play lvl 60 only if they want.

You’re not one of those people. Nobody will funnel you loot. You won’t see that stuff over warriors if anyone even takes you to a raid.

My memory is hazy. I do remember that the auction houses in each city weren't linked to each other on the same faction, meaning that you had to hop around between Ironforge and Stormwind (possibly Darnassus) if you wanted to get a clear picture of everything on sale. That changed in patch 1.9 with linked auction houses.
---
&gt; Comparison is the thief of joy 
---
Love this quote, is it form anywhere?
---
video or didn't happen
---
"For approximately one day, the new realms will be restricted to only those players using a free character move. After one day, any player may create new characters there. This is to allow players using the free character move service a better chance at retaining the name of the character they’re moving.
---
...
---
During periods of high usage, free character moves may take up to several hours to complete. This service may be closed at any time, without warning, should a destination realm become full. We strongly encourage players who wish to use this service, especially in coordinated groups, to do so as soon as possible."
---
Alliance scum, cute kitten though :)

Try deja character stats

I think that would only make imbalance worse. People wanna play for the “winning” side.

Fair enough lol I'm 27 now, and I'm a lot less tolerant of the general attitude of the younger generation. All of these 'cool' things they come out with just makes me cringe. Probably the same way the generation before me felt about how I acted at that age.

Allright! Seems like an improvement atleast, on the new server is the status low/medium or high?

Meanwhile I'm still running around in Westfall...

---
The best name has been Mööséknückle
---
You need consecration from the holy talent tree to effectively tank as a paladin
---
This looks more like Sepulcher to me, maybe I wrong tho.
---
!RemindMe 1 day
---
So he devalued a rare currency by having so many of them?
---
It doesnt fucking matter roll whatever race you want
---
Min maxing for vanilla raids lmao
---
I only play for myself anyway so I'm fine with that :) Don't have time to run dungeons for 3hrs straight sadly
---
i had to do this for 2 hours yesterday LMFAO
---
A spoiler in a game for a movie that came out almost 15 years after the game did? God damn time travelers.

Deja Character Stats classic?
---
The beard growth is hilarious
---
You learn Blizzard at 20. Arcane missiles makes you stand still and will lose against Frostbolt as soon as rank 2 or latest rank 3 AND it also slows the target (even more when you go deeper into frost). Every 2 levels you can learn new Skills at your Class-Trainer. You can simply walk to Guards in a main city and click on them to find your Class Trainer.
---
Also: Don't waste gold on anything besides Utility and Frost spells while leveling. Only fire spell you could consider is the instant cast to finish of mobs f.e.
---
Using a mechanic in place for questing to farm materials infinitely will get you banned.
---
It's a pvp realm with opposing factions lol you're not supposed to be best buds
---
All the vlasses without buffs are just spitting on you to give you a spitbuff
---
awesome - love the style reminds me of old spawn !
---
You seemed fine at first but your edit makes you seem like a douche now.
---
Does not affect queues? Isn’t that the entire purpose, to fit more people in one server?
---
Hey now.. my bank alt is named Wankbank and I am very mature.
---
Pagel world chat is loaded with people asking for invites for a layer hop...i cant imagine were the only server.
---
Ignoring that, people constantly bring up conversations about layering in chat (for and against point) 
---
Im not sure how you think 99% of people are ignorant of layering and how to abuse it...
---
Frankly you just sound ignorant at this point for saying such obviously false statements.
---
Aren't the Rachet quests dual-faction? The other zones they mentioned have 'em. So... :P
---
A quick glance at OP's post history and he's from Europe somewhere...    Unless he's on an oceanic server, he's not gonna see much activity now that labor day weekend is done and everyone is back to school midweek.
---
Hi, /u/DocktorDicking
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/czzryv/oxhorns_roflmao_is_the_real_deal_on_wow_nostalgia/). 
---
Yeah nah. It works, takes about 5 minutes to get setup. Bit more to fine tune it to be enjoyable. Bad try
---
What’s hilarious is how much you care about something that doesn’t affect you and will be irrelevant next phase.
---
Beary Manalow druid
---
Can confirm. It does not decrease. Even on 60 you sometimes farm lower gear because it has resistances you need for raids/dungeons f.e.
---
Now I just wanna know what the overalls are
---
And don't lie or play dumb. My uncle works at Reddit and will delete your account.
---
Can someone /r/ExplainLikeImFive this for me?
---
Super realistic than, actually. If they AoE farm certain places for Runecloth then getting around 80 bags made and sold is believable. Awesome work by OP
---
I’ve been torn between all the casters also. 
---
Pros for priest are hella facemelting, can do it all, you’ll heal. Cons, mana, you HAVE to heal all the time, wanding to 60
---
Lock- hella damage, great self healing, great control. Cons, ridiculous micro, soul shards, having to put 15 dots on everything and ramp up
---
Mage- so much damage, mobility, food, ports. Cons- always drinking, kinda boring IMO
---
don’t forget balance and ele
---
I also did not buy it for Classic. I was just saying it run great, and wont need to upgrade if he decides to play something other than Classic
---
funny
---
Yo, I need some life advice from a pro.
---
When I'm making up my success story, is it worth going for having an actual mansion with a helipad, playboy bunny maid and a golf course, or too many people will smell the bullshit? I really want people to compliment me on something imaginary, but scared of being called out.
---
But the journey doesn't begin in Sepulcher tho...
---
I hear you. How do you think I feel. Half the time I'm grouping with people young enough to be my kids.
---
Last night someone was wanting to chain run a dungeon since our group was going well, and I said I really tried to keep it to one dungeon a day since tanking was hard on my arm. They suggested I needed to change the way I play. Buddy, I'm 44. Existing is hard on my fucking arm some days.
---
ohsnap, I still got Redridge to do too! :S
---
How's that?
---
Almost no Druids horde side on Zandalar Tribe EU it seems.
---
I'd like to see them release expansions but keep the character progression to level 60. No flying mounts, no stupid ass gear tokens . Re tune zones to work with level 60 and no flying mounts.
---
The building opposite the auction house in the trade district. Theres a guy called 'Wu ping' or something. 10s per weapon skill. Just remember that once you equip a new weapon type, you'll have to level that weapon skill too.
---
You ever see the old episode of Tyra Banks with the guy addicted to WoW who missed his kids birth raiding?  The ultimate solution was he agrees to shred the disks in front of his whole family.  And while they’re shredding you can just kinda see him smiling, and anyone who plays is probably laughing with him.
---
Maybe quit being a crybaby bitch and grow some thicker skin? Imagine actually getting offended at what a bunch of retards online say. Let them have their fun, it's a throwback to the old days when there weren't so many sensitive pussies like yourself.
---
I'd love to see people like you try to play a game of CoD online back in the day, you'd probably kill yourself over someone "cyberbullying" you too hard.
---
If you base your self worth on what a bunch of anonymous morons behind a monitor say; you have far bigger problems in your life than this guild name. Grow a fucking spine.
---
1. He didn't "rob" anyone. Robbery is where you use violence to take something *away from someone*. Isn't it?
---
2. He's not going to enjoy this for long, probably. There's likely a ban inc for this.
---
3. Even if not, it changes my gameplay, or my enjoyment of it, like so: 0.00%.
---
I am sorry but when you date someone who is controlling to the point where they forbid you from playing your favourite game breaking up with them is the only correct choice.  
---
Ofc we dont know if that was the case, but it would be a very valid reason.
---
If the next expansion does not contain any of the following:
---
- void-focus
---
- light gone bad
---
- soft reset/lore-relevant level squish/loss of character power
---
- azeroth receiving a grand ass whooping from n'zoth,
---
I will be thoroughly surprised. It's kind of a pleasant thought really. You can say a lot about the state of retail, but their efforts to establish a central plot really gets me going. I have suspicions, but there's no telling where they are planning to take us. 
---
Then again, if Blizzcon comes and goes without absolutely blasting my mind into orbit... Major Classic launch success aside, the shadow of last year still holds their reputation in a thread.
---
Anyways, rambling and derailing here. End transmission.
---
"I'll have to find a buyer for this and people are not exactly lining up to buy a rusty blunderbuss or a stack of lifeless stones. This could sit for years in my inventory. 1s is all I can do."
---
I'm abusing it too because I can, and everyone at my level is abusing it. So yes it affects me. 
---
"don't worry about this game breaking exploit it'll be gone in like 2 months!!" that's you.
---
For me everybody is much higher level than me but honestly I don’t mind more spawns for me :)
---
Thanks for reminding me how fucked the game actually is. 
---
We should make this an hourly reminder. So everyone can have his day destroyed multiple times a day

What level are you and what level mobs are you fighting

As a Horde player he forgot to tell you that we will always kill you on sight for being a Gnome. Be aware!
---
Thanks for explaining what I already know. 
---
Why risk it for karma is the point.
---
True ^
---
In world chat its either "spellcleave / melee cleave grps" or "inv for layer swap plz!!! 1!11"
---
This isn’t true there are so many naysayers in this echo chamber. Join a guild, build up friendships and raid. Yes your dps won’t be the best, and you may be forced to heal, but you will be able to use dkp for ret loot. Some items you may have to wait on. But you will still be able to pvp as ret and enjoy it.
---
I always liked those bank mule names, Bankymoon or Bankimoon. And SamanthaFox is a good pet name.
---
sad
---
I can’t find that on curse at all? Any ideas?
---
It very much is
---
Oh because you say that I totally get it now
---
Kromcrush was a joke last night in stv. Literally groups of 5 horde around every corner. It really felt like the ration was 30/70 in stv.
---
I'm on a high pop server (Westfall) and see none of that...
---
we've had like a million of these posts, can we just calm down already?
---
What people seem not to be willing to say judging by the feedback at this time is blasting dungeons while levelling is the most efficient way to generate gold. Almost everyone you see at level 40 with their mount already is geared to the teeth for a reason - they were dungeon spamming at least from SM Arm -&gt; Cath if not sooner and making 1-5g per 30-&gt;45min run depending on drops.
---
Touche, but it would take a pretty special Alliance to level the Barrens-Stonetalon route and then complain about a lack of quests.
---
Ah, gotcha. It had looked like OP was just looking for something capable of running classic. Good point though. 1k USD is certainly not a bad price for your laptop and will run a wide array of games. =)
---
Don’t be snitch!! That’s what u do!
---
Yeah I hate that dungeons are best way of leveling. It's quite sad.
---
It's astonishing that nobody knows how to take screenshots.
---
Looks pretty nice!
---
Ah that makes sense, then yeah, if people are using it to farm that does negatively impact the realm.
---
You do so much dmg as lock in dungeons, maybe not on the smaller mobs but if u stack corruption +curse on all mobs that are focusing the tank you'll easily be top dps.
---
I have still yet to see this on my server. Everyone keeps saying they see it, but it is nowhere to be found on Blaumeux or Mankrik
---
Occasionally you might have to do green quests, which have grey mobs in order to unlock the yellow quests in the chain
---
So I'm a noob to WoW and am trying to get to Ironforge from Menethil Harbor. I was told to run there, but looking at the map, I don't see any roads that can get me there. Do I just swim along the coast or is Dun Alhaz a tunnel that leads into Loc Moodan?
---
I'm a level 20 NE Hunter, so I'm trying to find another area to be able to do quests in as I've run out in Aberdine and can't do crap in Ashenvale Forest at my level. Don't just want to farm 2-3 levels.
---
This is why I prefer dungeon grinding over questing...
---
Questing: 90% solo, 10% group with me for 5-10 minutes and then leave.
---
Dungeon: 5 player group for anywhere from 1-3 hours.
---
I know they added it in some expansion as it was a big thing but I knew it wasn't in classic
---
a lot of people don't, but there are AH / price add-ons that will tell you everything.
---
Will do, thanks.
---
Yes! Not only are they humanoids but there are also chests that spawn right where they are. If you are lucky you can get good drops and just vendor. I might have gained a little extra gold by turning silk into heavy silk bandages and vendorinf as well
---
Honestly I do it all the time. I find PC version to be confusing.
---
\*staring in hammer-wielding dress-wearing paladin\*
---
LFG/World on  Westfall is NOT constantly having people talk about layering. Quit being an asshole and play the game.
---
I can only assume you're abusing the layering if you chose to be offended by my comment and your comment shows you just don't know how to handle differing opinions when you reply "nice anecdote" to an anecdotal topic you dotard.
---
Thank you.
---
Assuming based on what? You can’t even show anything related to WoW that backs up your claim that people only want a vanilla experience not actual vanilla.

Dwarf is nice, I like it but I don't like the idea of playing one. I prefer either something I can really identify with, or would want to smooch. Dwarves are cute, but not that cute. Horde is better in that regard, I'd play any race there uwu
---
Theodore Roosevelt I believe. Might have been someone else originally but that's who I saw referenced in regards to it last time I checked.
---
Well I know it's been said countless times and not everyone will agree on everything, but preserving the 2004 feel is kinda the point of Classic TBH.
---
I always did find these escort quests frustrating and I still do now, but it is what it is.
---
I am on lucifron with which had insane 25k+ queues. If you learn to deal with it it's not a problem.
---
At least you are going to have a super populated and active server for a long time and that's really important to me.
---
Can barely see anything
---
Aww, imagine thinking you'd be able to actually channel MC long enough to hurt me... 😝
---
Here's a simple trick to learn which definitely makes you feel like a better hunter (and is actually incredibly useful). Shooting something behind you with an instant cast shot without stopping.
---
- Start running forwards and hold down W (never release it).
---
- Click your LMB down and turn the camera so it's pointing backwards
---
- Jump
---
- Tap the RMB to turn yourself midair
---
    - Note: You keep moving in the same direction as you were when you jumped
---
- Cast Concussive shot (or any other instant cast ability)
---
- Swing your camera back around to the way you were facing
---
- Land and keep running
---
If you can pull that off smoothly you can fire off all any instant cast abilities without having to slow down, change direction or stop. Great for PvP and can be useful for kiting mobs in PvE.
---
I practice whenever I'm doing a long run anywhere. Playing little games like 'How many "perfect" jump spins can I do in a row'.
---
It probably sounds weird but I like it better in my mind if i imagine it’s the starting zone.
---
By abusing it you are becoming apart of this problem you care so much about. 
---
If you actually cared you wouldn’t abuse it and would be emailing blizzard about it instead of whining about it on here.
---
#nochanges
---
Oh, that's sweet. (Adorei o nome, por sinal.)
---
I took last week off, and may have bolifed a little. I'm 53 currwntly, hoping to hit 60 on the weekend
---
What server? Mograine?
---
You can do exactly the same with ashenvale.
---
Layering won't go away btw. There are 10000+ people on these servers. If they got rid of layering there would literally be no room to do anything. Unless 80% of people quit there are going to be multiple layers
---
You should be using succubus for drain tanking though.
---
Good to know.
---
Pretty glad about the support on offer from this community; I haven't even began to play! Decided on a hunter troll : )
---
By the way 'rolling' a character means creating one, right? I don't remember there being a randomization process for the character's stats in creation mode.
---
Wait. That's illegal!
---
When you're taunting a tank
---
Keep it in your bank sell it later on when people have a lot more gold to spend.
---
Came by a gnome mage called nbzpwnzor
---
Really made me grunt that I was subjected to such subverted lack of creativity.
---
Then again he probably did it just for that.
---
I prefer dungeon grinding too. I could do 26 to 40 in just Scarlet Monastery. This is part of the reason I would love to have a tank/healer combo.
---
Not sure why you were downvoted, if you spec for drain tank and grab dark pact at 40 succubus might be the best minion. This is because you want a minion that isn't spell reliant for damage, so you can use your minion as a mana battery. I did RFD last night and I never stopped to drink with almost constant pulls. If I was playing non dark pact we would have been slower even though individual dps might have been higher, but only if the group waited for me to drink or the healer expended more mana to let me lifetap constantly.
---
/cast [stance:3] Battle Stance
---
/cast [stance:1] Overpower 
---
You obviously need to click the button twice, because it's two actions. 
---
For the button highlighting you probably need to look into Weakauras.
---
Because its not consistent 
---
Its all about Lucky procs and burst
---
Ret cant keep up the dps in longer fights
---
fucking layering....
---
Since you can't trade loot in classic this isn't really any different to going into a dungeon with 3 regular mages who all need an item. It's not like they're able to use 3 need rolls to funnel loot to their main. They're gearing 3 characters, the same as 3 separate people would do.
---
Ignoring an exploit does not remove it.
---
He knows how hard  it is to level as melee compared to hunter
---

Depends, if you think the 150-200g now could benefit you more than 500g a month from now, go ahead and sell it
---
Get your mage to pull with the sheep so the sheep stays miles away, frost nova the remaining mobs to give time to the warrior to pick them up. Then go ham with the damage.
---
OP admitted he's abusing layering below, this topic is nothing but a shitpost.
---
I tried to wipe your screen off.
---
I’m levelling as arms and having a blast smacking things with my big ass long staff.   Having tactical mastery and anger management makes such a difference. Compared to leveling in the fury tree.
---
Known as the Reversebowl or Longhorseshoe.
---
Way off topic but where did "costed" come from? I've seen it mostly in the last few years. I've lived in America for 30+ years and it's always been cost. Same with "casted".
---
It sounds like something someone would say who has English as a second language.
---
Rogues aren't nearly as popular as they were and the amount of warriors is usually more balanced at 60. They both get a good number of spots in a raid. Don't pick a class just because it's uncommon, play what you want to play.
---
There are many like us who despise those farm-raid-aoe-sh*t.
---
Just form your own group and play with people you enjoy playing with!
---
How are queues?
---
Don’t do them then?
---
Literally no way to know that. I’m on horde and see a ton of alliance in every contested zone. If we’re going off personal experience instead of statistics then I would say it’s close to 50-50.

Play the long game, be smart, you make loads of gold at 40+ zones you might get mount at 42 but its worth it.
---
https://i.imgur.com/uWMYqhn.png
---
Taken just now.
---
How does that not effect queue's, lol? I see so many people not knowing what the layers actually do. You layer the continents to allow MORE people in on each server. So, if a popular realm has 25 000 active players, but the world itself can only handle 8 000 max, but preferably 4-6 000 players online due to "lack of resources", removing all layers will mean queue 24/7.   
---
I see arguments like "omg, but the servers can handle it, much better technology". It's not about the servers handling it. It's about the RESOURCES in each server. You have a set amount of mobs, nods, herbs and the respawn rate has not changed. So, how do you think that will look like if you put 25 000 players on one layer? Imagine trying to get one quest done that requires 10x of a certain mob. You're lucky if your done with that quest in 2039.   
---
They can only remove layers when the amount of players on each servers are at a healthy number, then they need to add queue on those servers to not go above the healthy amount of player online at the same time. That's the aim.
---
While you guys are "Clapping cheeks", we, the alliance, are training harder than ever, waiting for the big battle to come.
---
I hope you won't regret it because the day we will come , you might not be prepared .
---
Just joking, clappin cheeks party tonight at Stormwind, bring your friends !
---
Congratulations!
---
This. It somehow feels more impactful in classic though - perhaps because there are fewer quests, they take longer to complete and you really have to read the quest text to know where you need to go, which makes it much more likely that you will remember doing that quest and appreciate it more.
---
Who am I then if I play 3 hrs a day when my kid goes to sleep, buddy? :) A pro?
---
 I barely fucking got lvl17!
---
ooof. Thats never good :/
---
You can bet blizzard has still ways. At least if there's actual game play happening - Actions per Minute would be the first metric to come to mind.
---
But you are actively using it. You are no better than anybody else using it. All of these issues you are complaining are only being pushed forward because of people like YOU who know it exist and decide to use it instead of leaving it alone. 
---
So yea, you are still apart of the problem. You don’t get to complain about something while actively using it.
---
Make a go-fund-me for this dude someone :(
---
Probably warriors. Very rarely would people whisper my priest looking for heals. Today I asked a dumb question in trade chat and got invited to tank stockades (at level 22)
---
that's a name if you truly do not want to be whispered or invited much into groups
---
A: "hey we're missing a dps, invite mooseknuckle!"   
---
B: "man i'd really like to but fuck him and his special characters in the name"
---
They didn’t decide, it literally was a bug that was unintended
---
They hope most people will be able to keep names but they did say there is a chance you won’t for popular names.
---
Endgame fury wars will out-dps literally anyone when properly geared. For leveling its Arms.
---
I see myself a lot in you and I play a Night Elf Priest. A Night Elf Priest is far better than any Paladin/Druid for healing while leveling and early raids. People will love you in both PvP and PvE still. Fearward is far overrated and you will find groups and dominate in world PvP as Night Elf Priest too.
---
I am taking a note of every "accident" could have been avoided if I rolled a dwarf compared to night elf. Be it a PvE fear wipe or a PvP fear causing a loss. The count is currently 0 on level 35.
---
See, I just make my own guild for my bank alts, and get them that first bank tab to store my non soulbound junk in. Although I suppose you could do the mailbox juggle too, because that's cheaper.
---
My ex told me I wasn't allowed to play WoW or she'd dump me. I thought the same as you at the time, why throw away something over a game? But in hindsight I should've let her go because that's toxic af.
---
I did a DM run last night and needed one DPS. A guy guy whispered and said, "Will you take a DPS druid?" Fuck right I will. Get on board Mr Smite's Wild Ride.
---
What do you mean by "better than anybody else" ? I'm not saying that those who exploit blizzard mistakes to level faster are bad people. I'm doing it myself that would be hypocritical. Blizzard is the problem, not people using their mistakes.
---
My gear was looking good at around lvl 40 [pic](https://i.imgur.com/9We6NYG.jpg)
---
But it didn't last long, now I'm in all sorts of mismatched stuff and have a tunic :(

Definitely hold onto it for a month and you'll get hundreds of gold easy.

Just follow the path leading out of menethil. When there is a crossroad just go straight and you will be in loch modan after some tunnels

Not at all, they said

For me I only like the two unarmored human ones, the rest of them just look kinda eh
---
Yeah, I was trying to figure out if we would have that or not, I suppose not. That's ok though. I've abused the mailbox before and I can do it again.
---
Do you mean a heavily layered server which will have insane queues again if layering gets removed?
---
Focus on being frugal throughout the 30s and you'll be perfectly fine. You will make a lot of money from 30-40.
---
Here are some general tips anyway:
---
- The bigger your bags, the more money you can make. Once you have silk dropping regularly, consider having a tailor make you some silk bags if you don't have bigger already. It's nice to be able to hold more things to sell.
---
- Loot everything and don't forget to sell your junk often. The silver you'll make will add up pretty quickly. Full bags can cost you in the long run.
---
- Enchanting can cost you money while you're still pulling some gold together for your mount. Consider holding off on investing into it until you have your mount. Those greens you get are worth a good bit of money while you're saving. If you must disenchant, consider only disenchanting cheaper items that won't sell on the AH.
---
- Speaking of AH, good greens can fetch a much higher price on the AH than they vendor for. If you see an item that you think a particular class would be very interested in, it may be worth holding onto to see how much you can fetch for it on the auction house.
---
But I don’t want to use shift. I wanted it to be mouse button+5 etc

---
Anyone has a macro for making my imp attack when I cast at an enemy? 
---
All through WC I kept forgetting to get the guy to attack stuff as I'm so used to sending the void walker at it lol
---
Did they make MC easier than Vanilla? I don’t get how lvl 58s in greens can meet the gear check if they didn’t l...
---
Thank you, but I wasn't really asking how to play priest.  I do understand the concept and playstyle of priest.   
---
 I was asking how to more effectively communicate with the groups I find myself in.
---
Feral Druids are very nearly as good as prot warriors for tanking 5 mans. Don't know what you're smoking.
---
Also rank 1 fireball to keep rogues from getting away in stealth! :D
---
Thanks! I'm really looking forward to properly first timing such a popular game
---
God if I could stop refilling trying to figure out what I want to play... have like 6 chars at level 15+
---
That quest took me 140ish kills. I know that because at the time I was getting 100-104 exp per mob
---
Horde definitely seems more like the kid faction this time around.  But that’s not to say alliance is great.  We have the people who still think this is retail and that you need a cookie-cutter team for everything.  Had one guy spamming for an hour for “1 more DPS for stockades MUST BE LEATHER WEARER”.  I don’t think any loot actually drops in the stockades...
---
Either get real lucky and get a guild that'll let you raid as ret. 
---
Alternatively go for a 21/8/22 or 21/0/30 hybrid build and offer to flex between healing and DPS (which I could honestly see happening).
---
Or suck it up, raid as holy, and ask for a decent 2hander when it drops. No optimal PvE builds use 2handers, so that should help you out.
---
If you're pure PvP, I'm afraid your best option is to get The Unstoppable Force, unless you're a nolife legend who can get Grand Marshall weapons.
---
A new weapon would help me a lot probably.
---
GATOR NEEDS HIS GAT
---
You'll definitely get a raid spot as a resto druid.  However, I've never played the class so I can't tell you any more about it without being largely ignorant.
---
Another EPIC gamer moment 😎
---
But seriously, telling fat people they should loose weight because it’s unhealthy is like telling a depressed person to “stop being sad lol, it’s not good for you”. You’re just an asshole, and that’s a fact.
---
low effort? 
---
i wanna see your high effort version of that
---
Staysafe just did rag like 6 days out with a guild of randoms from his twitch chat. People were face pulling bosses. Maybe he’s not as “good” as the guy who autistically done this for every pserver
---
I love layering, unlike in legion I don't even know it is there. Blizz just needs to eliminate the possible exploits.
---
Yup, that's how it went and IF AH became the hotspot for trading. It was also where groups for most endgame dungeons and raids were formed due to proximity of BRM and Menethil Harbor for Kalimdor Ship.
---
best possible advice i can give you for saving money while leveling are:
---
1. do not buy unnecessary skills and their higher levels from trainers  
---
2. always have ton of space in your bags when you go out on an adventure  
---
3. avoid enchanting until high levels since enchanting is super expensive to level up and to use since you're basically destroying all the gear you could either vendor or put on AH  
---
4. it's tempting to, but avoid buying gear on auction house  
---
5. since you're a mage, you can easily AoE farm gnolls in wetlands, great exp, great items and tons of cloth which you can vendor or put to AH  
---
6. all the cloths you've got, if not used or sold because the market's currently shitty, convert ALL your cloths into bandages with first aid, that way you'll earn more money than just plainly selling the cloths (for an example, 20 cloth vendors for 10s , but 20 bandages that are made from 1 piece of cloth (so 20 cloth=20 bandages) vendors for 15s).  
---
7. like stated on previous comments, most of your gold comes from mid to late 30s
---
Omg truth.... Clearly I haven't gotten any yet lol
---
It's not even real.
---
You can detect this automatically when you read server logs. This exploit should be trivial to detect and to respond to.
---
What a wonderful idea, i'll definately download this.
---
Someone explain to me why dwarves need these huge halls. I never understood that.
---
Bullshit so us a screenshot with your character at 60 and time played
---
Another thing worth considering with enchanting is that you get to enchant your own gear as you level, without having to buy the enchants off anyone. This will give you a small power boost for the levelling process.
---
The main delay to making cash off enchants is people getting good gear at max level. Very few people (unless they're already prepping twinks) will buy enchants until they're level 60 and wearing pre-raid BiS.
---
That's a rock fact!
---
Obscure reference, but I thought it fit.
---
BoP
---
Yah it matters,
---
The underdog faction will constantly be outnumbered in every zone.
---
Some of them will leave the server, some of them will hide in dungeons.
---
Which will make the effects stronger.
---
Majority faction gets upset they can't find any minorities to beat up on, so start a policy of Kill on Sight any minority they see.  The players on the majority side tend to become worse PvPers over time, as they really only see fights that last long enough for them to  burst 1 ability or spell before the minority faction dies to dozens of attackers. The minority faction that stays, tends to get very good at pvp, because they have to fight everyone all the time at a moments notice, under all conditions.
---
This makes me wanna switch realms
---
I already switched the realm 2 times due to friends. I doubt that I will change it again. It will take a while until Blizzard will fix layers (if ever)
---
YOU GOT THE DEATHCHARGER'S REINS?!!?
---
oh nevermind you're a skeletal person
---
READ! Read your abilty descriptions, your quests and if you're into.lore any book you see lying around the world.
---
Races matter quite a bit, though just about any race/class combo has both advantages AND disadvantages. there's usually one combination per class and faction that's slightly better, but we're talking 1-2% here, so it's not a big issue.  
---
The learning curve for any class is about equal. The game is designed to get you to learn the ins and outs of your class as you play along. That said, hunter is so easy that you rarely get punished for mistakes, unless in group content (which has given rise to the huntard meme). This is why I would advise you NOT to roll hunter. It's a lot more satisfying to have a character with a proper learning curve. But after ruling out hunters, all the rest is roughly equal in difficulty.
---
Thanks for the clarification
---
If I remember right you need to use an item on them.   A side note though these mobs are great go skilling up your weapon skill
---
I leveled one long long ago and I do remember the leveling experience to be really easy as a cat
---
What premise? I want it gone, I'm gonna continue abusing it until it is gone, but I still want it gone.
---
The fact that I'm abusing it as well, actually validates my premise, it shows people actually abuse it.
---
It would be great if every city in wow was built to this scale. (Or in WoW 2!)
---
Warriors only want 2handers for PvP anyway.
---
Considering the guild Apes cleared MC the same day and half the people were 60 in that raid, I wouldn't be surprised if one of them was actually world first 60.
---
You’re*
---
So what’s the addons called? I’m still level 22 and would like to gain some levels.
---
Owls doesn't have screech, you got to get it from carrion birds
---
When will my torment end? :(
---
the good will from my significant other died off within an hour of launch when I caught the "are you actually going to be on there all night?"
---
and balance is restored.
---
Omg thank you! These are so freaking annoying and I wasn't aware of this!
---

---
The power of...THE INTERNET!
---
So click mouse button plus 5 I just used shift as example
---
Ehh I got told that my zf run was a waste of time because I was marking and didn’t bring a mage. Oh well bro that’s just ZF if your not just using mages to spam everything. Some people want a retail experience they can find another tank.
---
I have to use the Stone I am hovering over once the mob banishes itself. Which it does not do.
---
Torn between warlock or warrior and cant stick to one...
---
I enjoy both while leveling but i heard that the endgame if warlock is utter garbage and that warrior dominate everything, that being said I like the edgy esthetic of warlocks more than warriors. Help me decide...
---
Also forgot to mention that i am mainly looking to pve but want to get into pvp( not that good at it)
---
Queue*
---
Xaxa
---
We can argue whether or not they should break that addon, but that doesn't change the fact that they explicitly stated they would.
---
I also think it's worth mentioning that the wow and MMO community has changed since then. Those addons may have existed back in the day, but if nobody used them, then it doesn't matter.
---
Leveling a druid right now
---
You are a quick leveler, cat form is fast and you get travel form in level 30.
---
They are "weak" yes, but not worst. A Balance will never be a mage, a resto will never be a priest, a feral never a rogue and bear never a warrior, but they are not bottom, just not the best.
---
As for dungeons, bear is easy, you press maul, swipe and taunt when people dont know what do attack, mostly its the dps job to not get aggro on them, so if people die its mostly their fault.
---
Resto healer is good, battleress is extremely powerful aswell as MoTW, yeah you dont have a ress outside battleress but priest, paladins, shamans do. You'll probably run some dungeons and most likely raids with these people anyway.
---
Getting the useful items in gnomish then switching to goblin is the standard.
---
:(
---
I have 2 characters at level 10 now. Nightelf and a dwarf priest. And I'm still not too sure which one I should pick. I like being a dwarf, the animations are cool, his racials are strong, but in endgame the sets on a dwarf just won't look as good as on a nightelf... I simply can't make up my mind. :D 
---
If only my friends would have picked Horde.
---
they're offering server swaps, once layering is gone I'm gonna jump to a fresh server. Even if I gotta say goodbye to my old char I'll just have to
---
This guy has been asked to post proof numerous times and hasn’t. His numbers make absolutely no sense. He’s full of shit. 
---
I don’t doubt there’s some abuse going on but this post is bullshit fear mongering.
---
Wow, everything you said is completely factually false. Sounds like you're a layering exploiter that doesn't want it to be fixed
---
Not solely, but if you give first DFT or something to players who do not perform the best you will lose them instantly and your guild will be shit.
---
I've not played PvP, but I find in pve dots are your best bet. Throw corruption on it, then a curse of agony. If you have time use immolation, then wand the crap out of it. If you're leveling solo, use the void walker, otherwise I'd just use the imp for more dps. 
---
In dungeons, take the imp and keep it on passive untill you have a target. Stay back and put that dot rotation on each target. Don't forget to be spending your skill points too.
---
That's exactly why it's so special!
---
Nvm that dont work
---
Are shamans a joke to you?!
---
2h fury was not really a thing as dw fury and 2h arms was so much better. It’s not as bad as dw arms but not by much.
---
fellow priest here.. Ditto...
---
I play mostly on Pve servers - there is no reason to layer on PVE realms. They're so massively populated right now that any increased production you get from it won't get you ahead of anyone else and there is no reason to jump to end game content because hardly anyone is there...    Blizz has already stated they want to end layering for phase2 when pvp gets honor which is my gut says most people QQ'ing about layering on PVP servers where it can be used to avoid being ganked or gamed to take advantage of people fighting over something and layer hopping to steal it...  just generally stuff pve realms don't care about.
---
Were there any super long profession cooldowns besides transmuting arcanite back in classic?
---
Medium pop realms are significantly more people then full servers in vanilla. You don't have to be afraid for medium pop servers
---
The 2nd.
---
same, I created a party and didn't invite warrs/paladins to it, though did have 2 hunters. x)
---
Relationship goals &lt;3 Also wanna hear your story!
---
They're the only pets with a ranged attack. Good for staying out of the way of aoe's.
---
[Look here](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/hunter-dps-pets-guide#sec-4)
---
Oh I'm sorry. Of course telling people the word is a shit place due to their assumed ingame behaviour and calling them butthurt is clearly the better option here. I might have to try that one for a change. Thanks, stranger!
---
In all seriousness though, let's go grab a beer.
---
Working together as part of a team!
---
I feel like this with iron
---
Baah
---
I am a new player, the first time I found out about /roll. I was shocked by the brilliant design and have never not ‘rolled’ for a chest ever since.
---
Source, I haven’t heard this at all.
---
q*
---
You can tank with 2h in lower level content, it requires a little more attention to stance swapping and putting out reliable dps to maintain threat though
---
Enjoy.
---
Lok'Tar Ogar!!
---
It shows you abuse it. It shows you're a double standard.
---
Funny how you can change, 15 years ago there was not a fibre within me that saw a problem with this name. Still lol'd today tho, but in a more painful way
---
Instead of waiting for a group, they make their own group. It’s not hard to change the G in “LFG Mara, doing scepter quests” to an M, making it “LFM Mara, doing scepter quests”.
---
When you sit back and be passive, you are limiting what you may find. When you come to reddit and make a multiple paragraph post to complain, you are limiting what you may find. Be aggressive, make your own group. Those making aoe farm groups aren’t the majority, and there’s plenty of people that want to join a “normal” dungeon group and go through it at a slower, unrushed pace and complete quests they have.
---
I don't believe so but I'm super rusty on macros 
---
Maybe try out this one:
---
/Castsequence Battle Stance, Overpower
---
nice roleplay here! Take my upvote
---
excuse me, what?
---
For every who is hating this is a Nice little joke (my cat killed the mouse)
---
Wait - how is it that a slower weapon with higher DPS has a lower damage range? How does the math add up?
---
No, arms at 40 because of mortal strike and leveling with 2H is much better. 1-40 is personal preference between arms and fury.
---
More drop for me
---
So we need a petition to rename baguettes: “bread wands”
---
Everything I see says stick shadow, and I plan to do the same until 60. I will re spec after that for raid/pvp healing, but I think it all comes down to playstyle.
---
6-8500 evenings but might change due to transfers.
---
The huge Nordic community chose to play Gehennas, a lot of swedes there. Think Danes went firemaw
---
damn, you right. Thank you!! I missed this addon so much
---
Blizzard bans for abusing the economy more than any other ban type in the history of the game.  
---
All you "well the bank shouldn't have left the doors open" people have some really shitty view of morality.  This affects everyone on the server for the life of the server and you people are fine with a few people having tens of thousands of unearned gold waiting for them to trickle it into the economy through the next phases.
---
Sorry, I had speed to 60 in mind, forgot we had two records to discuss. You're correct that I got confused for a second.
---
I did this exact same thing like 2 days ago.
---
You will level so slowly that you will be intimately familiar with your class. Based on what you say go warrior or enhancement shaman?
---
Aren't furbolgs in Azshara pretty good?
---
APES said druids are garbage and only brought one for the buff. That being said the vast majority of the raid will need a druid because people suck dont know how to manage their mana and will die so innervate and Battle rez will always be needed. I am a druid main btw.
---
Have you played in the first minutes, or at least hours of launch? I had. It was a nightmare, and my system and connection is more than enough, considering I had classic graphics selected.
---
Layering needs to go, but it also needs to stay for at least a week, if not more. Servers are pretty full right now.
---
What level are you? Are you new to Classic? Did you play Vanilla? I'd this your first Priest?
---
I doubt he doesn't want it to be fixed if there is actually an issue there.
---
The problem is that it seems like that this is simply faked.
---
Anyone know a nice combo point add-on?
---
I don't like nug BTW.
---
And..
---
When does skinning start to be profitable?
---
Agree with Gnome&gt;Goblin but keep in mind, you have to completely re-level engineering 1-300 again.
---
Horde overpopulate PVP servers because of their racials and better options for world PVP like Redridge, direct access to STV from the Barrens, campable Wetlands, etc.
---
I'm on a medium/high pop server and I am never alone in an area.
---
Leveling is no problem on a Druid!
---
I hit level 5 in about an hour and I even got a group invite to take down a named Brisstleback!
---
The graph doesn't even include the gold cost for your epic mount.
---
The epic mount quest chain requires 350g as well as...
---
10 Arthas' Tears (Herbalism)
---
6 Arcanite Bars (Mining/Alchemy)
---
40 Runecloth
---
5 Stratholme Holy Waters (Boxes in Stratholme)
---
20 Enriched Manna Biscuits (Must be friendly with Argent Dawn to purchase)
---
A true classic.
---
Thanks for transferring !
---
That Stamina though..
---
It doesn’t matter in grand scheme of things, mon. Wash yer back!
---
Horde lacks immersion I believe. Questing in horde zones really just feels like mob spanking. In alliance zones you really feel like you have a purpose
---
Hopping layers isn't the problem.  Hopping layers to farm nodes is.
---
&gt;Oof, as an American this is sounding a little too real.
---
too real because you let some mouthpiece for the alliance media indoctrinate you with fake news?
---
Look at you, you are the captain now.
---
The longer he sits on them, the less valuable they become. He doesn’t have a monopoly, it’s not as if a server will only ever spawn x amount and then we’re fucked. Other players will find them and drive down the prices. If he has 160,000g worth of crystals st the time of that pic, it’s already depreciated. Depending on the server and how people play the AH, he could have lost thousands of gold. This is basic economics.
---
Yeah they promised to remove layering lmao that's not the same thing as fixing the bug, that's just removing its platform. 
---
I'm not acting high and mighty at all, I never hid that I abused the mechanics that I wanted fixed, and there's nothing wrong with abusing it while I can despite not wanting it to be there in the first place.
---
Honestly nobody ( by nobody I mean low level players) has money. Those sick green drops you are trying to sell are almost better off being sold to the vendor if you are looking for the cash right away.
---
There’s thousands of people who have streamed their 1-60
---
Please explain your methods!
---
A stack of Mageweave is 1g+ in AH, plus you don’t have to stop to skin. Can just kill nonstop, which means more loot and money.
---
Feel the same

This made me chuckle. However with the amount of pictures been taken from phones on this sub I wouldn't be surprised!
---
On Kromcrush Alliance, seems to always be in the Horde’s favor. They’re all over Hillsbrad, Thousand Needles, and especially STVietnam.
---
I seem to see about one Alliance for every five Horde.
---
How does that make any sense? Your personal experience is in no way affected by people abusing layer swapping, and while they do get ahead XP and economy wise, boycotting the game will also not prevent them from doing so.
---
&gt; clap
---
lmao
---
Hunter with jump shot and a good healthy run.
---
Thunderbluff have a really rare ring you can get from fishing only
---
It was obviously not super populated immediately but within the first hour I saw a lot of people. I’m from skeram and just didn’t have time in my life for queues.
---
There were a lot of transfers - my first character had a 5 minute wait and my 3rd had a 34 minute wait. I clicked them to transfer within 5-10 seconds of each other. 
---
People are too nervous about economy being new, when skeram economy is a whopping 8 days old. Yeah, the first few days will have a barren auction house and it may be a LITTLE harder to find a group in the first 48 hours but even last night skeram has a 4800 person queue to moment I got home from work.
---
What app do you have that lets you have the WASD buttons and such?
---
I really don't think you're playing a Goblin hunter in Classic WoW.
---
Awesome! You’re going to want to hold on to that once raids start and people have money and it’ll be worth a pretty penny.
---
At that lvl just dot and wand. Depending on wand the dps from wand is really good until late 30's. Here's a [detailed guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qdUs229_XvkR1NCeTrJkybL5BDXGIh7q/view) for drain tanking, which is a fairly good way to lvl as a warlock.
---
As for channel failing that's just you not turning properly. You should use your mouse for turning around. You only really have to focus on being on target as the cast is about to go off. That being said you shouldn't really be casting shadowbolt's in pvp, espeically that early. Just focus on doting the target, wanding and keeping them feared.
---
Layering really needs a (time) limitation. It's good that you can change layers to group up with your friends, but how often does that happen for individual players?
---
Once every ...10, 15, 30, 60 minutes? Also if you just switched layers and want to group up with another friend you can just pull him/them to your layer and don't switch have to switch yourself. Or use a X per hour approach.
---
No idea how long or what the restriction needs to be ideally, but there needs to be something. And honestly, there should've been something like that from the start. 
---
It's not only that they could easily have gotten the idea themselves as people do the somewhat same thing in retail (where it has less impact but jumping shards to farm rares was/is also a thing there) and, surprise, people told them from the very moment they introduced the tech.
---
Must be to help people earn the gold for their mounts
---
r/wow is dead because BfA sucks, not because ppl post art there :D

Nice one!

I'm US Alliance, moving from Pagle to Windseeker.  My name is available there, plus more stupid/pun names for future alts 😝
---
Most important thing i'm missing here: put targets up.
---
Life gets 1000000x easier if there is a skull to attack (and a moon to sheep or w/e), and you can easily offtank the rest with more aoe-oriented attacks.
---
Although you should take care not to sell under vendor price :D
---
If he definitely cared then he would have posted proof long time ago plus his server would know about it.
---
Just Look at any post asking for new stuff to be added to classic or anything to be changed.  The community who fought for this to happen want it just the way it was. Everyone was happy playing private servers that was the same old content with nothing new since they started coming up 10+ years ago.
---
It's much better for PvP. You have a decent amount of freedom with PvP rogue specs because your base skills alone provide your major tools. Also, I think preparation is in classic and a subtlety talent? That skill alone is worth going into sub for. Combat is still viable in PvP, but I personally think sub jumps ahead of it in that case.
---
Call the amber lamps.

Unless an Orc warrior wants it I doubt they'll get much use?

Dowsing the runes summons Majordomo. Defeating him allows you to summon Rag.
---
I'm abusing it by getting out of layers with 100 horde on a pvp server. Please wait another week
---
&gt;You are taking in circles. I was responding to specific points you made.
---
I don't care anymore and lost interest in talking to you. You are seemingly unable to realize that you are a hypocrite for directly profiting from something you condemn.
---
I know my server has more horde but do horde usually stick to he western continent (barrens) and alliance stick to the eastern continent?  With the capitals it makes sense
---
Go with Warlock, CC is important so Banish will help you bring something to the party where its useful especially when you get into Molten Core. Take up enchanting and tailoring and be sewing all day and sharding all night. To hell with having the best DPS and go with whats fun for you to play, also the class  mounts stand out as something real special.
---
That is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head.

This really needs to be animated for wallpaper engine. Gooby pls?

Wait a month or so for people to actually have gold
---
That's not included here. It costs 350g in costs, which is obviously not included in the (approx.) 56g that the graph claims.
---
Not sure why everyone disbelieves the Deadmines run.. I played 19 hours straight from launch, did RFC and WC, hit level 20. Then because I’m begrudgingly an adult, it took me 3 days to physically recover. Just hit 40 tonight! But only 50g :(
---
Congrats!
---
Don't expect someone confused by a web forum to figure this out.

Warlock, warrior is cancer to level, mage is so mainstream that my dog cried

---
While I would rather have layering to manage the insane launch numbers, anyone could see the impact it has on the economy by looking at the AH. Whenever the big leveling wave hits new zones and new mats (herbs, mining, etc.) the price for those mats plummets to vendor price.
---
I think you have 30 days for items in a mailbox!
---
There's a place for these kind of conversations.  It's call the Deeprun Tram.
---
Imp and Succubus is usually better than the VW. VW doesn't hold aggro well enough to justify the low dps.
---
Omni CC and SUF should show you enemy buffs and allow you to customize their target windows.
---
O shit. I forgot about that

What realms are they suggesting to move to?
---
Bro I play Horde in retail. I love the Horde because they’re evil, but they are evil. I’m already hyped for them. However, my heart is for the Alliance.
---
Nobody levels prot, you can tank low level dungeons as any warrior spec.
---
Bro he is using that as an example of a situation with the same principles
---
This isn’t an isolated incident. Some jerk named Boopsie on Grobbulous said he blacklisted me for not accepting his non-bartered trade (like he wouldn’t lower the price) that was twice the price of AH but more specifically because I wouldn’t travel to him to buy his overpriced wool. I put THAT fool on ignore. Good luck trying to tank a group lol
---
Lol I feel like everyone has to drink. I duod with a random through senjin as mage and we both would drink after 2 or 3 mob kills, 1 if I was by myself and the target is higher level than me.
---
Your hypothetical case doesn't make sense. He literally only needs to say "ding lvl 60" in world chat and half the population would just shift click him for proof. And if 0.1% of the server population was watching Jokerd stream then that would be enough for someone be posting it in his twitch chat. Not even that because dozens of people would post it on reddit too because free karma.
---
Now if the "real" lvl 60 didn't share his achievement on world chat and nobody knew then it would literally mean he didn't care.
---
After giving ProJared a chance to [explain himself in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBywRBbDUjA), it very much appears that while he is a pervert, he was falsely accused of being a pedophile by two people who are mentally ill and unstable. Internet being the Internet, you are guilty until proven innocent. But ProJared has done nothing of the sort, and he proves it with facts.
---
I only thought it was fair to enlighten you on the situation too, since I think someone being falsely accused of something so horrible deserves to speak up.

That's because it most likely is someone who does have English as a second language.
---
don't have to fight queues if you never log off I guess
---
Amazing. 
---
I am very proud of you Kubzak!
---
You gonna use those later or will you sell them? :p
---
The memories &lt;3 There was something special in undead starting zone. Even though it was so dark and gloomy I still liked it.
---
I’ve only been able to clock 2-3 hours a night at my age.  My old WoW habits are from a time gone by.  Still a fun experience, but feels strange not being able to be at the head of the pack.
---
Same with people getting arena grand master in one reset.

I've ran past so many alliance players. I play with my bud, so we could easily beat the shit out of this alliance players. But so far we haven't, we even let alliance players quest nearby. We don't really care much about WPVP while leveling and there is no honor in killing right now... I've been killed by alliance players tho, I was lvl 22 and got ganked on the boat from Booty Bay by a lvl 34 dwarf hunter...
---
Ironforge forever!
---
Under level 50 you can tank anything in the game as any warrior spec, just make sure you use 1h+ shield, defensive stance and that you buy max ranks on all your protection abilities (revenge, demo shout, etc...)
---
Most warriors will be leveling (and tanking) as Arms.
---
Feralas!
---
How is this possible so quick? Ya'll went to the hyperbolic time chamber?
---
&gt; At 8pm on fucking monday night bigglesworth had a 62 minute queue.
---
I had a "160" minute queue on Stalagg last night around 7 PM. Long minutes, of course.
---
Legit Hotaha is my buddy I play with two redditors one cup
---
this was honestly what shocked me the most about the early kills. not that it was done but that people actually farmed out that rep so fing fast
---
i also did not think it was possible to hit 60 in 3 days even with 24/7 playing
---
You're right, I guess I haven't thought of it.

What server? I have Piggybank on Incendius
---
Without being a expert for mmo development, I would assume the terms layering and sharding are referencing the same system. Meaning what's layered are the shards. Global layers just wouldn't make sense for me, thinking of server resource management...
---
Im not boycotting anything. Im waiting for the initial rush to be over so i can enjoy the world of warcraft. Immersion is ruined by layers and spam clicking empty space waiting for a mob to spawn.
---
You're not reading.

I'm asking about my off hand.

Also, Gouge then Backstab. Pretty easy.

Seems like you are mad, you posted this shit.

Chuds are just ignorant selfish people with no respect for others. it's sound logic.
---
Have you been skipping dungeons?
---
First of all, how dare you. Secondly, get out of here with them space goats!
---
It's a lot faster without a tank. Just grab 3 mages a warlock and a priest. Warlock pulls with Eye of Kilrog and you aoe everything.
---
More like she's chasing that mad deeps.

This makes me happy

Hold your breath for too long and you die. Lmao

Nz/aus term for cowardice. The dropping of one's nutsack, thus to no longer have any balls.
---
I am also a mage with herbalism and tailoring and I just played normally, vendoring everything, selling valuable greens on the auction house, selling all my herbs, selling valuable trade items and quest items. Btw the mount cost is 90 gold if you are honored.
---
People wonder why I roll on RP or Normal. This is why. I will never understand the enjoyment of taking away other people's time away from playing the game.
---
What kind of person doesn't leave those channels immediately upon logging in?
---
You clearly don't understand the subject.
---
It's kind of like say "Just buy a Ferrari they're the fastest and easiest to drive.
---
There is a major difference between something being technically possible and being a reasonable thing to tell someone to do, that's new to the game.
---
That's because it most likely is someone who does have English as a second language. However, costed IS indeed an actual word, is it NOT however, interchangeable with the word cost.
---
Lol comparing real life economics to a very simplistic market in a game.
---
I made over 10g per level after level 36 or so. Questing, killing and skinning in Stranglethorn Valley
---
Fel Hunter would almost always be out in group PvP, and almost never when solo. In a duel you’d want the fel hunter vs a priest for sure. 
---
Idk why I’m getting so many posts about lock dominating this matchup, but it’s simply false. I don’t think any of these guys have dueled good priests. Half of them are talking about DoTs killing the priest which is hilarious because your DoTs just get dispelled.
---
You should level as shadow and then immediately switch to a disc/holy hybrid (you can lean more towards a holy/pve only spec during Phase 1). You can heal any content up to 60 as shadow, btw, so forming groups should still remain relatively easy.
---
Not trying to tell you how to play, if you really like shadow just give it a shot. But generally speaking, shadow tends to be not very useful in raids or in BGs. It's known as the 1v1 duelgod spec.
---
Ah the good old Crossroads mailbox dance....
---
I passed a troll in the barrels the other day names Virjin
---
Because people refuse to transfer off their server bc they have a level 30 lol
---
awesome!
---
Definitely! I love reading lore
---
Yeah he was. If someone else had come close they would have been known about - the people watching the race to 60 were keeping an eye on things. Hell, the 2nd place was on an OCE realm!
---
The players are taking advantage of being able to move their character between 'layers' - which are basically different "instances" of a zone within the same realm, that are used for load balancing the servers. The player can farm a whole area, then switch layers so the monster spawns and world spawns (like mining nodes) are back again instantly, without needing to wait for respawns. This makes it a lot easier to farm a massive amount of lucrative materials and gold in a shorter time than intended.
---
Hey man if you're on OCE we can group up. 
---
UNLESS YOU FUCK ME BY TAKING MY RESERVED LOOT THEN YOU ARE ON ANOTHER BLACKLIST BITCH!

Good on you.  I'm absolutely the guy who sells bags for less than vendor prices.  Newbies should be able to afford shit, too.

Im orc warrior, so il be using them!
---
show us a screenshot of your fiancée
---
I've done this and at level 35 I am 800 off revered. It's a lot of work. That is as a human.
---
At ashenvale level you need to be doing stonetalon quests too. Then move onto a couple in desolace.
---
34 to 41 is a huge gap til feralas' 31 quests.
---
I think at 60 ill be about 6000/21000 and thus need 300 stacks of runecloth.
---
Bit dropped last night and we couldn't work out for who this set was for lol. +Staff skill like what on earth 😂
---
Paladin tanking is stupid easy, tho. Mark, pull, Consecration, judge/cast Wisdom, auto attack.
---
Openly admitting you can't handle leveling without exploiting is pretty hilarious.
---
yeah it never used to be like that at the start and habits die hard, plus this example shows that you could put the ability name in the showtooltip, just in-case you throw something like a trinket or battle elixir to use just prior to the ability, or the tool tip will show the trinket icon instead
---
Im not excited about reaquiring that grandmaster token...
---
Not seeing Carltonbanks
---
Most deadlines groups should be willing to help.  Odds are they need it too.  Yes I'd run dm a few times if only for the xp. Also not sure of your wow experience but it would also give you a chance to see how other classes play....classes in classic are pretty different than retail
---
You have to actively join them and I have them on a side tab so if I want to find a group for dungeon I don't have to start typing /join etc. I can just quickly change tab and try to look through this garbage of chat
---
From a hunter's point of view all 8 yards are the dead zone. They can't shoot you in melee range. If you are melee, you want to be as close as possible.
---
Are you sure this isn't your first rodeo? Undercutting by that much for an item that will always sell seems a bit silly.
---
Haha hilarious. Good on you for not triggering and just ignoring him...
---
Why is he even upset if he sells them for more he can make an easy flip with yours xD
---
We shall welcome you as a long lost brother. :D
---
I was a warrior night Elf in Tanaris, I had a little trouble making the quest in the creek of thieves when I met a hunter NE lvl 47 who offered me her help, we became friends, then we were married at the Temple at Darnassus.

In 2007 I flew to join her here in Canada,

Damn I forgot about stances being relevant for warriors back before Pandaria. Also when you had to equip sword/shield in macros for spell reflect, shield wall, etc.

My bank alt is called sunwellfargo

Not possible by lvl 40. I’m definitely trying though
---
This is hilarious, it's so interesting seeing how people act over something so silly.
---
Man is clearly am industry tycoon in the making.
---
Its present in retail I have no idea why it wouldn't work for classic.. seems like a huge oversight
---
Fuck this art is awesome
---
He's been selling for weeks when the game "came out" 9 days ago? lul
---
?
---
They wont depreciated until he introduces them to the market, but even so, he can sell them much cheaper than anyone else which devalues them but makes it less viable for others to use it as a gold farm.
---
So he's also making it harder for others to make gold too.
---
It took me a week to reach 38, and according to this, the remaining 22 levels will take me 1.1 months.. I Take that challenge for sure
---
I don't know what level you get your mage skills like conjuring food/water and portals.... But selling those services seems to be a thing on my server. People are advertising in the chat something like "portal to darnassus in 10 minutes... 5s or (whatever reagent they need, can't remember)" I imagine that they can then either use the reagents they get to sell more portals for money or sell the reagents  to other mages for cheaper than the reagent vendors and still make a profit. 
---
I'm not a mage, so I don't really know how it all works for them... But that's what I've seen advertised.
---
Again, you could see the same thing with osrs during release.
---
I was asking for data not opinions.
---
Did you find a good add-on for altoholics? I need to know what boe gear to save and what to craft.
---
I'm level 17 and I'm dreading going to pvp areas.
---
Quick question are dungeons match made or do you need a pre made group?
---
I don't think you know how an economy works.
---
You need demand and supply. He's got the supply but not enough demand to shift the items.
---
The items are currently depreciating in value as more people acquire them. They are also infinite in number.
---
If anything he's made it cheaper and more affordable for people.
---
Uh huh, sure dude.
---
COME ON NOW THERE'S NO NEED TO GET VIOLENT
---
And rightfully so. The first good drops are for the top performers that put in the work. Not for the warm bodies that fill up to 40.
---
On a PvP realm, the other player could wait until you're in combat with one or more NPCs and then turn on you and kill you. On a PvE realm the most they can do is stop helping you.
---
The fact that they choose to remain friendly is what makes this interaction special, whereas on a PvE realm it wouldn't be special at all, just another day in Stranglethorn.
---
Well written and entertaining read. However, everything I said is still true, and Horde deserve complete and utter annihilation, with absolutely no mercy.
---
This game already killed me. Waiting for Rez as we speak...
---
No that's a completely valid point, I'm not exactly living paycheck to paycheck, I'm a student but I had quite an expensive summer with holidays and going to festivals, where I spent a lot of money, so just trying to save for now
---
So you live in dream bubble where you think everyone is in a position in their live that they can spend 12+ hours  per day on a game, and SERIOUSLY think that 6h / day shifts are the standard in Sweden?
---
Better to just know what your class needs while leveling and make the call yourself. Addons will only tell yyou so much and could easily recommend something inferior just because it's technically better dps for example.
---
Got some gear up on the AH too, that’s pretty cool :)
---
It can't. Look at it this way. If layer hoping is happening on a large scale then it doesn't matter because that is simply just population re-distribution. If it's happening on a small scale then those people doing it can't compete with the general populations in those layers either (gen-pop is still farming/questing)
---
Someone can do more harm in your scenario playing in server off-peak hours than they could ever do by playing layer hopping and layer hopping in  off peak times is actual a disadvantage since you would introduce variability to your farming routes.
---
prices are already EXTREMELY low because there is a lack of gold in the market/economy so you can't plummet prices any further since general population is dealing with silver as a currency not even gold really at this point.
---
Always try to get a new stronger weapon.
---
It is such a big difference.
---
There are guides online with a weapon progression list
---
Oof
---
Yeah I've been considering a Druid mainly for flag running, but also just for general utility to be able to jump into nearly any role at an instant.
---
Sometimes it is good to undercut and push the competition out for a bit, then slowly raise the prices and earn all the money. those 0.01c undercut wars can drag out forever and cost more money when you have to relist unsold items.
---
I mean, you might be correct. I won't claim that I'm 100% right.
---
But I have watched enough of all these different WoW streamers, and they type in a similar fashion.
---
He knows it, he just wants to be an idiot.
---
horde only has to walk straight past two alliance outposts to get to our fp, no big deal
---
I can't possibly express enough how glad I am to be much older than twelve now.
---
It's not the same principles at all though. Robbing is taking something from someone else. This is generating something out of nothing. It's not a good comparison.
---
Daze - daze - you need more Rage - daze.
---
Please teach me to do stuff like this
---
Alone=go in a zone that you overlvl
---
On a hidden hotbar that shows up on mouseover, of course!
---
Weapon skill is op
---
Layering removal IS coming. The population cap WILL shrink (layers will evaporate and you will have less people total, but they'll all be on the same layer). This is your chance to leave.
---
How is it going to have zero economy if you’re moving two well established server’s characters into one place? The AH will be empty for all of 15 mins before you won’t be able to tell a difference.
---
People who hoard them will be able to set the market price. Like with diamonds IRL; deBeers and others maintain an artificial shortage so they hold their value.
---
Yeah, I’ve seen several people running sideways or even straight up backwards, and it weirds me out every time. No idea what causes it, but it’s definitely an interesting effect, lol!
---
That’s a good point
---
Yeah and it's cringy and low key racist...
---
Playing with a controller is definitely doable. Look what I did today:

 It was very easy to set up. Let's see how it is when I have more abilities :D
---
"Whoops! Missed one!"

\~Death, 2019
---
Thats why you go Engineering at 60.
---
Game hasn't been out two weeks and you're already a blacklisted normie.  Good luck doing anything in game now.
---
It's not a hack. It's just using the layering system to its most scummy and profitable extent. I'm doing the same thing and will continue to do so until I'm told not to.
---
I wish that I weren't able to do this, because the profits are insane. I don't like doing it, but its so easy and lucrative I can't not do it. I wish they'd patch this in a hot fix asap.
---
Please make this a pasta
---
Everyone knows you play paladin as Ret...
---
Looks like QuestLogEx
---
I'm sorry hahaha, I actually remember running past you, i was going to Rebirth you but i was running low on mana, sorry :x
---
You are the real mvp.
---
Let the orc have the axes and force a roll on everything else. If that doesn't work, get a better guild.
---
Good job. I was so stoked to get this as well. Not only is it a powerhouse hitter for the level you can get it, it has stats useful for every spec. Big fan.
---
Dual wielding as a warrior when leveling may not be optimal, but damned if it isn't more fun to me. Waiting for a 3.8 speed swing timer just makes me slowly lose the will to live.
---
Been struggling as well m8. The best I've found is to try to stick to quests that are a level or two lower than your level. Also getting a good weapon is key to warrior leveling so popping into an instance when you have the quests is a good idea if you can. Also having guildies help you get good weapons helps.  
---
Learn first aid, you will go through the Band-Aids. 
---
If you end up pulling more than 1 or two mobs and know youre going to die do not be ashamed in hamstringing and running away but run sideways so the mobs aren't hitting your back so you don't get dazed.
---
How long does it take start to finish?
---
Saw a female Tauren named "fursuit" 
---
Guess with no worgen they default to Tauren?
---
I think they will do everything they can to ensure a healthy population, and that they realise success is from a great social atmosphere which a low pop wont provide.  Keep in mind when a server is low pop, its like a high pop server back in vanilla.
---
I knew these BFA players would fuck up classic
---
NGL i feel like most orcs/Taurens kinda want BELFS to leave so people actually have to play a race that suits the horde.
---
It's kinda weird having the pretty elves in a group of hulks.
---
And slam
---
I knew what this would be before I clicked and I'm still delighted.
---
Have you ever heard of McAffee on Access file scanning or file checksum hashing?
---
There are multiple ways you can handle it, though to be honest, if someone were to do this they could simply say "We have banned this add on" then do a file checksum, scan the add on file contents, scan for names and scan for the add on name itself.
---
Then if they find people are circumventing after being told it's not allowed you hit them with the banhammer.  
---
Seriously, it's possible to do.  The optics suck, but it can be done. it's not like these are executables that you have to deterministically detect what is being done. By the way - that is what your moden on access anti-virus does.
---
So it is possible. if you think it's not, your understanding of modern automated data analysis needs to be updated.  Maybe if you ran obfuscated code.  but since you need THEIR engine to run it - again, probably not something insurmountable.
---
It would take us a lot more time to work around than them to ban.  Again, as I stated before the best bet for a questionable add  on is to literally to not publish it.  Heck honeypots are how most viruses are found.
---
If you can't understand the concept he was trying to get across I'm not gonna bother trying to explain to your empty head
---
Oh, you're right, I forgot. WotLK kid.
---
Giving BRE to a ret Paladin is beyond stupid. It shouldn't have ever been a consideration. Put on the dress, Paladins.
---
A few weeks lol
---
Every class needs a way to ruin other players’ days as a way of retaliation.  Some, like Warriors have no way to do this and are constantly being out tagged by ranged classes, or having chests and other interactionable objects taken by faster classes.
---
Netherwind is high populated during peak hours, i play on it myself and it doesn't feel dead in the slightest
---
Pretty much this, I have no trouble with my Skeram queue, so I won't transfer.
---
If they wanted people to transfer, they should have opened up character transfers to any server (or perhaps any non-full). I don't care about the queue, but I do care that my friend group has been split up because some of them did.
---
Holy pallies are safe tho yeet
---
R u insane your auto attack does nothing
---
True but it wouldn't affect the economy unless he pumped the additional money into the auction house.
---
If he did it would make items rise in price theoretically (if he had a massed enough wealth to bulk buy) but due to the amount of players and the fact big priced items such as mounts as just hidden gold sinks with money vanishing outside of the economy I don't think it'll have much of an effect.
---
Now if everyone did this then yes everything would be dirt cheap. It would devalue the worth of a gold coin. Means buying items from players is cheaper but getting vendor items takes more time and they are theoretically worth more.
---
The main barriers to raiding are consumables. If the markets flooded with cheap herbs and pots etc then I see it as an absolute win coming from something who lacks sufficient time to farm myself.
---
So you're telling me that basing your prices on a previous market which no longer exists is now the way to evaluate an item price?
---
Yeah, layering is fucked up for farming, but more items means that they should sell for cheaper, so are we really losing out on this?
---
That’s what Mankrik wants you to think. Bastard got away with it.
---

It does have a time limitation afaik. Base is 5 min and can be delayed by combat and pvp.

QuestLogEx is one of the other addons I looked at to see if it worked for me. I personally have no use for the collapsible part of the window. I also found that it does not cascade any other windows that you open next to it. For example if you open the Quest Log and Character window the character window will fall behind or in front of the Quest Log window. My adaptation fixes this and makes the windows tile correctly.
---

Why would i let others have fun on behalf of others? Why would i let people bully someone? It's funny how you pretend to be such a little tough guy, complaining about how others show their feelings and emotions in response to bullying.  
---
You must have had, and still have, a very sad lonely life.  
---
People who bullly, do so for a reason. but the reason isn't that anything is wrong with their victim. they do it because they themselves, like you, are probably stressed, and have a crappy life. or because you have low self esteem, or because your family is shitty and they don't like your existence.  
---
It has nothing to do with being thick skinned or being, as you say, a crybaby bitch. The problem is people such as yourself. you're projecting your insecurities and sadness onto other people to feel in control, to feel like you're in power. Its actually really really sad.  
---
So yeah, its not us who need to grow a bigger spine, or have "bigger" problems in life. its the opposite. You're just to immature and dumb to understand that and you lash out to others instead of fixing your own life.
---
I was able to save up and get my mount at 40 as a shaman. I now have about 50g at lvl 44.
---
Yeah I'd love to hear how you managed it too.
---
Nice :D how did you meet, randomly?
---
I just made this. Make sure to make toggle keyboard macro that spams jump... or you’re not really rogue’ing.

---
Where the hell's the petition to change this? I'll sign it
---
Happy cake day
---
I don't have any source, but why would you think there's a 1-character limit? Kind of defeats the purpose, since you'd still be playing on the server with the alts you couldn't bring
---
Didn't vote you cause its stupid.
---
I transferred from skeram - I think once it opens up to new players this afternoon and there has been a whole day of transfers it will be more full.
---
I’m NOT going to miss the queues
---
Never leveled to 60 in vanilla, but 2h + hamstring kiting should help you at your current level, if you've unlocked it.
---
Charge/run straight towards a mob with autoattack engaged, apply Hamstring and run through the mob and out of its range, turn around so you encounter it when your weapon swing timer resets, apply Rend if needed and reapply it or Hamstring as needed. That way you can always trade with it hit for hit. Pop Blood Rage between pulls to keep rage at a healthy level. This is obviously most efficient when fighting one mob at a time.
---
Print Screen  
---
Usually near the top-right area of the keyboard.
---
Mage has the best quality of life imo. Portals, food, blink, etc.
---
Warlock also has a pretty great quality of life by comparison, and the voidwalker is excellent. Candy and summons are always welcome.
---
Coin flip on those two.
---
While you were all singin' songs and fucking off in mountains with Snow White, Stormwind was burning.  Stormwind took the brunt of the damage in the First War.  And it was Stormwind who decided to do something about it and proposed the Alliance.

Ok, fair one, will give yours a test run.

Where do you get statistics on server population?

Thanks for the info. What level is recommended for the DM? I’m running a rogue so would be dps I would think
---
Bonebiter.
---
Quest in scarlet monastery.
---
Why the hell do people keep saying this shit. Overflow from two realms moving to a new realm is not the same as an entirely brand new realm. It’s literally the same characters from launch in the same world without a queue. 
---
I guess most of reddit won’t understand this concept, but not all of us have no jobs and can afford to wait in even an hour long queue when we’d like to play. Don’t move if you don’t want to, but you’re lying if you say it’s a dead realm with no economy.
---
They have said that paid transfers are on the table later since it existed in vanilla, and considering blizzard likes money i wouldnt worry.
---
Any relation to the old Gilneas Alliance guild Storm?
---
Currently a holy priest in Tailoring/Enchanting
---
Between some of the gadgets, and the goggles, going to Engineering is looking pretty tempting. Just had a few questions.
---
1. What do I lose in terms of viability for PvE if I went Tailoring/Engineering? I know Tail/Ench is what I usually saw recommended for some reason...
---
2. What is it exactly that drew priests to usually be tail/ench? For some reason I knew to use this combo, but for the life of me can't remember why.
---
Call the police and write your congressman

Just because you can do something within the game doesn't mean you can't get banned for it.

Hey, I found the solution.
---
The WSAD configuration can’t be set in the steam link app, you have to configure it in the Steam fullscreen mode by clicking the big Steam logo and on the left hand menu you’ll have some controller configuration option (sorry can’t check the exact name right now).
---
There will be different layout types: Personal, Comunity, etc.
---
You have to choose the Predefined ones, and the bottom one should be the WSAD one.
---
Let me know if you can’t find it!

Alt+z for real minimalism.

We did on private servers. Obviously not every single person but the few hundred you were levelling at the same pace with.

"If you're not gonna use my inaccurate analogy I'm not going to correct myself."
---
Always keep your 2h up to date with your level when possible.  Aim for ones with the highest DPS possible.   Learn the hamstring/autoswing kiting method.  Spirit is a great stat early, keeps down time minimal.
---
Nothing? Oh well, I guess you realized your comment made no sense in the context.
---
Yes first aid is a must. As I'm progressing through quests I basically use Band-Aids on cooldown (usually after combat ends). You can bandaid up in a handful of seconds and then proceed. You can use Band-Aids while in combat but they stop on damage so you have to separate from mobs attacking you and not have a bleed or dot on you to fully utilize them or just after you've pulled 1 or 2 and need to top up health as they are a 1 minute cooldown. There is a classic guide on wowhead for first aid that tells you where to get the higher level Band-Aids as you progress.
---
Also you can try to ask a mage for some mage food as we go through Band-Aids and food a lot whilest leveling.
---
Hamstring is an ability warriors get that snares the target (makes them run slower). You would have to put it on each target but then you can create space. In pvp hamstring is basically your best friend but that gets into other strats.

Questie
---
There's a 21/30 Fury tankish spec that takes 1h weapon specialization but forgoes Flurry to get it.
---
&gt; Dual wielding as a warrior when leveling may not be optimal
---
I just switched, feels faster tbh. I don't know what the hype is with 2 hander. Dual wield has more damage even with the higher miss chance on white attacks and I believe abilities have the same miss chance with dual and 2 handed.
---
Missing also doesn't feel like you just wasted 3 seconds of combat.
---
This is the vanilla experience.
---
I caught some flack for being a level 28 Holy Paladin trying to heal Gnomer. That was until I very kindly let them know that I have 1900 mana... +50 to bonus healing.... and my heal only costs me 50 mana.
---
No one died the whole run.... no one.
---
As a lock we're just the less talented younger brothers.
---
There are cross-faction quests all over the continents, so the factions don't really "stick" to either side unless you are low level. Swamp of Sorrows is on Eastern Kingdoms and was crawling with Horde when I tried to quest there, so it just depends.
---
Correct. Have to do battle with them until *you* learn it so you can teach it to other pets.

Uh... I'm from Sweden so I wouldn't know, I play Gehennas though so I'm well aware of the big lines ;)

Is fishing good for making gold?
---
Same here as well, I wanted to play years ago, but never had a PC or the funds. 
---
I have really no clue what I'm doing besides from youtube videos I have been starting to watch. I've been playing solo since all my friends play console and have managed to get a level 11 troll mage so far and I'm enjoying every moment.
---
Why does my mage look like a priest tho?

Your cat is a druid stuck in cat form and is trying to tell you something. (Similar to the bear in Auberdine that was tamed by a hunter)
---
No, he’s right, like I’ve said since the first iteration it doesn’t seem accurate at all.  I’m not blaming you it’s just not accurate because there’s too many variables to account for.  Example?  Dungeon spam.  I hit 60 in under 6 days played as a result of it.  Your pre-launch estimate for my levelling speed, class, etc given the same number of hours per day placed me at September 24th.
---
Yet your supposed played time to 60 is more than your estimated time. How exactly is that being ahead of schedule? Having problems keeping your story straight?
---
Well now you're leveling with 10000 people instead. Even if the total population is similar (which it probably isn't but whatever) there's a massive difference in timing.
---
Classic hard retail easy
---
Look at it from the other end though. As a buyer, sure it'll make things easier. With deflation on trade goods it becomes much harder to earn gold as a seller. So while crafting and ranking up professions may become easier, earning money for your mount/repairs/actual rare items on the AH becomes that much harder. I definitely agree that we shouldn't want things handed to us on a silver platter, but that's not what this is doing.

I am relatively new to WoW and first time leveling a Warlock on Classic. Last night I did DM at lvl 18 with some lvl 21’s. I did little to no damage according to my DPS addon and I think it’s because mobs were dead before  my DoT’s could ramp up and be useful. I chose Warlock affliction because I looked up highest dps, yet now I feel useless in dungeons. My question is this, are warlocks useful or should I re-roll now while I still can?
---
I think not...
---
I have a 28 lock, 21 mage and 20 rogue... along with a 13 priest, 12 shaman, 15 warrior.
---
Please help
---
You are completely correct. The situation I described is best case scenario
---
That’s people using auctioneer, and it’s so, so frustrating! 
---
People have been doing it in retail for years now, so I’m not sure Blizzard can or will do anything about it. :-(
---
I explained it 🔝
---
Let me know if you can’t find it
---
I always prefer humans due to the increased weapon skill. Misses are annoying and the extra points help a bit, although in endgame raiding you’ll never swing it.
---
Perception is pretty good too for PvP mind, your consecration is expensive and seeing the rogues come a little sooner can belp.
---
*shrug* it's really just the person farming screwing themselves since they're creating a bloated market that's just completely fucking themselves over. And come P2 it'll be gone anyway
---
Glad I'm not in a guild with you lol. People take games way too seriously. I remember when I was clearing content back in vanilla we had a ret paladin and I was a little too try hard and didn't like it when he got gear either. We still cleared almost all of Naxx with that. Having 1 ret in your raid isn't a big deal and they deserve gear. I guess you and I have to agree to disagree.
---
Part of the reason, my group specifically, is spam cleaving instances, is because of the class reworks. We're using a paladin tank, and he's holding threat spectacularly well. Probably because they changed a bunch of skills for paladins later on in vanilla. Now we get to use all the reworked abilities and talents. 
---
We did an Ulduman last night and it was a bit rough on the healer, nothing he couldn't handle tho. We still just AOE blasted the whole place like it wasnt even elite.
---
That's actually kind of awesome.
---
So it was YOU that punched me in the face as I offered friendly waves! 
---
I learned the other day that Horde and Alliance speak different languages. I had no idea, It was a nice touch as I tried to communicate.
---
Yep, the only thing that makes it worse is having a warlocjs watch you drink, just standing there, and when you have done your drinking he life taps his mana up. 
---
Well fuck you dude, I'm not drinking for you. The nerve XD
---
There are a bunch of Blood Elves in Azshara.
---
My rogue banker is named Shankbank B)
---
I also recommend Windshear Crag as you can level lockpicking easily too here
---
If the only reason Billy the Orc is doing more dps than Johnny the Tauren is because of his race it means they are exceptionally close to each other in skill.
---
You can do the classic raids with lots of warm bodies.
---
googling really hasnt turned up anything hence why i am here
---
I see my classic char as an alt if not a side project. Its quite boring and tedious so far tbh.
---
I see you are also a man of culture.
---
For the girl I'd say
---
You're making an awful amount of assumptions there buddy. I happen to have a very good life with plenty of loved ones, not that that's any of your fucking business.
---
You're treating a simple joke as actual bullying. Where in my comment have I advocated *actual* bullying? You're spewing a lot of head-canon here to give yourself some sort of imaginary moral high ground. It's easier to attack me and make assumptions than actually looking at yourself and seeing that you are in fact - an oversensitive pussy. 
---
I'm gonna repeat what I said. If you base your self worth on what somebody says to you online; you need to re-evaluate your priorities in life. Why would you give a shit about a comment of someone you don't even know? Are you really that mentally fragile that you can't just ignore it? They certainly don't give a fuck; it's all about getting a reaction. Which is exactly what you're giving to them by going all SJW.
---
I'm not even a part of this entire ordeal - I don't play WoW. It's just funny seeing people get triggered over something so irrelevant, so inconsequential, so fucking stupid. It's a childish joke meant to get a quick giggle. It really doesn't go any deeper than that; and you trying to paint everyone here as a bunch of inhumane monsters is frankly hilarious.
---
Stop acting as if anyone here actually gives enough of a fuck about you, or these other triggered losers to truly wish you harm. It's really not that deep.
---
Arms isnt mediocre for raids, its outright terrible since AP was normalized. Youll be doing less than Hunter DPS.
---
If you really want Arms gear, its the exact same as Fury in PvE except youre capped at 9 hit, so swap any gear that puts you over cap with more AP/crit gear
---
Ignoring trolls is usually the best way to deal with them — otherwise you risk going down to their level.

---
What do your unit frames look like?
---
Yeah every dungeon group respects the rolls. If someone doesn't they usually get kicked on my realm.
---
Is that why i see people asking for party invites to phase? theyre getting camped?
---
Everything I've read and experienced points to a layer hopping cooldown. This stacks higher with additional hops or activity like pvp or farming nodes.
---
I also highly doubt the 160k gold in arcane crystals claim. Crystals dont spawn from every vein, so he'd have to have mined at least 10k+ nodes at a very generous 1/3 drop rate which is ridiculous from a time perspective.
---
Totally useless unless you’ve got friends to help carry you.
---
My dwarf hunter would be getting a bear pet! From that classic loading screen.
---
My dwarven warrior is currently crafting himself a nice 2-handed axe!
---
I participate in world pvp as a rogue just like everyone else, but I don't go looking for fights, but it just seems like such a dumb idea to gank a rogue who is behaving neutrally towards you so far. 
---
You hate rogues because they can make your life difficult, so you want to give a neutral one a reason to gank you?
---
Sounds insane to me.
---
You get shield wall as long as you have a shield.. argueably Arms is better for tanking low levels because of Anger Managment which allows you to charge for 15 rage, stance to defensive and apply a sunder.
---
People don't seem to understand, the prot tree offers no damage and little rage generation. Without those warriors suck at holding agro. Almost guarantee the bad warrior tanks are the ones with only prot talents. It doesnt become viable until higher levels.
---
Most warriors just don't know how to pool rage.
---
If you have agro and are not losing it just auto attack and shield block every 6 seconds. Most tanks go in spamming for damage. Get sunder and rend stand there and pool, sunder for dump to 5 the switch to hstrike. Use bloodrage on CD, try to always open with charge if you have no rage. If the healer needs to drink and you have over 20 rage use bloodrage to stall the decay until pull... over 20 rage just body pull instead of dancing.
---
Whitemane, it's currently ~65%/35% H/A

You should take the time to learn how to use TSM. Nothing else even comes close.

Yeah I had the same problem.
---
Does anyone know how long the "free transfer" is open for? it appears it started yesterday - they have been letting skeram people in for a bit now so I wonder when they will unlock the server and report stats
---
Uh what? You can absolutely trade loot in classic?? BoE items drop all the time. 
---
And if it was 3 mages rolling need separately, 2 of them would be kicked since they needed on something that was shittier than what they already had on.
---
I don't pay that much attention to it... So it's quite possible it's more than that! I was just giving an example of stuff I've seen... Should have put in that the price may be off.
---
At the end of the day, as much as I love playing WoW Classic, it's a virtual world.  Go and enjoy the real world.  Enjoy the experiences you will have, the sights you will see.  In 20 years those memories of experiencing the real world will be worth much, much more.
---
Waste of a talent point.

Thank you! Today i'm gonna train first aid, and cooking by myself and make sure all my gears up to date. Then later do some mad dungeoning.

Next threat should’ve been “I’ll run a trace on ur IP and hax ur xb360 account. Njoy the ban nub”.

Ahh. Early 2000’s online gaming making a comeback with WoW. Such a breath of fresh air!
---
Yeah I leveled a nelf druid to 11 on blaumeux and I had to leave all chat channels because they're so obnoxious.
---
&gt; After that, they went in a different direction when adding new races.
---
* blood elves/space goats in tbc  
---
* no new races in wotlk/cata  
---
* pandas in pandas  
---
* no new races in wod  
---
* allied races in legion  
---
* more allied races in bfa  
---
kind of a weird direction in general but i think they've got a decent path now
---
except for the part where you have to get exalted with legacy reps to unlock the new races even after the expansion is over
---
Did you perhaps swap to a different region by accident?
---
Teamviewer and timing in the queue 
---
I work 7am - 3/4pm and I start my queue at noon sometimes I’m log In already while in commute home.
---
What's the addon that tells you the values?
---
The wording on the forum post is singular which has led me to ask this question.
---
Chests are worse.  At least with mining/professions you can use fear/kite/immobilized skills to gather while the mob is "distracted"...
---
But chests require you to not be in combat.  Nothing worse than fighting a mob right next to a chest and having some random walk up and take the chest. Even worse when you're in a party and all of you watch some random or other group stroll up.
---
So sensitive.
---
Hahah yes. I’ll do it. Give up my finance career and start a bank guild in azeroth. We will be the iron bank of azeroth.
---
As someone who played warrior main in Vanilla and now classic, if you plan to do mainly dungeons on your druid as tank, unless you are with a group of idiots, druid tanks are arguably far better dungeon tanks than warriors.
---
They have more aoe, larger health pools, and if you are good enough to use your utility spells at the right times far more utility than warriors.
---
As a raid tank bears...can...but there is really no reason to use a bear tank over a warrior since their gear just does not support tanking any hard content.
---
i havent had this issue but i do feel semi useless in group content as hunter best i can do for group is not pull stuff with my pet everything hunter does mages does better kinda sucks
---
It's just a lot of people are putting low bids to get their stuff even seen in the AH, couple I bid on, instant higher bid... Clicked a hundred times, instant higher bid. (again because of the flood of individual mats) - without a way to sort. 
---
Googled vendor price.. Bid that, no instant counter bid...
---
Realized its probably a bot so bid other stuff just couple copper below vendor, so it would bid those things above vendor... It did, suck it bot, because damn that experience.
---
It's not buying and selling that's a problem it's the scale of a few individuals that seem to ruin it for everyone... My trade chat is unbearable, lot of people rather vendor goods.
---
If there was a better way to sort AH, or just limit AH postings to just 100 at a time... None of this nonsense would be taking place.
---
not nearly as bad as the TBC standard "nagas belong in slave pens" or similar permutations
---
Okay, thank you
---
What realm are you on?
---
Engineering is expensive yes, but it gives you a trinket that gives your raid 5% attack speed buff. For raiding it's great. It's also great for PvP and lots of plain fun, giving you lots of trinkets and bombs to mess around with. 
---
But tailoring/enchanting is a good combo because you can use the crafts for tailoring for enchanting and enchanting can be used to make gold later on, and tailoring to make your own gear and ofcourse bags for gold too. 
---
Engineering doesn't really make you gold that easily. Only if you get some good recipes to drop and only from selling to other engineers.
---
I think you'll regret tailoring/enchanting less, especially on your first character. Maybe take engi on your second character when you have some gold, or on one that can farm gold easily solo (hunter, rogue or mage for example).
---
Think of the economy
---
The first one to press the roll button wins if it results in a tie
---
The whole time - as hunter I rarely see my sword. Always the quiever in hand.
---
In wow its that but also waiting for everyone to roll greed and rolling need or rolling need on gear you cant use/isnt an upgrade to your current gear
---
Stun them, attack once and vanish. Let the paranoia do the rest.
---
Yeah I am not debating whether it is possible.  I was just simply stating the idea is pretty cool.  I am certain there are 10,000 reasons why it would be impossible or unlikely.
---
Same here. It was a crazy experience and I was always so so happy when I got there. I'd go into the AH and look at all the cool stuff, look at all the higher level people wishing I could get there.
---
I never did get to 60 in vanilla. That's why I'm back.
---
Got it! Thanks!
---
My levelling experience is miss, miss, parry, hit, miss, miss, parry, parry and finally dodge but im dead before I can Overpower.
---
Which layer though?
---
The ideal situation in my mind is get the priest close to OOM and then unload using fear to bait the trinket and then  deathcoil and spell lock to try and keep him from healing. Unless you have fantastic gear and get amazing crits I view this as a battle of attrition
---
&gt; Some people here argued that layering wouldn't affect economy
---
Everyone said it would affect the economy

https://www.twitch.tv/videos/434435099 blacklisting discussion starts around 1:30:00 and lasts for about 20 mins
---
Basically Sodapoppin was thinking on how to have an authentic experience as a popular streamer when you'll deal with legit stream snipers whenever you're live. one of the things he came up with was a 'streamer server' (i.e. Faerlina) where stream sniping is very frowned upon and so anyone doing it would be blacklisted by their own faction to discourage that behaviour. this was the day after a player sniped a dueling tournament, sitting on totems etc. He also talks about the downsides of this idea around 1:42:00. I don't think streamers ever implemented anything like that.
---
I remember almost every quest in Morrowind. I remember a handful in Oblivion and none in Skyrim. Having you read a quest and identify landmarks described in the the text does wonders for immersion. I even enjoy the quests that have you run around in talking to people. Even something as simple as having an NPC buff you when you pick up their quest makes the world feel more alive.

---
Most of the tanks you encounter are either in Fury or Arms spec. No one levels in Prot spec. It does zero damage. When leveling any warrior has the ability to tank, it's just about whether they want to/feel comfortable with it.
---
It's their secret lovechild
---
Great Video Mate! I hope you get more sub's with content you are pumping out!

I was convinced it was a rocket-powered quarter staff haha
---
Do your self a favor and get a wand (Lesser Magic Wand) and upgrade it to Greater Magic Wand at 13, then level to 18-20 and do a few DM runs as a healer. This will give you a decent test of how it is like to heal in dungeons.
---
If you are sure you dont want to heal then by all means go for a Mage or maybe a Warlock.
---
The only thing that matter is what **YOU** want to play.
---
The best color too. Congrats bud!

Are those boxes worth farming? What do they usually contain?

It deserves every bad review. Cool idea that hasn't received a decor update or deep cleaning for decades. Worse selection of booze than TGIFridays.

I've only asked for layer hops twice, and it was for this exact reason. There are a handful of quests, mostly those that require 2 NPCs to interact, that can get bugged for a handful of reasons, but swapping layers seems to help
---
[I don't care.](https://youtu.be/PG-qCyYZRms)
---
&gt;All they had to do was create either a cooldown on hopping layer, or make layer hopping take longer time. That's it.
---
Agree 100%
---
If someone is telling you that you cannot dps as a priest in end game they’re mostly just referring to really high end 40 mans looking to push world 1st. If you’re just casually playing theres 0 wrong with it (watched a guild down rag last night with a shad in raid). Mage = spam frost bolt, wand til you have the mana to spam more frost bolts. If that fits your play style more than sure.
---
This might be a daft question but is there any really difference between Horde and Alliance? i know each race has their on racial abilities. But i guess what i mean is, it is relatively even split or do most people play alliance for example?
---
I'm a career Horde player who will never have anything but respect for the Dwarves and the great city of Ironforge. Truly the height of the Alliance experience.
---
Warlock summon &gt;&gt;&gt; mage water in wow classic considering no meeting stone summons.
---
I don't blame anyone for not wanting to tank. Its a thankless job and stressful asf.
---
yeah this is my concern... thalnos is fairly balanced but ive heard netherwind is 75% horde
---
I don't believe the gold claims. If you check the markets gold is selling for $6USD per g. That would mean none of these exploiters are selling their massive fortune in gold otherwise the price would be  much lower.
---
It sure does. For reference when you move the graphics slider down to 3 it says "Classic". It goes up to 10.
---
The zones pretty much all border the zone you should be questing in next.  Breadcrumb quests (i.e., quests that basically say "go here to this place in another zone and talk to this guy") lead you to where you should be questing next.  If you see quests, you are eligible to do them.
---
If you want to enhance the basic UI, download Questie.  It actually puts quests and levels on the map if you're eligible to get them and can still get xp from them.
---
It wasn't. Classic sped the levelling process up tenfold with the raid exp bug / exploit and then layer hopping so you aren't waiting for respawns. Aoe mages are saving literally 10 minutes a pull thanks to layers.
---
So you sayin' WW axe is a hunter weapon?
---
I'm level 27 and have been having this same debate in my head.  I really don't wanna jack up my respec cost so early on.  I think i'm staying single target for now since it seems like most areas I would farm (Hillsbrad), is pretty populated on Stalagg.
---
Is it required to be AoE spec (imp blizzard + no imp frostbolt), in order to efficiently find a good spellcleave group? If not then i think staying single target is the move for me.
---
You're gonna catch a lot of dolphins in that net, I feel like.

Pally engineers can MC enemy flag carriers in WSG and BoP them to make them drop the flag. That caused so much raging and server drama back on vanilla. GM straight up came out and said “oh well. Clever use of game mechanics”. Still have a screenshot of that convo lol.
---
Report these people it's the only way to.stop it.
---
Right now because the servers are so full, each realm is made up of multiple instances of the world. Their intent is to remove layering when content phase 2 comes out (several weeks?). They did this as they expected a large drop off of players after the first few weeks. If they just made too many realms just to handle the influx around the launch and then if this drop off happens, end up with hundreds of low population servers it would not be enjoyable.
---
When someone in a different layer invites you to a party, then you get swapped to their layer.

Majority of guilds are going to have a minimum of 5-10 warm bodies for raids, because the majority of guilds are going to end up with a decently hardcore core, and a bench full of people like me who might be able to make 1 raid a week and will perform our best, but won't have BiS gear or generally offer as valuable of a contribution as people who are more committed.
---
Manipulating the layering system to endlessly farm nodes is very obviously unintended behavior and a manipulation of server architecture for ingame benefit.
---
It's nakedly an exploit.
---
Lawl. Guy thinks 3 hours at a gym over a period of 9 days can be considered "going to the gym".
---
Like the guild that exploited the Saronite Bomb bug for world first Lich King, that was within the bounds of the infrastructure too, tell me how that went for them.
---
That's adorable! Mine will rub cheeks with my face, but when he really wants pets he will bite my mouse fingers softly until I pet him, it's really cute
---
No, I'm sure it was the right region. I tested it a couple of times by logging in through the launcher, logging out and then trying to log back in again. I wonder if it's because I've got 2 wow accounts registered to my blizz account? A starter edition account called Wow1 and my active account with my wow login username (the original one I set up over a decade ago).
---
I would argue, a high skilled druid in dungeon gear is better to have than any other classes with ditto skill and gear. Their survivability is not that much gear dependent, than the other healer classes.
---
The one I use is called "Vendor Price" I believe
---
The best way at least for me on my priest  is to sit on the boat and mind control people off as soon as the zone loads. Never fails to amuse me
---
The fuck am i reading? I think reddits broke.
---
Is that Valor shoulders on one of the warrios? Didnt think they were adding 0,5 Dungeon Sets until phase 5?
---
Phase 5: Ahn’Qiraj War Effort begins, Ahn’Qiraj raids open when the war effort dictates, Dungeon loot reconfiguration (Tier 0.5 Dungeon gear, Relics, drop rates and location changes)
---
That sounds awesome. Hope it'll be the same for EU coming up today.
---
I mean, just reverse the order of your sentence.
---
With the cost of crafting reduced, think of all the money you'll have left to repair and buy mounts!
---
Repairs are a fixed cost, essentially. You were going to buy them anyway. Saving money buying mats vs losing money selling mats is essentially a wash, depending on how you try to get money. If you get money from grinding mobs and vendoring greys it wont matter. 
---
If you get money from farming herbs every now and then, then yeah, you're fucked, which is another reason that we are 'really losing out on this,' as the guy questioned. 
---
If every single consumable is able to be easily farmed via layering, then yeah, it really is a silver platter situation, at least for the first phase. Every craftable will be very easy to make. You'll be able to stockpile arcanite bars and herbs for the future. and so on. massive influx of goods will drive down prices, period. There are other ways to make gold--unlike the real world, it doesn't have to come from other participants in the economy. It can come out of thin air. wow's money is always depreciating. So when the value of a gold is high, it means that the grind is easier. 
---
now I guess it could be argued that people would stop grinding for things once it became not very profitable to do so--why would you hop layers farming herbs if the herbs barely sell above vendor price? But if you're to that point, hasn't the economy already been ruined?
---
I clicked 3 links and still couldn't find picture proof
---
Thanks Mel!
---
If you're incapable of logical reasoning then sure, it was an answer. It's not like there is visual evidence of the description he gave is not working. Reddit brain peaking, I see.
---
Found myself a bow of searing arrows in badlands
---
Yes, there is satisfaction in killing people. That is why most people do it. You are in the minority on a pvp server if you do not like killing people.
---
Darnassus alliance capital lmao
---
There's an internal roll if that happens, iirc.
---
When I'll play, I'll be a rogue. Mostly as a bounty hunter vigilante.
---
I respect World pvp is expected, but there's a thin line between dynamic player driven action and outright bullying.
---
The biggest factor in low level dungeons for tanks is threat generation due to lack of rage, not survivability. Early prot tree does not have talents to help with rage management. You can easily argue the Arms is more beneficial to early tanks.
---
Remember ppl used them to test dps back in the day, before target dummies, work as intended ;D
---
I cant access their website, can you send me the files?
---
I am determined to get it done at 30 this weekend. My Priest buddy is game and we are going to give it our (his) all.
---
I will still do dungeons and probably get comparable loot after. But I want muh wirlwhind axe!
---
So you’re saying you’re being sensitive to racism.
---
Its not ElvUI, just a bunch of addons I've customized per specification - I'll see if I can put together a list soon.
---
Same for the Pally quest to get Verigan's Fist. I wasn't even that interested in using it because I am going 1H+Shield all the way for reasons (don't @ me). But you can't call yourself a Paladin and not get this weapon. It's like opening up a big old can of holy whoop ass every time you swing it.
---
God no, that’s definitely warlock.
---
If you don't play Classic on Classic settings, then you don't play Classic.
---
Fuck this makes me miss my undead mage from Vanilla.
---
It works, i use it for my mage aoe spells like Blizzard and Flamestrike that also require the same type placement.
---
Thanks! Will do.
---
I’m not cos I haven’t reached that level of sad.
---
but the AH is in SW as well?
---
All my friends rolled alliance and here I am playing on my shaman. Got a whisper from one of them last night asking if I was still being stubborn. Damn right, I'm having too much fun dropping totems to reroll.
---
You're welcome, citizen.
---
This only shows healing on me. It does not show numbers that I heal others for.
---
The Whirlwind Axe far more than an axe. It is a rite of passage through which all warriors must pass.
---
100% false.
---
Play a priest and renew your tank before the pull, you *will* get aggro from the adds.
---
I never played rogue but that sounds fun.
---
It took me just an evening and since I got it at 30 it’s really big. I’ll be good for many many levels. I won’t need to worry about weapon for a long time
---
Was this on Thunderfury by chance? My friends and I have called HBF a few nights in a row now...
---
when i check last night at ~6pm EST it was 7k 
---
so basically no change
---
4 Days 23 Hours
---
Well the only reason I can think of is that my bear pet deserves nothing but the finest cuisine:,)
---
My experience with alliance is they are all vindictive shits so far. I was doing a quest in Alterac and notice 2 mages a bit lower than me. I wave and go to pull a different mob to do my quest. Suddenly one polys my to charge a frost bolt. I get my pet on him (pet is 37 he is 31) and pet just tears him up. His friend also tries killing me but also dies pretty quick. I just wanted to quest, I was gonna leave you.guys be. 
---
Also if I'm just running down a road theres a 5050 shot that 2-4 ally will just show up to attempt to murder me lol.
---
Yeah and I'd agree with you until you said the word "threatens to run to wowhead."
---
Duh.
---
But seriously what really happened to #nochanges, the nostalgia, the authentic experience? He is clearly acting like he is 13 again. Just laugh and joke with him at that moment. Why be a jackass and be mean and also make a "humor" categorized reddit post?
---
Believe me that guy was just trying to have fun by playing the game and trying to communicate as he loved as in the back in the day. He is the true vanilla player and you guys are not. Go back to retail.

I believe they’ve said world bosses would not exist independently on different layers.
---
*Exploit early, Exploit often* is the motto for a reason. 
---
Just like the raid xp "bug" that was essentially an exploit, youre good to go until Blizz says otherwise.
---
Not true. Thats like saying a hack that exists that makes people level 60 in 3 days doesn't affect you. It certainly does. It's like saying a dupe that exists to make your one stack of thorium into 100 stacks does affect you. It does. Economies matter and layer abuse is busting the economy more than it needs to be. Playing the economy is integral to games like wow, and it represents a large part of the game. That part of the game is currently being abused and it's affecting other aspects of the game.
---
OKayokay I can see how you guys interpret it as to how interpreted it, clearing all the mobs to the quest might be an important part I missed. Turns out we're on the same side :P my bad
---
I'm on Skeram (full pop) and have never seen anything about layer hopping.

From what I can tell there is no built in floating numbers. As in I do not see green numbers floating over my friendly targets head.

I’d like to know too

Items with grey text you vendor. Items with white text (non-armor/weapons) are used in recipes. These are typically more valuable. Green weps/armor and up always put on AH, either someone will buy it to use or disenchant. This has been your finance crash course with a filthy casual.
---
Don't forget to press "Tab" on the keyboard to cycle enemies.. you don't need to click!
---
&gt; How about a game where both people playing for efficiency and people playing at their own pace can do dungeons together?
---
The only time i could see this happening is when the heavy raiders are having an extra member/ missing one last person, and they need a sub to/from the more casual group
---
Does it mean every single mob on azeroth have a chance to drop it? Also can high level gear world drops dropped by low level character?
---
Kingsblood? You mean vendor flowers?
---
You can and did talk smack on the realm forums.
---
"Did you even play vanilla?"

This is important.

oh well that settles it thanks for your help mlk 2 racism is over

I heard the one for classic is not working properly. Does it seem good to go?

Same. I'm good dying to the hordeapocalypse.

What does adds mean?

I'm on Incendius and I was thinking about it, but I'm really on the fence.

Apparently Thalnos players are also transferring to Netherwind just like Incendius, and if all the reddit posts are correct and the brazilian and portugeuse speaking community decide to move there as well, I really will have no desire to transfer there.

The Rake is where it’s at. I was mad when they patched all the pets to have the same attack speed when I had the Rake.

This is pretty weird for me as well... I remember it being Ironforge in Vanilla, but right now IF is empty and everyone is in SW.
---
I might be misremembering, but I think SW in Vanilla initially missed one of the important features... AH, Mailbox, Bank?
---
You’re right about fear to bait trinket to open up a window for death coil. Regarding the OOM win condition, it’s really difficult to outlast or out-sustain a priest in this matchup unless you’re in full T3 or insane PvP gear which isn’t available yet obviously. Warlock does have an advantage at that point due to their crazy scaling. 
---
if you land a spell lock when they’re around 50% HP, you’ll probably win because they have to exit shadowform or do nothing for far too long. 
---
It’s just funny reading the replies here. No one even mentioned shadow ward, spell stones, or any of the things that actually could potentially give an advantage against a priest. Just dot + fear + fel hunter is supposed to magically kill a thicc as fuck shadow priest or disc priest? Nah not likely
---
Really? I remember guild banks back in Vanilla, maybe just not released yet? I am pretty sure we had guild banks before TBC released.
---
She's going to need glasses from sitting so close to the screen.
---
imagine taking the time to say something this stupid
---
Wow. You are completely delusional. What's with you twisting everything I say into a narrative that fits your agenda? I'm not projecting anything onto you. I'm telling you how it is. Funny how you can't seem to actually be able to make a counter-argument without resorting to attacks. Seems to be the MO for all you SJW types.
---
You seem awfully desperate to paint me as some sort of basement-dwelling shut-in with no friends or loved ones. I can happily confirm that the exact opposite is true, not that you'd believe me; or that I'd give a fuck whether you did. It's quite cute though. If anything, you seem to be doing a lot of projecting here. The most I did was call you a pussy, and that seems to have gotten your panties in quite a twist.
---
Is your argument *that* badly dependant on all of us being inhumane monsters that you can't grasp the idea that it might simply not be true? We're all normal people, we're just mature enough to understand the concept of jokes, and to not take things too seriously. People chat shit, they always have and they always will. You're not accomplishing anything by making a fuss about it, all you're doing is drawing attention to yourself and inviting more people to talk shit.
---
***Nobody here is triggered but you.***
---
I too would like to know. I'm on kurinnaxx
---
Holy shit staysafe needs to be put in the bin
---
It’s so upsetting to see how SW is so friggin populated but IF is a barren wasteland.  Hopefully as the majority of people continue leveling they’ll migrate away from the reminder of retail and back to the true capital of the Alliance
---
Yeah I haven't seen any numbers on what the ratio is but I've had no problems finding groups for anything.
---
Queues are a thing. Staying logged in to avoid Queue is a thing too. No reason to log off while doing work on the other KVM Session.
---
Yeah I just noticed that. Transferring is out the window for me now.
---
i ran into a tailor who already has 250g

Within a level bracket, it has a slim chance to drop

In about a week chat will be spammed with "Lv60 Tauren Druid account for sale"

What's with some of these people?!
---
I rezzed a mage yesterday and then buffed him with fort.  He just ran off and didn't say anything.  I died a little.
---
Auctioneer does exactly this. It also allows you to setup 1 of 1 stacks on the AH which is why you see so much 1 stack of shit on the AH. It's super handy, and you're just doing yourself a disservice if you don't have it. Blizzard has barely touched the OG AH in the last 15 years so don't expect shit.
---
i ran into a tailor with 250g
---
For real though why does any Alliance go there? Every single person I've heard mention leveling there has said they just get attacked by Horde all the time. Of course any sane person would know that going in, and given all the other leveling options (zones, dungeons), why bother? Especially since we're spending most of our time on the other continent already? It's like they're going way out of their way just to slow themselves down and get ganked repeatedly.
---
Next video is my follow-up to this with Cooking and then AH content
---
Same. Not sure how long it took me but it was most of a day. I wasn't even that interested in using it because I am going 1H+Shield all the way for reasons (don't @ me). But you can't call yourself a Paladin and not get this weapon. It's like opening up a big old can of holy whoop ass every time you swing it, and it's a giant shiny lump of everything we stand for.
---
I did not know this...thanks for the tip!
---
THATS +1 FOR THE HORDE
---
People are comparing it to the popular pservers which were over tuned because they knew it was super easy.

Skeram why?

Pudge!

It's pretty fun building your pet. Like as long as they're in the same species you can teach them skills that you acquire from your other pets. I'm currently building a cat that has prowl (from alterac cougars), dash(from stranglethorn tigers), and claw

So did you think about the economy?

If you prefer melee start with a paladin so you can heal yourself. For a caster start with warlock so your void can tank for you

So satisfying post level 30, sweeping strikes, cleave and retaliation. My character doesn't stop jumping for 15 seconds straight while I mow down 5 mobs with potion and stoneform.

Oh I do enjoy killing people, but only when it's actually a challenge.

Whats the best server for playing horde PVE currently? I tried mirage raceway but horde pop seems a little lower than Alliance.

They added AHs to sw, if, uc and tb later in vanilla.
---
Level the warlock. Warlocks are superior. 
---
There. Done.
---
Do you seriously expect warriors, already the worst solo class, to spec prot for leveling?
---
you can set this up yourself, look at my edit on my original comment
---
Like a pawn shop. It may be worth 1 gold but I’m only going to give you 12 silver for it
---
As a hunter that does as much damage as mages (more single target less aoe of course, but dungeon total), doesn't need on spell gear or 2 handers, and gives away bandages to fellow warriors because i know not having healing sucks,
---
Fuck gatekeepers.
---
Lmao, so you’re saying changing some letters so the RACIST word is changed to a more funny light hearted sounding one- but we all know what you’re saying- completely removes the root of it? Pot-kettle asshole
---
IF becomes more convenient to travel between the continents. At lower levels (45 and under) most Alliance players can stick mostly to the Eastern Kingdoms, so SW is plenty convenient. Once you have to start factoring in regular trips over to Dustwallow Marsh for Onyxia, or the long questing in Tanaris/Ungoro/Silithus then being closer to Menethil Harbor makes more sense.
---
I wouldn't recommend using dual wield for leveling, for fun yes. Leveling as a warrior is tough as it is, doing it right now.
---
The amount you miss with dual wield isn't really worth it until you get some hit rating, id stick with a slow 2H for now
---
For your first character, i'd go with warlock. I both make him more menacing, but it also make the situation "turn out this maniac warlock living in the swamp is just a nut guy" even more silly.
---
&gt; I had a hunter need on cloth healing shoulders, a tank weapon, and rogue legs all in the same dungeon. 
---
Clearly the .001% of hunters here, represents all of them. If you apply this same logic to other classes, we should all just stay away from eachother. Let's all just solo everything and go back to Retail guys.
---
Meanwhile I’m only level 20
---
Follow the mushrooms.
---
You that broke? You can’t support the people who spent time putting it together? So you resort to stealing?
---
Join the club, I was "blacklisted" first 10mins on the game.
---
Anyone else having the opposite problem on incendous?
---
This is how I felt running through Barrens on one of my Warlock quests. All the Horde there are unflagged questing, until they see me. They flag and start attacking me only to get put into the ground. 
---
All the while I’m thinking, “YOU DID THIS TO YOURSELF!”
---
Same on eu. It starts around 2-3 pm
---
It's because it's what he would do, probably.  Liars expect others to lie.
---
Right now I'm a level 30 warrior tanking dungeons with a fury build. It works like a charm once you keybind your spells with macros (mouseover macros especially).
---
The real problem is that people seems to keep playing like in 2004... not focusing the same target... But it's a great way to improve my multi-targets aggro skills and to train with "chaotic pull" situations
---
What made mine standout as extra bothering lul
---
reminds me a lot of a game i played ages ago
---
Only advantage stormwind had after the linked AH was shorter distance from AH to mailbox. Lol.

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
---
For those asking for a list of addons, I'm not at my computer so I'll have to edit this later, but off the top of my head here are the addons I'm using:
---
MAIN UI STUFF:
---
* Titanpanel - the "info" bars at the top and bottom
---
* Shadowed Unit Frames - my bar is hidden but pops up when I target something/in combat/missing health mana, party frames are always-on if I'm in a group
---
* SexyMap - replacement minimap and can move/hide buttons
---
* Bartender4 - action bars (theres another 2 tiny sets of bars for utility/professions that show up when I mouse over them)
---
* TinyTooltip - tooltip replacement (prettier and adds more info)
---
EXTRA UTILITY:
---
* Auctioneer - auction tool plus lots of useful economy/profession stuff added to tooltips
---
* Buffwatch Classic - lets me monitor party buffs to keep Fort up
---
* Decursive - Dispel/Cure helper, shows if I'm in a party
---
* XToLevel - additional exp info at the bottom left in Titanbar, breaks it down by kills/quests/dungeons needed
---
* AtlasLoot - menu for showing possible drops for dungeons, but I mainly use it to remember the level ranges for each
---
* NeatPlates - custom nameplates with more control/info (show party buffs, enemy debuffs, etc)
---
* OmniCC - buff/cooldown timers
---
* RealMobHealth - shows enemy health (approximate, gets better as you kill more)
---
* Inventorian - bag addon, shows it all in one with highlighting etc.
---
* MonkeyQuest - Replacement quest tracker, looks much nicer, I have it on a keybind for when I need it.
---
That's all I can think of for the moment, I know I have a few more so I'll add those in later.
---
Because victory or death, that’s why
---
This was made by Chad Dwarf Gang.
---
I’m having a very hard time believing this at all. Seems totally made up. 25+ layers? That claim alone tells me this is probably bogus
---
But you should see their pubes
---
The layering and 10 man farm exploiting is really killing my nerd boner for classic. 
---
I always thought Vanilla was great because you earned things and it meant you did this hard stuff for it. This seems like retail where everything is just cheapened to the point of 'whocares'.
---
really? because i /ignore the proven ninjas and assholes to save myself the trouble down the line.
---
For real, this isn't the NBA or NFL. This is MC, almost every one of us will have front row access to  loot drama of some sort in our own guild within the next few months.
---
That's a nice suggestion for someone who's level 10. For someone who's already 30+, and all of their friends are 30+, re-rolling is pointless.
---
So when you walk in you generally do the ring around the top first. I go left at the fork and continue in a circle until I hit the boss, think she has 3 spawn points. After that you drop down to the lower level. I go left again (If you're looking at it with your back to the entrance tunnel). This takes you down the path to the boss that's by himself, think he's the one that drops leggings of the fang (sorry I forget their names). After you jump down from his platform you're back in the river/creek thing on the lower level so you back track and bit to the right path. This path is pretty straight forward and will eventually lead you to each other boss. There are some little shortcuts you can take, but for the most part you're on one path that will eventually hit all the bosses.
---
Right??
---
Does nobody think for themselves lol? I'd read that and nope right outta there and find something better.
---
I used to show everyone this movie. Was my all time favorite. It was so goofy but touched on a few of the things that WoW so magical. It also helped I coincidentally played on the server that Illegal Danish and Forbidden Donut were on. Felt a little starstruck  lol
---
When you say tankish, what do you mean? IIRC, you need Shield Block to avoid Crushing Blows, so you might get trucked by bosses.
---
Pretty much always doing something with the guild.
---
Dragon whelps in eastern Wetlands, mob levels 24-27.  Drops small flame sacs, important for consumables.
---
It's not dumping the market. People are broke right now and you're far better off making money on smaller prices. 
---
As people get more money the prices will go up when people start buying out and taking the risk of raising the prices but it's totally viable and reasonable to undercut someone's prices if it works.
---
Yes Undercity is horrible. However Im used to the clear city structure of sw, thats the only reason I dislike Org. But I can imagine that if I would get used to the verticality of Org, I would like it too ;)
---
fun part is. if you don´t read reddit you just play classic and enjoy it and never notice any issues at all.
---
Agree with you. Warlocks are one of the best class in classic because they are really unique, fleshed-out, with many unique mechanics and features outside battle (creating stones, summoning peoples, etc) while being efficient in every area of the game.
---
Also the 3 specs are viable and that's quite rare in classic.
---
I think we need to realize that the capital supply coming into the game is the same. Meaning there is only so much gold in the game so the price of these mats will be significantly lower than in vanilla or private servers because the capital in the economy is only so much. It will change the economy but completely “fuck” it up? I don’t know about that
---
I always do this. Everyone wins except the guy you're undercutting.
---
I use meters to make sure im keeping up
---
It is one way to close the gap between early and late quests of a certain area. Alternatively you could switch to a different zone to continue questing there and later return to the previous area once you caught up
---
mail all extra stuff to it, keep them at a city login auction the stuff then mail money back. can walk your level one to city easily

DPS warriors can tank, even if you're arms/fury. I've been tanking these low level dungeons with a 2 hander, only swap to sword and board on the tough pulls. Better than sitting around waiting.

This isn't really ingenious though. Literally thousands of people have been saying this would happen since layers were announced.

It sucks, but it was this or having MASSIVELY overpopulated starting zones and HUGE queues. That or having dozens of dead servers in a few weeks.
---
A lot of players have herbalts or material alts to store all sorts of good items.
---
I love how virtual Karens/Jerrys have no power in video games, you just laugh at them and there is nothing they can do to hurt you whilst they go on their spoiled adult tantrum. If only this happened in real life too they might learn a lesson to behave.
---
&gt; It was a pretty popular add-on back in Vanilla days
---
I still use it in Retail. Never stopped using it since Vanilla. It's just too useful!
---
Yeah was a lotta fun to share this with my pals when we played back then for sure
---
Thanks.
---
Seems less relaxing but more lucrative.
---
Stereotyping isn't normally based on 1 experience but many and it's often accurate even if some people don't fall into the stereotype.
---
Better not risk if with braindead rogues and hunters.
---
Then why is your thread title about bots?
---
Also, again, there are scans people can do with nearly every AH addon that will show items below vendor price.  These are very profitable to do right now.  
---
I'm not trying to beat you up over this.  I just want the correct causes blamed because whenever people mention bots, people get nutty.  
---
On a high pop server there are probably dozens of people sitting there playing the AH all day or doing it on a 2nd account.  Fresh economies are absurdly profitable in the right hands.
---
Odd, all of my friends and I do this. Might be a generational thing, or that we mostly work in IT. Don't know but we're in our 30's so pretty far removed from being kids. Most kids I know type extremely poorly.
---
The answer is always left.
---
What level fishing are you?
---
The best way to handle that situation is to party with your fellow ally players and tackle the zone as a team. Also the ratio will be skewed towards whichever faction has the closest major city, shimmering flats being next to both org and TB.
---
&gt; including exploits of any in-game bugs
---
Layering isn't a bug though.  You aren't exploiting a bug, you are exploiting the system how it's been designed.  Very similar and may come down to semantics.  But there's a case to be made.
---
Wow.  You seem pretty rational and friendly.  I bet you're super fun to play this GAME with.
---
Don't loot the corpses so they respawn slower.
---
I'm a Ret paladin and I kill things slow af. I make do, all you gotta do is pull things into a small corner. Somehow I feel like I'm an expert at avoiding aggro compared to many people.
---
Random question on your Overpower; Is it Weapon Damage or a Static Value?
---
You aren't allowed to not like jokes anymore. All jokes are sacrosanct and beyond disagreement.
---
Same...
---
Aggro ranges are a b\*\*\* in classic, especially in comparison of retail. Also the repop can be brutally fast sometime
---
I was in SM library as a rogue. Also had a mage and hunter as dps. Overall everyone was more or less equal in damage. 
---
Positive experience all around.
---

Warlock never has to stop and drink or eat. Unless they pulled 3 mobs and it was a really sketchy battle. Void just soaks all the damage. Throw up dots and wand a few times. Tap as you run to the next mob. Your hp can sit low because you're not taking damage really. If you ever get in trouble though, just healthstone, life drain, pet sac etc, you're fine.
---
Sorry unless you include a vitriolic declaration that you agree with the majority opinion, we assume you violently disagree with it.
---
just flip.. profit, stfu
---
how full is that diap
---
3 hour heroics killed cataclysm? In which dimension were you playing?
---
I'm with you, but there's a difference: hard R
---
Steam link is actually very helpful. Or any other game stream application
---
Nah you're right I agree that most pvp servers are 60/40 but I'm saying that I dont think that kind of difference is felt that much usually on full servers, we're talking tens of thousands of players
---
Doesn't seem unreasonable when the gold farmers pool their gold together.
---
&gt;  only like 10s each
---
weird flex but ok
---
I rolled a Dwarf as my first character. When I got to IF I expected the commons to be packed like I remember... they were barren :( So sad :( IF is the best city in the game fight me
---
Or they could just limit the amount of times you can jump layers per hour.
---
Are you using bartender? Same thing happened to me as well
---
You’re wrong and that’s okay.
---
Had an epic fight with some quilboars while in a group if 3 casters. Mobs running and aggroing more mobs, mobs patrolling into us, mobs spawning on top if us. Demons did die, and all mana and most health was lost, but we remained victorious. It was just as exhilarating as killing a raid boss imo
---
Most stuff asmon says is just memeing....twitch has developed a rich culture of memes and it can be hard to understand what's a meme and what isn't if you're not used to it. I won't go into details since that would take forever but the bottom line is if you don't like a content creator on twitch (or the internet in general) just avoid them and don't consume their content. It's actually that easy.
---
Not everyone is rushing, not everyone has time to farm 5hours a day and do a 7/7 raiding guild
---
Most people are still in their 20s and 30s and aren't even half way to 60 lol.
---
I believe it calculates the exact same way a white damage hit would calculate. So taking your AP into consideration, but I'm not 100% sure.
---
Woosh
---
Most people that started day one are like 40ish now.  The no lifers are high 50s with some 60s. Being behind is really not an issue right now.
---
Night elf are iirc 7 agility ahead of humans, but 7 agility deosn't mean much in endgame. The +5 on swords are much more valueable - it basically elevates you to level 61 when calculating attacks in endgame content (_vary_ basically, there is much more to it)
---
If you are into min/maxing, play human. If not, play whatever looks or feels best for you
---
Ahhhh, minor issues!
---
It's still so early in the scheme of things, don't stress over it. 60 is a commitment, it's more important that you enjoy what you're playing.
---
Aaahhh. Noted. Thanks!! I thought it was a static value like Hunters... this makes it so much better knowing this fact.
---
I mean, that's *your* opinion. A joke loses almost all it's effect of you have to explain it, imo.
---
How do we know you're not just a mere traitor? 
---
Jokes aside, I think it's not active yet.
---
Only the hardcore guild and people are rushing. Everyone else will take awhile to get to 60.
---
Is he waiting in queue?
---
I spent a half hour running through Dustswallow, naked and screaming, getting eaten by alligators just for my stupid first aid book. I think I hit 10 deaths before I hit Brackenwall. Good times
---
It’s fun at 60 when you get some real battles but leveling and being killed by someone 15 levels higher than you can get grating. All in all it’s really how the games meant to be played at the end of the day.
---
The beauty of this game is you can't be behind anyone. You can play at your own pace and catch up whenever you feel like it. You don't miss out on anything if you don't play for a week.
---
I for one have abused layering a lot and never noticed any cooldowns on it. But maybe it's better now. But yes I agree increase it every hop.
---
Because it was fast? Im actually now debating warlock or warrior for 3rd character haha
---
Ya I really wish data was available to groups like realmpop it would be nice to know at the minimum which realms have a large number of 60s and are at least semi balanced horde-ally. Especially once BGs are released.
---
Happy you found it! Endgame spec (for now) has some arcane talents in it - you still use frost spells, but arcane sadly isn't getting a big portion of WoW Classic.
---
Um hello alts?  You have only ONE Lv 60 with a mount?
---
Freaking casuals man....
---
I was just about to say this. 1.5 week in, only the most hardcore are already level 60 and raiding MC and Ony for gear. The mass majority of the playerbase still has a ways to go before reaching endgame.
---
Alliance are slightly better in pve due to paladin buffs and fear ward and horde have slightly better pvp racials
---
It will be months before the majority of raiders even enters MC. You've got plenty of time.
---
Then they need to lower the price and I will pay for it.
---
does this apply to warriors too cause they can use axes aswell
---
Don't feel pressured in keeping up to the status quo. I mean unless you're the very top 1% or better people will out gear you. By the 1% I mean the people that could dedicate huge hours to play and rush to the end.
---
Recreate, play, and enjoy. Honestly if you're constantly worried about being behind you won't enjoy the quests and the grind. Create your stories and your memories from however many ults you play. 
---
Good luck friend!
---
Along the same vein, I think the Deadpool movies have been great and worth seeing in theaters.  Most of the other super hero movies are pretty meh though.  Any good vs evil movie needs to have a good villian.  Almost none of the marvel movies do.  Deadpool doesn't either (better in 2nd one though), but the humor makes up for it.  Thor Ragnarok and the 1st Guardians of the Galaxy was the same deal, but I assumed it would be bad and watched it later, at home.  To stick with super heroes (though it works for pretty much any good vs evil story), the Christopher Nolan Batman movies have solid bad guys and that helps tremendously.  It's why they still are better than any of the marvel movies despite 20 or so shots at it.  Loki was a good villian, so the movies he's big in were pretty solid.  Generic blue alien #17 who is going to destroy the earth is not interesting at all, and the hero's journey isn't that exciting when the bad guy is not memorable.  Thanos is a pretty good bad guy, but with how the last Avenger's movie ended, it was pretty obvious they'd bring everyone back and while they didn't kill the super hero I'd been expecting to die for 2-3 movies, there wasn't really anything exciting in End Game, and nothing really unexpected happened.  I don't feel like I've gained much from watching it that I didn't already expect minus a swap of two hereos dying/not dying.
---
Perfect thank you, and definitely. I hear a sound so that helps, but it's not always easy to catch it. The duration is very short, so with a bunch of things going on it's hard to track.
---
Dont think so, but i dont think BGs are in the game yet, right?
---
Get an auction addon like Auctioneer or Auctionator and scan the auction house every day. This will establish a database of the market value (they also often show vendor value, or other addons will do that), so you'll know if you're better to sell on AH or vendor. Some times you might be better to save some mats for later, like if you intend to level a profession which has recipes requiring some specific mat you might not want to go out and farm again later on.
---
One "easy" way to do that is to use a bank alt and send them every white item you find, so you can take the time once a week (or so...) to sort everything out, instead of wasting time cleaning your bags/bank every day.
---
Also keep in mind that when selling on the AH, you have to pay the deposit price, which you'll lose if your item doesn't sell, so if your profit margin (taking the deposit into account) is too low and you risk losing your potential profit if you lose your deposit, vendoring might be the better option even if you could potentially make more off the AH.
---
Also keep in mind that right now, prices are rock bottom, because everyone is farming and leveling and need to get rid of a lot of items since bags/bank room is limited, some items will inevitably be worth much more later on, which is another good reason to use a bank alt to store some items for later, but it'd be complicated to give you a comprehensive list of what to save for later versus what you should sell now.
---
because its easy to call someone stupid.
---
in reality they are stupid for not thinking of the large amount of phone pics as a phenemenom, which it certainly is. I've never seen a sub filled with more phone pics of a game than this one.
---
Actually this makes more sense than what I was thinking. 
---
I was thinking that there’s possibly 10 decimals which are not shown (result rounded up), but this does not account for the extremely unlikely scenario that two people still roll the same number (all 12 digits).
---
&gt; So he's also making it harder for others to make gold too.
---
Just lvl alchi. With that amount of crystal on the market, people will starve for transmute.
---
why the fuck are you posting this? this screenshot literally screems private server. jesus christ people turn on your fucking brains
---
Well, I totally fell for that one.
---
I wouldn't worry about it man there are players who will go on to clear Naxx who haven't even rolled their characters yet.
---
you have plenty of time , but there will always be people with better gear then you. there will also always be people with worse gear then you.
---
Well, if the renew was applied before any combat and you enter combat with the mobs either by proximity, spell or anything, and the renew is still ticking, the ticks will indeed generate aggro at that moment.
---
Get the "ItemTooltipProfessionsIcons" add-on.
---
It adds icons to the tool tips of items so you can tell if its used for a profession or has a use in a quest (it won't tell you what recipes or quests its used for...just that the profession can use it).
---
At least this way you have a better idea of what's worth holding on to until you look it up in the ah
---
Holiday is my gamer handle in 99% of the games I play.
---
So I went with Holidae
---
None of the heroics in cataclysm took over an hour to complete. But more to the point, long or difficult heroics don't destroy the community. At best they highlight an already defunct community. This reactionary nerfing they did at the time was the worst they could do to the game in the long term.
---
The Hippogryphs in southwest Feralas near the "High Wilderness".  They are levels 43-46 so I usually go there at 42.  They drop very valuable vendor trash items(and often drop multiple at once) and you can skin them.  I average about 12-15g per hour grinding there.
---
I was really excited to see a green mace finally drop after way too long. And even better! It's called 'Priest's Mace' and I play priest! Perfect!
---
+1 Nature Damage....
---
I'd say a majority is still in their 20s and 30s. I was in Hillsbrad last night and it was super full of players and that was just my layer.
---
This is very accurate.
---
You can have a bunch of each faction in one zone, and for a while everyone will mind their own business cause they want to get the quests done.
---
But all it takes is one person to kill someone to set off a chain reaction.
---
It hasn't been too bad the past few days. Just Monday for some unusual reason. I logged in yesterday at 8pm and there was a ~500 person Queue. Tuesday around 6:30 it was around ~200. 
---
So far it seems to be a fluke, or I've been very lucky.
---
And here we go. You've lost the argument so you're backpedaling when you're the one who wrote an essay in the first place. Another typical MO of you SJW types.
---
You really like using that little buzzword of yours... "projecting". You're not even using it in the right context. Do you have any idea what the word even means? I don't see how I'm projecting anything onto you. *You* are the only one doing the projecting here. It's hysterical that you can't see how much of a complete hypocrite you are.
---
Stop trying to argue with me. You're a moron. We've already established that multiple times. You haven't made a single good argument to anything I've said, resorting to nothing but attacks and assumptions about me.
---
I'd say I'm gonna stop replying now, but it's funny seeing you regress from your self righteous mindset to using emojis as if that somehow makes you look any less pathetic. So keep it up buddy, you've already lost the argument. I'm just gonna enjoy the verbal diarrhea that you're inevitably gonna keep spewing.
---
Imagine needing 24 years to do anything with those crystals. Unless he can farm alchemist via layering there isn't much he can do. They'll be 20s in a month like they were in vanilla. 
---
Oh no now he can make 400 scarlet savant caps! Oh wait it's a BOP quest item!
---
If these were righteous orbs, we'd have a problem.
---
and make it impossible to group with your friends/pugs.
---
Let me guess, he didn't play like you wanted him to.
---
Ret prio on friends
---
Troll man good
---
Yeah, that's a problem with WoW in general. At the point when you can equip the gear or get the quests for a dungeon they are a bit trivial. That's what I originally found a bit off putting with WoW coming from games like EQ and FFXI. Try doing them a couple of levels below the recommended level for more fun.
---
The thing is that with good targeting freezing trap is nearly as good as sheep. That never happened to me in the original or classic only in private servers. It kind of makes me want to alt that class too while I was never tempted to do that back in the day.
---
&gt; Warned them months ago layering wouldnt alleviate queues too and i still get downvoted for it even though we currently have queues.
---
Maybe you get downvoted for it because you’re wrong, and being kind of a dick about it. Layering helps *massively* with the queue times. Just because we still have queues doesn’t mean they wouldn’t all be 10x longer without layers.
---
If it's green quality or better, bind on equip, and you don't need it, take it to the AH. 
---
Vendor anything grey quality (for the most part, there are some grey vanity items that some people like).
---
White quality is hit or miss. At lower levels white quality armor and weapons will still sell, but at higher levels it's unlikely.
---
I’m pretty sure it’s tradeskillmaster???
---
Audit the fed!
---
yes
---
Still waiting on that rollback for all the xp exploiters. And the cauldron exploiters. 
---
I can think of *ONE* time they handed out bans, and that was the XP pots on live.
---
I’m a 28 shaman right now. Not really enjoying it. Should I power through to at least get to windfury and other perks of being a shaman?
---
I always decline to inv randoms for gathering quests. I'd love to help, but it's going to take long enough as it is...
---
No, option D is a realistic take based on the average retail player who decided to try Classic. "You think you want it but you don't" was offensive because it was said to the people who clearly do want it. The sentiment still applies to large parts of the general population.
---
And if my guild is anything close to the norm, parts of those 'retail tourists' as I think they're known on this sub have already started moving back.
---
I’ve been a priest this go around, it’s been fun!
---
Because it's one of the big reasons people used to multi-box back when we had BoP trading and need/greed in the game at the same time.
---
Since it's not possible it means that multi-boxers are restricted to doing what anyone else could do - try and get a few extra greens by being a bit of a dick.
---
Use your bow pull far away use hamstring. Your shout and clap can save you food. Upgrade your weapon ASAP.
---
Never played Classic WOW and never played much of Retail WoW, but enjoying the game a lot right now.
---
I have two questions though, first of all is there any point to hold on to monster drop/materials? Things like Splintered Tusks and Ruined Pelts. Are these useful for crafting later on, or worth selling to vendors or should I simply discard them? The same goes for old equipment.
---
Next I was wondering what professions I should take as a Hunter? I imagine each one has its own pros and cons, but perhaps there are some professions that have good synergy with the Hunter class that would help me. 
---
Thanks in advance!
---
What the actual fuck? Does your SO also asks non-stop "are we there yet" as soon as you start the damn car?
---
if u say so
---
Remember someone kiting Jaina to meet Thrall.
---
The bonus applies only if you equip maces or swords. If you are usng an axe, you don't get anything.
---
r/twanks
---
I was probably one of those dudes chasing last night.
---
All my characters are some play on "Brak" being my screename.
---
My pride and joy was that my bank alt's guild was "Brakshire Hathaway"
---
I'm reading now that maybe the promised cooldown is broken/not implemented. hmmm
---
Huh, arent like holy palas considered one of the best healers in classic?
---
I get annoyed any time an AA doesn't land, it means I won't have rage to do *anything*
---
Yup. I transferred two last night perfectly fine.
---
no this is not how classic works. you will be able to connect to lategame at any point.
---
reason: itemlevel dosent exist.
---
in addition: i you run the CensusPlus addon on your server you will recignize, that the majoritiy of people are simply only level 30ish. The picture drawn by streamers is very decieving.
---
Your emotional reaction to it is missplaced. It is a given that there will be a population dropoff. That's how every mmo has been after a major release. 
---
Plus, if you spend some time here on reddit, you will see it happening in real time. People learning about Classic and how different it is. Some stick, some don't.
---
And to top it off, Blizz hobbled the whole thing themselves by severely lowballing the number of servers. I guarantee you that there is a number of people who dropped simply because they couldn't play with their friends.
---
Hmm okey thanks :) Yeah it feels like I dont have enough slows/cc at this lvl .
---
I dont wanna focus on pvp because most of the time someone charges on me and im not able to get away with only Wingclip .
---
They dont have liquidity. They have items that are presumably worth that much based on old market data from older servers.
---
Most of the value is predicated on blizzard removing layering before the majority of the playerbase is able to farm via the same methods.
---
Removal of layering increases scarcity which is prime to trickle some of your stockpile into the market over time to make a fortune.
---
Most servers dont have enough liquid gold to even buy what these mats are worth based on previous prices - it's all projected value.
---
Go look up a spells coefficient or look up the math to figure it out yourself. Each spell behaves slightly different:
---
Shadow bolt (ranks that are 3s casts) will profit from 85.7% of the shadow spell damage you have.
---
Drain life will profit from 50% of your shadow spell damage over it's full duration, so each tick will profit from 10%.
---
Corruption and Curse of Agony will profit from 100% of your shadow spell damage, except for corruption rank 1, because it is only 12s.
---
You only profit slightly from intellect in that you have to life tap less often and gain a small amount of crit (60.2 intellect per 1% of crit @ 60). According to my math a single point of spell damage / shadow spell damage is roughly equivalent to 3 points of intellect, so to replace a piece with 10 spell damage you would need over 30 int on a piece.
---
Just got 30
---
...soon...
---
Meh. Eventually some other group of people would get upset over prices and forn their own guild. Competition ensues, prices drop, yay
---
But will they?
---
BGs aren't getting out until Phase 3 or 4, you have lots of time to catch up. Obviously, people who are far ahead already will remain far ahead no matter what (ie.: people who already cleared MC...), but depending on how much you play, you can still easily catch up with the herd.
---
Bis is nat pagles boots from the stv fishing quest, but they require a rare fish to be caught. I think these are up there, though.
---
Imagine each 'server' being serveral servers called layers. It's a dynamic split and merge as demand on that server increases and decreases. It's dealing with the mass influx of people sort of like how sharding does in retail. They're a bit more static with different filtering mechanisms compared to sharding though(layering deals with a LOOOOOOT less players since it's a single server vs a battelgroup), but similar idea. The idea is to have a group of layers in the servers available and when the population levels off they can do a final merge at phase 2 to have a single well populated server instead of a lot of low pop ones.
---
The waiting allows me to attend to my RL responsibilities. Cooking, laundry, etc.
---
That is a truly a way of a warrior only warrior can endure
---
As a tank, I like to cherry pick a cloth group so I get all the drops!
---
&gt; bad for the economy 
---
Not really. It's just bad for people farming crystal. The economy will be fine.
---
I did RFC yesterday and the run netted me nearly 50 silver, so till I start getting more expensive drops i will be running some dungeons for the gold. Plus i might be lucky and get a boe blue to sell later on.
---
I have no issues for leveling etc
---
It will only because people getting to 60 who want to PVP will have no outlet except ganking because DHK are not in the game yet
---
&gt;I've played a lot of MMOs that have had amazing reception for weeks or a few months before slowly dying off.
---
Did you ever play SW:TOR? The drop off was fucking MASSIVE after about a month. Went from having login queues to being on a dead server in a span of 2-3 weeks.
---
Exp wasn't nerfed when you were in a raid basically, so people just spammed 10 man aoe dungeon groups for hours getting 3-4x more exp than they should have been.
---
The math was worked out somewhere, basically something in the code made it so the +140% exp you get for being in a 5 man group stays at +140% when you enter a raid instead of switching to the raid multipliers which were negative.
---
Always loved how vast and grand Ironforge is. It feels like a Undercity/Orgimmar sometimes to me. 
---
I hope they bring back Christmas decorations in cities. That'll definitely help convince me to play in December.
---
The top of the Bell Curve right now is around 15. Don't get caught in the Reddit echo chamber.
---
Oily blackmouth are used for potions. Deviate fish are used for deviate delites which are always in demand. There are other higher end fish that you'll be able to sell for consumables later in game.
---
My guild was the same way. Half said they wanted to xfer instantly. Othe half said they wanted to wait til later(p2 start maybe).
---
We xfered instantly it felt really weird not having a 60 on the server and being the only one in upper level zones.  From /who 40-50 last night there were only 30ish in that range.
---
How do you hide guild name? The one that appear under players names: &lt;GuildName&gt;  
---
/script SetCVar(\*UnitNamePlayerGuild\*, 0)  did not work
---
Same on Ashbringer. Or, it was the same. Now I'm at character screen and if I try to "Enter World" it says "World server is down."
---
No news on the realm status page, though.
---
yep it is located at 47,29 (if you have co-ordinates) . There is a pretty good list [here](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Memorials). This will form my tour list once I get going.
---
Bro I’m level 15 .. on two characters .. dont let these people discourage you.. they are hardcore and have a group that’s working together not to mention they probably haven’t slept much
---
Can you provide more info about the Satyr farm?
---
horde and alliance are different.  13-14 for horde to do ragefire chasm.  17-18 for alliance to do deadmines.
---
wowhead has a good guide that includes level ranges for each dungeon
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/dungeon-quests-classic-wow
---
It's things like this and guild banks that I don't see why they couldn't have been updated... I'd love to hear an argument against this
---
Well RIP I missed out on that
---
At level 28, i get even or better stats with quest 1h weapons than 2h ones. Also, it's more flexible since you can swap one average piece for a good one and still feel great about it, while you could sit on your 2h for a long time and it can feel subpar
---
And yet the #7 most upvoted and perhaps discussed all time on this sub 
---
But yes not really important like anything else in here.
---
Yep. You need to price it at a point that will actually sell.
---
So u meant im in for a rough time because of gankers?
---
I've been saying this to people just to lighten up chat in between arguments of whether or not its called VC or DM and someone usually responds with a not as fun "why doesn't my character learn how to get a cleaner kill then"

"The Cashbringer"
---
It's getting a lot better.  I play on Whitemane, get home from work around 4PM.  Last Thursday and Friday I was having to remote in around 1:30-1:45PM to be ready to play around 5PM.  Yesterday I remoted in at 2:45PM and when I got home at 3:45 I was at the character selection.
---
Wait, free transfers are a thing now?
---
Hey that is pretty cool, I thought I was below casual.
---
There already is a cooldown. But if you make it too large it will effect people who aren't abusing the system.
---
This is a lazy approach, they could've done a million things to soften the issues layering causes.  
---
  Make this layering exploiting punishable.  
---
  Limit the amounts of layers you can move in during an x amount of time.  
---
  Dynamic spawns depending on people coming in.  
---
  etc.   
---
   There's just NOTHING to prevent people from abusing the shit out of the system.
---
1. For high end enchanting, not sure, but having Engineering without mining means it is super expensive. Say goodbye to your mount at 40 if you level Engineering.

2. Both tailoring and Enchanting don't have easily comboed professions (herb+alch, mining + blacksmithing, mining + engineering, skinning + leatherworking), they are one offs; because of that they combo together. Plus, any extra cloth you get can be turned into a green easily, then disenchanted for mats for enchanting. In addition, it feels nice to be able to make any gear for yourself
---
yeah i'm just trying to figure out all my keybinds as i have for holy and for shadow it seems to get overwhelming going back and forth between the 2 for instances and solo grinding, and i want my main hotkeys to be the ones i use most often for the situation. 
---
Currently i just have 2 bars that i swap back and forth between as i need them.
---
Cheer up I’ve had my hearth set to IF ever since I made the Menethil run at level 7
---
Can't talk cross faction.
---
Yeah cause he should totally be concerned about criticism from someone with a reference to white identity in his username. 
---
GTFO
---
This is amazing! Very well done. FOR THE HORDE :)
---
Im not salty at all, its just an observation.  I didnt say the ecomony would be fucked, i said it would be changed (likely in a negative way).  Obviously the original game wasnt designed for layers.  Im sure the designers wouldnt want a single person would farm 50 arcanite reapers worth of crystals in a day or two.  I also dont believe the present designers anticipated layers to be exploited as they have been.  If you dont care, thats fine.  But it is wierd you seem to aggressively defensive of obvious unintended exploits that dont really help the actual game in any way.
---
The person who sees your auction may not know that you're actually making any sales. Theyre not being stupid. They are being competitive.
---
lmao while you miss the guy im replying to doing the same thing. why do you think i responded in the same tone as him, genius?
---
how does it feel writing all that and just coming off even dumber than the guy you're clumsily trying to defend?
---
i littealy seen it last no    so the game mechanics definitely allow it.
---
COME BACK SO I CAN /PAT YOU!
---
You can now get a life. Yes :)
---
Shiit I am on Gandling too..guess we won't be playing tonight xD.
---
For specific realms, yes. I was on Skeram.
---
I've got a lvl 19, 17, 15 and 9. I have a problem :(
---
You do have a point!
---
That’s unfortunate. Hope they have reconsidered in the last 100 days since obviously turnout is way higher than what they projected
---
Do you have a part list?
---
He replied to another comment to say he sold Runecloth Bags for 10g each. So I imagine he AoE farmed humanoid mobs for Runecloth.
---
I like to follow them around and use Distract at random intervals, make them think they're insane.
---
So far, I have done 2 x RFC and 2 x WC runs (both times over leveled - planned that way) as DPS.  I had a different group for each run.  Each tank lost aggro in every multi mob pull.  We had shamans with rock biter.  We had rogues who didn't know what focus fire meant.  We had warlocks dropping fear bombs into mobs.
---
I cannot speak to the level of skill of the tank as I can speak for my own level of skill.  But I can say without a doubt, that if I was supposed to have been the tank, I would have lost my shit as these idiots were screaming at him.  I sent each tank a pm letting them know I understood the issues at hand.
---
The worst part is, the idiot players - who were not the tank - were the ones whining and insulting.  I finally broke down and asked the rogue to start following an "order of operations" to attack the 1) non elite add (enemy void walker in WC), then the 2) elite caster, followed by 3) the elite melee.  But I was shouted at saying I was "a shit DPS nub" blah blah.
---
Whatever.  I look forward to 30+ when I start tanking and don't have to deal with asshats.
---
To be fair he wasn't wrong at the time going off the knowledge we currently had.
---
It's not like he made a prediction that ended being totally false, it was more like an analysis with the facts currently available at the time.
---
Yeeeeaaarrrrgh!!!!
---
catseption
---
hope they abolish this accident
---
Ugh fuck Ashenvale for those escort quests.... Always get ganked before completing that druid escort.
---
Because the amount of players on it is so low. A good economy is not a few well established toons. It's a range of toons around all levels.  There are less than 2-3 postings currently per any one thing.
---
you fell for the dead realm meme trap
---
imagine transfering from the OG servers 😂😂
---
I kinda like this. Have had a few experiences trying to fight other groups for a named kill. Sure it was a bit hostile, but we all eventually got the boss and carried on
---
We did this back in the day! Or something similar at least, every guild had its own "Hanging out spot" ours was near the wagon next to the AH. Everyone lined up in a neat way and random people would come and check out the guilds.
---
I met a multiboxer yesterday who had all his followers named after different Native American tribes: Apache, Cheyenne, Cherokee, Comanche, etc.  I thought it was a pretty dope naming convention.
---
Same here, currently working on my 4th main...
---
Everything is super fun in PvP (retriPaly can be very strong), but lots of classes are going to stay questionably viable in top-tier PvE. Thankfully 90% of us will never have to worry about that since most vanilla raids can be done with like 30% of the group still leveling/gearing-up.
---
#enlightenedcentrism
---
I challenge you to prove that.
---
You can pretty much do either. I would recommend ashenvale finishing off with BFD then heading to Hillsbrad. That's what I did. Maybe work in SFK at some point.
---
Default
---
Why not both?
---
If you are on Blaumeux we can RP walk together.
---
I did too. Good stream :)
---
Just so you know: The picture of the bank that's full with arcane crystal is from a private server.
---
If you stand inside the bank in classic you only see the bank room on your minimap. Since you see the outside of orgrimmar it's not a picture taken in classic wow.
---
\*Uses revenge\*
---
DODGE
---
You’re in the right.
---
Buy mine and just resell it for a turn around is the perfect response.
---
With an addon, just search twitch for it. There was one showing more stats on your character panel.
---
Somebody just found a new desk top background.
---
Hey, I do what I can! When I play a game, I expect it to be enjoyable. As soon as I stop having fun, then its just a chore.   
---
I also have a friendly little macro that I post once a group is formed informing everyone to check their gear degradation, ammo/food/water, and a friendly reminder of what the marks I place above the enemies head are supposed to mean :P  
---
For the sake of readability, I keep the caps lock off for that portion..
---
Armor is a stat!
---
I'm assuming you are not from my server, but I am still offended that I am not on that list.
---
Reduced queues on servers are because they opened up new servers and increased server capacity to reduce queues. Nobody left yet lol. New people are flooding in daily
---
There isn't enough "surplus money" to support a supply manipulated economy. Prices are low because no one can afford anything.
---
Put it this way, I have a 100% economic advantage if I farm during off-peak hours. I can easily see node routes, see who is farming, jump zones if the competition is high and I can buy low from people during the day and sell high during prime time.
---
I have a completely random chance that layering will do anything and it requires massive coordination over me running a route that I've marked on my map to track node respawns and because of layer hoping I don't know what the new competition is.
---
Except there is an unlimited supply, since they always respawn. So no matter how much you farm you can never have "all the supply".
---
Elvui then get (or make) a minimalistic set up
---
Without knowing the numbers of how the volume of player increase because they exist or not. I am of the belief there is not an equal relationship between number of players being allowed online vs the number of nodes available. That also doesnt take into account the limited pool of people who even have access to the nodes. 
---
There also is a 100% advantage to hopping because there are addons (which arent even necassary) to force the layer change easily and conformable. 
---
You are also discounting people who are 60 early, have professions up (or can aoe farm) have a time limited advantage, also putting them way ahead of the curve. Someone could easily farm a ton using layers, stockpile, and sell once layers are removed.
---
Did you need food or were bandages enough? Any tips you could give? I’ve got full armory gear and ravager
---
I actually feel a little bit shitty because I'm a shaman, and don't have any buffs to give. So I go around Flame Shocking mobs after they are aggroed, or stop and heal someone. It's not much, but it's something.
---
That's a bear thing, the Darkshore ones sticks a 30min disease that weakens your physical attacks by a lot (dont remember how though). Dont fight bears as melee I guess.
---
Warriors need rage to cast their abilities - meaning 1s after you pull 3 mobs the tank will have aggro on 1-2 targets, max. 
---
Ease off on the aoe right away! Only thing you can do.
---
I agree. I'm Alliance on a Horde dominated server. I hope at least I can get quick BG queues.
---
You dont need a special talent spec to tank.
---
I can hear the dodge noise in this post
---
Right, thats what i'm saying. not sure how this would aid RP.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHHAA
---
Frost shock
---
If you're cutting edge (40+), most people you meet will probably have some grasp of the game. The lower level under that you get the less skilled the average player will be.
---
Sometimes that happens, sure, but more often than not I find multiple people purchasing individual bags than individual people buying multiple bags.
---
Very real. Yesterday a hunter swooped the Ravager axe from under my nose. I don't like hunters anymore.
---
&gt;Extra reach
---
They have extra reach? What the hell.
---
I personally have a stance switching macro so I've got no need, it's super infrequent I'll forget I'm in defensive stance.
---
The common sense I'm talking about is the basic workings of layering, not a screenshot with zero proof. The screenshot is irrelevant, why are you so focused on that? **Nobody that is exploiting like this is taking screenshots to publicly condemn themselves.** 
---
The problem is that this is completely possible, and you can easily test it yourself by mining a copper ore node in a starter zone at level 1 and getting invited by someone in another layer. If you can't put 2 and 2 together, then you have no business talking about the subject.
---
grobbulous, which is one of the more populated but not overflowing servers. did you not get the free migration offer for you server?
---
kek
---
There are screenshots of people with hundreds of lotus and arcane crystals. That did not happen when I played the game in vanilla. There simply were not that many nodes that existed. Yes, a single group of players absolutely can manipulate them. You keep saying the availability of gold matters but it does not, because there is a time coming with more gold and no layers. They will have a stockpile of mats farmed using methods that simply do not exist anymore giving them a massive advantage simply because they played while it still existed.
---
Thanks for the tip, they do in fact have the higher level Throwing weapons available. Huzzah!
---
now if ya'll can stop spamming LFG chan with your twitch, that would be great
---
Why would anybody post it already now on AH?
---
Respeccing is nonsensically expensive. It caps out at 50g and decays over days/weeks. Respeccing often will not be possible.
---
if you want the on one button you should just do 
---
but you will still have to be in each stance. its whatever your preference is
---
I hope by some ironic turn of fate that so many people transfer off of Shazzrah that it ends up being the dead realm in the end.
---
Just to see the faces of all the people who refused to leave a 15k+ queue realm because they were scared that a 5k+ queue realm would be dead in a month.
---
I have had way more fun grouping with people in the zones I am in, than playing solo, so if it is less efficient, I don’t care. :-)
---
It’s fun, so it feels faster to me in a group, especially because you die much less.
---
completely agree. /r/wow is just full of bullshit these days. just downvote and keep fighting the good fight brother!
---
We r/wow now bois.
---
I love hearing about new player stories and how they’re exploring the world and areas they shouldn’t be in yet. I had too much game knowledge of the starting zones to get lost, but just this morning I went to the badlands for a quest and got utterly lost in the world’s most hostile wolf pack. I haven’t leveled past 30 since 2006, so it’s all new to me again. 
---
The world is so massive. Enjoy your time with this game!
---
On biggles, never see it in gen chat, lfg, or trade chats. And hardly ever in my guild, only if they've been camped by an ally for awhile.
---
You realize that all of the guilds that cleared Rag in the first week did this and have this mentality right? The best players do this, and they're leading the charge that you're behind. They're not going to quit.
---
Please go back to /r/wow
---
I see your point, however the complexities of what your are describing (leashing to the party leader maybe?) in what is done on the “global” scale is impossible by proximity means alone. I don’t know your development background and I myself am not a well versed developer but I do under stand that just to make layering in its current state work was no easy task. I think we just wait for phase two.
---
I leveled through Mulgore on the most populated server and the entire time the general chat was almost completely dead. :(
---
That’s really awesome if that is the case with new people actually enjoying classic.
---
The lucrative fish is the winter fish. The summer one isn't very useful. IIRC
---
23rd of September I think is the date. To actually answer the question. Doesn't switch back to summer till.. like March.
---
So far so good, the only thing is somehow making it also work with left click, then it would be a dream. 
---
You mentioned a shift mod being possible, could you also add that in case I or others would like to try it?
---
Boy sure sucks the greater community didn't see this one coming then get bitched out by major "influencers" and their cronies that it wouldn't be a thing.
---
You are forced to run into other faction players ALL the time in the world while questing. If you are leveling on a PvP server you will get ganked dozens and dozens of times. This fuels hatred for them. On top of that you are on one server only so people get reputations and the same fuckers that killed you while leveling will still be there 2 years from now.
---
Classic satisfies the Horde vs. Ally war better than any expansion bar none. Actual raids on Orgrimmar and Stormwind are a thing. World PvP is going to have a renaissance with Classic.
---
Queing up instanced BGs or Arenas vs. the opposing faction with randoms from other servers does nothing to stimulate hatred.
---
I haven't been brave enough to join it. But also since its a player made channel, if you stay active in it long enough you can become the mod of it and ban the gold sellers from jt. Thatd be a funny troll.
---
I said that already...
---
Yeah. Honestly just having that much of something this quickly would probably be a ban hammer from bliz. It's obvious something was done, and they are pretty liberal with the hammer sometimes.
---
 I have to imagine a ban on classic would be a ban on retail.
---
Where do they say half a year for phase 2? 
---
Phase 1 (Classic Launch): Molten Core, Onyxia, Maraudon
---
Phase 2: Dire Maul, Azuregos, Kazzak
---
Phase 3: Blackwing Lair, Darkmoon Faire, Darkmoon deck drops begin
---
Phase 4: Zul'Gurub, Green Dragons
---
Phase 6: Naxxramas, Scourge Invasion
---
Six phases to fit into two years, and the 2nd phase has no raid involved besides two world bosses &amp; four new 5-man instances. I don't see them taking half a year to release this. I would expect a december/january P2 release.
---
... you've never had to play the AH before have you? Lol. He either sits on all that shit forever and sells it in incredibly small amounts and hopes no one else ever sells any of it, or he has to post a lot of it and constantly undercut the competition and it deflates to 0 lol
---
I’m leveling full on enhance, bout to get winding and I can’t contain my excitement
---
No point in complaining on Reddit, just switch servers
---
Correct, you would weigh your fun had playing ret against your angst of being dead weight.
---
Because there is only one mob and it cant trigger dynamic respawn because it works on people in zone + mob packs killed iirc
---
There is also the SM quest reward from In the Name of the Light "Bonebreaker" which is guaranteed, has 39 dps and +20STR. Its better than all of these weapons.
---
This would only work if it is about getting large amounts cheaper.
---
Yeah that was my bad. It's been waaaaaay too long that I remembered things wrong. :-(
---
I LOLd IRL at work.
---
Also, as a mage, I approve Abe as the mage in this.
---
usually a random mash of leather/cloth trade goods, one green, and some greys.
---
I sprint for any wreckage to fish in because it's worth it.
---
People here are posting their Epic mounts, level 60s are streaming with 500+ gold in their bags, and you come to that conclusion? lol good job Sherlock
---
The 3200 crystals screenshot is from private servers. 
---
The fix is super easy: Layering in starting zones only. Done. Fixes the issue layering is for without letting it affect anything of value. Oh no, the market will flood with tin!
---
So first it was 70%, not 90%. Kinda a big change don't you think?
---
Second, that's retail, not classic. This might as well be an entirely different game with a different target market.
---
Hmm, that also makes sense. Hopefully, it works out that way.
---
2 to 3 respec’s in a week you’ll end up paying the max 50g respec fee on week two for each respec.  So if you’re ok with farming at least 150g a week for that expense, it’s worth playing one character.
---
Oh grow up. People can play what they want and you have no right to tell them otherwise.
---
If you keep a DoT constantly applied to it the mob won’t leash.
---
I see, thank you so much! That really helps sort things out^^. Thanks once again.
---
Will it be welcomed in raids though?
---
the spawn rates are boosted if the monsters are killed fast.
---
As a solo player, being in a area which was previously visited by a 5-man group quickly end in madness
---
How dare people disavow racism?! Fuck off back to your basement. Wait, you’re already there.
---
You're wrong, they're the same.
---
Hash the data before transmitting, problem solved.
---
Which hat is that? I'd love one of those for my lock!
---
I don't think he has ever been in a spell cleave group or even plays as tank. There is absolutely no possible way anyone can keep aggro. I play prot warrior since vanilla and I'm fairly certain I know how to tank and how much threat each of my ability generates. Even if you get the rage to spam demo shout, cleave, some sunder armors etc. it's not enough to keep any aggro from spell cleave groups. Let alone most of the time you simply don't have any rage to spend, since no mob is attacking you and spotting and hitting 1 mob you will lose instantly aggro again against aoe spells.
---
ofc man, adding it to the post
---
As long as you hit a mob every once in a while it will keep following you. All you need besides that is to not get killed, probably by outrunning it. Hunter and druid come to mind
---
grats on your epic mount!
---
Have your friends invite you to groups. Do it with a bunch of friends. Make notes of a few afk names around you. How many layers do you find?Plus, kinda just logic. /who says there are 24 horde in Sunrock Retreat and I can see 16. Are there really 25 layers and 16 of us are all on one?
---
Queues. if there are 25 layers of 3,000 players each, that would mean server capacity is 75,000. You really think a 7,000 queue takes 4 hours to get through with 75,000 spots on the server?
---
Server restarts. Admittedly this one is a rumor, but RUMOR has it that the number of \[SERVER SHUTDOWN: 15:00\] is one per layer. Mornings on Kirintos have been low pop and we've had 2 messages.
---
You aren't a very skeptical penguin at all!
---
&gt; ...even though I have the cred for it
---
The toppiest of top kek!

So much hostility. I flaired it as Humor on purpose. Not complaining. Just thought folks would get a kick out of that que time. Sorry I upset so many people. Lighten up everyone! I feel like this turned in to Barrens chat!
---
I don't think you understand....yes, it is working as intended. Yes, they are going to keep it the way it is for now. No, blizzard does not look at these posts.  Layering is fine the way it is so you aren't switching layers every single time you go near a party member otherwise people would be switching layers CONSTANTLY which would cause more lag server side because you and 5000+ other people are switching layers at the same time.

Had an ex gf once (back in the mid 00's) who after I broke up with her, immediately posted my phone number on craigslist in the "NSA hookups portion" with some random porn star photos saying "let's fuck - send dick pics to ######".  Let's just say........ I started off confused as to why I got 2 random texts saying "hey".... and then a few random dick pics later I shut the phone off.  The next morning, changing my phone number at the verizon store......... that poor girl couldn't go into the phone settings to do anything without being stopped by another dick pic.  At the end of it all....... about 3200 dick pics were sent to my phone.... and that verizon girl must have thought I was the worlds biggest homo.
---
It's incredible how many people I see in city chat looking for RFC groups
---
I guess I just don't know why there are so many dickheads on Horde, having played Horde on PvP on retail, and Alliance now on Classic. Never had this much of a problem with entire groups ganking individuals 4-5 lower levels, every second person you see attacking you, etc. It's weird. At least in retail they actually gain honor but in Classic there's zero reward - it's literally just an antisocial behaviour.
---
Worth.... one quarter portion
---
Personally, I watch the queues all day so I've gotten pretty good at roughly guestimating how long it'll take when I pop in and out of queue. I do everything I can to make sure that as I mentioned, it's about 10-15 minutes *after* I get home that I actually get in. But if I mistime it and get in before I get home, looks like I have the standard ~15min afk that anyone else gets when they take a bathroom break before the game dc's me. 
---
But again, I'd wager its not the people remoting into the queue that is the issue, its the people using scripts and macro keys to be afk in the inns without actually getting flagged afk that are causing the problems. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy of they do this to avoid the queues and the queues exist because half the server is doing this. If there was a way they could better crackdown on scripts and macros to avoid afk, the queue would be gone in a day. I believe they're working on it, but its tough since many keyboards have keys that generate regularly repeated keystrokes that to the computer and the servers look exactly the same as standard input.
---
Did you change the render scale to 1080p?
---
Lv 40 to 60 PLUS the 1k gold needed is a LONG road…… While yes skipping the level 40 mount does indeed save you money in the long run; the amount of time saved from 40 to 1k gold more than makes up for buying the level 40 mount.
---
Are people using layers to collect more mats? Yes
---
Do they have a stockpile as large as what the image shows? Hell no.
---
And its going to take actual proof to show that anyone has a stash this large. Covering up your name in a picture will not stop blizzard from finding this people instantly. It isnt hard.
---
I made no comment on whether or not what they are doing is right or exploiting.
---
&gt; We expect these free character moves to remain open for the realms above through this coming weekend.

---
Layering is still an absolutely massive change to classic whether or not this is true. 
---
 Just gotta look at the constant spam for a different layer to see it. May as well rebalance the classes at this point.
---
Why don’t they apply the same “too many instances entered” with layering? It’ll limit the exploits.
---
Its charms for the whirlwind axe quest. The prices are really wacky and sometimes way overpriced if there arent any other sellers. its the same on my server, 25-50s normally and 1g if no one is selling
---
I doubt OP is wildly undercutting it. He probably listed it at the normal selling price and this guy is mad he cant keep monopolizing it at the unusually high price
---
I expected us to slap our shield together, not to punch each other's shield... But if that's what you want me to tank, I guess I'm game!
---
It was the only auction house
---
Go to interface options &gt; social &gt; block channel invites. It's the 6th one down.
---
I will mind my own business unless there's an alliance player who I know will be easy for me to deal with contesting my quest mobs, but if I see an alliance player attack a horde player, all bets are off. We throwing down
---
Yeah.  Questing as a Druid is great.  Kill, kill, HoT, repeat.  No downtime at all.  The only time I ever drink is if I’m grouped up and I’m healing other people.  Plus most quests require a lot of cardio and the Druid excels at that.
---
ZA is not classic, ZG is. ZA was tbc

It's all over world chat lmao
---
Replacing one letter is a pretty shit attempt at making a “joke”.
---
Unfortunately if you try around 6pm EST it’s still pretty rough on Herod. Haven’t got to play the past two days after work. Yesterday was an 8k queue and Tuesday was around 7.5k.
---
I saw a layering inhibitor in other thread: make players switch layer only when they are X yards from group leader.
---
Tough call, tough call.
---
I’ll try this, thanks!
---
Anything else?
---
What realm is onslaught and the other large guilds doing this on?
---
As a tank stop joining those groups. Use your words.
---
Also, you are a tank, build your own group, recruit like minded folks for it, and boot people who don't do what you say. That is literally the best thing about being a tank. Stop being a Beta, you are the ALPHA. You are the TANK.
---
Don't let others ruin your fun, you are the boss.
---
As a healer I hate underleveled, undergeared groups thinking they can chain pull.
---
Animals are not getting fatter, the person who wrote that study was paid by the food industry. Also you didn't link the study you linked an article by Vox describing the study. It's also not all laboratory animals, it's the lab animals measured in this study, that was funded by the food industry.
---
Yes? What does that have to do at all with what I said?
---
No, this guy wrote a program that will perfectly time the disconnection/reconnection. The "switch" in these cases are a button on a customized program.
---
Rabies is one of the few things I will actively seek out a priest to remove for me. Screw having to eat for 40 seconds after every mob.
---
People can also answer questions how they see fit and you have no right to tell them otherwise.
---
Being able to play the game I’m paying money to play &gt; some dude exploiting layers.

I named my bank alt ThrallMart

Meanwhile, my priest looks like a mage.

I think we both know they are just saying they raid Eastern time.

Yeah I use A and D to strafe, I don't need to "turn", and if I do I do it with the mouse or arrow keys. Im just very lazy and dont want to move my hand much to use my spells
---
Yeah they were doing this on my server last night with the Naga reference. Acting all surprised that someone got banned for using the word Naga. Like, context you idiots.... Something isnt not racist just because you used a different word as a joke.
---
Thank you for the information kind stranger, it makes sense now!
---
Nah. That's a pretty cool hack! I hope they get banned to oblivion, but still cool
---
Horde just group up more and slaughter without any care in the world. Alliance are little cowards that wait til a horde is engaged with mobs and then kill them at low health. Absolutely no honour.
---
Human sword/mace spec? Gnome int? Dwarf priest fear ward?
---
Right... changing layers isnt an exploit but using multiple layers to avoid monster/node re-spawn timers is.
---
The toolkit doesn't state it  but you only have a small window to use parry, around-the-clock seconds after you parry an attack.
---
I was doing it with my priest party memeber as a 32 warrior. I would hit the elemental for 10 generating no rage. Eventually my friend came and helped us. It would have taken multiple evenings. Instead it took 1.
---
"Zone layering" *is* sharding and they would've been crucified for doing sharding in classic
---
Depending on the guild I rather start wearing them asap, take a 10% increased DPS dump on the fellow warriors and secure your core raider spot immediately.
---
The worse geared you are, the more edgemasters is letting you pull ahead due to the abundance of white hits and therefore glancing blows in your DPS that you can alleviate with edgemasters.
---
Happened yesterday on blammo. Certain zones suffered hyper lag while others unaffected. My guild chat was freaking out.
---
Imagine unironically rolling nothing nothing but oversized characters because you are afraid of a beautiful race. It's over for lanklets.
---
Adds are additional generic enemies that show up during a fight with a tougher enemy. e.g: Raid Bosses, Dungeon Bosses, etc
---
Trash usually refers to generic mobs that are before a fight but since trash/adds both refer to generic enemies, they are sometimes used interchangeably (can you grab that trash that spawned? vs can you grab the adds?)
---
So I wouldn't be surprised if someone called a random pack of mobs 'adds' even if they're not really additional mobs. The main criteria is that they're generic mobs that respawn or get spawned in by an encounter.
---
I actually agree with you that WoW stopped being fun, but apparently for different reasons. The heroics at the beginning of cata were some of the most fun I ever had in any dungeons. I don't expect that everyone felt the same about them, but what I don't understand is, why would you quit because of *heroic* content being difficult.
---
My point is, that you should have the option to have challenging content if this is something for you. But they actually went through the effort of implementing two difficulty levels, so that everyone could do what suits them, and still you're complaining about difficulty of heroics - why?
---
&gt;My solution to long queue times was to go to a server that didn't have queues
---
As you've likely heard or read before on this topic. I didn't want to leave my group of friends who've all decided to play here and coordinating the switch between me and my friends might be easy but adding in their friends they've brought and the friends of friends and now we have too many people to convince to move. So in our case, it's not a simple solution.
---
I agree that I would prefer to not have to remote in, but its either that or don't play with my friends and I know which I would prefer. In any case, it seems queues will be resolved soon. It's been a little over a week and queues have dropped from 20k to 8k at prime time and from 500/hr movement to 1800/hr movement. another week or two and there won't be queues beyond prime time weekends and even those will be short.
---
So? Your point is you don't like him? If I watch tv and don't like what's on I switch channels instead of raging lol
---
What's the purpose of a bank alt?
---
What is best class to do this on? Warrior? Rogue?
---
Orc racial is significant in pvp but pretty minor in pve.
---
Exactly this.  People don't understand that if other people have thousands of an herb the supply is WAY up, but the demand hasn't changed.  So the price of each herb will be much much lower.
---
This means affording your epic mount will be much much harder as you can't farm things to sell to other players as a means of income, due to extremely depressed prices.
---
Wouldn’t you have to make the distance super short then? I don’t know anything about anything, but I could imagine a clever addon being able to work around that limitation by creating chains of proximity.
---
It's definitely off by a huge amount in hordes favor. I said it in a previous post, but I've always played on PvP servers and have never seen it this bad. I'm really hoping it starts to balance out, because as it is right now, it's just a slaughter. I'm still enjoying it because I've always loved PvP, but I'll be honest:
---
 I die like 30 times a night, and it's usually to 10+ horde just ganking the shit out of me. Quests in any neutral zone are impossible. Hillsbrad I tried to quest, and I was ganked SO many times that after an hour I still didn't get 1 kill for the quest mobs. STV, holy shit, it was so bad. STV is usually my favorite part of the game - it's usually a war zone. This was not a war zone. This was a one-sided war, every time I went there. Just a straight slaughter with little to no Ally anywhere.
---
 This does nothing to deter me from playing, doesn't bother me, but it does bother some people I play with. I fear this huge imbalance will push even more Ally players off my server and it'll be a ghost town.
---
Still a waste for a 4sec debuff
---
 Layering works exactly as predicted, anyone taht isnt completely clueless knew that it will break game in this way. Just gotta abuse it now as best as possible.
---
Must be boring to mindlessly dungeon grind!
---
Right? He claims to have been sad that it wasn't there, but it is there, and that is a very specific name to be sad about not being there anyways.
---
Just like making wild, unfounded, and specific accusations that "all people who play X race with Y class are Z people" is an easy thing im sure will be popular
---
The true Horde. Thrall's Horde.
---
He will just sell it a stack at a time and keep the rest in the bank.  That'd be the smart way to do it.
---
And if that is taken just try it backwards
---
I don’t think I’m going to teach them a lesson. But I don’t have to help them either. So yes. I’ve cancelled my two accounts. I’m pretty saddened by this because I have been hyped for so long for this. Now I feel the opposite with the same fiery intensity. Why couldn’t they just see the obvious and prevented this?
---
"Copystrike" - it was worse than you remember.
---
No. I was 12g shy at 40 but I did SM cath runs with friends and they let me need on every drop and vendor them. Made the last bit in about 4 runs ( which takes us 20 mins each). Earned the initial 78g by running dungeons for the quests, world quests, vendoring items, bandages, and bars of iron and mithril.
---
What do YOU mean "you people"?
---
Half the classes didn't have working talent trees at launch. Fury warriors didn't exist. Mages specced full frost. Consumable knowledge is nowhere near what we know now. And many of these players have had years of practice in MC.
---
I think it's a decent way to prevent mass-farming from exploiting layers.  People farming rare herbs/ores would (I imagine) be pretty easy to track, simply because of how fast they would be farming these items.  
---
I'm not saying it's an end-all-be-all solution but it at least gives Blizzard the ability to punish people who continue to do it.
---
&gt; why would my character intentionally smash their skulls if he knew he needed them?
---
You're fighting to the death. Sometimes the only opening you'll get is to aim for the head, and you gotta take those openings if you get them, even if that damages the "goods" - it's preferable to being impaled by a farmer's tools.
---
I don't think there is anything like it available yet. I spent sometime this weekend looking for a TC replacement and didn't get anywhere.
---
Thing hits like a truck and you even get it from a quest of that dungeon.
---
Easiest way to get around this is to macro it into your Sinister strike.
---
All horde races are savage, especially in classic. Just embrace who you are.
---
Some people want to enjoy the game with their group of friends, or nobody else. It’s perfectly fine.
---
The game is a MMO sure, but you can do a hundred different things without talking to anyone if that’s your flavor.
---
Edit: this post was stupider than I thought, didn’t even look at the picture. weak meme hombre
---
&gt;Probably because he was using layers to get multiple chest, not because he phased into a zone and killed some one in the arena.
---
And that isnt possible now or what?
---
The new servers are locked from new characters, right? That way nobody can take the name.
---
Fury Warriors as well.  Casters and Hunters with their shot timers are pretty slow comparatively.
---
All he can really do is slowly sell off the crystals. Which is no different from him having farmed and sold the crystals over a year.
---
If he floods the market then prices will drop and we get cheap crystals for a while. Good for people who craft with them. Not so good for people who gather them.
---
I don't have enough money to train in axes.  I got to choose between uses an axe and having my 3 new skills.  But I'm still level 9.  Moving slow.  I'm not finding many more quests in Dun Morogh.
---
Sell them slowly, and never ever ever have to farm them, and instead can farm other stuff for even more money in the meantime.
---
Playing the auction house is a game in itself. This isn’t the real world haha, those players aren’t actually “getting fucked”
---
And you missed mine. 
---
I dont give a fuck about his point. Its stupid and childish. You cant sit there and call people every -ist under the sun because you didnt like what they said. The OP is likely trolling and wanting to start a political argument. They were triggered by a red hat and pepe memes ffs.
---
For sure this isn’t retail. Griefing players, especially those on your own faction, doesn’t always carry the penalty it should. So, sometimes it’s necessary to educate people that being a dick to randos just earns them same. Props for taking one for the team; with any luck this guy will eventually learn.
---
How did you kno
---
That looks nice
---
Well, then you would have to pay 2000g in a month or two once you have to buy them to set yourself apart from the other 10 million warriors constantly applying to your guild.
---
The warrior spots are the #1 most fiercly competitive spots in a raid roster and you *will* be cut if you don't work on the only thing you bring to the raid as a warrior: damage.
---
One button, one action. Such an addon would be bannable.
---
!remindme 8 hours
---
They have lower traffic because most people arent power leveling to 60. They will have more traffic, lots more, but obviously not 20-30 zones as there are fewer.
---
depends on prices and what you're looking to do. if you need for profession you don't. if the auction house is going to be same price as vendor you wouldn't bother because there's auction fees. look up auctioneer add on classic on Google. helps with this. also questie for quests if you haven't already. easy
---
Its not hard, just slow as fuck!
---
This is what he wanted, gg dude
---
r/whoosh
---
Yeah thankfully itemization is so wonky that you'd have to be a complete dummy to try to judge people's gear based purely on ilvl in classic.
---
I don't know the scope of the problem, but it's worth fixing. Especially for things like devilsaur leather the layer thing just fucks that farm up. Or black lotus farming. Keeping a timer for every black lotus for every layer seems pretty smart. And just other things like that. There's no reason for it to work like this, whether it's  just a handful of people doing it or everyone. Fix it before it potentially gets out of hand.
---
Hm? There is nothing that says anything you seem to claim. The devs state that you won't layer spontaneously and also it will take a little bit of time if you are in combat. None of those things even **remotely** proves what you are saying. Furthermore, everybody on this sub is **asking** for a cooldown to be added - while you claim it is already in place. Why would people be asking for it then? The paragraphs you have quoted are as irrelevant as quoting Shakespear.
---
I saw Monkey get invited and kicked out of his group to switch layers back and forth several times within a minute and he always transferred. Unfortunately.
---
As we have estabilished, you clearly have no clue what you are talking about, so thank you for the conversation, but educate yourself on the subject before you go posting some more.
---
So how was this accomplished then?  How were you able to take him down with 1/4 the raid numbers?  Your gear couldn't have been uber already....
---
"We" agree
---
It's a mage what do you think
---
No, rested xp is a percentage of your current level, regardless of progress. If your current level needs 1000 xp total, but the next level requires 2000, and you log out right now, you'll be getting 50 xp every 8 hours, for a total max of 1000 rested xp, even if you're at 999/1000.
---
If you just level up before logging out, you'll be getting 100xp every 8 hours, regardless of how much left of the level you have.
---
note: not actual numbers, just a figure for easy math.
---
always felt the opposite way, first time I rolled alliance and tbh it is equally good. You just have to be willing to engage with the quests
---
Oh grow up lol 
---
Fucking trolls on this sub
---
&gt;to limit progress and to allow for gameplay thats challenging and time consuming
---
Except none of this is actually true of Classic.
---
There's some gear gatekeeping, true, and some performance gatekeeping as well. But overall, Classic end-game pve content is way easier than what we've been used to through later expacs.
---
Doesn't mean it's not interesting, but simply making it easier to access to components for craft means we'll waste less time for mats grinding.
---
I had no idea that was an option
---
Real men level as prot.  Also masochists.  They level as prot, too.
---
well, hopefully, those folks get caught and a nice week or month ban should correct the issue. by the time they come back, queues will be resolved anyway.
---
Hey, have you considered adding the console port addon to the stack?
---
I choose to sit my bank alt in TB. Not as populated of a city so everything runs smoother, not a huge issue in Classic but little bit counts. Also, I think it's laid out better for bank alts. AH and a vendor are next to each other without even going inside a building and the mail/bank are just a few steps away.
---
Arcane crystals only have like a 3% drop chance off of small and rich thorium veins right? That would means hes farmed around 100k thorium veins, with the time required to level to the zones required to get these mats, and the time it takes to farm. I doubt there is any possibility besides item duping that this is true.
---
There's an addon called classic census that gives good data. Definitely doesn't paint the whole picture, but it's not soley anecdotes.
---
This the same Leshraque who was the only competition ever even close to Joanas old record runs?
---
You fill in base miss chance, then crit chance, and the rest is hit. The only reason it seems to miss more is because you’re paying attention and you notice them more than other abilities.
---
I agree man it’s really annoying. Been duo leveling with a friend as shaman rogue and we just do dungeons here and there for some weapon and gear upgrades. It’s so annoying how virtually everyone just wants to run cleave. The worst so far has been scarlet monastery.
---
You might want to watch out if you're abusing the system, Blizzard might punish you. They want to get rid of layering soon too so it won't be a problem then.
---
But if you're dual wielding you can't shield block. Unless the talent spec is meant to allow you to slap the Shield on when needed (that's what confused me)
---
I am so glad I picked a low pop server. I havnt had a queue yet.
---
26ish-34ish
---
Wow you really didn't get the picture
---
Then you went full 12 year old and said "welcome to my ignore list" and ignored them.
---
Well if you really want to analyze the bell-curve part of the comment you may be right, the way I meant it is: that first wave of slightly less than casual players are going to be hitting 40 real soon!
---
You’re not going to get a satisfying smooth rotation in classic. Every class is either spamming the same move(mages with frostbolt) or auto attacking with procs, or very slow ability usage. 
---
I play ret and the bulk of my rotation is waiting for procs; the fun for me comes in all the utility I can bring, off heals for clutch moments, throw on sword and board and I can tank adds etc.
---
You’re not going to find a smooth retail rotation in classic; it just doesn’t exist.
---
It wasn't actively exploiting, it was taking advantage of a bug that stopped the raid xp penalty from kicking in.
---
As a warlock I make it my mission to give unending breath to everyone I see. Some of the whispers I get from doing this have been amazing.

Please give more materials
---
You are a GOD!  A GOD I say!
---
You are the one who doesn’t know how it works apparently. There are not an infinite number of layers, and the same nodes are not spawned on every layer. It is not as simple as “mine node, get invite to new layer, mine same node, repeat forever”.
---
It's not bannable and that arcane crystal pic also isn't on live Classic servers.
---
Only clicked the post to say this!
---
Ok I'll bite with some math.
---
Game has been out for 10 days, meaning there have been 240 hours he could have farming. Being super generous, lets assume he was farming the second the game dropped.
---
To get 3200 crystals,  he'd need to get 13 per hour since the game dropped. Looking at a few different websites, the best drop rate for crystals from a node that I could find is 13%. So lets say 15%. That means he'd need to mine at least 88 nodes per hour, ever since the game dropped, non-stop, with no breaks. So yea, I call bullshit on the screen cap being from classic.
---
I know, but most have 1-3 friends that could do it
---
You obviously care enough to express you don't care. A real person that didn't care wouldn't have even clicked on the link. "Asmongon? Whos that? I don't care about him." But clicking the link, probly downvoting the post too, you clearly care. So why do you care?
---
So happy I’m on Deviant Delight where this shit isn’t a real issue (yet). Hopefully this stuff gets fixed soon.
---
not at all.  sailed all the way across the ocean.
---
Barrens is amazing for leveling? Not really sure why you're dreading it.
---
But with the live version of WoW players can still go to Outlands for BC and Northrend to experience WotLK, so the only issue is would Blizzard actually go ahead and branch out to create a new storyline in an alternate universe?

---
Yea I've done every quest in Auberdine and the ones in Ashenvale that I need to complete are 24+. I have the large map with all the level ranges from this sub bookmarked, but wasn't sure when looking at the map how to get to Loch Modan because there wasn't a direct road from Wetlands. 
---
I'm trying to meet up with a friend in Ironforge so we can at least duo quests together in Loch Modan and then head to RR.
---
No it used to be used very effectively in PvP.  I remember some old pvp videos of someone destroying in AV and in some arenas in BC/WOTLK.  PvP is primarily why you would do this.
---
I have tried this on retail back at that time and it's not a casual playing experience at all.  You have to login with all your chars, everything has to be a target of target macro on every char and its just a huge pain to setup, play everything.  I sucked at it but some people are really good with it.  I would think now with as 'loose' as raid comps could be it would be a really good time to raid as well.  Come to think of it I've seen multiboxers run BC raids too.
---
For some reason, every time I try to go into window mode it gives me an error and crashes. :/
---
Thinking of rolling paladin, does anyone know if you have to lvl as ret to lvl efficiently? I've heard going holy/prot can be good for leveling too, but I'm not sure how true that is
---
Usually you DW for trash and soft-hitting bosses and slap a shield on for the hard hitting ones that can actually kill you. It's a max-threat talent build for farm raids to allow your DPS to go ham, and it's also a build that lets you tank most 60 dungeons easily without sacrificing your ability to solo farm and quest too much.
---
Go to the human starting zone. Swapping between zones is a good way to deal with the questing draught.

By level 30 you’ll start watching every class kill much faster than you and you’ll think “ehh maybe I can throw in 2 or so mind flays” next thing you know you’re drinking every 4-5 pulls. BFD wand is so good 18-30 but falls off, yet still nothing beats it because shadow vulnerability and shadow damage.
---
I know, and that's why I'm glad I won't have to, or at least will have to waste less time.
---
Because in the end, it gives me more time to work on alts, other areas of the game or simply to play something else.
---
Also, I'm not sure mats will be that detrimental to progress with the tools we have now. Coordinating more people is easier than ever and should alleviate most of the self-requirements of the time. We'll see - I can't way to tackle MC in a couple of weeks to see for myself (=
---
Just make macros
---
That is not what I'm saying at all. Lol.
---
Having to explain *any* joke is an automatic sign of its poor quality.

Yes, layering has totally fucked the server economy and needs to be turned off NOW.   It served its purpose, launch week, now turn it off!!!!

&gt; Elrond: "This peril belongs to all Middle-Earth. They must decide now how to end it. The time of the Elves is over — my people are leaving these shores. Who will you look to when we've gone? The Dwarves? They hide in their mountains seeking riches — they care nothing for the troubles of others."
---
&gt;Gandalf: "It is in Men that we must place our hope."
---
&gt;Elrond: "Men? Men are weak. The race of Men is failing. The blood of Númenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity forgotten. It is because of Men the Ring survives. I was there Gandalf. I was there three thousand years ago… It should've ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure. Isildur kept the Ring. The line of kings is broken. There is no strength left in the world of Men. They're scattered, divided, leaderless."
---
&gt;Gandalf: "There is one who could unite them, one who could reclaim the throne of Gondor."
---
&gt;Elrond: "He turned from that path long time ago. He has chosen exile."

Thanks 👍 looks like that's it then

And yet here you are. Trying to be the internet white knight. What point are you even trying to make. You think im defending a hat or memes.

You mean you can't see past your own confirmation bias? That was abundantly clear from your OP. 
---
Try actually watching him and gaining an understanding before leaping to a wild conclusion about him. He has previously made it abundantly clear - in fact he did as much in the moments surrounding the one your post concerns - that he is staunchly against racism and homophobia. He's just not some virulently left-wing authoritarian nut-job and gives almost 0 fucks about the bullshit people spout 99% of the time.
---
BM for leveling is the smoothest imo and can be used in dungeons no problem (just be sure to dismiss your pet if you are doing any skips) and you can easily afford to respec at 60 to go MM for raiding.

&gt; “Someone who lies and someone who tells the truth are playing on opposite sides, so to speak, in the same game. Each responds to the facts as he understands them, although the response of the one is guided by the authority of the truth, while the response of the other defies that authority and refuses to meet its demands. The bullshitter ignores these demands altogether. He does not reject the authority of the truth, as the liar does, and oppose himself to it. He pays no attention to it at all. By virtue of this, bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are.”

Eh, if you don't have friends to help you get WW axe at 30 then Corpsemaker is such a massive upgrade over the Crescent Staff which many warriors are still using around that level. It will carry you until you can solo the WW axe quest.

---
This sounds good, but reality rarely plays out like that.  Most people showing up to raids are going to expect their fellow raiders to contribute ti the best of their character's potential.  A paladin playing ret is simply not doing so.  You may find a raid team that is willing to tolerate your selfish spec,  but in 99% of cases ret is not going to be tolerated for very long,  especially as you progress past BWL.  For example,  not a single ret paladin killed Kel'Thuzad on the most recent pserver before classic launched.
---
It's just a completely terrible spec and attempting to fool the OP into thinking he will be able to find a raid team that will tolerate it long term is doing him a disservice.
---
Not just boss mobs. In Vanilla (and apparently in classic, though it's a different engine so some things might be working differently) *most* mobs will reset their leash ranges when you hit them with a spell or attack. This means that you can theoretically drag almost any mob to pretty much anywhere on the continent as long as you keep hitting it without killing it or dying to it.
---
The eyebrows through the top of the brim on the hat are making me laugh so hard
---
Agreed. This is exactly what I do. The remote desktop is amazing.
---
BM is excellent for leveling, farming, and soloing dungeons. From what I remember it is not too far behind MM in entry level raiding, but once you accumulate more gear MM pulls further ahead. MM obviously brings significantly more utility with TSA in raids.
---
Hrmm..

I wonder why I don’t see any config options. I’ll figure it out.

God I fucking LOVE pixelart, tremendous job!
---
Yes, this guy is right... Abandon your friends and character you spent time on for a server that will be dead within a year.
---
I'm not entirely convinced that there aren't certain types of mobs that DO get extra miss/dodge/parry chance at low health.   
---
Rambling anecdote incoming: My wife and I were grinding some mobs this weekend.  I'm drawing a blank on which ones, but there were casters and melee scattered in packs (possibly the orcs leading up to Nekrosh, we played alot this weekend and it's blurring together)...anyway.  The melee died fine like normal mobs.  Every single caster, around 2% would just go full on ninja and miss/dodge/parry about 10 hits in a row (3-6 hits from each of us) before we could kill it.  I never saw a buff on the mobs or debuff on me, so it wasn't that.   It was consistent, though, the entire time we were in that camp.

Dwarf - Hunter

Gnome - Mage

Orc - Warrior

Tauren - Shaman

Undead - Warlock

Troll - Hunter

That’s my personal preference based on atheistics alone.
---
I don't think so, but I quit around christmas so I might have forgotten. In this case it wouldn't be useful anyway, any party member can "request invite" to ask the leader to invite someone.
---
Nah, I hated that shit and only went through it like five times over the entirety of vanilla.
---
But think about it, if you have to stop in the middle of the dungeon to discuss what you are actually going to do, then you clearly didn't do that beforehand and thus people might not react the way you expect them to.
---
Always clarify the targets before you enter the content, not when you are already in the middle of it.
---
Can you copy and paste here the specific one you're trying?
---
I did some math on the full arcane crystals, if done by one person they needed to be tapping a node every 9 seconds or so since release. That doesn’t allow any time for leveling, mailing crystals to a bank alt, or being offline at all. At the very least getting that many crystals was a group of people exploiting but more probably it’s from a private server.
---
With Blizz still remaining silent on this issue I honestly feel they just don't care and layering will remain until P2.
---
This of course is a huge mistake and will end up causing major damage to the economy for months to come.
---
Layering should have been removed after the 1st week. People are spread out enough level wise that overcrowded zones isn't a major problem. 
---
This is an MMO we are supposed to have lively zones filled with people running around doing quests, killing things, and competing for resources.
---
But by the time P2 rolls around countless people will be 60 and unfortunately feel forced to abuse layering like everyone else had done so there will be massive stockpiles of mats severely damaging the economy.
---
I don't follow Asmongold so I don't have a horse in the race but the OP isn't mad bc Asmon played how he wanted. He made a promise to his fans he wouldn't do this. The OP is mad at the hypocrisy of someone that they financially supported and they want to call him out.
---
This isn't "Who the hell cares" bc people obviously care. you don't care. You aren't the center of the universe. Just because you don't care, doesn't mean other people don't.
---
Tukui - the only add on you’ll ever need.
---
Why ask the same question every minute?
---
Norsemen fan ? 🙃
---
“Tolerate your selfish spec”
---
Lmao these people
---
in that case you are passively being benefited by a game bug, kinda hard to justify a ban when you have the argument that you didn't knew you were making more XP out of it.
---
In this case they are actively exploiting a feature in order to make gold. Yeah banning has happened for a lot less. And it's kinda hard to argument ignorance in this case.
---
Supply and demand would fix this quick if they wanted to sell them in any reasonable amount of time.
---
Plus, if he can do it so can everyone else. Flooding the market like this is always good for the consumer, bad for the seller.
---
Woah, is trump still a douche in 2020?
---
Oh, in that case yeah I think they should probably be temp banned as well, but it won’t happen because all of the streamers abused SM leveling and blizzard won’t be willing to sacrifice 2 weeks of that free advertisement.
---
I just bought a sub too right when I joined a full sever and my position in queue only went up. Since I was a new sub wow didn’t register that yet when I was in queue so everyone else literally had a higher priority than me. I just played in a different realm till it became active.
---
I understand what you’re saying but the only reason I join groups instead of forming my own is because it’s an instant invite with zero downtime between dungeons. I can finish one, stand outside the entrance for a bit then jump into the next run really quickly.
---
same for Mograine EU PvP, cant get out of BRD im stuck here
---
cant even log in anymore just gives me world server down
---
Put the flash on next time to make the image worse.
---
Okay, World First Classic then.
---
Love the earlier seasons of Arrow reference. If I wasn't being forced to play horde I would definitely want a hunter named "Oliverqueen" or something for the same type of reason
---
How did you bind the keys?  I only have a "Desktop Default" profile and can't find a way to have pressable buttons for like 1/2/3/4, best I have right now is up, down, left, right, and space.
---
That's not how it works so that shouldn't have made a difference. There's no priority for new/old people.
---
Just happened to me in desolace on ashbringer as well!
---
What server you're on? And about your last sentence, that's exactly why servers that starts too unbalanced tend to get even worse, the other faction just goes play somewhere else.
---
Was there? what was the abuse? I did not hear about it.
---
Yes, nightfall is definitely best for off tanks.
---
Yeah but it is much more of a bitch to do because you have a bunch of low levels. Also, not a lot of people have 10 alts.
---
Unless it knocks the rogue that just vanished out of stealth
---
Questie shows marks on the map and minimap for quest objectives, and also shows all available quests with exclamation marks. (ex: If you have to kill 10 boars, it will show you everywhere on the map where boars spawn). 
---
Guidelime tells you exactly what quests to do and in what order to level more efficiently. (ex: Accept quest X, Y, Z... go to (location) to do X, then go to (location) to do Y, then go to (location) to do Z). 
---
Really up to your play style for which you prefer. Guidelime is a literal guide, while questie just makes it easier to see where quest objectives are.
---
Yes they did. Separate server groups that would eventually be merged (which may share common player name pool). The main difference being that you could not just server-hop whenever you please.
---
Oops.
---
They should add animal interactions, so that you can cook them before killing them. That would be delish
---
The Fight for Mage Gear is real!
---
Can you even turn off xp in classic?
---
Yeah, hoping she gets in tonight 😅 it's her first time playing really
---
In arabic it means vagina...
---
Okay. So what?
---
Sure it is. I saw someone riding an epic mount Saturday after release. Was honestly more impressed with that than the Saturday rag kill.
---
As a tauren my arms are quite furry so I don't have to make that tough choice!
---
Official Brazil, not Official Blizzard.
---
This is an alliance screenshot. Horde don't have a flight path up in night elf lands.
---
Kinda answered your own question.
---
Allright then mr tryhard who got world first. Oh wait. You're just a troll with nothing better going on in their life. My bad
---
I feel these problems pale in comparisons to the current abuse. It's not a perfect solution sure. A 10 minute cooldown would be enough to avoid most of the above while making it not nearly as beneficial
---
Shit up eurotrash
---
If it’s green and up it’s desirable to someone. The stats done matter all that much expect to what class wants it. You could get into the finer details about what classes are dominant in your server and what stats are in demand but that would be exhausting. Just know that if it’s green or above you can vendor it on the AH, just do an AH search of it and see what other are selling it for. Like I said that actually number of the stat doesn’t really matter as much as the grade because the stats will remain consistent as the item gets higher level.
---
Very true, but I'd also remind people an average player with a warrior is going to have a lot easier time holding threat than the same average player on a bear tank.
---
A 100% top tier raider will be more effective on a warrior than a bear tank as well.
---
It required you to move 10 characters and die many times in the process, much less convenient than current state, I think it's a good idea
---
Sure, but as soon as it heavily affects the economy to the point of it actually breaking, then they better either roll back their progress, or ban such accounts. Otherwise it will ruin the experience for all.
---
This was not the case when some people reached max level faster.
---
Lol no. If someone breaks up with you for a shitty reason it's the best gift they could ever give you
---
Classic player and BFA player expressed in 1 comic, I love it!
---
And what is he going to do with the “other stuff” to make “even more money”?
---
All layering does is increase the size of the map virtually. It’s no different from Blizzard manually increasing the size of the map several times manually - increasing the number of nodes with it.
---
There are more nodes but also more players. More players who will gather. More players who will craft and consumed the gathered resources. For most part, the ability of an individual player to affect the market has decreased due to the increase in the size of the market.
---
That's why I blow my vanish when I get marked. Usually means the hunter is too far to serpent sting but doesn't understand that my vanish removes his mark.
---
It's Thalanaar in 1KN that's missing and causing this route.  I don't believe Stonetalon Peak and Nijel's Point in Desolace connect to Feathermoon in Classic.
---
The last few groups I've run with have been smooth to the point where I'm able to dps as the healer. Never have to stop and drink people using cc and pulling correctly. The tank actually using a shield. 
---
Prior to that the tank was using a 2h the ret pally had righteous fury on and the mage and warlock were taking 100% of the aggro. SM was about to become my favorite dungeon to my most hated.
---
Pro tip to groups: if you run the healer oom every pull if you make a shit pull it becomes a wipe. If you make a shit pull while doing controlled pulls it's a break for mana
---
It's actually really crazy to see tbh
---
You pay a fee for putting an item up on AH. If it gets sold, you get that fee back. Otherwise it's lost to the void.
---
Yeah in camera settings you can have it settle behind you automatically when you start moving. I think there are a few more options but I've never used it.
---
The less than vendor value thing is the one that gets me. My bank alt has a bunch of stuff like moonstone that's regularly listed at vendor price on the AH, so after cut the seller makes less. Makes no sense. If it weren't so pervasiv in I might buy all of it and try to corner the market.
---
Lol, thanks, now I have something to do while waiting the flights that are as long as New York City's traffic.
---
My dude, he's alliance
---
Each later is an entire independent server population. In retail that was estimated to be between 2500-3500 people. 
---
25 layers would be at least 75,000 players on each full realm. That is absolutely absurd.
---
They won't do shit.  Exploit early, exploit often.  They continually make decisions that fuck the game, even when provided evidence that those decisions will, in fact, fuck the game.
---
I used to do this with somnus from swamp of sorrows a lot back with my hunter. I wouldn’t ever take him to SW cause he would be killed rather quickly, however goldshire would get smashed
---
&gt; On your phone or tablet, go to Options and find the Controller Presets. Click on Desktop Configuration and find the one that says "WASD, Mouse, and Keyboard."
---
I managed to configure this option but the game doesn't recognize any input.
---
I actually dont know.  Can anyone clarify?
---
This guy has night elf FPs so imma guess sun rock isn’t an option...
---
Yep, you can always switch later :)
---
30, 21, and 17 here.  Looking into starting a new one too...
---
 People  who say, this will somehow ruin the economy don't seem to even  understand how "economy" works. Like the formula price=demand/supply  tells us. Everything you can achieve by farming and selling 1000 Black  Lotus is: The price for Black Lotus will plummet (yay, cheap Lotus for  everyone!).
---
Sure, you can decide  to keep your Black Lotus and only sell one occasionally for a higher  price. But this won't make you rich either. In the very long run  perhaps, yes. But in the long run you could as well get rich by normal  means.
---
So all you get by getting 1000 Black Lotus is you having 1000 Black Lotus sitting in your bank.  You won't magically "fuck the economy" with that.
---
Priest is my first and highest class so far and I can't stand it anymore. It boils down to shield, dot, wand, and wait 10-20 seconds. It's really not engaging at all.
---
and i'm over here having fun and not giving a hoot
---
Nope, you're incorrect. Skeram is filled with horde to the point that horde cannot be ganked. Don't you read comments?!
---
hashes are literally all unique by design how tf are you grouping ppl through this. This sounds like bs.
---
That I'm not sure of.  October I believe but haven't researched a solid date.
---
What difference does the existence of playing off peak make when you can combine it with layer shifting? You keep mentioning it like its in a vacuum.
---
You can’t tell me what to do. YOU’RE NOT MY REAL DAD!
---
My first reaction was "why would I join a guild with my bank alt? I make a bank guild with my bank alt"
---
Then got sad that I can't have my own guild bank anymore.
---
I feel like most classic people havent played wow since TBC/Wrath/Cata and are coming back just for this.
---
There are also private server people but i think they mostly stick to their own little bubbles and are all at or near 60 by now.
---
Then you have your retail tourists. These are mostly the people who just want to check out classic a bit and maybe ding 20. I honestly feel like retail casuals will enjoy and play further into classic than the retail raiders/pvpers/m+. Classic is about time investment for the most part not mechanical skill like high end retail content.
---
There are also totally brand new players who find retail overwelming and want to have the same new player experience people who first played the game did. Props to these guys if i was new and had the choice between a game in its original state and a game overloaded with expansions id want to start at the beginning too.
---
So no. People who have multiple AOTCs and do +15s regularly are likely in the tiniest classic minority. We'll see more of them when retail hits a drought but right now 8.2 is still pretty fresh.
---
I remember running SM over and over and over again trying to get  it on my paladin in vanilla.
---
This was my 2nd time on my rogue, just helping some friends clear it, and it dropped for me. Lol
---
The people exploiting it knew it was a bug, the people who played vanilla knew it was a bug.
---
MC is incredibly easy.
---
In reality it just means that this (supposed) guy and a few others relentlessly farming and abusing layering will have a ton of individual gold. They wont be able to do much with it cause manipulating the economy is clearly against ToS.
---
For anyone not planning to farm these mats or make money from crafting these items it wont affect them at all other than positively as they will he able to get some epic crafted gear easier. Of course so will others so in a pvp sense it will just balance out.
---
Sorry to all the blacksmiths that had plans to sell arcanite reapers
---
Create and advertise a discord with ur plan to change the name
---
and therefore we give them a back stab. 
---
ok, i will show myself the way out.
---
Agree to disagree then.
---
Always blame Khadgar
---
Do you have any actual evidence of what it's doing to the economy or that abuse is even a regular occurrence?
---
Why would you assume one person? You think the devilsaur mafia is 1 account?
---
I did some math. Onyxia is MAtHEMAtICALLY imPoSSiBLe if we assume one person is soloing it. Plus we HAVE TO factor in the time it takes to solo your way to attunement ! Iamverysmart
---
It will.  Warriors are arguably the most gear dependent class in the game.
---
He can't even dook normally after this.
---
I just started over for the tenth time. I keep leveling to 10 and then rerolling something else. 
---
I'll never hit 60
---
Nope. Can't change your mind. The most iconic thing about Org is their mud hut bank. Horde is big gay.
---
By definition, it is an exploit. Using game mechanics in an unintended way to gain an advantage. Like literally the definition. Just because blizzard hasnt officially labled it as such doesnt mean it doesnt fit the definition
---
It's not racist
---
Delete this comment you dirty nogger
---
Cyborg Gnomes. Wish I was joking.
---
I’m 39 right now and was looking forward to giving portals, but I really feel bad attaching a price to it. If I don’t put a price and just do for tips I’ll get shorted a lot.
---
If you stay resto you will still need some str and agi gear to grind mobs unless in a group. Also you must take three points in nature's guidance for the hit chance, it is a huge upgrade for grinding.
---
In regards to disbanding and recreating? Because that has already been done.
---
That's okay, I don't want in your raid anyway.
---
If you flood the market, you either vendor or sell below market value, wiping out all the effort you put in to "farm" those mats. 
---
If you sell it slowly (best case scenario) then you're only dripfeeding yourself gold because no one has the money available to bulk buy your product. 
---
If you have a house valued at $10 billion, that's great and all, but if no one can buy it then the value is essentially $0.
---
Avoid ad hominem attacks when attempting to have an intelligent conversation. It serves you not at all.
---
Any resources for gear progression on leveling a tank warrior? All I see is pre bis
---
The same exact thing could be said for this fear-mongering post from the main forums.
---
It’s mad isn’t it. You initially are annoyed that they’re not dropping but then you realise you’ve gone up half a level from killing 100 of those bad boys. Silver lining!
---
But there are even more players per server now. Demand will also be higher.
---
Well obviously it depends on the addons and how they are implemented.  But they could likely break auctioneer + TSM sniping just by restricting their API a bit.
---
You are correct and I did not say otherwise. I said that in light of a positive response to playing wow on a  mobile device blizzard will end up simplifying wow in the future as a result in order to make it more mobile accessible.
---
Diablo 4 was an entirely mobile game. They can not be trusted with a positive mobile response to wow.
---
I will post here again but thanks for contributing to the discussion. Ohh wait. You didn't.
---
Where did you farm runecloth?
---
If it bothers you that much just disband the guild and remake it with a new name.
---
It was a fun game in the past and still is. While some will rush and level, many take their times, and enjo the ride. Plus, many players are now quite old and have a life which means that a big chunk of experienced players are a also levelling slowly. Give it a shot and you will probably not regret it.
---
I think so just going by memory yeah, no "weapon damage plus 27" or "increased by attack power" etc
---
I think it will be in phase 4 or 5
---
Skeram, and exactly. I feel like it's only going to get worse to be honest
---
That's a good way to look at it - relative % to current stats.  
---
I have to retrain my brain lol.  Looking at a +stamina in the 5-15 range immediately causes me to think it's junk, but I'd be wrong in that assumption.
---
Spoilers! ;P
---
You are god.
---
You can put a \\ before the # so that it shows the # instead of turning the text into a title/header
---
This is exactly what people were saying about the raid exp exploits up until blizzard hotfixed it. 
---
Dont see why people try so hard to deny that these things are happening.
---
There is no proof that this is real and is likely just fear mongering for drama. And in reality if this was true it wouldnt affect 90% of the population negatively. The people screaming the loudest about how bad this is dont understand layering or the in game economy
---
yeah that's quite possibly true but I don't know the extend to which this has really been abused. This may also be the result of multiple people doing this and accumulating it into one bank alt.
---
....I'm not the only one who thought this gnome was wielding a smoking pipe of time kind? Clearly a classy weapon for a warlock.
---
I leveled my warrior as arms and had a blast, I couldn't really get into fury. Mortal strike is awesome
---
As a fellow machinist I'm rubbing my hands of the thought of this working on my moto g5 plus.... Gonna try it out
---
Blizzard can find them easily with stats: Delete all and put a ban on them. Fcks the  whole economy and they are try hards....
---
Phase 3 those will be worth a fortune!!
---
If it takes you a couple weeks to level, you will be so late to the party it wont matter
---
Those elementals in thousand needles that do fire damage on melee swing to avoid armor, 3 sec fire instant stun, and debuff 51% chance to miss.
---
No mob claps harder lol
---
That’s the big question I suppose. Is this flood of mats balanced by the increased population. If there are really 25+ layers I would hazard a guess and say we still have a problem
---
No but BGs don’t reward any exp by themselves so twinks never leveled up
---
If I do BFD quest at level 18 and have a level 18 friend with me, how much more help would we need?
---
Dammmmmmn that's nice. I'm still rocking my mage lv 15 robe at lv 26... I need an upgrade!
---
That's what I'm after too
---
&gt;It's kind of like hardcore racists use it as a mating call to find each other without having to explicitly yell about black people in barrens chat like some people do.
---
It's called a dog whistle.
---
It happens everywhere on the internet, with all kind of groups. Mostly racists and pedophiles though.
---
They already started allowing character transfers. It won't take as long as people think
---
Well, it's not like anyone could have seen this coming...
---
This has been discussed as the major drawback of layering, which is why only layering 1-20 or even 1-30 would have been the correct approach. However, Blizzard chose to build their layering technology in a way that makes that impossible. So we are stuck with this and a fucked economy. If there are truly 25+ layers atm, we won't be able to get rid of them for a very long time.
---
The only real way to do it is to force you within the same zone or like 200y, and be within like 10 levels so you can't just use a L1 to farm 60 mats.
---
And... It's too late. Enjoy Blizzard apologists. Enjoy
---
Please, re-read very carefully, exactly what I wrote.  Layer hopping in itself, is not an exploit.  What people may choose to do with layer hopping at their disposal is a wholly different discussion.  But someone flat out making comment that layer hopping should be a bannable offense is 100% in the wrong.
---
Yo legit tho, as a Warrior myself approaching 40 how the hell did you save up 90g for the mount.  Tell me your wayssss.
---
&gt; Don't hesitate to abuse layering  
---
Was it your goal to derail your own post?
---
If I'm lucky I might hit 40 by the weekend. But I worked all last week. Could be different depending on how much time off people took
---
What's the bell curve lol
---
For Us realms as well?
---
That being said, underleveled dungeons with people you know are a fun challenge. My bro tanked deadmines as a 17 druid and I was a 16 warlock dps. Rest of our party were 18 and we were upfront with them about it. Only wipe was getting the miner cards outside the instance.
---
I have had groups for other dungeons where the overlevelled guy is barely pulling his weight. Competency matters more than level. If you have good group members, add them so you can try to group with them again later.
---
Similar experience when he tanked stocks at 22. Were looking for a tank, overleveled priest joined up and we asked him if he could keep a 22 druid alive. Before the bosses I would tap down and he would HOT me before pulling so the heal gave him more threat. Only wipe was me pulling a boss with my imp xd.
---
Also learn the limits of your class for dungeons, warlocks be passing out health stones, and offer to voidwalker offtank or use succubus to charm and hold a mob if you think your group needs it (or voidwalker main tank when the 28 pali cant hold aggro on the 35 boss). Priest, Pali, or Druid dps, hold onto some mana in big pulls incase the healer needs help. Having a druid swap out of cat form at full mana has saved me a number of wipes over the years.
---
He will occasionally show you mercy if you address him using his formal title, 'His Chonkness'.
---
Honestly the most important part about race is its the animations you're going to have to watch repeatedly for a long time. So you want to choose one that looks cool and has good animations. At least that's my opinion. The racials are pretty negligible in terms of everyday playing.
---
honestly if I see a rogue I assume he is going to stealth and attack me at some point when I am attacking mobs or something like that so better safe than sorry. Fuck rogues.
---
No, i did not believe you were defending retail.  
---
And to be clear, neither am I. I do not like the state the game is in right now.  
---
But i do not like classic either. I liked other expansions, such as legion, mop, wotlk, tbc as stated earlier. I do like some changes though, and i believe a wow we all (or most of us) like lies somewhere in between.  
---
But to make my point more clear: Classic encourages you to socialize, because being in a group instantly REWARDS you with making fights go faster etc.  
---
Retail does not discourage or hinder you to socialize, it just doesn't encourage it anymore. You CAN kill normal Quest-Mobs rather fast, so why would you group up with someone?  
---
Well, if you actually WANT to socialize, then you group up with people BECAUSE you want to socialize.  
---
And i do believe that alot of the commentors here mistake "discourage" with "not actually rewarding" socialization, which classic did.  
---
And to repeat my point: If you need a carrot on a stick to ask someone if he wants to group up, your goal is to quest and grind better, not to socialize with said person. The Problem are the players, not the system.
---
+arcane / spell power discipline priest topping the dps meters with starshards; BiS priest imo
---
I like to pull with Moonfire but I don't like to recommend it to new players because it's extremely situational.
---
 You don't want to do it if you're going to lose a ton of rage from shifting out of bear. You don't want to do it to a group of casters that can instagib you before you can shift back to bear. You don't want to do it to mobs that have a charge or a ranged stun. And on and on.
---
Once you're good and you're comfortable with the class and with tanking in general, then throw some Moonfires around. Heal yourself between pulls and do all the cool stuff that only druids can do. But until then, keep it simple.
---
Im going to download my character from a high pop server to a low pop server
---
Yeah the term bar does not imply it is large at all.  You can buy really tiny bars of precious metals... The issue is that when people think of a bar of metal (myself included) they immediately think of the large gold bricks...
---
 [https://invest.usgoldbureau.com/gold-bar-sizes](https://invest.usgoldbureau.com/gold-bar-sizes)
---
Not to mention their /cheer is the best as well. Taz'Dingo!
---
The human racial for spottingcats/rogues in stealth is pretty damn good too. Personally I prefer dwarf, purely for cosmetic/lore reasons.
---
I’m happily settled into my undead mage main, but I’ve wanted to play something on the side to sate my appetite for the lore of classic Azeroth.
---
So, between the other three horde races and their classes, which will be the most fun to play for the lore?  I’ve been thinking about an Orc warrior or shaman, but I’m still uncertain.
---
Edit:  I’m looking for a horde class/race combo (not undead since I already have one) that is especially enjoyable for lore reasons.
---
He's connected to EU realms so I'm not so sure we can say which side is the passenger side. Just a joke, friend-o.
---
In addition to what the other reply said, the reason they’re worth less than usual right now is because most people don’t have a huge amount of gold yet and so the overall gold floating around the economy is way lower than it will be in a few months.
---
OOOO yeah, I don't level as fury.  That changes things.  I have imp rend which makes rend BY FAR more efficient with rage than sunder...even if rend only tics two or three times (can't remember the exact math)
---
If you think it’s ok then go for it.
---
But it takes roughly 2 minutes after being invited for the layer to change. Do people not know this?
---
Are you sure? i cant find the folder :(
---
Armor takes your HP into account in calculating damage reduction so stamina is actually much more valuable to your effective HP than a flat increase of 10hp per point, especially to mail and plate wearers.
---
It's still kind of nice to have with all these shadow priests healing dungeons.  Pretty hard to have decent keybinds for downranked heal spells and such with all the best binds used up by shadow stuff.
---
Im a new player enjoying classic, so there atleast 3 of us!

Every little bit helps... I honestly take all my BoE green or higher items and go look them up on the AH to see what they are selling for and then I put them up for a couple silver or gold (depending on price) less than what the lowest is.  If they don't sell after a few nights - I usually list everything before logging - then I just vendor them or see if an enchanter needs them.

delete their account. they also likely can determine the account of the dev(s) who wrote the original addon as well.

This is fine for general play before raiding, this would be fine for offtanking as well, but as a MT Defiance will be mandatory.
---
&gt; To best prepare, please note that a character cannot move if the character:
---
&gt; is a guild leader.
---
&gt; has active auction listings or bids.
---
&gt; has mail.
---
Double check that.

Yeah that's true actually; I might do this instead.
---
with proper min/maxing on gear, raid comp, class knowledge, and positioning... you can kill rag with a group of majority non-60's. theres a lot of mini things you can do to help out. and we didnt have 10-12 players. we had 10-12 60s, a few 59s, about 10 58's, about 10 57's, 2 56s, and a 55. just because you arent 60 doesnt mean you cant contribute
---
The axe feels better, even as a human. It's slower, so you get the bigger hits, plus you get the bonus crit from the weapon spec. Also, as a warrior, it's unlikely you will be grinding mobs higher than your level, so the human racial is somewhat devalued. I think if the speed on the sword was the same as the axe, I would probably take it over the axe, but unfortunately it is much faster. All in all, it's probably not a huge difference either way.
---
This is an item for a "Twink". A twink is a character that a player will stop leveling at a particular level and get the best gear possible for that level to dominate a PvP bracket. There are brackets for PvP battlegrounds (releasing phase 3) that range from 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-60.
---
These boots are Best in Slot (BiS) for a rogue / druid / hunter "twinking" at level 19. The reason you should hold onto items like this is no one has any money to spend on their main / mount / crafting professions, let alone a powerful twink item. In a month or 2 when people have more gold, these boots will skyrocket in price because they're literally the best in slot boots for a level 19 twink and they're a rare world drop.
---
One hell of a sap
---
Last night on Thunderfury we got a raid team of maybe 15 people together and started to take over hillsbrad, most fun I've ever had in pvp.
---
Then a lvl 45+ (skulled to everyone there) showed up, made it kinda boring after that. But we found out we could lure the guards from southshore up to tarren mill to kill them. as long as you have some way to kite them/slow them. Not sure on their spawn rate but you could probably invade doing that method
---
I think it's very unlikely we get 2 mainly due to cost.  They can just repurpose old content for classic, but to develop all new content would require a whole team and all sorts of overhead. Really not likely, especially while linked the single subscription fee for both classic and retail
---
No Change.
---
Plus, it likely isn't possible with out a total rewrite. Combat Log picks up everything with in a 'max casting distance' (think that's 30yds in Classic and 40yds in Retail).
---
Again. People have PVPed as Warrior, Mages, Priest, Shaman, Paladin, Monk, and Death Knight without the use of 'stealth on demand' (I know mages eventually get 'stealth'). Stealthers can deal with it; we do.
---
It does not. :)
---
On you tube look up videos For cats.
---
I put it on a second monitor for our young one.
---
No layering does not need to be in the game.
---
You're only seeing it in LFG? I'm getting whispers for that shit.
---
That’s leeway and been talked about a lot
---
I recommend u get rank 4 in pvp it will also give a 10% discount, so with exalted and rank 4 in pvp you should be able to get it for 800g total.
---
If they wanted to rollback they'd have to re-launch Classic as layer hopping has been abused since day one.
---
Haha nah, it's actually not super common but if you use the AH a lot, it's definitely a big time saver.
---
Why is that a problem?
---
Warlocks IMO bring more to the table. When you can summon people to where you are, especially remote instances, that is more valuable than a stack of free water or a teleport to main cities. Both are useful but pre meeting stone summons warlocks are OP.
---
Yes and no. Technologically they can since that’s what they do on retail. However they want certain events that cross realm barriers like Rexxars patrol to be seamless between layers so they had to make the layers server wide to achieve that.
---
No one is supposed to look like a Gnome, they're a mistake, a terrible mistake...
---
Lol.  The reaction is visceral..
---
Clutch.
---
yes and yes
---
World first?
---
I'm playing Warrior and my friend is a Priest, which professions we should get to complete each other? I was thinking I should run skinning+leatherwork and he herbalism+mining, what do you guys think?
---
Signed.
---
The CC that breaks on damage lasts 15-20 secs usually. Sap, Blind, Poly, Cyclone etc.
---
Am I at normal lvl speed?
---
Is he guild leader? AH listings?
---
Because of the pedophilic smile.
---
Fuck that, people should be punished for being lazy.
---
Get out!
---
Have transfers started? I know they announced them. But I haven’t seen an announcement of them going live
---
No changes
---
Welcome to classic
---
Lock unique quirks: unique mount, infernal, doomguard roulette, summoning portal.  
---
Mage unique quirks: blink, portals.
---
Mage is more glass cannon fun. Lock has more outside of combat fun.
---
So im choosing warlock because there is more to the class to keep me entertained.
---
Alliance only...
---
Hate to correct you, but you misspelled Gehennas. You’re welcome!
---
Why would it be difficult? The game client knows how far away mobs and players are. It has to, or it couldn't render them!
---
There are already plenty of small changes like that anyways. The combat log in particular is totally different, particularly in implementation, from vanilla. In vanilla the only thing mods had was the raw text and damage meters had to literally parse all the text messages back into data.
---
Is it at all possible to actually play this game without dedicating significant chunks of time?
---
It's not high school any more, not likely that I could play for more than maybe an hour and a half at a time. 
---
Seems like leveling could be fine over the long haul but would I be screwed out of 5 mans? Raiding out of the question but I don't care about that anyway. Would probably play pvp endgame.
---
I'd rather see an orc than some filthy Alliance scum. ;P
---
Well, you do need a lot of it, however.  Every warrior wants their arcanite ripper ;)
---
Lmao but non of those things are true. Actually far from a nerd like that majority of freaks that play this game. That’s why I like camping you. Sorry you can handle getting killed in a video game.
---
That’s when you just leave the loot window open and hope they can feel your death stare.
---
kinda works both ways tho, dunnit
---
If you can find the recipe on the AH for those lv 20ish green quality daggers that add +Agi, those will usually sell like hotcakes. Mine up some quick copper, buy a few swiftness potions and make a few of those for continuous profit. Just don't flood the market ;)
---
If you're a Warrior (or I suppose Pally) it can be rewarding to make your gear, and you're somewhat more gear dependent anyway. For anyone else I wouldn't recommend.
---
That should be fine. I believe it's  when you get to over 70, that's when it could be problematic...
---
Embraacee the shadows
---
Not really, it needed 15-20 competent people with okay maybe-ish gear and the rest were warm bodies.
---
It was easy, although it's easier now that we're starting in 1.12.
---
What is this? A proper screen shot? Needs more phone.
---
I totally agree! It would be tough to track it, in the Sonydigital reaction clip you can see his leveling time to get an idea of when the guild was formed. 
---
Also, damn a 15 minute mark is pretty freaking good considering you got to get a group in the game to get the silver and charter sigs and then run to TB with out getting killed. My hats off to that guild for sure!
---
For a desktop? Slightly concerning. For a laptop? You're fine.
---
FOR THE HORDE!!!
---
That would be considered account sharing which is a bannable offence i believe.
---
Holy shit that is cool.  
---
Keyboard turners eat your heart out!
---
STV near the venture company goblins 1st thought. They are humanoids and a pretty good size area. STV is full of Alliance tho
---
Nah, it was pretty funny. Mellow down. Thanks
---
I can endlessly sprint in circles around my enemy who is trying to hit me while my pet rips them limb from limb
---
It’s fantastic, layering is bad but doesn’t hinder the game play, just creates a lot of exploits.
---
Needs to go away but is ok for now. 
---
It’s different than Private servers , especially with node, pool and mob respons, much less material out there to gather. PS had that way over tuned.
---
They knew this would happen and figured it was acceptable.
---
If you didn't have layers it would be impossible to level or herb/mine on these servers.
---
It does, and I also res everybody I see dead on the ground. Hoping someone will remember my name and it'll benefit me.
---
Did you even read my post, I explained that once you have a big enough sell wall you don't even need to farm the leather anymore because you set the price. Don't know why I'm even bothering explaining this it's beyond your grasp apparently.
---
That explains why I see literally every Alliance lock running around with it.
---
Meanwhile I'm fine rocking the Whitemane Chapeau.
---
Use something like team viewer instead, this way your IP doesnt change and your account stays logged in on your PC and your friend wont have to log out.
---
More than likely your account will be locked the first time you try this. S better option is to install chrome remote desktop/any other remote desktop to your PC and phone. Leave PC running and put yourself in queue from your phone.
---
If you’re a skinner just go kill some beasts.  If not go kill humanoids.  It’s monotonous but it’s decent money which you’re going to desperately need at 40.
---
Just download and use teamviewer. You don’t want to get your account locked out
---
Yep, still running to corpse as we speak lol
---
My Druid looks like "I'm glad I have animal forms".
---
Layering is the same as sharding except it is server wide.
---
These products are perfectly fine as is. Pretty ridiculous to say that everyone using them doesn't have a brain.
---
Why should we make him play bfa?
---
Enhancement is a good leveling spec for Shamans.
---
i disagree that it's overblown, and whirlwind axe is going to blow through any blue weapons you get for fury, and when white damage is most of your dps, yes 20-30% miss chance matters.
---
Oh shit I've been looking for something like that. IDK why but I love shit like that, downloading it when I get home from work, TY!
---
Being level 25 doesn't feel so bad now, damn job...
---
I have the same exact case for my pc seems like you removed the dust grabber and front plate tho

" You're disappointing. "
---
This post is disappointing.
---
"At the end of the day, Who cares he's just one person."
---
Love it when people write this. Why the fuck did you write this post then? 
---
You obviously do care.
---
Im on Stonespine too and Blizzard has to stop influx of horde players on these servers. They should inmplement system that only allows you to create alliance on that server, if ratio is like 60% to 40%. New horde players on said server should only be able to join if they get reccomended by player on horde side. Blizzard must do something to keep servers in balance. Cuz what we do is picking in a dark when we chose a server, they must ensure we get at least 60% to 40% at all times. They should have implemented this right away. Not sure if they only want those 25$ from server transfer.
---
I have never encountered this issue on NA servers. I agree that the server name showing up is annoying, but it hasn't resulted in any errors.
---
Because if their goal is to get down to 1 layer by p2, it would be extremely foolish to let so many people onto a realm at the same time that it requires 25 layers to function properly. That would be like expecting that 96% of players are going to quit before the end of the phase 1. Which would be a completely ridiculous thing to plan around. You can look at nostalrius server pop over time as a reference point; even accounting for retail tourists and other realities of the situation it just wouldn't make sense to draw that conclusion.
---
What exactly is layering?
---
I did take zep to org, then hoofed it i didn't know about that other one, which thank you for informing me, but so glad i didn't know last night, the traveling there, the landscapes, the vista's, the discoveries, hitting the cross roads, getting chased by mobs much higher than i was almost dying along the way, then seeing TB coming on the horizon...
---
I would have missed out on that wonderful prelude to the main event, just made it feel so worth it to finally arrive.
---
I mean... soliciting explicit material from anyone underage is considered pedophilia. That’s just how that works.
---
110% account sharing.  Don’t do it.
---
I have 300 cooking but now I'm broke
---
How do you do dungeons and stuff to get gear without dinging?
---
Why would there be any monopoly on this? Go farm it. Go sell it for however much you want. No one's stopping you.
---
Yeah my shaman is a legit off tank when I inevitably rip aggro at the 25-30 range at least.
---
I’m not really in on this whole layering destroying economy thing. 
---
BUT 
---
during the recession when gas prices were crashing, my dad worked at Caterpillar, he got laid off for a year because one of Caterpillars biggest markets is oil, mainly fracking. But fracking is expensive, so when oil when below let’s just say 50 dollars a barrel, it was no longer worth it to frack and they stopped. Now in that time they tried to improve it to make it cheaper and did, but it still slowed down certain businesses. 
---
So during that recession where it was like dannggg gas is 1.50 a gallon, it also is like sheesh this is good but also bad. 
---
I guess if anything maybe this will make arcanite reapers cheaper? Then more warriors will have them, then we’ll be ruled by a tyranny of OP warriors.
---
A full clear of MC for people who know what they're doing is about 3 hours.

True but there is still an alliance FP in the north of STM
---
Twitch desktop app.
---
Get the Leatrix addon, it has an option for sit/dismount and it works perfect. First keypress dismounts or stands, second uses the ability.
---
Heroic strike can't possibly do less damage than auto-attack, because it does auto-attack damage plus some extra. If you got a low damage roll, it'd have been worse without HS.
---
You're bound to be better off on the whole having not rushed to 60 and rush cleared MC.

This might not be the right topic but, I settled with a horde Druid, and really enjoy how weird of a class it is. I love being very self sufficient and if I die its prob my fault as there must have been a way to play the fight better. My only gripe is i cant see my gear or I guess also don't really care too much about getting gear. I Love tanking and why I chose druid. Any other druids feel the same way? Also its weird that some of our DiS items and weapons are not even max lvl(i refuse to farm pummelers) are there other weps to look forward too??
---
Also if the DPS pulls you throw a HoT on them before you go back to bearform and then free rage generation you get all the aggro you want...
---
For context it was a big group of hordes that ended up helping me kill the elemental, since no alliance wanted to help me, was glorious 
---
Shoutout to Snupyz, Stabétha and Thowra
---
Same here I've just been unsatisfied with my choice at level 12 and reroll.
---
Mostly because I wanted to be mr original by picking Druid and enhancement Shaman but figured out pretty quick that Druid is like a dollar store Warrior in terms of tanking and I'm basically playing a level 1 warrior at level 10 and Shaman just didnt click with me.

Anything less than an extreme crack down won't fix the abuse, you're being naive.

Waiting for the inevitable ban for exploiting.
---
It's both fun and fast. They have a very rewarding playstyle, and there's tons of little minmaxing things you can do, much more so than other classes during leveling, where you generally wanna have a stable rotation.
---
I think he means taking Anachronos to Orgrimmar.

Don't have pummel until 38 and warstomp is a 2min CD so I'm at a loss at the moment.

This is a super recent repost

Some of us cried and cried for the game to rush through it and have fun the way we wanted. Why do you care people don't want to play the game how you want to?
---
If you have retail downloaded, there’s a window to switch the dL files to the classic folder.  If you don’t, it’s auto classic
---
Will be permabanned. There's no suspension if they know you are doing something like this, the punishment is only perma ban
---
Oh wow he actually posted the screenshot.
---
Layers is used for overpopulation (Classic) and sharding is used to populate a single instance from different realms (retail).
---
Correct me if I’m wrong though.
---
Look at the minimap of the bank in [classic](https://youtu.be/FXMTay03e1w?t=1192) vs the minimap in the pic you posted. Something seem off in the pic you posted?

Are you on a PvP server? I personally don’t like Icy Veins guide.

Would be nice if you could convince the group to let you get the killing blow so you can take that bonus more often!

Does it keep your downtime near 0 when soloing?

How has it fucked the economy?
---
I use a macro just like this (or very similar to it, @work right now so can't check unfortunately) and it works just fine. Hit once, Cheetah, hit again, Hawk, vice-versa.
---
I'll try updating this post when I get off work, but I'm 99% positive the macro is as I typed above.
---
I think I understand what you mean. Similiar to the gun control arguement that guns aren't the problem, its people using them. Same thing on the opoid crisis. It's not the drug it's the people abusing them. I see ur point, technically yeah you're right that the problem. However you're sidestepping the point with semantics.
---
The price will drop if theres competition between the sellers.
---
Unless you’re tanking, but that’s it’s own cave of kobolds.
---
Yeah. That's my problem with this. Even then, if I'm ganked by a higher level, I don't mind. I've been pvping for so long that I win most of the match ups unless they are 10+ levels higher. It's the constant barrage of 10+ horde just steam rolling that I have a problem with.... You die, ok thats fine, then u get camped 5 times, not too bad, its a pvp server. Then once ur done getting camped you go to quest, immediately get stunned by a rogue and then a random hunter shits on you while he has you stunned. Rinse repeat, literally non stop until you gtfo of there and go dungeon or stick to ally zones.
---
I don't believe Hydras are able to be tamed in Classic. Just bats, bears, boars, carrion birds, cats, crabs, Crocs, gorillas, hyenas, owls, raptors, scorpids, spiders, striders, turtles, wind serpents, and wolves.

Take away all server firsts from those doing it.

whenever i have the rage should i be using heroic strike or slam?

Just got to hack the mainframe.  I'm almost through their firewalls. **furiously types** I'm in!  Better be quick before I'm detected.  Just going to download this RAM and upload to the supercomputer neural network...
---
Nice. I'm level 25 and have 5 gold.
---
Actually in vanilla it's 10% less for honoured and that it is. the 15% revered and 20% exalted came in in TBC or WotLK can't remember, but definitely not classic
---
*Use the print screen button ffs!*
---
Remember when people used Fraps to do video capture?
---
Ya but they are the Swiss Army Knife of classes. They’re like Staples; ya we’ve got that. Need stealth? Check. Hots? Dots? You bet. Melee dps?Mmhm. Ranged dps? You guessed it. No tank? No problem. Admittedly, I get that endgame content calls for optimization over versatility, but Classic is all about the journey not the destination for me. Idk. My 2cents.
---
GANgKilling was a solo sport for rogues?  Interesting.  I made a thread about this and have mostly given up my crusade to set the new gen right on this terminology
---
Don't feel bad, apparently hundreds/thousands of other people did too. This is just fearmongering.
---
WHOOSH
---
If your holy, you'll stop looking at Armor values once your 60.  Half the time you end up wearing cloth anyhow.  
---
For solo ret leveling your best sticking to mail/plate.  I'm not aware of the armor values differing much between the same type of pieces with different 'of the' though.
---
Well look at Mr 1% over here.
---
&gt; ruin classic
---
Yea, because being a hyperbolic drama queen is better
---
gratz on being the 1000th person to post this!
---
An exploit (known as "exploitive activity" by Blizzard) is a method of playing the game in a way not intended by the game developers to gain an advantage over other players.
---
With layering you see whatever the fraction of people you should see, so it feels even more empty
---
Returning items for free is OP. I will definitely be doing this.
---
This is an exploit. Plan and simple. People are using a mechanic that is not intended to be used in this manner. Hopefully Blizzard starts dropping the ban hammer hard on these people. Just my opinion though. 
---
For reference: Anyone remember back in good ol' Vanilla where you could be banned for standing on the spikes in ZG for the Raptor boss? I do cause a few of my guild mates got banned while running a Pug ZG and doing that strat.
---
You spec fury or arms, she specs shadow, she can heal you and you both can slay mobs with speed and ease.
---
Ah of course, that makes sense. This more for pve use or pvp as well? I can't imagine vanilla pvp fights lasting long enough to completely drain your mana pool, locks and priests notwithstanding
---
Playing passively has only a minor effect on deaths. Never trust a rogue or hunter whether you are trying to live in harmony or not.
---
Now who’s arguing semantics?  Regardless, his opinion that people should be banned simply for using the system, is flawed.
---
Gz man!
---
You earn a lot more gold from grinding etc at higher levels.
---
Oh hey, this thread again.  Has 20 minutes passed already?
---
How much PvP do you think is even happening when their is no honor right now.
---
They’re both terrible people so they both should be changed.
---
&gt;Why him and not my toon.
---
Because people reported him, but not you. Blizz doesn't have the time or resources to individually look at everyone's name. It's driven by player reports.
---
Mining pays off
---
&gt; raid exp bug / exploit
---
This is not the main reason people are crushing records on /played time. A lot groups stayed as 5 man grinds and the fastest times to 60 were done solo by hunters and mages.
---
Layering probably had the largest impact since it freed up SO much space for people competing to be fast. I'm guessing there is some difference in xp gained because almost all the fast times are below 4 days played which is absurd.
---
I’m lvl 24 horde, I was questing in hillsbrad but now all the quests are too hard for me to solo. Where should I go now? Ashenvale or Stonetalon?
---
on shazz i would peak curve right now is around 26-30 atleast if you look at the people spamming groups.
---
I'll never understand getting bent outta shape cuz of something someone said. One way or another.
---
I'm sure he will affect the price of this item but I'm  pretty sure were talking about less than 5% overall. Which as I stated wont affect anyone really over time this will normalize and nothing of note will come of it for anyone but himself and the people he wants to share his gold with
---
It's a simple hash!
---
Add me I should be on level 22 UD mage  Brucey
---
Great to see more podcasts Josh!
---
When you raid any spec you are prioritizing your personal enjoyment above anyone else in your life. You don’t have to like it, but it is a fact that the vast majority of people view any spec as selfish
---
Heirlooms. And they came in WotLK.
---
Probably will happen. I just hope they don't migrate all of the Classic realms to it.
---
Let's be real, as Classic runs its course, realms are going to 'whither'. Might as well open up transfers and reserve those \[now totally\] empty realms for TBC, Wrath, Cata, MoP, WoD, Legion, and soon BFA. Players should have the ability to play the version of the game they fell in love with; regardless of what expansion that is.
---
This means keeping each version.
---
Dungeons are meant for 5 people. it used to be converting your party to a raid to allow more than that cut the exp significantly. not just by adding more people to split with but by imposing a penalty to exp gains while in a raid from non-raid content. For some reason, that wasnt in game during the first week so groups were forming raids to spam 5 man dungeons repeatedly with 10 people and gaining exp faster than should have been allowed. between that and using AoE/Cleave mechanics they were essentially abusing a bug where raid exp wasnt nerfed to level large groups very quickly. 
---
It has since been hotfixed with no word from Blizz about if there will be punishment for those who abused what was obviously a bug to not only cheat the race to 60(which in and of itself doesn't affect the vast majority of people), but in doing so potentially messing up the economy of the server by allowing them access to 60 content and drops faster than they would have been able to without the exploit(which could drastically affect many people). Historically using exploits to gain an advantage on loot has been punished but who knows how it will play out this time.
---
There is no Fullscreen only mode.
---
Is that all it takes to trigger you?
---
They're probably just trying to say hello.
---
Which poe boy does it?
---
I am in agreement actually...
---
I think you are actually winning by enjoying classic rather then rushing content
---
I own it and it's a hunk of trash.
---
Have you actually looked into that addon with your own eyes? I don’t think you ever have.
---
This might be an unpopular opinion, but I think blizzard should give paladins a hard taunt for tanking... maybe if they want to do voting/polling like OSRS. I mean warriors and Druids both have one, why can’t paladins?
---
So if you clear a big section of mobs, you can just get into another layer instantly where all the mobs are still alive, kill them, then just repeat?
---
Good! But I’m sorry, it’s better to not have enough servers than to have too many, from a financial point of view. And they know damn right “the players” will pay them anyway.
---
They’ll add and have exactly as many as they need
---
I plan to just raid in my daggers pvp spec.  I know going in that I wont be topping any charts and I was upfront with my guild and they are cool with it.
---
Sword spec. it’s easier to get good swords in the quests.
---
Is there any tool to compare mp5 vs spirit? trying to decide myself between 4spirit and 3 mp5.

I play on a PVE server so my list is players who stole my mining nodes.
---
Brilliant, thank you!
---
Grobbulos us horde rppvp server refuses to do world pvp because the honor system is not enabled yet. Our questing areas are dominated by alliance and all grinding spots have level 60 alliance protecting and farming them. Cant wait for transfers.
---
Combat swords is the best for leveling. You are basically a fury war in leather
---
Sorry, I misinterpreted your first post. I totally get it now. You get the same percentage of the current level regardless, but leveling up before resting will give more flat XP.

He should change to Billveg(not the full name) to match you.
---
I used to play on an L702x dell with temps pushing past 90 celsius with no staggering... You should be fine
---
Right? Cheap investments.
---
Now that I'm done penny pinching for the mount at 40, time to hoover up more stuff.
---
You're pulling 5% out of your ass. You have no way to know how many were mined were stacked. Could be 5%, could be more or less.
---
&gt; He wont affect the end game market at all
---
&gt; I'm sure he will affect the price of this item
---
Can't have it both ways.
---
How is sniping ruining the economy ???
---
Well on my server I see mostly SM / Gnomer / ZF
---
Deadmines is definitely not the bell curve
---
sword is more stable dps, dagger is more bursty.
---
both can work, depends on how well you like timing your stuns, and running behind a mob.
---
 A hash is the result of a deterministic process; if you feed your algorithm the same data, the resulting hash will be the same regardless of how many times you do it.
---
Realistically, youd have to build a "hash" in a clever way where you could tell if two hashes consist of mostly the same players and not necessarily a totally identical list of players, because of timing issues.
---
I don't see why it wouldn't be possible, on paper at least. Although you probably wouldnt be using a cryptographic hash and more of a "hash"-like string.
---

!!!I didn't even think of doing that... what a great idea. :D

Wow is back baby

Looking for the "I DoNt HaVe To WoRrY cAuSe I wAs SmArT aNd ChOsE pVe" comments.
---
1. It's in the quest text.  You have to read it.
---
2. PvP servers are more crowded than PvE servers.  You can find a server that isn't overloaded.
---
If you think druids can't tank raids, you've been missing out.
---
Is it too late to catch up? I’ve got a level 20 mage and a level 15 hunter feels like I’m miles behind everyone else
---
1. Either read the quest text or get the addon questie
---
2. Playing on gandling EU and the most I’ve had is a 15 min queue don’t know about other servers
---
Go down holy far enough to get Consecration, then start going down the prot tree till you get Holy Shield.
---
T1 Holy: more int
---
T2 holy: imp SoR (the no push-back is better if you're going to be healing yourself but useless if you're just tanking with a dedicated healer).
---
T3 holy: Consecration and done.
---
T1 prot: Shield one.  Not dev aura, you won't use it.  You use ret aura to tank.
---
T2 prot: Improved BoP for sure, then the weapon one if you need threat or the armor if you want more survivability.  Threat/damage probably more important.
---
T3 port: Kings (that's your blessing now), imp RF, redoubt in that order.
---
Downscaling to 480p and then back up to 1080.
---
I've had a decent time with just Sundering and Heroic Striking mobs. 
---
Let's say we pull three mobs. I'll pop Blood Rage, Sunder the first mob, switch to another and Sunder that (with Blood Rage active, you should be able to get these first two Sunders off fast) and then repeat a final time on the third mob. 
---
I pretty much just rotate this and toss in Heroic Strikes after to get some damage in and maintain threat. Personally, I really only use Thunderclap on groups bigger than 3-4. 
---
Again, this is just what I have had a good time doing. Of course, if some Rogue or Mage is going off, there isn't much to do but just keep that taunt off CD and ready.
---
&gt; The next three would be considered spyware, something blizzard doesn't do.
---
Are you sure about that?
---
It's pretty common practice for programs to gather info about your machine nowadays. I've had some programs go as far as checking Outlook/Thunderbird/etc. to determine identity. I was confused how a company found out I pirated their software until they straight up told me they parsed my Outlook account.
---
Eh let the pet die fuck em
---
Has any group kited multiple ones before to one location?
---
Twinks back then couldn’t lock exp. You didn’t exp in battlegrounds either though so it worked.
---
Kurinaxx Horde here. I would love to join. As for retention, try guild events and encourage people to pump each other’s professions. Give guild rewards for recognition of such an act?
---
Getting HS out and using ww feels wrong to me so I'll do the math.
---
With improved HS at lvl 30 ( when you get ww ) with a main hand that does let's say 100 damages avg you get thses numbers :
---
HS is rank 5 so + 58 damages.
---
Average rage generated by your mainhand : 
---
Rage formula is : Rage = (7,5 x damage) / Conversion
---
Conversion 0,0091107836 x level² + (3,225598133 x level) + 4,2652911
---
So for level 36 conversion = 132,1943994336
---
Average rage generated by the MH = ( 7,5 x 100 ) /  132,1943994336 = 5,6734627429 let's say 6
---
100+58 = 158 damage for a cost of 12 + 6 ( avg rage generated ) so 18 . It's 8.7 damages per rage.
---
Ww does your weapon's damage for 25 rage so 100/25, easy, 4 damages per rage. That's less efficient.
---
Obviously on 1v4 situation it's different but you don't do 1v4 as a warrior while leveling...
---
So I stand correct.
---
Save taunt for when an enemy goes aggro on someone else. It does nothing if you already have the enemy's attention
---
All of those are channeled, which I did mention I didn't know of the top of my head, so thank you!
---
Not totally sure on the exact plan, didn't really play wow till cata so im gonna wing it and try out a few talent builds. Not too worried about being meta, I think priest plays really well and open to different playstyles. I will doing world pvp mostly so im thinking a healthy blend of disc/shadow more heavy on disc if it plays well.
---
All the melee look like 4 year olds playing soccer...
---
Yo, are y'all on the Westfall server? I recognize that guild name
---
 I used to do this too when I played wow as a teenager and it was so creepy with some monsters, but I did it anyway!
---
I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.
---
Tanks. Thanks.
---
mules is an older term.... used to use this term in the Diablo 2 days
---
I ran into 50+ people I recognise daily from levels 1-45, and often accidentally form groups with people I've grouped with before. Some have joined my guild!
---
A statue of our lord and savior in the background. Brilliant.
---
in a level or two there is also desolace and shimmering flats
---
But the stuff I mine is free... /s
---
Well when u have know how, and it's trivial for you...
---
For the sweet bloodsail buccaneer hat
---
If you stack spiri, fight mobs slightly less than your level and keep your gear up to date it’s not that bad. 
---
Alchemy also helps a lot.
---
Can you use like an ounce of critical thinking please? A) Layering by definition cannot be for a specific level range or zone, that would be *sharding* and is way more detrimental to the experience and would have way more backlash/abuse than the current system. B) There is 0 fucking way there are 25 layers on any server currently, like come on how do you even think for a second that's true? C) THEY. ARE. GETTING. RID. OF. LAYERING. *BEFORE*. PHASE. TWO.
---
The thing is, there just isn’t that many layers for it to make that much a difference. 
---
An oversupply is driving prices down and allowing players with less money to buy and progress faster. The economic affects of layering really isn’t that bad for servers that are this young. 
---
We are expecting a layer cooldown timers sooner rather than later. It’s a great time to buy and hold items as once the layer cooldown comes into effect, prices will increase and your buying power will decrease.
---
Really great colour pallette, working with oranges and those murky red-greens is tough. Very good choice on the darker, cooler foreground elements too.
---
Very torn on class choice.  I've always wanted to play a hunter or a warlock.  I played in TBC and Cata, warrior and DK.  I've been wanting to try a kiting class. 
---
I was torn between warlock and hunter.  I chose hunter bc my friend went warlock.  But I'm not sure I'm into it.  Lvl 34 now.  Ammo and pet food/skills is a pain in the ass.  I was also under the assumption hunters were great at pvp, but now I'm hearing they lose to most classes 1v1.  And they have a lot of bugs/issues with classic right now.  Leeway, auto shot delay, feign death not working, trap bugs.
---
So I've been considering rerolling to warlock.   Also doesn't hurt they supposedly win every pvp matchup 1v1 except rogue.  Downside, leveling again.
---
Any thoughts?
---
Because orange man bad
---
I kind of miss AoE looting...
---
This hurts the group more than helps, let the tank do his job and stick to your role.
---
When can we get Snufflenoses as a pet? Nobody does the quest so imagine all the poor Snufflenoses stuck in cages, 5 of them shoved into one small crate..
---
Is this game easy for new players? Can you do most of the games content without having to be super optimal 24/7? 
---
I'd love to play but i really don't feel like getting yelled at during my free time because i'm learning or not playing how/what someone else wants me to.
---
Would joining an RP server/community be a good idea to avoid these kinds of issues?
---
Have you looked at the AH? There are people selling mats for the price that they could just vendor them at.
---
Blizzard gave a grace period of one day so those transferring will have a higher chance to find their names on the new realms before everyone else can create chars.
---
Of course if two or more people transferring try to get the same name, the first one doing it will get it, so it's a good idea to transfer as soon as possible if that is what you intend to do.
---
They are far from optimal bordering on not viable
---
You can do this. Use seal/judge of light. 3-6 mobs should be ok to do it with. I wouldn't start until you're level 40-45+. Also I haven't tested, but reckoning should be easier to force stacks with more mobs hurting you. If that is the case, it makes farming more mobs easier.
---
Well there’s no substance in your comment which indicates how it might be different, just empty rhetoric that doesn’t mean anything.
---
I took this week off, and I'm still only 40.  Doing 4-5 hrs per lvl the last few, its hard when lots of spots are overpopulated.
---
Apparently you haven't seen blizzard mages abusing it. Because it makes a difference for them
---
He's literally just pissed that the free market exists, and that he can't sell his goods for more than they're actually worth anymore.
---
I think blizz killed add-ons like that a long time ago. Since we're not using the vanilla add-on API I don't think it can return.
---
This is the right answer, Level 28 and have over 70g from tailoring, and this is after buying all my spells &amp; duo partners spells, maxing both our professions, paying for guild tabard and buying whatever blues off the AH that we need/wand.  
---
Professions are super good gold making methods currently, just be smart with your gold!
---
The economy won't be ruined. The effects will hardly make a dent in the economy, even in the short-term. You're being hysterical.
---
Also, the other ideas would have much worse, real long term destructive effects. You're wrong on literally every point.
---
Paladin tanks are great in dungeons for AoE threat, but they fall off significantly and aren't as viable as warriors for raid tanking. If you're planning to tank raids, I would reroll.
---
Welcome to the vanilla experience.
---
Becuase they chose to exploit the bug
---
I second Chibi's response. I personally would do Wetlands and then swing over to STV. I personally am lvl 27 on my Human Warr and quested in Duskwood and am now over in Wetlands. Also don't be affraid to grind out a level or two on mobs. It helps and makes the transition to another questing area that much easier sometimes.
---
Thought you should know, I was running somewhere last night to get farm and past this alliance scum that was just questing. I was just going to pass by and leave I’m alone until I noticed they were a mage. I chased that little shit down just because of the convo we had... suck it mage. I’ll pass by anyone else. 
---
For all the pets that have been viciously attacked.
---
There's a good PR reason for not breaking that stuff when there's a valid use for it.
---
If Blizzard made C_FriendList protected, that would kill for example census addons, and none of the UI addons would be able to modify the friends list UI.
---
Clearly, they're also hunter weapons.
---
Beating Naxx in Classic is going to be like beating Naxx in WOTLK.
---
I usually dont wanna deal with constantly reposting auctions so I usually just see what the cheapest one is a undercut it by a tiny bit. Instant sales on my garbage
---
The apollo 11 lunar module could probably run wow classic. Youll be fine.
---
It can be different depending on your talents. 
---
But usually the rotation should be:
---
1. Attack with your minion while casting immolate
---
2. Corruption 
---
3. Curse of agony
---
4. Wand auto attack
---
40? No. Semi hardcores are in their 40s.
---
Healer aggro is just the worst.
---
Aesthetically ofc not, they’re not tribal like the core Horde on Kalimdor, but neither are the forsaken. Lore, and culturally, they fit in the Horde 100%. They’re outcasts, ruthless, without allies, and addicted to the sunwell. The Horde fits them perfectly.
---
My list is just like yours. Got spawn camped by a hunter 10 levels above and the graveyard run was really long.
---
are u leveling resto??? Every1 says i should do ench and keep like a staff for healing 5 mans. I think my dps is starting to lack for quests. How are u handling levels? Thanks :)
---
Pally tanks have good aoe threat. They just need a taunt. Its one of those things i really think blizzard should change and make classic more of a classic+ thing.
---
But for end game currently you will never tank on a pally.  No group will take you.  Its sad but the truth.
---
I’ll be working on this on 7 lvl s time I hope I find nice ppl like this
---
Bro...just abandon the incendrites quest. My friend and I found 2 the entire time we slew ALL of those harpies required.
---
Which it isn't, so crisis averted.
---
Took a loan in WoW... Beautiful.
---
A low pop realm with layers is larger than a full realm back in vanilla.  Think of the queues once layering is removed and then reconsider the decision to decline this transfer.
---
Thanks boys, continuing the grind when I get home from work
---
The dude who sung this is the guy that keeps popping up for peoples action bars that everyone posted about.
---
Priest is a good pick, but hard to level solo. You're just too squishy. Warrior is a pretty good option, tanks are always in demand and the dps specs can hold their own for solo content. Alternatively, paladin and shaman are both good options depending on the faction you choose. Druid is by far the most versatile class though, you want ranged dps play balance, want melee dps play feral, want tank also feral, want heals go restoration.
---
Monkeynews has always streamed devilsaur leather farming, so, yes.. Yes I do.
---
BadBoy can block text based on rules, not just spam as defined by the addon. Could do that, to hide all those messages.
---
Both
---
Sure if it's actually racist, which that wasn't.
---
I was dead set on Hunter/Lock for causal easy leveling until I decided to switch to Priest last minute (which is actually an insanely easy experience as well compared to what you’d think).
---
You’ll enjoy both, and both do great in wpvp without a ton of gear
---
Just that the person above mentioned that people who xfer can create characters, so some people may act quickly haha. We'll hope for the best! Thank you all so much!
---
SgtWaffleSound isn't alone in his sentiment, and it's unfortunate. There are ways to earn "purplez" in WoW that don't require sacrificing one's life for it (which, by the way, wouldn't be cause for being "disappointed in yourself").  
---
Once most of the raids have become as second nature as Deadmines, those of us who couldn't afford to push our lives aside for a computer game will begin to participate.
---
i am enjoying classic but it really leaves a bad taste in my mouth knowing people are abusing layers and so many people abused the raid dungeons for xp.
---
Thx.
---
You mean drain soul? And isn't that kind of macro only applicable when you take Improved Drain Soul? Because otherwise, you'd only be draining soul if you want a soul shard.
---
Byeeeee
---
Haha no, I've never tried. But I just wanted to add a bit of flair to the story by how I wrote it. And the yelling out of frustration so others would know my anger haha
---
Please help I'm not seeing any option to change to wasd in any of the controller settings. :(
---
Ok cool
---
She didn’t in wrath either did she?
---
There are a whole bunch of layers and they are being abused right now with great success.
---
Look up the thread at the top of the sub about the add-on making it possible.
---
Can't tell if serious or not.
---
Of course, that's like asking about ganking
---
You're an ignorant piece of shit and classic players will weed your greedy ass out. Bet on it dumbass.
---
This may not be advisable in your current state (not a doctor, etc.) but I always take a half dose of Zzquil (diphenhydramine) to reset my sleep schedule when I get it messed up.
---
You might want to at least grab skinning and mining/herbalism.
---
That combo is a pretty passive moneymaker
---
The people abusing layering to systematically destroy the economy of the game I waited 15 years for.
---
No no, you are the outsider that was brought to our world. You nasty green thugs.
---
Tldr
---
They locked/hid it clearly because it was a completely pointless thread when there was already multiple substantive threads preceding it. It should've been a comment in the original thread.
---
Make a very small cool-down for the first switch, and keep doubling/tripling it's time each time you switch. Then the time go back to normal after a certain amount of time with some decay formula, let's say the system forget one of your switches every 6 hours. There is no legitimate reason to switch layer constantly in the same play session unless your are deliberately abusing the mechanics for one reason or another.
---
Okay mate don't let the door hit you on the way out.
---
This is big brain 4D chess right here.
---
Use the twitch/curse desktop app to download auctioneer and make sure you select classic wow in the game drop-down on the mod page. It should come already setup out of the box.
---
Not really the same.  The only devilsaur cartel that works is one that has cooperation with sister guilds on the opposing faction.  Which will get them banned.
---
\*laughs in pve realm\*
---
While everyone else is doing 30-somethinf DPS, I'm out here throwing up 42.
---
I would recommend a druid.  Don't believe the rumors you hear about druids being weak, they have many incredibly useful group tools as well as strong solo play.  I play a feral/resto hybrid spec and am able to heal, tank, or dps confidently in dungeons without ever respeccing. (As long as you keep different gear sets In you inventory.)
---
We're not your boss you don't need to give us notice that you're quitting
---
Swords are great, due to dungeon rewards. For horde: Wingblade -&gt; Outlaw Sabre -&gt; Sword of Omen -&gt; Thrashblade  
---
That will take you directly to the end game grind.
---
Google'd for why are gold sellers inviting me to channels to see what their angle was, this popped up, decided to read the thread to see the current state of things, saw your dumb post, had to make fun.
---
Making fun of tools is fun for me, so it's not a waste of my time - unlike farming for gold like some chump.
---
What did I do to deserve seeing this menace?!
---
Faster leveling as hunter but more fun goofing around as a mage
---
As a pally this is but a fairy tale
---
These people are too damn stupid to comprehend that.
---
Add it so you have to go back to Ironforge/Orgrimmar to change layer if you're on cooldown, easy enough.
---
"Need" is subjective, especially if he's not looking to hardcore push endgame content.
---
A benefit that carries over to Booty Bay as well. Hell I even set my hearth there for a hot minute. Fast access to both capitals on a short flight, local bank and all the quests.
---
I'm just going to go out on a limb here, but I don't think anybody cares that you're quitting or why.
---
It's a tradeoff for playing massive MULTIPLAYER game.
---
You obviously had eyes on him as you're describing his behavior and saw him run past.  Sounds like you had plenty of time to make the conscious decision to move out of the way.
---
Im pretty sure this is Defias Brotherhood q.
---
If you're not already working on your Darnassus rep, it's gonna take a while to get the kitty.
---
He won't even talk to me so I can't even get his side of the story if I wanted to. I'm not sure how his side of the story matters when he is getting everything he wants, yet is still upset
---
Hell yeah it's worth it. Should last you to your late 40's. I got mine at like lvl 32 and still rocking it at 41.
---
Can a holy paladin heal deadmines at lvl 19 with only one healing spell?
---
It took me 4 runs to get the set.
---
Hi!  Ret Paladin LFG
---
Had a freaking rouge bring in three extra mobs on my friend and I after we were about to barely survive a bad pull. 
---
I hate it when people don't care about others and just put them in bad situations.
---
Man, you seem to be severely misinformed. Maybe you should try researching the lore or playing warcraft
---
Yeah that’s when I lay down a trap and flare, stand on top of both. Traps are touchy and seem to have a pretty big working radius.
---
With that reaction I’m honestly surprised he hasn’t been an issue before now.
---
do mojo
---
I am worried about the future of the server too, that being said I personally will still be moving from Shazzrah to Dragonrealm. I believe paid transfers will be an option further down the line if you are willing to transfer back later.
---
\[ immersion | leveling | questing | lore | slow play 1hr/day \]

Warlock: human vs. orc?  
---
Years ago I played an orc shaman on vanilla + I had a few alts. I always played for the Horde. Now I want to play a warlock, but I can't decide on the race...  
---
On one hand, I'm somehow more keen to choose an orc (nostalgia? + orc warlock seem to me more suitable lore-wise). However, I'm afraid that "knowing it all" (your faction, quests etc.) may spoil the Classic experience.  
---
On the other hand, playing human would allow me to explore the other faction (new quests, locations, storyline etc.), so it may bring back the "freshness" of wow to me. However, the human race doesn't seem to suit the image of warlock as good as the race of orcs.  
---
Any advice?
---
What add-ons?
---
I think you're the one that whooshed. That was a Simpson's reference they made.
---
I thought racism apologists and the general Gamer Gate alt-right crew were all about things being in context...
---
Wands OP OP  
---
Get that 5 second mana going and never stop to cast unless you're in distress or REALLY want to SW:P a mob.
---
The patience of a saint lol.
---
I have no idea what you're saying here. I'm saying play the game how you want to and don't worry about what other people are doing
---
Damn horde need to stay out of sacred night elf land and stop chopping down the trees
---
If people don't want to play 'that' expansion, they'll leave anyways. How is that any different?
---
*My guildmates really like Wrath; I don't. Blizzard migrates from TBC to Wrath and I quit.*
---
vs
---
*My guildmates really like Wrath; I don't. Blizzard migrates one realm to Wrath, but keeps one of them TBC. I stay on the TBC one, and my guildmates leave for Wrath.*
---
But it’s split 10 ways instead of 5. You got less exp per kill but you could kill faster. It wasn’t nearly as impactful as people claim.
---
Ya a guildie of mine was looking for 2hrs last night constantly layer hoping and found 1
---
IMO, fuck multiboxing and fuck greedy Blizzard who allow this P2W tool.
---
I have also noticed that leveling feels much easier, for sure, as well as low level combat.
---
Could be because I, too, am used to pserver tuning. 
---
You're blowing this way out of proportion though. Game's fun as fuck. Get over yourself.
---
No matter what spec you wanna go. For leveling you need to at minimum max out spirit tap and wands. Absolutely max those 2 out.
---
Spanish? Teremus el Devourer. Original :D
---
Grobbulus
---
Did I?
---
You’ll figure something out. It’s not the end of the world
---
Why did you roll on a PvP server to begin with then, there is never going to be an even amount of players from both factions on a server.
---
You must have in game chat turned off.
---
Dude if this works, you're a legend, thank you.
---
Does seem like the game is easier.
---
I can't tell if by design or if I am just misremembering.
---
You CAN set up a schedule for the PC to go to sleep/wake up from sleep. But thats a lot of effort learning how to do that.
---
Truth be told. A lot of people have their friends log in for them. Yes its TECHNICALLY bannable, but no one actually gives a fuck.
---
Its more about someone logging in from a separate computer, doing stuff, logging out, and then you log in from your PC, do stuff, log out, and repeat.
---
Link to addon?
---
As a person who lvl'd rogue in Vanllia till 47 then switched over to a Hunter. ( We Seem to have done the opposites of each other, LuL ) I gimped myself leveling daggers. Swords definitely have the advantage leveling. Plus that change at a extra swing w/a sword is Cray-gasm.
---
Not my post, but yes that's the gist of it. You get more flat xp at a higher level.
---
I can see this sub is slowly turning into an art sub just like /r/WoW is 
---
/sigh
---
Word! One of the guides I read said don't bother getting it but im in no rush and I like gear so im gonna get it. Its part of a warlock quest chain correct?
---
Hunter: Easy to level, fun to play, no worries about glancing blows with ranged weapons (makes it easier to kill higher level mobs). However you have one less bag due to arrows, so inventory space is a premium (making gather professions extra stressful on bag-space management). Also have to maintain/train pets with new skills and abilities/keep happy with food (not a big issue at higher loyalty levels). Also bad rep due to large amount of 'huntards'.
---
Mage: Also fun to play, never have to worry about food/water, AoE grinding as Frost is an option for fast leveling, great at open world PvP/survival in general as Frost, option for huge damage/insta kills (PoM/Pyro aka 3 min mage), in demand for the new meta of dungeon spellcleave levelling. Free ports to major cities makes for master travelling. On the otherside, you'll be hounded for water/ports all the time, pretty much forced into Frost spec for current endgame/MC (spamming frostbolt/wanding). Resists suck, so fighting higher level mobs can be a real PITA (until hit gear/elemental precision). You're also pretty squishy as a clothie, but overall Mage is pretty much top tier damage/OP class all through Vanilla.
---
Doesn’t it have the alliance logo on it? Hardly a screw up.
---
How long did you fish to get this many. I usually get ~2 for an average STV 'route'
---
these "hur dur you posted so you must care" posts always crack me up.  explain how saying you dont care means you care.  if i make post saying i hate onions does that mean i really like onions as well?  maybe they dont care about the subject so they wanna let peopel know so maybe they might post somethig more interesting next time?  nah that cant be it.  they must be losing sleep over it and having anxiety attacks over shit posts.
---
Level 40?! What is it like playing on a server other than Herod? I spend my play time sitting in a queue because my WoW friends are complete idiots, so I'm level 16.
---
i did SM grinding 33-41, decked out in gear and didn't have to deal with getting ganked
---
library 33-37
---
armory 37-39
---
cath 39-41
---
Almost to 17 but leveling as a warrior and it's slooooww.  I miss my hunter.
---
Laughed so hard
---
This hits close to home. I tried to take a shortcut to the barrens from theramore by skipping the road and running west through the swamp. For anyone considering this, trust me, its not a shortcut.
---
This game is super easy or super hard, based on your goals, therefore it's all relative.
---
If your goal is to get to 60, it's super easy to get there eventually, but super hard to get their quickly.
---
If your goal is to have in a massive world, it's super easy to find things to do and places to explore.
---
If your goal is to get Tier 3 armor, it might be super hard.
---
Schools have started up as well
---
Funny, elites are wrecking me and I feel like I'm leveling slower than I remember from vanilla (playing the exact same class and spec, btw).  Crap greens never sold for anything even when people had money, and (basically) no one has money yet.  PvP was meritless back in the day, and the keychain didn't exist (and both are being added, like they were in vanilla).  Yes, layering is an imperfect solution, but 20,000+ players on at the same time on the same server would also not be consistent with vanilla.
---
But please, continue to go on about how "this version IS NOT RIGHT" and worth quitting after a week, despite having played for years on private servers.  Surely those weren't all perfect, were they?
---
Well you don't have to be a jerk about it!
---
/s kidding!
---
I tried the stop cast macros with drain soul but unfortunately I still have to spam it. The stop cast will cancel wanding but you'll have to wait for the GCD to finish before you can actually "activate" the spell. 
---
There may be some other trickery you can do but it seems like a game limitation.
---
Eh...hour isn't bad. Plus you miss out on the dungeon quests, which are something like x2 XP of a normal 'same level' quest out in the world.
---
Did zombie ony have one in cata?
---
That's about it. Applies to gathering nodes too.
---
Sure, just YouTube SteamLink guide, it's fairly straightforward.
---
There's a check box in the key binding options that toggles on "character specific key bindings"

Bye felicity.

People are gonna be twinking when bugs come in phase 3 plus the amount if gold in circulation will probably be higher.

So I’m currently level 35 on my paladin main. I enjoy it even if at times it is a little repetitive. For my alt I am on the fence though.
---
 I am for sure making a priest my alt (May turn into my main who knows). I’ve played priest since BC and all the way into BFA. So I know the class pretty well, however, I cannot make a final decision on what race it needs to be. 
---
I truly do love the night elf females. Their animations are wonderful, and armor on them looks fantastic. Human female priests also look as good but they are not my favorite. I could live with playing as one though. Dwarf female priest —- I can’t do it again. My paladin is a dwarf female and while stone skin has been great for wPvP and tanking as prot I can’t help but at the back of my mind regret choosing a dwarf over a human. 
---
So the question I am trying to ask is. How much will I gimp myself by picking a night elf priest over a human or the highly desired dwarf priest. I will be doing a lot of PvE content and for sure wPvP. Will not rolling dwarf and picking night elf be a death sentence down the road (considering night elves have the worst racial priest abilities)
---
Thank you all in advance. Hopefully you can help me make a final decision lmao.

Man... I need a priest one of these!
---
Private servers were not accurate. Classic is. Blizzard took the original data from vanilla and used it to make Classic. This *is* Classic WoW, private servers were an approximation based on guesswork.
---
Also, the keychain is being added later, just like it was in vanilla because this is more accurate to vanilla than private servers ever have been.
---
Nightfall, anyone?
---
No zeps in TB in classic.
---
Specificlly friends log in from the owners computer, not a separate computer, to clarify.
---
Ahh nostalgia, expectations, and getting older and less naive in general. Truly a sight to be seen
---
How big is your ego that you believe your quitting requires an announcement?
---
I want to say no but honestly I haven’t done the raid enough to remember
---
It's probably embarrassing
---
min\\maxing is the name of the game now. Why do you think \*suddenly\* theres no meme specs running around anymore. Have you see a shadow priest? Ret pally? Boomkin?   
---
How many people have you seen max their professions before hitting 60? How many times did that happen in vanilla? Everyone is good at video games, and it's no small part of the reason why all of them fucking suck now. The magic is gone.
---
I mean, no one in this situation seems to be an "asshole" but... yall could just lighten up a little. It's a game lol If someone wants to invite non guildies into a discord channel, so what? They could be cool peeps and worth having around for good convo. Discord chat aint gonna be 100% guild talk.
---
Personally I don't think you did anything wrong at all, John sounds like he's being dramatic. But I really wouldn't worry about this if I were you. Whole thing seems silly.
---
Group was ganked by two horde rogues while fighting that big rock elite, forgot his name. We didnt get credit for the kill and I dont think horde needs it, takes forever to find him too. I've also been ganked by horde 4+ levels above me while questing more than I can count
---
I didn't know that, then it's not really the right way to go.

Layering owns. The economy will suck without it, the only people it "sucks" for are people who already farmednor bought a bunch of cheap mats and are hoping to make a killing on em later. Fuck em I say, IDGAF about your goblin schemes. I want affordable mats and gear oh and also to not waste an hour hunting down a couple camped mobs for a small chance at a guts drop.
---
What the heck are they gonna do ban a shit ton of players and lose millions in subs?
---
Druids gain 0 benefit from weapon damage or speed in cat form. They only gain the stats and maybe the proc effects? I cant remember if they get procs.
---
&gt;Warrior
---
All that rage... you must play a warrior.
---
What is the VC you speak of? /s
---
Arms is also better for rage generation. Anger Management is a huge help to rage. Always start in arms for leveling at least until you get anger management. Then you can stray.
---
"Frontstab"....I'm now picturing a Rogue looking for a Frontstab ability.
---
It means that you will lose the sword spec proc on your OH, but it can still proc off your MH hits. So if you found a felstriker, you would prob use that instead of mirahs song. But having dalrends would probably outdps a dalrend + felstriker, depending on fels proc rate
---
I died, let me tell you why it's someone else's fault.

Nobody gives a fuck. Bye

Jin'Zil's Forest Magic...  Yeah feels bad to turn that in and find out he was just gassing his prisoners to death... yikes.
---
Ideally I’d like them to take the OSRS approach and really petition changes and ideally those changes would be something that doesn’t really change the game at all, or something client side. For instance I’d really like it if the higher res character models and Druid forms were available for use on your own client, we have the engine upgrades and I don’t see this being a problem.
---
Yah it's all about surviving the opener

Yawn. Later bruh.

This is literally all I saw and heard In shimmering flats killing turtles

Thanks for the heads up!
---
Yeah!
---
You want to cast immolate first so you can tag mobs with the instant damage as the dots don't start ticking for 1-2 seconds. Shadow bolt isn't worth it at all until very later levels, it costs a lot of mana and deals less damage than just wanding. As soon as you get a lot of shadow damage and all the necessary talents it's ok, but that's really late in the game.
---
Basic rotation without fancy builds: immo-&gt;CoA-&gt;instant cast corruption-&gt;wanding. The easier a mob is to kill the more just throwing corruption on and wanding is worth it. The imp deals a ton of damage early on, and 3/3 improved imp is worth it until you can get the succubus.
---
kill them as babies so they dont grow up to raise a sword against you
---
why are people telling you how to play? I want to be resto so I'm resto, just because im leveling dousent mean I shouldn't play how I want too... does it make me less effective at soloing mobs? Probably but I'm still using a mace and sheild because Shamans use maces and sheilds... 
---
I'm just really enjoying myself throwing heals out and getting quests done in the barrens, I res dead people I find which normally starts a conversation and we quest together for a bit, say good bye when where done and carry on...
---
I find it really odd that people are RUSHING to the end game... I guess people find that fun, but in taking my time to enjoy the exsperience right now. OH unless your Alliance those guys can all go die.
---
Right? We have a very active channel alongside world called "layer" which is just tons of "inv pls" messages
---
Go to a major city and say you're looking for guild in trade chat or general.  Hell on the way there you'll probably be invited to some casual guilds by randoms. If you're looking for something more serious, look on the guild recruitment forums

---
Sprint with the 2 point spec that removes movement impairing effects is your best bet. Also vanish can be used. Then you also have things like blind into regular stealth after you leave combat. Finally there's engineering items that will also work here. 
---
Plenty of options. But yeah they are mostly cool down based. If everything is on cool down then yeah you're out of luck and have to accept the fact that you will get kited.
---
Inb4 “the stock went up but I lost money” posts
---
Maybe some addon. In vanilla there was nothing like that
---
&gt;Blizzard has both the original code 
---
Actually a reason blizzard would give for saying no to classic for so long was that the didn't have the code anymore. Don't know how true that was. They definitely probably still had data and design documents that helped.
---
But yea most of the code is legion with classic values plugged in.
---
Just because the relationship sucks in most regards doesn't mean you can't extract some utility from it. Once it cost more than that is worth (the time investment needed in this case), you break it off.
---
I don't know how you can play with a bar at the top would drive me crazy and kill any amazing views with the updated graphics

I got a shit list

Why are you so triggered
---
and the warrior tanks the shit for the mage
---
I farmed elementals in Silithus for 18 hours as a shadowpriest, about 8 solo and 10 hours with mage aoe farming. We only managed to get 1 level 60 mage for this kill. Solo I was getting about 300 rep per hour, when we added the mage it went up to about 900 rep/hr on average (with no deaths/vendoring/falling asleep, etc). It is only 9000 rep to go from neutral to honored.
---
Shout out to Ercot for helping me! Grats on your Mana Igniting and Mageblade!
---
Make new dummy character on already full server. Swap to new realm. Make character on new realm with same name as other character you want to change. Now move character you want name change with. Not that hard to understand people.
---
Do you want to compete in a top tier guild that is going for speed clear times against other top guilds?  
---
If yes, then you need to roll dwarf.  
---
If no, roll whatever you want!  Getting a character to 60, getting them geared, and then getting them through the raids is going to take a very long time - so pick what YOU want not what anyone else tells you to pick.
---
Also, shadowmelding to ambush someone in wPvP is tons of fun.
---
At least the game isn’t going anywhere!

What happens to the pet when you feign death?

That's obviously against tos

I bet it’s Apes and monkey news, a known racist, are doing this.

Depends on what you want from the game.
---
When I was at my peak, I was in my late 20s and raiding on a Friday night. It became too much for me, and I burned out.
---
If high level raiding is what you want, then yes, lots of time. Anything else is manageable.
---
I'll also add, Classic doesn't have dailies yet, for the most part. When those were added, the addiction levels and time sinks skyrocketed for many people.
---
On incendius-alli join the channel "layermedaddy" and just say inv. People know what to do

Oh [sorry for US I guess then](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/free-character-moves-now-available-in-this-region/285965), because [on EU they said](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-free-character-moves-realms-eu/81745):
---
&gt; For approximately one day, the **new realms will be restricted** to only those players using a free character move. After one day, any player may create new characters there. This is to **allow players using the free character move service a better chance at retaining the name** of the character they’re moving.
---
blame dungeon spamming groups id say. More ganking, less people want to be in the world, more dungeon groups, less people in the world, more uneven fights, more dungeon groups, etc etc etc
---
Hell yeah brother cheers
---
I'm keeping a detailed list of everybody who ninja's gear from dungeons, or otherwise intentionally fucks the party for some reason.

Does it have the option to keep the overlay ir something?

Grinding Darnassus rep to get a saber mount on my gnome :D

Tanking is easy if your group understands that you need like 5 seconds to build threat. If you have a dps that is pulling for you then it becomes a lot more of a headache.
---
Far superior?? Lol
---
70% in cata sweetheart ;)
---
I can see you're far to emotional for a rational discussion.
---
Keep calm :)
---
It's back!
---
Been thinking about trying out something new;
---
I kinda wanna do Enhance Shaman, but the loot prio in raids is pretty discouraging.
---
Also kinda wanna try out Hunter, but the fact that finding a dungeon group is pretty much impossible (from what I've heard) is also discouraging
---
EDIT: Also been looking into Warlock, but Im kind of tired of casters, but could potentially be alot of fun aswell
---
It's 10% honored, 10% at r3
---
I would give it to the guy who needs it without charge.. maybe he just wanted the vendor sell price? But yes when you roll for a chest its his choice
---
That is only for dungeons, you might want to do other content such as quests in groups. You only think people need a group inside a dungeon.
---
You can heal as shadow, just pay attention. Leveling a priest kinda sucks in classic sorry but that's just how it is lol
---
Does it matter where you sell certain items, i.e do you get more for weapons when sold to a weapon vendor? Wow Noob sorry
---
So... how many layers are spawned? If this is the process, that would mean hundreds.
---
Another variant -- This isn't an airport, no need to declare your departure.
---
Its also another 10% at r3
---
Yeah that poor Jeffs quest :-)
---
sounds like you rolled the wrong faction for pvp :(
---
Yeah just gotta make sure you don't lose -50dkp.
---
The word is okay.
---
Si
---
i dunno about your server, but on gehennas eu they go for 6s and vendor price is like 4s. so you didn’t miss out on much
---
It's

R I S K

---
Says the guy who pulls numbers out of his ass and then sources a completely different number. Yikes, sweaty :D
---
That's you who came up with the dungeon scenario, not me.
---
Just keep on keeping on. As shadow your going to have the easiest time questing solo, and you’ll be able to heal dungeons just fine right to 60. So do whatever your heart wants, it’ll all be just about the same in the end. Unless you level as disc or holy. Then your going to not have as good of a time, unless your in a group. Not to mention if your on a pvp server, you’ll melt faces as shadow. Literally one of the best 1v1 classes
---
Its not required to farm dungeons but it will sure help!
---
No, paladin tanks are perfectly fine for dungeons. Just make your own group and forget the toxic elitists who only invite mages and other meta shits.
---
Just left click and hold while you drag
---
see how dumb that guy sounds.
---
Personally I enjoy the play style more so than other classes. A 2 hand axe wielding spell caster wearing chain mail and throwing off heals just sounds so cool to me. Totems are fun to drop down and can save a bad pull or a group from wiping if played well. 
---
Quality of life spells like ghost wolf, water walking, water breathing and reincarnation are also awesome and fun to play with. 
---
Obviously you'll have to make one yourself to see if it suits you, I just can't pull myself away from my shaman right now.
---
would have been nice to only allow mounting outside of towns/cities. probably an unpopular opinion, though.
---
He changed it since this post was made. Check out Guidelime and grab the free Horde or Alliance guides made for that. It’s great.
---
Yeah.  I’m sure you would still make room for a 1:50,000 chance pet.
---
ill also move from shazz, feels like its 1to 8 horde ratio, i cant even get out of SW whitout getting ganked.  
---
btw how do i transfeR? never did it wow.  is it in the shop or on the [battle.net](https://blattle.net) ?\`
---
Please keep undercutting, people like you are making the AH bearable to use...and I need to get my damn axe
---
Are you buying all of your skills? As a warrior I am skipping most of them and saving tons of gold. Only buy the skills you need
---
Ok but what was the alternative? There wasn't one.
---
Far too many people played on classic for there to not have been layering. Day 1 WoW =/= Classic Launch in terms of numbers. Day 1 &amp; 2 was a shitshow and no layering would have made it nearly unplayable for most people. I think its fine to turn it off now that its been a week but I would only be critical of Blizz if they keep it for too long. More than a month is too long imo.
---
Do you even play WoW? How do I possibly survive as a 21 against 5 murlocs as cloth when I am already low?
---
Are server Discords a thing? Or not yet?
---
I suggest using your normal bag for projectiles unless you are doing a dungeon. You aren't losing much in damage and spending less time emptying your bags.
---
just... move.  moving cancels the wand autocast
---
Mace spec is chance on stun so no one takes it if you are Arms, which you should be if you have Mortal Strike. So your only other choice is sword and there just aren't many good 2h swords
---
Sounds like he didn’t attend school at all, a place where the teachers are required to pick up this shit. Whatever.
---
They still have a "weapon damage", though. It's the damage as calculated by their attack power's contribution to DPS divided by attack speed (which is 1 for cat form). Basically, ap/14 is their weapon damage, if I remember right.
---
No procs either.
---
I hope stuff doesn't get that super inflated.  I hope Blizzard finds a way to crack down on gold sellers so the WoW economy doesn't go to shit.
---
I noticed all of the pre-raid BIS stuff for resto shaman is basically all cloth or leather. Is there still decent mail stuff? I feel like I should have just rolled a priest if I am going to be wearing cloth.
---
I’m a BC baby what are these items
---
By paying attention
---
I  would say shaman.  It's a melee class but still has that battle mage feel which sounds like would be more up your alley.  Plus, you can heal which is something completely different from what a mage can do.
---
Got ‘em!
---
Actually TBC was the expansion that the vanilla wow needed. Blizzard did not make a single mistake with this expansion.
---
&gt; lack of a Keychain (Did they forget it?)      
---
       
---
Blizzard has already mentioned it's coming in a later phase. I think phase 2.    
---
    
---
&gt; PVP is actually meritless. There is no harm in getting a dishonorable kill and there is no incentive to fight.    
---
Again, upcoming phases.     
---
     
---
&gt; Unless they remove layering     
---
Again, upcoming phases. Layering will be removed in phase 2. Did you not read about this and what's being released when?      
---
        
---
All your post says is "I didn't read anything."
---
Netherwind has a healthy population already without transfers. I've had very little trouble finding groups for dungeons and elite quests even in the morning.
---
That is really good, I bought mine for 25s.
---
I mean, absolutely, when those opinions aren't "hahah borderline racist references are funny," as if people don't see that it always brings out people who are actually racist.   
---
Respecting opinions is like "Hey man, Pizza Hut is better than Papa Johns," "I don't agree but hey you do you." Not "Someone is less because of their skin color,"
---
Ive played since Classic launch and have only waited about 15 min total.

There's definitely some wiggle room to modify the tree how you see fit, but this is exactly what I'll be using as a night elf. It scales best with high crit gear to really benefit from the seal fate. 
---
You'll notice some things like only taking 3/5 MoD, but as a night elf I get +1 stealth level from racial, and I always enchant a cloak with +stealth to achieve a 5/5 level without spending the points. If you're any other race, I'd recommend going 4/5 MoD and just 1/2 Elusivenesss and 2/3 Ambush. The shorter vanish CD's are really nice though in PvP as well as in PvE, because vanish &gt; ambush is a part of the dps rotation and also drops threat.
---
In the assassination tree, I like imp eviscerate 3/3 over imp KS because KS can fail or be trinketed and you lose out on the dps gain. An eviscerate will eventually happen if you want it to. It's also completely useless in raids.
---
I like imp expose armor over passive 2% damage bonus from Murder because I think Imp Expose just opens up your toolkit to be able to take out those soul link warlocks or high geared warriors. Or just added fun to blow up a mage for enormous crits lol.
---
You can drop vigor until you get 5/8 Nightslayer from MC. 10 more starting energy alone isn't going to make much difference in most fights. You can put it anywhere you like but I just like it personally.
---
Combat tree isn't flexible. There's no reason to get any points in sinister strike as daggers. You shouldn't even have it on your action bar to be honest.
---
Ah well that's my opinions. If you have questions let me know!
---
Get Windfury since you're so close. Chain lightning as well. If those get you excited stick with it. Otherwise, nothing will.
---
better isnt easier
---
You'll be fine as long as you have proper gear for the roles. You probably don't want to try healing a dungeon in dps gear.
---
They were a thing as soon as the server names were announced
---
Also don't forget about mouse buttons. I find pet attack on mouse wheel up and pet follow on mousewheel down feels very intuitive. You can also add shift and ctrl modifiers for more abilities as well.
---
10s is a lot of money at this point.

It's probably the *last* reason to break up with her but not the first.  Especially someone who decides to throw shit at other people's homes.
---
Not saying he's a good guy either but if she's doing that then good riddance.
---
And it didn't.  People didn't spend months on it like we do with heroic/mythic raids these days.
---
In vanilla, I walked in with some garbage ass greens because our server was trying to raid at 60, cause what else was there.  We definitely cleared half of the bosses on a Saturday without knowing wtf was going on.  I remember spending the following Saturday, granted that was for 12 hours, killing Onyxia. 
---
Trust me, Tier 1 raids weren't insanely difficult.
---
Fair enough, looks like I was overthinking it lol. Now I feel dumb.
---
I can smell the packaging through this image.
---
That’s a giraffe
---
the guild i'm in has one
---
maybe it is, maybe not
---
Good to know, thank you.
---
I really hope they stay vanilla forever. And I hope they never ever ever allow flying mounts. By all means, introduce maybe raids that is of the BC and later era or whatever, but let every game mechanics and the rest of the world stay vanilla.
---
Lmao are you okay? You sound so angry. Seek mental help friend
---
Arugal... lol. Yojamba is pleasant af.
---
You’re my favorite person!
---
He would have rank 6 shadow bolt.(which can hit like 300+
---
Your soul is hardened much stronger than mine good sir. I cracked at 47 and rerolled to a NE huntard for the rest of Vanilla.
---
Looking for a couple of add-ons. One is a simple tool to compare looted items to equipped items.  
---
The other is a map addon I remember using back in 2006. It had maps, boss locations, and item drops for each dungeon.
---
If he won the roll the chests contents are his. It’s common courtesy to offer the item for vendor price if someone else needs it though.
---
Damn you look dumb haha
---
Retail baby it's level 30 lol
---
"But I won't do that..."
---
Good info, thank you
---
They are using the tools exactly as they are designed. They are not going through any complicated steps or setups to hop layers. Its impossible to say they are exploiting when hopping layers is something you encounter in a normal play session.
---
Is layering designed poorly? Maybe
---
Should there be a limit to number of hops per hour? Most likely
---
But I dont think its fair to be upset with people using the tools they were given as designed.
---
Best pick up I’ve ever made. Welcome to the team mate 
---
-Ddk
---
It's the better pvp faction this time around. If you like pvp you are in the right place.
---
Yeah this. Rebind them, change camera zoom to ctrl+scroll, and get used to it - game changer!
---
I'm not saying they aren't. He asked how it was possible so quickly and I was just pointing out it was done even quicker than this.
---
damn.. this is the waiting time? a big reason why im not playing is this.. and also i cant get a $5 for one month.. i dont wanna pay $15 for something i wanna try out
---
Yup! Maybe you're ahead of the leveling curve? What level are you now? I was level 24-29 on the weekend and spent my time in Tarren Mill. There was a ton of stuff going on.
---
I think it has more to do with how populated the server is. Less populated servers don't have as many people and as result either don't have as many layers or don't *need* to have as many layers.
---
Yeah love druid. Can do whatever I want, great at solo stuff. Have saved multiple wipes in dungeons by off healing or going bear. Always feel useful.
---
So angry. What are you 5? Hahaha this is amazing
---
Just did it, yep it was. I was overthinking it a lot lol

Everyone here assuming I’m unable or don’t know how to take a screenshot. Using my phone is simply a preference of mine. I appreciate it though

What I’m saying is that if it is possible it will be exploited. Making it harder is a waste of resources imo because it doesn’t matter what hoops they have to jump through. They will do whatever it takes to exploit as long as it is possible. 
---
I can see an argument for reducing accessibility with a suggestion like your own but it will far from solve the problem. A select few players can trash an entire server’s economy. It’s not that we shouldn’t do anything but that doing anything that doesn’t prevent it entirely is going to be largely fruitless because it only takes a couple exploiters to tank prices.
---
I mean if your going to go that way. I’d say the programming of you solenoid violates tos. Just get an isolating fan and duck tap/zip tie a pencil or dowel to it to hit space bar.
---
AH addons existed in vanilla too.
---
Why do you pref the bear? As far as I know they have claw and are a bit tougher
---
It didn’t register me as active for some reason which is why I had low priority in queue. Once I played for a bit the system marked me as active or whatever and I had the same priority as everyone else. It might be just be a bug for new subs that it takes time for the system to recognize.

The game is super populated so more people have started trying to exploit the system and level up asap, I don't really see the point but it is what it is.

I mean, we did that back then as well, I feel like people just didn't know you could spam grind dungeons if you had enough people.

---
How wouldnt you be able to change the name if its taken :O thats just weird if its true
---
But thanks for the info
---
The simple fact of the matter is is if you don't take advantage of layering or use whatever advantages you can get, others will, and that just puts you at a disadvantage.
---
Come back to the Horde! Lok'tar Ogar
---
After checking Wowhead, buying the PVP mount with tokens was only introduced in BC. In Vanilla you had to be rank 11 (Commander), which is no small feat. 
---
So you'll be facing a grind if you choose PVE or PVP.
---
I think at your level, take a look at the zones ahead of you and then focus on Night Elves in Kalimdor or Dwarves in Eastern Kingdom (most EK zones will be SW rep though). I believe you could start grinding the Gnomer dungeon for rep with the Gnomes if you're a fan of their mechanostrider.
---
The good news is, if you put the work in, you can get a different mount - the bad news being that it won't be easy and will take extra effort on your part, but that will also set you apart from other members of your faction.
---
Nah, Back in vanilla we constantly had people under 60 to fill spots, everyone also only got 10-15 fps &amp; couldn't figure out how to use addons
---
This is why uber was able to kill the taxi business.
---
It was fake. Screenshot was photoshopped and/or from a private server, which you can see because the minimap inside Org bank looks different from how it is on Classic. Also the numbers were literally mathematically impossible given the drop rate of arcane crystals and the "cast time" of mining. He'd have had to spend practically every second of the past five days actively swinging a mining pick in order to get 3200 crystals. Also, there's no conceivable way that there's 25+ layers on a server. That's like 50k+ players.
---
This fourm post has a high chance of being completley false.
---
I don't think there is a single server in the game right now that has 25 layers. At most 3-5.
---
Our cities. Your cities are fucking mazes and the sole reason I can't play horde.
---
Need to be Magellan to navigate to a profession trainer.
---
But in theory they are the ones that own the mines as well. If everyone can do this to farm won't it cancel out?
---
Your post was okay untill you wrote a second phrase, too bad..
---
No cross-realm. If you want to play with your friend, join his realm. RP really just means don't make a stupid name, don't talk politics in General Chat.
---
thx I knew there was a spec for it back then. I find it kind of funny how people have forgotten about the leveling specs from the days of yore.
---
[This guy's](https://i.imgur.com/gkCgOez.jpg) name must be "Algorithms" cause he supports it
---
Had something similar happen to me earlier this week. Went to the caves just outside Org and some people were fighting a mob. Ended up pulling the boss. The asshat whispered me saying i was a shitty player cause i didnt ask his permission to pull the boss. I just lol'ed at him and told him some graphic things he could go do to himself.
---
Wonder where the hard factual proof is. No one comes up with proof this is truly happening. Every post about this has spawned because one dude made statements on the blizzard forums, the place where people declared a lgbtq server. I'm not saying the abuse is bullshit, I'm saying we don't have any evidence whatsoever and creating a wichhunt over this issue.
---
While true, all you need to understand is that a point guard is a position in basketball
---
If people knew about this in 2004,they would have done it then too
---
You can’t make new characters on transfer realms. This post is unfortunately incorrect.
---
Wait till they get out of the dungeon farming.
---
The isboxer discord have a preference for horde as they can start doing 5 man runs at 14 instead of having to wait till 18.
---
Stop being part of the problem by abusing it then, dickhead.
---
Bots would be easy to manipulate with little effort if they are indeed a problem on your realm.
---
Not really. I'm a tailor/enchanter lock as well and key thing to remember is that you don't need to buy all the skill upgrades that are available to you. It also helps that you'll get your mount for free with a lock quest.
---
I played for a few hours that day and tried playing the next day in the full server and my friend said my account was properly marked now and my queue position went down consistently like it should.
---
Same here. Really hope Earthfury gets a lot of new blood
---
Those new servers will be dead realms. Don't fall into this trap.
---
Just because you can do something, it doesn't mean you should, or that it's okay to do it.
---
It's a really simple thing really.
---
What does that mean. Layer
---
If you are on a pvp server, put Fortunate Son on at loud volume.
---
You're heading to STV.
---
If you had, you would be pissed off about it crashing in November instead.
---
Also what is it you don’t like about the guide?
---
Ignore all the idiots commenting saying that they don't care why you are quitting. They are casual players that don't have the brain cells to comprehend the impact of what you are actually talking about. They may only realize how big of an impact layering has in 4 months when they finally reach level 60 and they realize that the economy is shit. 
---
Layering is beyond broken when abused by people who know what they are doing. Being able to switch between up to something like 25 layers to farm items is crazy. You have no competition and items are generated into the game faster than the demand for them. Due to this smart guilds can literally monopolize the server and items and make as much gold as they like. They could always be dumb and oversaturate the market but if they are smart they would just keep the items banked and sell them slowly.
---
Our server has an 'AdolfHealer'

I would be so disappointed if they went this route with Classic.

Nice kills. I am new and not seasoned enough to kill 5 guys but i did find a nelf hiding nearing Zoram'gar with my track humanoid and a stealthed druid that both attacked me when i found the nelf. I killed the pet first then the hunter and almost killed the druid when i died. It was so much fun
---
PEOPLE ARE MIN MAXING LIKE WE KNEW THEY WOULD FROM THE FORUMS SINCE DAY ONE DELETING MY ACCOUNT

I join group for 'kill X number of whatever', but not for quests where you're collecting drops and it winds me up when people invite you for them without asking, especially when they're like 5 levels lower. That's not beneficial for me and quests that have a low drop rate or where you have to get 20/30+ drops take long enough already.

I don’t understand. They said they were implementing a cool down in switching. And yet, here we are. I’ve canceled my 2 subs.
---
Where is that, sorry?
---
He didn’t specify what level at all. I understand what you’re saying, and I agree with you, but he could be talking about a warrior fighting 3 +1 mobs which is totally possible. Far from efficient or smart, but definitely possible.
---
Sometimes?
---
Hmm I see what you mean. Of every wow classic warrior guide ive read, none have mentioned the use of slam. Im guessing thats because you should be saving rage for mortal strike/execute or cleave pulls and casting of slam is delayed when you get hit
---
I had the same tought

If you think this is not an exploit, it's not my dumb ass who doesn't understand shit.

I've been using dagger spec to stun enemies and then get behind for the backstab, but if the stun is blocked I can be in a world of hurt.  I suppose I should make the switch to swords for leveling?

I’ve been feeling pretty meh about playing horde. But last night I grouped with my first shaman with Windfury totem.
---
Oh my sweet jesus it’s amazing.
---
So... kind of how it was at the original launch of the game?
---
Why not have phasing, and why not have other retail aspects then, if worried about the ease of questing.
---
Hash browns Mmmm
---
I kinda like rep grind. I compare it to real life where you can pay someone under the table for extra service;)
---
You don't get it. The world as it is, isn't big enough to handle realm populations. NO one would be able to play "WoW" without layering or more realms.  I'd rather have layers, than have low population realms. Layers say 2 people can farm mats because the population demands that since the world itself can't be modified in scale.  Because the population is exponentially larger than could ever be achieved per realm 15 years ago, layering keeps a similar play/quest style with minimal impact. Just  Look at it this way, back in "Vanilla" 1 person mining that node meant 999 didn't.  Now that we're talking layering it means 1 person mining that node and 2,999 others on the same layer didn't. but . we have . 15,000+ on the same realm. 
---
You can see the massive counts when layers crash because you're playing 15,0002 sitting in queue.
---
servers/technology didn't exist back in the day to solve this in vanilla and layers are an elegant way to make the world big enough for the demand without changing how it feels.
---
If layering impacts YOU, don't do it.   It certainly isn't the magic panacea people are claiming and it hasn't caused inflation or hurt the economies on any realm i'm on. 
---
Just lots of noise in forums . and reddit.
---
Chiropractic was founded by David Palmer or to put it another way David Palmer is the L. Ron Hubbard chiropractic.
---
They've increased the capacity of the servers by a huge amount because of layering.
---
I'm gonna make up some numbers here, but say Blizzard decided that 50k people in one continent is the max that the servers can handle to where those people all have a decent game experience. This doesn't necessarily mean lag, it means competing for quests, getting ganked, all that stuff. Without layers, they'd set the cap to 50k people per server and the queue would kick in when there's more than 50k.
---
To facilitate a clean launch, rather than leave the cap at 50k, they add 5 new layers and increase the cap to 250k. Now each dedicated layer/server has 50k people on it having an ok experience, and the queue doesn't kick in until 250k.
---
When they remove layers, they'll have to lower the cap. I've heard some servers have 25+ layers right now, which means they're going to have to set the server capacity to something like 4-5% of what it is now when that happens.
---
Again these are made-up numbers, it's possible that they'd allow 100k people in two total layers but would be ok with a 60k cap with no layers, but that's the gist of what they have to deal with.
---
You can also get Titan Panel which does the same.
---
Me that kinda orc
---
You sound mad you're insulting me and calling me names lol.  Control your emotions plz
---
KFBR392...
---
You can go watch (for example) Apes stream. They spread out over as many layers as they can and lock down all high level resource nodes. That will make them way more than they'd ever be able to on a single layer. You don't need to believe OP, in fact OP's statement doesn't matter. A ruined economy is a direct consequence of layering itself, which is why it was predicted when layering was announced. Big guilds on all servers will spread out over several layers and farm way more resources than they'd normally be able to. I don't say anything is over btw. I'm just saying that the economy is fucked and the servers are too full to remove layering by phase 2 without ques. I never said I minded any of that enough to stop playing. These are just facts. I am just surprised that people are still denying the negative repercussions of layering when anyone with common sense could have seen them coming during the beta.
---
If i ever get so bored i start watching pewdiepie...just shot me, please
---
Thanks for the reply! It was so long ago that I really can't recollect anything about classic other than 60 content (BGs, MC etc.).
---
I guess I can't wrap my head around the idea that these private servers were able to reproduce the game in basically its entirety, but things like NPC difficulty weren't apart of the metadata that came with it.
---
Cool will do friend

Tell him to check the dropdown that says "WoW1" and see if he can change it and try to log in. A friend of mine had a similar issue (never even played and was banned) and switching that helped. Just a shot in the dark.
---
In Classic you get travel form at level 30. You can see your spell list per level here  [https://classicdb.ch/?spells=7.11#0+2+1](https://classicdb.ch/?spells=7.11#0+2+1)
---
I kind of figured that what you said was self evident in my comments. Obviously (IMO) if a player has an advantage from an exploit, other players are at a disadvantage merely due to the existence of said advantage. I agree with what you're saying, i just didnt feel the need to fully and thoroughly explain that portion because i figured it would be self evident. Also because im on mobile at work and im lazy lolz
---
Playing solo is super enjoyable! The community is AMAZING and super helpful (just look at this thread). If you want to lvl with people join a guild or just ask around. The guild i'm in is super friendly and we do stuff together all the time. Everything from questing, dungeons and just ganking Alliance have all been things i've participated in with my guild. Also dungeons are a great way to fill the gap between lvling zones, get good gear, and have that feeling of community. If you're worried about the game dying down before you hit 60, don't. A lot of people who are playing classic played it when they were young with no obligations and are in the exact same boat your in. Classic is also being release in Phases (1-6), so every time a new phase comes out the servers will populate like crazy again.
---
Die....I'm like 80% sure I'd just die.
---
I'd rather the economy be ruined, than the game be completely unplayable imo.
---
dungeon spamming is already meta, imagine without layering, that'd literally be the only viable way to play the game
---
If you spec into Fel Concentration, you will very rarely be interrupted. Also, Gravestone does 29 DPS and the latest level of DL at level 31 is rank 3 which does 32 DPS before any +Shadow Damage.  
---
Starting at level 30, this is the route speed levelers will take. You have close to zero downtime if you manage your health and mana correctly with Lifetap and DL. Even if you find your wand doing slightly more DPS, it isn't healing you.   
---
I don' t even buy food or water on my Lock and they are very fast to level if you do things correctly. Bandaids are enough. Since launch, I have gotten a Gnome to 33 and an Orc to 31.   
---
Another "mistake" people are making is using Voidwalker over Succubus. Succubus accounts for \~30% of your damage and Voidwalker... not a lot. If you find your Succubus dying, you are doing something wrong. You should be tanking, not your pet.
---
item drop quests still take forever in a group
---
Because engineering makes your character stronger, while other professions make your wallet stronger.
---
Yes. Everyone over level 45 would play on their very own 45+ layer which is a really dumb idea
---
I'll accept group invites at times. Sometimes I just want to roll at my own pace and not have to worry about a group. Sometimes I'm farming silk or wool or whatever to level up my professions. It makes sense to group up for boss/unique mobs that are the objective of a quest, but if there's 30 mob spawns for the quest I'd rather do it solo. It really depends on the traffic and mob density.
---
We waiting.
---
Kazak was the one mob put on a leash in vanilla as, iirc, he would enrage and start spamming shadowbolt volleys that would immediately kill many NOCs and lower level players, and also heal whenever something died. And thus became an unkillable monster
---
Yea that’s what I want
---
...Questie. There is an option to turn off the overly for map and minimap.
---
i have learned a rogue never wants to be your friend, and no issues with hunters except ones that are higher level than me. Thanks for the heads up.
---
On Andorhal leading up to TBC release kazzak showed up at the gates of IF.  A tank from my guild named Kronix? charged and we fought him for a good bit making no progress before everyone died and he despawned.
---
I think a gm spawned him in.

Or you can just press Print Screen and it will automatically save a screenshot to a folder in your Classic WoW directory. It's literally a single button press and people still fucking refuse to do it.
---
um what is this trick, I must know for research purposes
---
Its his to do what he wants
---
Does anyone else has played WoW Classic, being hyped for months after tons of old videos and machinimas, after remembering old the good times in every single aspect of the game through multiple expansions, hoping for that feeling to come back but instead obtained a rude awakening that those times wont come to us even we make our best effort... 
---
Although the nostalgia will always be present and the present nor the future will ever satisfy our needs to be happy in **that** way anymore?
---
Am I alone in this? Idk, this just hitted hard for me. Its like it has awaken in me more feels that are not wow related
---
Crazy stuff like this is what made Vanilla so great. The world was there, the players made the history by doing the impossible.
---
As a warrior leveling. What armor should I prioritize while upgrading/buying?
---
I know weapon is the most.... But from there? Chest? Pants?
---
Level 18 btw.
---
Sure, I don't believe there are any race-specific quests that would stop you.
---
Low quality comments :'x
---
Assuming the whole thing is true... you don't see any issue in a repeatable gold farming method / exploit?
---
Huh.
---
all hail da google
---
Looks like you were playing cat and mouse 👉😎👉
---
That's kind of an unfair assumption. What if pets have been fed earlier but finished their dinner, so now you're over feeding them?
---
It's just kiting practice for Hunters.
---
Oh my god now way link please!?!?!
---
&gt; they are smart they would just keep the items banked and sell them slowly.
---
So effectively the same as if they farmed them slowly.
---
I’ve said my piece I don’t think I want to continue talking to you about this because you seem to be getting easily frustrated. Have a good day
---
It's pretty limited how much you can get out of that. Felcloth quickly ends up being worth just a few gold. Hunters and warlocks can make the same kind of money just doing the 3-boss Maraudon farm, and once DM comes out, most classes can make that much from lashers.
---
Bookmarking this one for the TFT subreddit. It's only cell pics there it seems.
---
The levels you begin entering contested zones are honestly probably where hunters can usually just crap all over everyone else except maybe decent rogues. At that level, melee, other than rogues should never be touching you and clothies probably shouldn't even be getting a cast off until they're \~50% hp save for maybe priests via PW:S. 
---
Hunters are good in pvp at all levels and the playstyle is probably unlikely to change MUCH at 60 (other than possibly being Marksman spec) other than the introduction of feign death/traps/flare etc. in your mid 30s. 
---
In regards to #2, are you referring to when your pet is dead?
---
&gt;	I can just post my bank
---
We’re waiting.
---
Do you want a small dps boost now or a chunk of gold at some point in the future?
---
Personally id save it for the gold later, up to you!
---
That's actually a smart idea, didn't think of it. I agree that considering that possibility, they should have greyed out char creation until the grace period is over.
---
Make sure to be lvl 10 before u run there.
---
Not that I know of. It should be the same price throughout
---
I wouldn't count on it for level 40. But there are rep guides that will help you do it for your epic mount. Choose a race/city and use things like their cloth quartermaster and complete any city-based quests. It's a grind but it is doable and you can do a chunk of it while leveling.
---
Thank you for your reply. At lv 45 with dungeon blues, can I kill equal level players and which classes would be weakest against me?
---
&gt;Statistical averages still apply.
---
To what exactly? Overall population? Sure. Population around every single Point of Interest? Absolutely fucking not.
---
Even if every layer has the exact same number of people, layer hopping is still advisable for many players. A player doesn't really care about which layer has the lowest pop, players only care about how many players are competing with the locally for the same ressources. Considering the amount of possible locations(especially if the level range is varied) that are of interest, the servers are bound to have very different densities around many POIs.
---
This is a statistical reality, this isn't really up for discussion in any way shape or form.
---
Dude, people go hardcore on 100 year old games like chess. Some are passionate and some aren't.
---
My guild gets spammed with requests of group invites to change layer. Shit sucks
---
That's the point of drain-tank though, you run from mob to mob using lifetap for mana and immediately healing yourself up with the drain, losing little health to the mob as your main move for the build is a drain life boosted by + shadow dmg gear. 
---
Not saying you couldn't get it done, but my survivability in that spec with the succubus was much better than any Stam setup with a voidwalker.
---
Cowabunga!
---
After 40 gold starts to ramp up a lot more.  I've  probably gotten close to another 100g or so leveling from 40-50 on just quests and vendoring.
---
You deserve it for trusting a filthy Gnome
---
I'm not sure what rumors you are listening to, but layering allows servers to easily host players and balance loads.
---
Capacity of a server shouldn't be affected by layers, and visa versa.
---
He's playing a character. One who is able to keep the attention of his tens of thousands of viewers I'll add. I don't think he's legitimately upset about the things he throws "tantrums" over. Everything he does, every reaction you see is exaggerated. That's how he became successful and how he continues to be a popular streamer. No one watches him for his integrity.
---
First time playing WoW ever. 
---
Tried 2hrs of Hunter and 2hrs of Warlock. 
---
I like the pet system but never got to level 10 Hunter and based on YT videos, taking care of different pets and maintaining them seems to be tedious. Also, the deadzone is kind of terrifying for a total newbie.
---
I would play this game 90% solo as I don't have friends who play this game and would rely on people I meet in game.
---
I'd like a ranged/dps that is self sustaining, which path to take?
---
I'm talking about /stand, as that works with 1 press.
---
Meh you could say the same about Mount everest, yet lots more media attention on such things now. People earn good cash streaming such achiements. Doing shit in classic has more value now than ever, because back then people uploaded on YouTube for fun and stuff now you make real good money if you have a fan base and being the first and best gives you thst fan base.
---
You think you wouldn't enjoy looking at our planet from the moon for the first time just because so many did it before you?

---
yeah he's missing the one where feralas and 1k needles meet
---
Doesn't overpower only proc for the mob that blocked/dodged/parried? From when I played a decent lvl warrior in vanilla I seem to remember that's how it worked. So if you change target then there is nothing to overpower if you get what I mean.
---
It's been while though, so I could be wrong :)
---
Nah he’s getting downvoted because the screenshot is from a private server and he won’t post his own stash of devilsaur leather or anything else to substantiate his claim.
---
Herod is a crowded server with plenty of 60s already who are competing for stuff, the window for one person to monopolize multiple layers worth of mats has closed already.

I see. So when I tried to party up with my girlfriend when she was in goldshire, but I couldnt see her and she phased in after we partied up one of us changed layers.
---
I do agree with this sentiment. I do not layer hop myself, and I personally dont condone it.  I dislike people layer hopping for AOE grinding, but I will tolerate it because its a small thing, to me at least. The one I dislike is that people can layer hop to avoid PVP.  I play on a PVP server and I very strongly disagree with the ability to avoid pvp by layerhopping. If you don't want to be attacked by other players don't play on a PVP server. Being ganked (not camped, griefed, etc) and running into people in open world is a part of the game. If you have some asshat camping you for 30+ minutes it can be a great tool, but causes more poor instances of PVP than good. Once again, just imo.
---
Your one of those people huh? Judge things before trying them. Have a good life.  Bye.
---
Bonebiter* but it is Alliance only and requires you to go to Desolace. 
---
I’m going for it on my Paladin atm
---
Very strange.. now I’m curious as to how that little bugger just poofed out of thin air.  Literally just disappeared as I was killing him.  However he blinked away and was running for a bit so I’m thinking combat must of just ended and he spammed an invite or something or he logged out lol
---
Clarifying the functionality of an add-on doesn't necessarily equal endorsement.
---
Yeah exactly. Having magnitudes more players on the server is going to drastically change the server feel. Not to mention when they do away with layering (eventually?). And these huge populations are all going to be competing for one layer's worth of the worlds resources, which even under vanilla's original population count where described as "limited." If spawn rates aren't drastically different the prices for things are going to get fucking outlandish.
---
Yes but where can I sub to the ticker feed
---
I thought that one of the things to do with a Bank Alt is to try to get it it's own Guild, so that you also have access to the Guild Bank for extra room
---
Well they recognize the realms that need transfers.  They aren't going to open it to everyone.  And of they don't dictate where people go that could create other population issues
---
More than 1g sounds like a jackpot to me...that's a lot of money at the current stage of classic

---
I don't disagree but u/Nazalan 's post is about everyone being on an even playing field. Everyone does have the same capability to use these addons. He said:
---
&gt; Am I the only one who thinks we should all have the same Auction House UI, in order for it to remain fair. 
---
Everyone can have that. Nobody has access to anything that others don't have.
---
His post is about the AH being fair to everyone, I'm only commenting on that.
---
Logged in at 1600 with no Q. Had some shit to do and at 1800 had a (5500) 2hr Q.
---
Yup agreed. Any math also assumes that every time he's in a new layer the node is there. Even with 10 layers, he'd farm 10 nodes then likely need to wait till a respawn. I tried to find a number to the respawn timer but came up empty since I don't think it's a consistent set time. But I do know when ever I'm farming and running circuits it's like 10 or 15 mins. before they start coming back. He'd need an absurd amount of layers to get that many drops.
---
The only reason I am replying to your post right now while "working from home" is because I promised myself that today, unlike yesterday, I wouldn't play WoW when I should be working. So instead I'm on the subred..... I think you're good bud.
---
The avg age was in the teens in 2006 maybe.
---
I'm at work and dying. Thank you. Have my upvote.
---
Probably.  I do sell for more too, was just trying to help out some lower level players in Barrens.  I also might have a problem buying gear from the Auction House.
---
Its part of the fantasy. All the green boys bully you tall purple boys
---
You don't have to wait that long. Players are soon forced to make their way to Kalimdor frequently to find xp. IF being close to menethil harbor is extremely valuable.
---
For strictly leveling yea spirit is better but I don't really think im missing out on much, im only losing 8 spirit from the chest I have now. Rather have more int and stam for pvp anyways.
---
You now, I have actually educated myself in the basic mechanics of stock and option markets in the real world. I do not claim myself to be an expert, but I know some fundamentals. And as far as I understand, the auction house in WoW work pretty similar to the order book of the derivatives markets (or any order book in that matter). It all boils down to demand vs. supply. So as long as everyone fails to elaborate why this is wrong, there is no reason for me to believe any of that "hurr durr layering ruins our game" fear mongering.
---
I have yet to read a comprehensive explanation on how someone with a great stock of any cunsumable Item or crafting material could seriously ruin the market. On the long run at least.
---
I thought you could fish lockbox ?
---
Who do you think we (horde) learned it from?  Hillsbrad foothills and the endless spawn camping from southshore alliance bullies who are 10 levels above you while you are trying to quest there and you are mercilessly getting spawn camped.  The alliance sewn the seeds of revenge and let the hate flow through us.   Now the reaper is coming back for the sow and the days of prancing in the fields picking flowers are done.  We are coming for you all.
---
&gt;Is this a throwaway account
---
3 months old. I'm betting my money it is.
---
So you can link to a tweet but not to a photo of your own in game bank like your promised?
---
Why are you so dumb?
---
Enchanting is a great way to not have money pre-60.
---
It works the exact way it worked in vanilla, Overpower is only activated against the target that dodged.
---
Going for that true vanilla experience clicking abilities
---
Thanks for reminding me of titanpanel. Forgot about that one.
---
No obligations and no sleep.
---
So the first bit of your statement was that calling people pussies over the internet holds no weight but then the rest of your statement is calling him a pussy in a really long way. This is a very long “no u”.
---
(1) Want to level to 60  
---
(2) Want to PVP, MATE!  
---
I don't care about high level PvE content besides wanting to aquire the best possible gear to pvp with. So guess I have to engage that stuff after all.  
---
Now the question is: **Orc Warlock or Undead Rogue?**
---
If you enable PvP, someone from the opposite faction will be able to attack you out in the world when they see you.
---
If they attack you, they'll also get "flagged" for pvp and you can fight back.
---
The only difference between a PvP and a PvE server is that the PvP option can't be disabled in neutral territories on a PvP server.
---
Note that if you turn on PvP and then turn it back off (or if you attack someone from the opposite faction who has it toggled on, or if you heal someone from your faction who has it toggled on), you'll have to wait 5 minutes without any pvp combat for the flag to actually fall off.
---
That's the reference, yeah
---
You manage to make ElvUI ugly...
---
It did exists on actual classic. Not sure if beta. Hell I swear I can tell that it worked like this in WotLK too.
---
This is why the layering limit was going to be based on earning XP, which is also an issue as it does nothing for people farming nodes and mobs that don't give XP from swapping.
---
You've already been caught showing you have no clue what you're talking about, "needing 25 layers". Sounds like someone's a bit sour the gravy train is about to stop.
---
(y) YASSS
---
That's proof that Azeroth is flat.
---
Rape, murder, torture, and theft are all regularly lampooned and have been inflicted to and by people of every creed and race. Totally don't care. Every slur is equally as funny because they are all just words ,and getting angry about it creates a feedback loop that keeps the word in power. Most slurs originate as merely descriptive's like Chinaman, and any negative connotation is added because of how one group reacts to it, which I interpret as humorous, especially when it's someone else getting offended on another person or hypothetical person's behalf.
---
It's to manually enable PvP if you want to.
---
The difference is that on PvP servers, you are automatically flagged for PvP whenever you enter contested or enemy zones. On PvE servers, contested zones instead become neutral zones where you aren't automatically flagged, but you can still enable it if you want to (you're also automatically flagged if you attack a flagged member of the other faction, regardless of server type).
---
Classes need work though.  The world feels great but the heroes don't.  Mages topping DPS charts with 100% Frostbolt damage, shit like that.  We need Wrath class design with Classic systems imo.
---
\&gt; Bitches about the economy being broken
---
\&gt; Goes to a server without any guarantee that the admins don't gift money/rares/recipes to their friends
---
Yep, you are totally going to have a healthy economy from people who can manipulate the game to give themselves millions in gold.
---
For me at least, Dwarves are the best WoW race, but Horde is the best WoW faction.

Im trying WOW for the first time and picked a rogue. I found contradicting sources when it comes to specs to pick and how they fair in pve and pvp. Right now im sword main hand, dagger off hand, combat spec, apparently “rushing to blade furry as fast as possible”  idk what the source meant or what im doing. I guess i have two questions, if i wanna pvp and pve is it viable with rogue, also cant i get all my talent points back and reassign them at a certain level? Help.
---
IM ABOUT TO!!! :D
---
As they should, why would someone help another if they don't put in the effort to help themselves.
---
how the fuck did you get feralas fp without the thousand needles or desolace ones?
---
lol cry
---
&gt;I can do what I want to on my lunch break
---
If you don't want to wear cloth, you don't have to. Don't worry about best in slot, it will take you a long time to get there, and none of the endgame dungeons are punishing enough to require you to wear cloth imo. Paying attention, positioning, playing your class are all more important.
---
Exactly. I don't see how this is confusing.
---
What the fuck are you talking about? The 25 layers was OP's claim.
---
&gt;Doesn't switch back to summer till.. like March.
---
You consider March summer?!?! damn... Where I live March is basically still Winter. If I had to guess it would be the first day of fall until the first day of spring (September 21st-ish until March 21st-ish)  aka the Vernal and Autumnal equinox dates
---
Team viewer has a bloated ui it looks like an early 2000 app.VNC  It also had malware issues before, many hacks and stolen user datadata. I don't like the userid system. With VNC viewer you just install the server on your pc, then log in once in your phone. Then all your pc's are just there to choose from that to you are hosting. No remembering passwords and codes. Also has a now light weight feature rich ui suited for power users. No big bright blue buttons that look like my geocities page. Rather a clean/minimalistic ui.

They’re on my “Fucking Google it”-list now.
---
That's good.  I was driven from another MMO because the exploiting got so bad, people were rolling around in mythic (bis) gear in months, whereas it should have taken multiple years to get. 
---
Usually I don't care what other people do but it allowed one guild to farm the entire open world bosses uncontested, further widening the gear gap to the point of unplayability.
---
I love it... :D Loving the good advices!
---
layering is the worst part about classic atm, there are groups being advertised on herod simply for layer hopping to get resources/mob spawns.
---
I can only imagine how this will affect future grinds and deter people from activities like world pvp

---
What specifically adds to the immersion?  Picking locks? Stealth?
---
This is seriously backward.  There’s no competitive advantage until someone exploits layer hopping.  Layering exists to ensure more players can play simultaneously without throttling each other.  
---
The problem is people abusing the ability to switch between layers to do something they know is not in the spirit of the game.  While I give people a pass on layer hopping to spawn the quest mob they need, things like resetting gathering nodes and instant AoE farm mobs respawns are plainly exploiting the system to achieve something the player knows he or she shouldn’t be able to.
---
The people abusing the system are the problem.  That includes you.  
---
Blizzard has a good track record of fixing or removing exploits, albeit slowly.  Those fixes are occasionally accompanied by bans.  Those bans are warranted because it’s the player abusing the system that is cancerous.  “Everybody else is doing it” is literally no defense.  Never has been and never will be, in or outside of WoW.
---
The best one in the game, or among the best at least. One that I have on my general playlist.
---
The only ignorant asshole here seems to be the person that reported a name for personal reasons... /shrug
---
nah the problem are the gnomes
---
Love my human warlock. While Humans may lack the strong lore examples that the Orcs have with Gul'dan and more. They have their own charm of living on the underside and the deep dark corners of stormwind. Humans as we know in real life have their good and bad apples. The Human Warlock trainers in stormwind are hidden beneath a bar/pub. But enough about lore.
---
The human starting zones are some of the oldest, best, and most detailed in the game. They spent more time on them than the other starting zones. So I highly recommend experiencing the early alliance leveling process at least once. that being said at 30+ things tend to merge and theirs more and more shared zones.
---
As for class quests Most of the warlock quests seem shared between horde and alliance. Or at least way to many of mine send me to the barrens as a human.
---
All that being said it doesn't really matter. Min/maxers will tell you which race/class combo is best. Hint its not humans. But play whatever appeals to you. Which is stronger nostalgia or wanting to experience something new.
---
Thank you very much.
---
Kromkrush is having an identity crisis.
---
Uhhh, WarCraft 3 when the orcs kill a ton of night elves, including their Demi God.
---
We should just call all dungeons by the initials of their last boss to avoid any confusion.
---
I go back and forth on going through the expacs and Classic+, but lately I've landed on my personal preference/dream that we get TBC and WotLK up to 3.2 basically unchanged. Everything was great about both of those, and that's 5+ years of content right there. 
---
It's been forever since I played Wrath, but I remember some fooling around with timelines and the past with the Bronze Dragonflight. Even a quest where you saw your future self IIRC. There's no reason that at the point we got Fall of the Lich King, we can't have a timeline altering event happen and that's when Classic+ could kick in where future content is developed independently of where we went. That means no sundering of the world by Deathwing (part of me died that day), and we can pick and choose the best parts of the other expansions but developed in a way that's true to what we enjoy about single-server/non-lfg Classic.
---
Exactly. Whoever was invited changed over to the party leader's layer. If you were watching carefully you probably would have seen other players phase out at the same time.
---
is this a new copypasta
---
I'm all for ganking, and I'm all for revenge ganking them back when you have a chance. That's part of the game man.
---
That said if there is actually a way to negate stealth then no, that shit should be fixed.
---
In short, stop getting mad about "fair fights" when you rolled on a PvP server.
---
This seems to be the case on some occasions. I’ve had it happen to me where i’ll be quickly changing targets and i’ll proc the overpower on the previous mob to quickly try and tab back and use it to only not be allowed to anymore.
---
You're not the same guy don't lie to me
---
I actually recommend him. It is wholesome entertainment.
---
That's right!!
---
Yeah, its like you don't have a whole mini-continent to yourselves that is a snot to even get to...
---
Are you jokin? Night Elf zones have some of the best detail and intricate design of any zones in the game.
---
You can only use overpower on the target that dodged. Duh.
---
Haha this is awesome, gnna try this when I lay down
---
**NO CHANGES**
---
Not sure if this is an unpopular opinion but I completely and entirely disagree with this. I have been leveling my Warrior solo and managed to get my WW Axe right when I hit 30.
---
How? I bought all the charms and liferoots from AH then teamed up with another warrior collecting the tusks. Finally to beat the cyclonian, I whispered a level 40 warrior in Alterac and asked if he was free to help. He said sure and brought his level 40 shaman over and beat it for me.
---
Even if you cannot beat the quest solo, there’s nothing stopping you from literally just asking for help. It forces you to make friends. Telling people to avoid this questline is not he right way to give advice imo.
---
The advise should be force yourself to make friends.
---
I have a job I can’t play that much
---
You should still put it in main hand
---
Staying Alliance Shazzrah. Got a good setup going and I can queue up remotely before most of my play sessions, so I'm just fine with the queues.
---
It's the old trope "bind on equip" shouldn't exist because it allows people to gear up without having earned it through RNG.  RNG being that age old gateway of how much time you can sink to beat the odds = how good people think you are.
---
You have to hit Exalted. It's a pretty long grind so I would probably buy your race's native mount first and do the rep grind later.
---
Shout out to the undead lmao
---
i did
---
 /cast pick pocket
---
/laugh
---
/cast cheap shot
---
i also used an addon for faster looting, this solved my issues. the emote gave enough time to resolve the loot before attacking closed the window
---
Pretty much yea, you can definitely heal low level dungeons as Ret, it just is kinda shitty to play.
---
Tanking... no never. 
---
Paladins absolutely suck to level, but get through the grind and get to 60, you will enjoy it much more.
---
Hahaha i love how upset you're getting. I'm really getting under your skin.
---
For me it’s a mix of realizing it’s triggering all of chat and legitimately my entire server in Vanilla called in VC or you were a noob. It was beaten into me. Guess other servers are different
---
I'm just curious when the mods are going to start removing threads that continue to use this picture to spread misinformation.
---
This picture is fake and serves absolutely no purpose in illustrating anything.
---
I am as much against layering as many people, but using a fake picture to try and make a point is just wrong.
---
This is horseshit.
---
Going down previous expansions (TBC, WotLK etc) would be a mistake. It will just lead to the same mistakes/changes being made - its pointless. 
---
The reason this idea has traction is down to the large amount of people who started in WotLK and want to play that.
---
A classic plus is the best bet - with ideas and patches voted on by the community.
---
Finding a somewhat worse or even better glove is a lot easier than farming 2k gold(not that I think it'll sell for even close to that much)
---
What if server demand is still high 6 months from now :(
---
It's not a bug, its intended. Just as rogues lose all combo points if they switch targets
---
Please do.  jesus christ.
---
Do any of those let you move things like the Loot window? Or the player / mob name window that pops up when you mouse over someone?
---
1 flight path, few guards, no class trainers. Mate this is most zones.
---
The 3200 arcane crystals are fake. He'd have had to be mining *literally* non-stop for 4½ days for the math on that to check out. Like 4½ days of swinging a mining pick at a rich thorium vein without pause.
---
The screenshot was not from a Classic server. The way the minimap looks inside the Org bank is how it is in the 1.12 client that private servers use. In Classic, you only see the bank building, not the surrounding city.
---
And finally, the claim of there being 25+ layers on one server is completely absurd. That simply isn't the case.
---
People do layer-hop to farm faster, but OP's story was a lie.
---
Rogues should be able to keep the stuff they get from locked chests.
---
Go fix a sammitch, watch the new season of your favorite show and come back
---
 well... 1 hour late.  Its like 10 second in blizzard time :)
---
They used statistics to determine how many servers they would need. They were waaaaay off
---
You can do this quite easily after around 25 BUT you either need a warlock or mage buddy to make it work efficiently.
---
Warlock pets you don't need to maintain at all, just resummon when they die.
---
Hunter pets really aren't too bad to manage for food/happiness to be honest. Hunter deadzone really isn't all bad either, you have melee abilities and a few ways to CC people to get back into ranged zone.
---
Mage is a ranged class that can self sustain due to unlimited food/water and great CC
---
That's the face of a Gorilla who's threat is no longer on your friend.
---
I remember that feeling as a night elf hunter too. Now in classic I got to experience it again in classic. 
---
Not having a mount gave me the chance to really admire it all over again.  It still is mind blowing!
---
Kill-on-cite. If someone referenced them, they must die.
---
Honestly it makes the game more enjoyable. Even when I was no-lifing last weekend I took the dogs on their morning and evening walks and it helped me get re-energized to play.
---
Well, APE clearing MC and Ony in the same day for world firsts was a pretty huge deal. Method didn’t come close to any world firsts afaik.
---
Oh hell yeah, and key word... WORLD
---
A lot of you didn’t actually play vanilla and it shows.
---
Classic alliance flightpaths are amazing, lol.
---
I enjoyed my warlock until I did some dungeons. Shadowbolt spam is mind numbing. Dots made me go OOM in all of 5 seconds.
---
Did you just basically tell me you're a chud?
---
Being an alliance warlock is not all that bad. Consider that just as undead can mess with you, you can smash rogues as a human or mages/druids as a gnome (escape artist).
---
Additionally, because people are worried about the wotf problem and don't roll alliance, warlocks are in slightly higher demand for raiding alliance side.
---
It would be extremely difficult. You need to be exalted with their major city. To do that most people created a character and went straight to the leveling zone of the race they wanted to get the mount for and they did all of those quests to get rep with that group. You should aim to get your epic mount as another race and save yourself a headache.
---
To be fair, it was a massive upgrade for me too.
---
This ! It was always this way in vanilla
---
What graphics do you get? Because on my 2017 one it literally won’t change from 1 settings no matter what I try.
---
Etiquette is important.  You got to the chest with the groups help.  Would you have gotten the chest without them?  Always roll.
---
Absurd way for top Streamer to show the game to players... like Spaming trash in Scarlet Monsatery.. 
---
How is that representing the charisma of wow ??
---
Yeah it sounded like one, until I talked to my trainer. 80s per skill upgrade at lvl 27 :(
---
Hey not all of us are dirty savages. Some are just regular zombies. And we live in human made cemeteries and mausoleums !
---
As a rogue, you always roll on chests whether they’re locked or not. It’s proper dungeon etiquette. I see what you’re saying though, when I first started playing a rogue I felt the same way, decided I was wrong after every single time it became an issue.
---
Sorry my lock picking isn't high enough.  Dungeon ends, walk back to chest and loot is yours.  Or just roll, whatever is in there isn't going to change your life.
---
Yoo you got me all kinds of ripped reading this. I'm on your side man if you happen to be on Kromcrush and care for a helping horde teammate send me a PM I will join you in your hunt.
---
Ganking a low level is forfeiting enough to allow cheating from a 3rd party addon? I don't think so.
---
Pwnd!
---
Or like.... strafe....
---
I personally don’t think you’ll have the mana to take advantage of the cool down reduction on mind blast until 60 or atleast mid 50 so I take silence instead.
---
Yeah but it wasn't that much faster than the 5 mans you can (and could) do.
---
"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.
---
You have a great day now."
---
If you couldn't hop layers then you couldn't play with friends/guildies on same realm who happen to be on a different layer.
---
Layers allow massive populations to live in a small space but exist in the same realm without being forced into instances.
---
If every time you grouped you got instanced that would suck.
---
More servers would also suck since when the honeymoon phase ends (and it will) you would have a ton of low pop servers...
---
If they didn't do layering and just forced massive over population then questing would be more difficult than it already is.
---
This was actually a thing in vanilla. People used warlock fear to get into old ironforge too
---
If you have the scepter it zones you in at the waterfall
---
No, you see, all those guilds must be colluding to horde thousands of these materials then sell it at inflated prices to the rest of the server!
---
Except that the ones who want the materials would be the ones farming them.  And would be the ones with the gold to afford it.  Regardless of what the economy looks like, a guild can gear up and raid without spending one copper on the AH.  None of the consumables and gear that are being horded are needed to raid.  They make it easier and allow more room for mistakes.  And even still, once the raid is being farmed, the gear and consumables are even less important.  No rogue wants devilsaur when he is in full T1.  Why would you want a flask for MC content when your guild is farming without it?  When BWL launches, that will have a huge demand for flasks but by then, prices will have stabilized and those who are trying to 'monopolize' resources will have given up.
---
It's a modified version of sharding that is continent-wide rather than zone or area-wide, as it is in retail.
---
So its not a bug
---
Not an oversight
---
Working as designed
---
Who are to say we are abusing the system? Until blizzard says something we dont know.
---
Which wasn't the same guy saying both of those things.
---
Still no actual argument? Damn, you're really bad at this.
---
in case you didnt know , you are currently standing at the top of a tree
---
In phase yo you can just pvp for gear. And I raided showed in vanilla. Dont listen to people they are all retarded
---
You get to control what your character does and doesn't do. If you're in a party of strangers and they /roll for a chest and ask you to unlock it, you have every right to refuse their request.
---
By the same token, those players are also in control of what they do and don't do. And they have every right to kick you from the party.
---
You're allowed to make any choices you want, but this is a social game, and your choices will carry consequences with them.
---

Neither do I. OP wtf.

You don't deserve him.
---
I have a question what would one need a bank alt for ?
---
Probably not enough data at this point to determine market value, i'd hold onto it until more people have more gold.
---
since you're the last to leave, its "your instance" now. so you either have to backtrack all the way to the beginning, die and ghost walk back to the instance entrance, or hearthstone.
---
I'm a Rogue now and in vanilla, I've always had people roll on the chests. I just unlock it and the person who wins gets it.

If theres multiple miners you do roll for the node... where have you been? The group got to the chest not you alone. Everyone rolls for the loot.
---
Everyone? lol 
---
At no point did I try to call "everyone" anything.
---
dude is quitting cause classic is not the same as his pserver experience. Also he's unaware of phases.
---
We Always used /roll...
---
BUT
---
The rogue could roll twice 👌
---
Layering needs to be undone immediately imo.
---
For portability, would you rather do this or bring a laptop?
---
you can just type 'deadmines' it won't kill ya
---
My viewpoint has ALWAYS been that if you can unlock a chest (rogue or blacksmithing) you get that chest. If multiple people can, they roll between themselves.
---
If you were not there the chest would not be opened so it does not affect anyone outside of those able to unlock it, period.
---
If some green drops that someone else needs as an upgrade it is kind and good of you to hand it over, and I'd usually stop grouping with someone who didnt do that, but it's not absolutely required.
---
If it's a purple, you should group roll, but again not required. If you dont though, be prepared for some hate.
---
They kill things slowly is why - at least until you get more points in your talents. Levels 10 to 35 are probably the most painful point. Yes, you don't die but you also take much longer than many other classes to actually kill anything. And yes, I know about spirit tap and wands. I've leveled a priest 3x now during vanilla/classic.

As a British person who has lived here for 28 years I have encountered about 5 people who know anything other than the name “Lebron James”.

Compared to America, a very small percentage of people from other countries know any basketball terminology.

I appreciate it’s a hard concept to grasp.

Fake news.

As a horde priest, I approve of this message.  Do not let them fool you because they will attack you from behind at the first chance they get when they group up.

Love to see this as well, Like the look of most of this, but i NEED those unit frames for healing.
---
What most people mean by no changes is no changes till naxx
---
The economy is a game all of its own.
---
/r/woweconomy is it's own sub (though it caters more to retail), where many of the addons and theories apply to classic.
---
Why would I want to veiw trash content from someone self promoting? That's what porns for

Get rid of titan oanel and dare I say it.. it's a good one.

Good to know, thanks! Considering switching, had a 6 hour queue over the long weekend lol.
---
Where do you farm the runecloth?
---
So cath is insanely good xp. You're gonna be dissappointed in ZF. I'd say maybe 42 though.
---
I read somewhere they have 25% stun resist too, but I don’t play horde
---
Foreword: My mains are always druids, and my first alt is always a warlock.
---
Your issues with the hunter class are valid and widespread, hence why they eventually dropped the ammo requirement and amended the food/skills, too. But to play devil's advocate - warlocks are very similar with shards. The minion leveling is far simpler than pet leveling, but I truly feel like leveling a pet creates more of an appreciation/fondness for that particular pet. My minions are just minions (and the new[?] voice animations are kind of terrifying lol).
---
As for PvE and PvP outcomes, I think it's kind of a wash between warlock and hunter - just on different sides of the spectrum. Hunters start out very balanced and appropriately powered after getting T1 gear, whereas warlocks don't fully come into their own until T2.5+. For PvP, both can be powerhouses in 1v1 and 1v? in certain scenarios, but a warlock will be better overall in 1v1 and a hunter will win-out in 1v?
---
If you're feeling unsure, maybe roll a lock to ~16 just to try it out? They are definitely a fun, engaging class, and they are second only to hunters for leveling speed.
---
Why do you say they are unnecessary?
---
So jokes are saying completely counterfactual nonsense now? Good one. 
---
Doesn't sound like satire to me, sounds like you said that in complete ignorance and want to back track it now. Whatever.
---
Negligible HPS from Imp. Drain Life, where the 5 points are better spent in something else, Imp. Healthstone + Siphon Life which don't require you to channel would likely net more of a total HPS and DPS gain over the course of a fight than the Imp. Drain Life with all 5 points sunk into it. Keeping in mind ofc that you can STILL use the base Drain Life as you please, on top of the better talent selections.
---
Edit:  the most serious sub for wow that I’ve found is r/warcraftlore
---
I'm on Kurinnaxx and Alliance and there is a ton of people for me. So many I am having a hard time leveling because of the population doing the same quests as me. Could just be timing.
---
How about you explain it to us then, genius?
---
It’s a thing. When I switch inputs after I’ve started wow, sound will switch for all apps other than wow. Have to close wow and restart for sound to switch to headphones properly, or disable my speakers.
---
I have had this as my wallpaper on my work computer for about a month. Such a good picture.
---
I know you're trolling. But yes, willful ignorance genuinely upsets me, because it's a bigger problem than "OP doesn't know how to take a screenshot."
---
From what I've read, pets will refuse to eat anything 30 levels lower than their current level. I haven't tested this, but I feed my pet stuff that drops from monsters with no level req. all the time.

Adolf is a name. It's not a Nazi name, it's a name.

Sure there was a bad dude named Adolf who was a Nazi, but he wasn't a Nazi cause his name was Adolf.

This is the most pathetic reply I've seen on reddit today.
---
So satisfying.  
---
Yesterday I was questing in arathi, I got jumped by a gnome mage at 25% hp.   
---
Change to travel form, high tail it out of there, put some distance between us, heal up, CAT FORM, PROWL, SNEAK.
---
I make my way back to where he is leveling, and the fool is fighting mobs. Boy. You just interrupted my questing and you think you can just continue on with your merry adventures? I ravage him from stealth, burst him down to 10%, and he frost novas and blinks away. Bitch. I got moonfire.   
---
So I cast some moonfire on him and he RUNS INTO A FARMHOUSE with 4 mobs inside of it. I didn't even chase him in, I just waited at the door and hear him get pwn by some arathi farmhands.   
---
You could have just let me be, idiot.
---
There's also the fact that they're more frustrated, because, well... I love Classic, but let's be honest here, the higher you level, the less well-designed the game becomes (generally). I don't mean in terms of class design, I mean like, geography, quest hubs, sensible level banding, and so forth.
---
Yeah gl in raids with no tanks
---
Depends.. Ppl doesn't need to group up for everything, only elite quests.
---
At lower lvls there are a lot of classes who struggle to kill a simple mob.
---
But yeah, It will never be like the first 3 days of launch because we were all in the honeymoon phase.
---
I'm sure those are great for ergonomics but it looks like you left your mouse on your dashboard on the hottest day of the year.
---
Did you see the cluster of a thread about spy yesterday? The mental gymnastics people are doing to justify its existence is mind blowing.  
---
"LOL it doesn't do anything the combat log doesn't do! Everything spy does you can do yourself"  
---
Yeah OK. My combat log doesn't automatically alert me to the name, level, class, and coordinates of an enemy player, and if they've entered stealth or not the instant they do something within sight range. I mean, using a bot to level my character or gather materials doesn't do anything I can't do either, so where do we draw the line with automation?
---
The only add-on for me is immersion. I can't ever go back to reading quests without it.
---
Mostly the stealth, I feel. When I mained a Mage, I would occasionally use Invisibility to sneak past an enemy for an objective or whatnot, but as a Rogue, stealth feels more like a part of me, rather than a tool. In dungeons, I absolutely love waiting in a doorway as the tank pulls back for los, then cheapshotting the last sucker to walk by, absolutely eliminating their ability to contribute to their cause, as they watch their friends unknowingly leave them behind as the last thing they ever see.
---

---
Why should I listen to such a clearly disturbed individual?
---
&gt;almost zero demand for any end game items?
---
of course  there's zero demand since there's a surplus of mats mate
---
there's suppose to be limited resources in classic, but instead there's a surplus
---
why buy anything when u can get everything u need in under an hour? and yes i literally watched someone get over 20 devilsaur leather in around 30-40 minutes. while on a server with very few layers.
---
+ my own experiences (ive been 60 for around 2 days.)
---
Right now I'm levelling as arms and tanking has been a challenge, mostly because of rage issues.
---
Once I hit the mid 40s I'll switch to prot. Block talents will make rage easier, and shield slam will make aggro easier (because of 1.12 threat).
---
They absolutely can. I'd say baring huge level differences and the go into this castle full of elites and kill a group of named elites quests they can solo most if not all elite or "tougher" quests
---
&gt; wth
---
This is my point well laid out above with fights being friendly to it.  But thank you for your input.
---
I'd love to see something like this for each capital city
---
Wow that escalated quickly
---
Because fury tanking is a thing
---
I have to disagree w/you Fanatic. Getting your first 60% ground mount is a rite of passage. I didn't get mine on my Rogue until I was almost 43 and when I marched all the way back to Darnassus to get my saber mount. I never felt so satisfied buying my riding skill and summoning my Black Saber for the first time. Some say on that day my heart grew three sizes...and then I abruptly got the diabetus.
---
This screenshot is from a private server...
---
Haha, n00b...just kidding welcome to the game. Have fun ;)
---
Raids / end game dungeons tanks are required.
---
The *classic* explanation, if you will.
---
Do you mean while leveling? Everyone levels in dps spec, healers and tanks included. That's just how vanilla was.
---
No normal gamer has time for that, switch and be happy.
---
or...* *adjusts tin foil hat* * it's so you're in game longer so blizz can leech you for your sub money!
---
/who for finding people  
---
/emote for custom emotes  
---
/lol or /laugh for trolls especially (best laugh)  
---
/train for taurens (hilarious)  
---
/roll for rolling on loot. /roll will automatically do 1-100  
---
/point for pointing at stuff  
---
All of the default emotes are useful because a lot of them have animations and other faction members can see most of them. Custom emotes will not be seen by the enemy faction (it'll say you make a weird gesture)
---
How much does a stack of heavy silk bandages vendor for

But, the alliance races are just Human, tall human, short human, and shorter human.

Isn't fury tanking not viable till AQ or around there?
---
I'm currently level 21 and i have done every quest in westfall and the ones in lakeshire around my level. The quests that are remaining in lakeshire are simply to high for me. I can't go into duskwood since every quest there is even higher. Should i just do Deadmines until 25?
---
I dont know why blizzard do that phase bullshit. Just upload the full vanilla content.
---
It might not be a dead realm with no economy in the present, but 2 or 3 months down the line its most likely going to be a ghost town.

Son of a bitch. I know what add-on to get now.

so yes
---
Do you guys not have Steam?
---
Was running SFK last night and this came up.
---
Party leader would loot chests and then tell people to roll for the items (weird, and he would keep any none greens which I thought was cheeky) then trade them what they won. We came upon a locked chest, the rogue unlocked it and looked to find the Redbeard Crest which I, a warrior, could have used but opted to Greed on it as it's a twink item. Some hunter won, the rogue looted the shield anyway and they got into a huge fight about it with the Rogue claiming we never would have gotten the item, the hunter claiming he won it fair and square. It was a mess.
---
Imo you roll for the chest before you see what's in there, if you unlock it or not. That said I'm gonna level blacksmithing and use keys to avoid the situation in the future.
---

Damn this was me in the kurzen cave in northern stv. So mob dense and their respawns are super fast.

That's not the point, he's saying that these people are farming really really expensive endgame mats. Eventually they will be worth as much.
---
Funny, that's what I say about the mobile experience.
---
That's oddly specific!

The reason wow got so popular was because it was designed to appeal to casual players. It was always easy

Was this Whitemane? He was just there a few min ago when I was there. First time ever seeing him. Is it a world boss or something?
---
Wow is still one of the most played MMO RPGs. I hate retail as much as the next guy but misinformation doesn't serve any purpose.
---
it does, and it gets expensive fast. Don't respec if you can help it.
---
The lower level cats around nessingwary's camp? Or the slightly higher ones further out? or does it not matter since they all drop the same things?

I just found it, thank you!

As a bear I still have issue with threat with some classes but PreHot pulls give me lots of AOE threat. Been pretty manageable
---
First and probably the last time I'll say this; THANKS FOR THE GOLD KIND STRANGER!

Very nicely done. I've never liked the minimalist look UI myself. I'm going for the maximalist look. I'll have to post mine when I feel it's at a good spot.
---
That's quite the mental gymnastics you got there.
---
That so easy to fix, click on your horse icon and the tab is called Toys I think is next to the Heirlooms, on there click on the Toy that unlocks all flight paths for Kalimdor and EK, assuming you bought the toys to unlock these flight paths. Then go back to the flight master and you should see all other flight paths avaiable.

Sooner or later Stitches will sneak upon you and mash you to death. It’s inevitable.

No Survivalist? Hunters have no way to heal natively and Stam is king in pvp. You want health...a lot of it.

Really feel like entrapment is noob bait. Only useful trap that procs it is frost. But Freeze is so juicy for Aimed Shots and getting distance.

 That extra HP will help more in the long run.

Too many noob ass mages wearing to Aoe grind dungeons

When I have been with multiple miners everyone taps once for the skill and the ore

Why? Pretty sure they can sell at whatever price they want.

Well that’s gonna suck for us later on, if you’re right!

Cuz people forget Melee cleave can speed clear too. Wf totem is insane with warriors and rogues and ofc shammys windfury is also nice. Had a group clearing SM Lib in almost under 12mins with 4wars 1shaman all Level 35 or lower

When you say dumb shit that SJW's say, like calling harmless jokes "racist", you're probably a SJW. You people and your victim complex's are really weird...

Wand toggles on. You press it once and it just keeps shooting. You shouldn't have to spam it.
---
Keybinding is muscle memory. You may feel a bit overwhealmed because at15 is when you start having a lot of stuff but I would recommend you to keep trying
---
 Focus on the basics and go from there. Hunters are among the easy classes tho maybe mages would have less keybindigns since you have a pet and all that.
---
Go skowly and you will learn I would not worry that much.
---
Half of them were 55.

Sephiroth with a speech impediment?

My wife and I have to use a system to ensure we don't do this with our cat. We found out we'd been feeding the cat 3-4 times a day because she would get fed, eat very quickly, then come tell the other one she needed fed. Twice a day. Gotta watch cats man. Now we have to ask the other each and every time before we feed her 😂
---
naaah it'll be different this time.....nobody will feed him.....
---
Warrior is more straightforward but shaman are crazy fun
---
Maybe in high end raiding, were running dungeon atm like this
---
Thanks. That's a good perspective to have.
---
Am I wrong though or is it still like 800g less because you don’t have to buy the riding skill?
---
It's like algebra, one enraged cancels the other and your left with just a normal rock elemental lol
---
I was also thinking in a pvp and solo pve context. I'm hitting 40 now and getting Bloodthirst to see how it performs, but if dropping flurry, bloodthirst and death wish, I might as well not put any talent into fury since the fun spells are gone.
---
Fuckin meta
---
You think Blizzard put this in explicitly so that a small group of people with questionable morals could ruin the game's economy? Are you fucking serious? "Sorry for not saving the drowning victim, but how was I supposed to know he wanted to be rescued when he couldn't tell me?" They most likely knew there was the potential for the mechanic to be abused, sure, but it was considered a necessary evil because the hoards of people concentrated in a few zones at launch was going to present serious issues for both playability and server stability, and layering was the most feasible option for avoiding them.
---
It's really not your point at all, though. You're saying if you're a good paladin tank, you can make it work.
---
A good warrior can cover for bad dps. Even a perfect paladin can't. You make the dps's job much harder.
---
The point of being good is that you can carry someone bad. A good tank will always make the run smooth, even if dps is retarded and healer is playing on a potato. Paladins don't really have the kit for that.
---
I play later in the evening and early morning hours but so far bigglesworth has felt equal to me as well.
---
You missed the slaughterfest of lvl 30's stomping on sub lvl 25 players
---
You know what you’re talking about but posted a fake screenshot to support your argument rather than an actual screenshot from Classic? I know layers mess with the economy; I have layer hopped to loot a chest or kill a static rare spawn several times in a row while leveling since I was way ahead of the pack, and the more hardcore guilds will definitely have decent stockpiles of flasks. But you are blowing the issue out of proportion.
---
What does the c-1 on certain spell mean what button is that?
---
As a warrior, every mob fight feels this way.   
---
If we're lucky :D
---
Obviously no one knows the future, but once the " novelty" of Classic wears off and the hype dies down so will the overall population.
---
We clearly don't know just how much it will die down, but you can be guaranteed it will.
---
A major thing contributing to the overall queue number is people putting in a large amount of hours every day to level up. Once your average person hits 60 they won't "need" to log so many hours every day.
---
As more and more people hit 60 fewer and fewer will need to login everyday.
---
I'm not saying we shouldn't have this discussion. I'm simply saying I feel it's too early to really worry about this just yet.
---
Will Blizz remove layers, add more servers, and offer more free transfers? Maybe
---
Could Blizz limit the amount of layers generated per server to help crack down to layer hopping? Maybe
---
Could Blizz somehow implement a limit on how often someone can switch layers? Maybe. There is already a time limit in place to prevent you from switching after pvp combat. 
---
What if they added a general time limit between switching layers? Sure people could still abuse it simply because we'd still have the ability to switch layers, but it would at least slow down the rate at which people could switch to farm.
---
the story unfolded a bit differently on my layer, so im staying horde
---
Hunter is literally the easiest leveling class lol
---
I vendor all pages. No regrets.
---
I have not. It is Lightning shield &gt; Earth Shock &gt; Fire totem &gt; earth totem &gt; water totem
---
recruiting for guild &lt;BROKEN HUNTARD&gt;
---
we are a guild whos sole purpose is to camp and kill broken tooth on all layers so hunters can never tame it.
---
any level doesnt matter as long as you can contribute to the death of broken tooths then you can join. NO HUNTERS ALLOWED.
---
I was invited to heal one of those we dont need a tank dungeons.
---
2 mages, 2 arms warriors and myself as a priest.
---
Basically one warrior "tank" pulled and was able to hold aggro on only one of the 3-4 elites. The mages would try and AOE but they are out of mana and running around each with an elite on them.
---
So I am left with a choice....
---
Do I heal the mages, who have no mana and keep them alive or do I heal everyone else. It's a mess.
---
I'll take any dungeon run with an actual tank over this tanks are not necessary BS. :/
---
How did you get that list as worst classes?
---
1. Druids get Bear form at 10 allowing tanking, and cat form at 20. You can cast a few spells shift to cat, dps mobs, then pop out to heal at full mana. Super easy. They get travel form and bonus speed in cat and have almost no down time. 
---
2. Priest is always in demand for groups as a healer, you can level in shadow spec and heal upto almost 60 without being healer specced. Shadow spec is great defense wise and with spirit tap and wand spec you can regen all your mana after your initial dps burts by wanding. The leveling curve is very smooth.
---
3. Warlock is almost as easy as hunter. You get a pet at level 10 to tank for you, and it is very cozy to just throw your DOTS on stuff and then have the pet tank. You can drain tank. You are always wanted in groups for summoning as well.
---
Deadmines for Alliance starts at 16 (not recommended).
---
You also have to consider that most people are in the 30-45 level range right now. Most probably wont have a lot of gold to begin with. Everybody will either be saving for or would have just bought their mount. It's not a bad BoE. I'd personally hang on to it for right now.
---
Get the Staff from the wailing caverns quest(Leaders of the Fang?). +7 stam +7 spirit and 20 ish DPS
---
There was actually an addon for this back in the day... I can't remember the name of it, but you could add enemies to a "black-list"
---
As someone that did play in OG Vanilla, this being a later, more "balanced" patch means that the OG feel that is remembered was developed over the months or years that were played prior to this patch.
---
To me, this feels like a better leveling experience than retail simply because it involves more time with the original content as opposed to speeding you through to the new content.
---
It feels great to be back so far.
---
Where is my book that teaches all the FPs?
---
Played Night Elf Warrior in Vanilla til MoP, then stopped and started Classic as a Troll Warrior. Was happy until I went to Ashenvale and got night elf nostalgia.
---
Lol at people who said this would take months
---
[It is indeed inevitable](https://imgur.com/a/eknc8fn).
---
I haven't waited a second on my server. Just go to a medium population server and there likely isn't any lines.
---
This is hilarious, thanks for providing entertainment for all of us. There will always be someone who can put more time into the game than you, if that’s what you base your enjoyment on, then don’t let the door hit you on the way out. PvP is about outsmarting and teaming up to beat the enemies, there’s always a way to win. 
---
Also hand of rag takes something ridiculous like 8k gold to make, so its not like everyone’s going to be running around with legendaries. You let your imagination scare you into canceling your subscription.

lol true, I swear I was playing on Whitemane and it was PvE.
---
Where the fuck am I playing?
---
Nervermind I confused Whitemane with Westfall. IT SHOULD BE A BIGGER TIP.
---
No shortage of priests atm so you should be able to find a partner
---
I will always take a pally! The utility is incredible! Just hit stuff and heal until you are needed to save the entire group in a pinch 👌
---
Can someone show me a video or something of this ACTUALLY being abused? There are a bunch of #outrage people blowing up the subreddit today but no one has actually demonstrated layering being abused like this. I've seen like one dude get layered in my \~30 hours in game or so. 
---
I just don't believe its remotely as big of a problem as everyone is making it out to be. I was SUPER down on layers during beta but I think they've done a pretty kick ass job so far personally.
---
I've always been drawn to the dwarves and tauren lore. Recently I started sympathizing with undead and how they're trying to just survive. I really like the quest lines and how they barely have time to grieve, and are forced to move on.
---
I agree
---
remember you can also do stackades :D you should be lvl 22 - 24 first tough but if you get bored of deadmines just go to stockades, also theres gonna be some quests for stockades too which are gonna give you some nice xp EDIT: and if ur feeling adventurous and dont mind little walking you can also do wailing caverns
---
true that
---
This hits close to home
---
You can go do Loch Modan and Dark Shores, and then once you hit 23 you can do Stockades -&gt; BFD. You should be 25 by then.
---
I downloaded it through the twitch app.
---
Seriously who gives a shit, get a fucking life.
---
Do you want 5 hour ques? Because this is how you get 5 hour ques.
---
5 sword special is basically 1% hit. So for rogues and tanks you need 1% less hit on gear which means rogues and fury wars can use a second dps trinket instead of a +hit trinket and tanks have a easier time tanking
---
A true player never leaves The Horde.

"MOM, BUCKET!!!!"

*MMMPHRRRRGHHHH UHHHHN*

Like a tampon it soaks it up ... Then you eat it... Boom bleed go bye bye.
---
That isn't often an option when dealing with a bunch of folks just out to gank I a big group and it's beside the point, organizing a counter raid would take time, fighting them would waste even more time. Time is the most limited and important resource in the game. Layering is the ideal solution. 
---
Camping Alliance once I hit 60 will be my real medicine.
---
The fact you think the word "noggers" is normalizing racism shows how oblivious and obsessed over outrage culture you are. 
---
There is nothing blinded here lol, just dumbasses like your self too stupid to laugh at a harmless joke without taking it out of context just so you can pretend to be superior to other people. So yes, you are a text book example of a SJW, it doesn't take much critical thinking to realize that.

Surely you can agree an add-on like that is by no means comparable to actual boting.

I know people always make fun of the horde by saying “think of the smell!” But Ironforge is literally filled with open pits of lava. Lava has sulfur, and sulfur smells like rotten eggs. Still an epic city, but it probably gets pretty musty in there.

---
You sure he hadn't been logging?
---
You literally just reworded my comment. In other words you would never see anyone under level 45 as long as you were 45+ and vice versa. You're basically splitting the server into two quasi-servers based on level. It's not a good idea and doesn't solve the problems that are caused by layering in the first place. Too hard to understand?

I thought it was lvl 53

I thought PVP doesn’t cause any durability loss in gear. It’s only PVE mechanics that cause this.

To be fair, a good number of folks, myself included, are loving Classic but really wish for either a BC/Wrath-locked experience.  The success of Classic makes that more likely, thus the anticipation.
---
Don't get me wrong, I am loving Classic right now and plan to spend many, many months here, but if a Wrath server dropped tomorrow, I would be very tempted to switch over...
---
Yeah, FOR SURE. I deleted a toon that blizzard won’t let me un-delete per Classic rules because I reused the name...so if they allow this bull crap I’m gonna be pretty miffed.
---
any advice what class to play in wow classic? i never played vanilla.
---
my story class is this.
---
my first class was hunter in mist of pandaria
---
and then
---
Demon hunter in legion
---
i want to play a easy solo lv class for vanilla, is mage good? i not want try hunter again or a melee class

---
*Laughs in druid*
---
That’s because everything besides FF14 is trash
---
Unpopular opinion, but I actually think Blizz got something wrong. I could be wrong, but If I was forced to bet money, I would say they got some stuff wrong. **Please, let me explain...**
---
I played the crap out of Vanilla. I started in June 2005 and played non-stop till 2010 (probably an average of 40 hours a week).
---
Now popular opinion is: *Many of us remember the game being much harder than it really was during vanilla because we just sucked at the game.* However, When I started WoW I was already a veteran from others MMOs (mostly EQ). I probably peaked as a gamer around 2014, but I know for a fact I did not suck at WoW in 2005. I remember I was comfortable with 18 hotkeys back then, but I think by WotLK I had become used to the 39 hotkey setup I have used ever since.
---
5 Months ago when I first realized that WoW Classic was actually going to be happening, I started playing on Light's Hope P-Server to quench my thirst. There was a few things that felt "off". There was just some mobs/spells/abilities that were way too strong. Overall though, the experience felt correct.
---
Now that I am playing on Classic, it mostly feels correct, except that some things also feel "off". In contradiction to Light's Hope, there is just some things that feel way too easy.
---
And please don't use the argument, "*Blizzard has the original code so there is no way it is wrong*".
---
1. Blizzard has always made mistakes and got things wrong. They are only human.
---
2. They have even been known to change things without telling the players. I'm sure this isn't often, but if you really want to then you can dig up plenty of cases.
---
3. Programming and databases are not as straight forward as you think. There is a ton of room for variable errors and unintended errors that will not flag themselves. In programming these are called logical errors and a project such as WoW Classic would be stuffed full of them. They have imported data, methods, classes, and procedures from 2004 into their 2019 code. It is a pretty impressive feat. But trust me, I'm sure 90% of their time was testing the game and saying "hmm that doesn't seem quite right... I wonder why" and tracing through their functions in debug mode to see why it's not handling things correctly. I am %100 sure that some of these have slid by into release.
---
Noted
---
It's been like a week and a half... you got awhile before we know anything about this
---
Faerlina is also one of the most populated servers because of the streamers.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if it was also one of the most abused and exploited through layering.
---
Blue racists (am playing NE atm)
---
Hi, /u/setonos

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d051m7/are_there_any_forsaken_only_pvp_guilds/). 
---
not that I know of, but typically, there is only one per zone, so usually wherever your faction has a foothold in the region.
---
Rogues are less gear dependent. They pretty much only need theur tier gear and some weapons.
---
Not that mace spec is worth a shit but you can get the mace (3.4 speed) and still get the bonus as a human. It's pretty easy to get 31 deep in arms w/o taking weapon specific nodes.
---
Yeah that might be right!
---
Consecration, it's a Holy talent
---
At what level?
---
You get in your own little instanced version of the game with a ton of other people.
---
and I am pretty sure having layered zones is possible, as oppose to having this server wide shit that is being abused to oblivion and keeps gutting the economy every day that is passing.
---
16-24
---
sounds like you and your wife need an extra dps :)
---
Wait, are the peggle and bejewled addons working with classic??
---
You’ve put in an incredible amount of work! Looks great. Will you consider putting this as a “pack” with WTF and Interface folders so it all comes configured just how you have it?
---
Really??? Bruh go watch the cinamatic. Thrall uses magic instead of beating it out like a true orc
---
I'm saying if the fight is friendly to it.  Paladins also make excellent threat, but lack taunt as is their downfall.  
---
Also, I absolutely love it when people online presume to know sentiment better than the author.  Good on ya mate, you are clearly a superior human being.
---
I disagree about the BC part, I think they did a great job with that expansion. Some of the best raids/dungeons imo. The only thing I could do without is flying.
---
Every time I see a hunter or rogue running around with robes of arugal I just laugh and hope that they didn't screw a caster over to get them.
---
Yeah for people who have done the fight for years on private servers
---
For a level 15 instance?
---
Report it as a bug

Hunter has a lot of binds, but a very easy rotation. You shouldn't need to be using more than 7 keys that are actually core ability binds:
---
Pet attack/follow toggle
---
Auto shoot
---
Conc shot
---
Hunter's mark
---
Wing clip
---
Serpent sting
---
Multishot
---
And that's basically it? Sure, there's a bunch of things that can use additional key binds, like FD/arcane shot/traps; but you can condense a ton of those down with macros and you don't need to keybind things like aspects, all the pet abilities, tracking, etc. You don't need to bind everything when your main rotation is going to be three keys, mark/pet attack/auto shoot and maybe serpent sting.
---
I was able to snag some great names on the normal PVP servers that were released after launch, so I decided to hop on and check them out before choosing where to play. And wow, the chat and character names were so horrendous!
---
Compare this to Grob (where I'm currently playing), and it's a world of difference! Sure, you still have some mean people here and there, and people with unpleasant character names, but it's far less frequent.
---
If you're looking for a server with less toxicity (and you yourself aren't a mean person), then I think RP-PVP realms are so much better! Just make sure you choose an RP-friendly name and respect people who are RPing, and you'll be fine.
---
Hasn't been a problem for me? Maybe try asking nicely?
---
Just look at the server types and populations and decided based on that. Do you want a big server with a large community but a lot of competition for resources, or the other way around? Do you want to do a lot of PvP and/or RP?
---
As for faction balances, I haven't seen any data about that unfortunately.
---
Probably one of the RP-PVP realms will be close to balanced. There is no concrete data at this time.
---
Haha I know you’re jokingly saying that but I do wish it were that easy and worked out like that.
---
What about when you're underwater fighting a boss in say BFD and that warlock has that sweet sweet underwater breathing they could use on you...but by your logic, they are the lock and you wouldn't have the buff without them so does he really need to give it you you?
---
We all need eachother equally and it varies case by case. Be kind. Show some manners and respect.  Roll for the fucking chests locked or not 100%.
---
Kill on site implies that it would be in a specific location rather than when you see them.
---
I thought MC wasn’t out yet?
---
Just got a replacement put in ;)
---
I feel like you could get banned for this. Hitting a key at nearly the exact same interval for hours at a time looks pretty suspicious.
---
This one is easy, go 100% with Night Elf. The absolutely irrelevant racials should never be a deciding factor. You already know this because of your paladin race decision. A few stoneskins here and there are nothing compared to playing what you enjoy, and specifically human priests and night elf priests are basically identical.
---
Thing is that it’s not hard to beat the game into dust. A .2% increase dps won’t be the difference.
---
Even going for high warlord just time spent will matter most, and coordination with other players.
---
&gt;And what problems were there with TBC?
---
Extreme faction imbalance(worst of any version of WoW) which also results in faction servers (as opposes to vanillas ~50/50), death of world pvp, Outlands, a lot of conveniences that makes the game worse (like summoning stones + portals in shattrath + flying).  Wellfare epics/guaranteed rewards, daily quests. Bad 5 man dungeons that you have to farm forever to grind reputation. Horde pallys are better than alliance. One multifaction capital.
---
My biggest gripe with the expansion is how shit it is for faction balance tbh, convenciences also suck dick but Outland isn't a content that is big enough for 2 factions, so instead you get alliance and horde servers (where horde is objectively the stronger faction for both PvP and PVE since there is no longer a pally/shaman meta)
---
meanwhile my dog is sick of me because my sub lapsed this morning and for whatever reason my payment isnt processing :(
---
The other day in Thousand Needles I accidentally blinked into one of the spires. Then I went to the Kalimdor loading screen. Then I got disconnected. Then I rejoined with my character, went to the Kalimdor loading screen again, then to a blank grey screen, and finally showed up outside of RFK.
---
On the plus side, I found a group for RFK!
---
Streamers make money regardless of WoW or whatever, being entertaining or a thot is all they have to do nobody gives two shits about what they are actually doing, plus there's a difference between a job and a game. 
---
I'm saying it's worthless and not an achievement because it's not a race anymore, nor is it impressive, unlike years ago the people doing the content now have so many advantages it's borderline cheating and not impressive at all. Boss mods, voice chat, pre-planning, video explanations, private servers, and minor improvements/changes (layering) all make it hollow. There's no point in being competitive about who get's where first in PVE since they are already at an advantage because they are running on the legacy of the first raids that did it. 
---
And people do say the same about Everest, it's become a garbage dump/grave yard from all the people that want to say they did something and try to rush up it and fail.
---
You're the first to admit all of this.  I have received numerous replies how MC was so easy, that gear had nothing to do with it, that when 1.12 patch came out, MC became so easy that noobs could be literally walked through it.
---
What you said makes more sense and supports my experience.  Some random guy in the guild wasn't able to just request to join a raiding party that had been working on MC regularly.  We had to show we knew what we were doing by being successful in things like 10-man UBRS.

"clever use of game mechanics" is what they call exploits that don't get you banned.

Moreso. Enchantings purpose is upgrades. It makes no sense to deny a upgrade for a fraction of a future one.

Or you can get the add on I said. Without having to deal with ElvUi.

When I am sitting in a queue of 2-3000  I get in and play and tbh I don’t pay attention to names all that much.

The actual phrase is kill on sight, as in kill when seen.

Could you give an example of a feature that is possible with TSM / makes it worth to use TSM instead of Auctioneer?:)

Oh, that's an awesome idea. Definitely going to do this from now on.

See you soon

It's just multiple instances within a realm. You're still gonna have everyone trying to get into that realm
---
Clean, I like it. Have 1 upvote, sir.
---
Fishing while eating breakfast!!!!
---
Why didn't I think of this!?
---
Exactly. I'm saying that this current grind is pretty dang close to the grind I remember in original vanilla. Maybe he leveled a holy paladin before and is now leveling a hunter. There are major differences in leveling speed among classes and specs.
---
YET!
---
Most of them come from memory if not then I just read it and follow instructions. Sometimes I wander in the wrong places but that's part of the game.
---
I'm not going to lie, the RP this time around has been pretty crap. I put it down to being filled with non RPers avoiding queues. :(

Disenchant is equivalent to greed roll, friend.
---
I started toward the end of BC and I distinctly remember having to kill tons of the Zhevras to get those 4 hooves. I was filled with dread that I'd be stuck killing them for a while when I picked this quest up in classic. This time around, I got the 4 hooves in 10-15 kills. I'm never that lucky.
---
Don't hate the player,  hate the game.
---
I didn't for the first 15 levels then I said fuck it
---
As a warrior, I GREATLY appreciate everyone who gives me a drive by buff every time. I whisper thanks, have a macro for /love and /lick...  
---
I silently scream inside that I have no way of giving people drive by buffs without spending silver on buff scrolls :(
---
look here's the real question: will a medium populated server have the same amount of layers as a full one? Are they constantly there?
---
Is this a cosplay of the pizza girl in the Umemaro series?
---
Yea... Uhm my friend says she looks like her.
---
We're leaking
---
I read a quest that was vague, ended up on a different quest I needed and ended up teaming with 4 other people to kill Gnolls/quest mob. We razed that fucking farm to the ground.
---
Still haven’t done the quest I set out to, but man, have I had fun!
---
Upvoted for being an actual screen shot.
---
Lol nice to see i'm recognized I guess
---
Yeah, vanilla Paladins never get a taunt. Just think about that.
---
Yikes. Sounds like a shitty owner, hope it goes well later :/
---
And then Alterac Valley (when it's patched in) will be a never ending payback.  God that BG is so stacked for the Alliance.
---
Big surprise! Jesse is a shameless ass-kisser. Back when the idea of classic wow appeared in the community, he repeated the same corporate bullshit with a big smile, Blizzard's juice still in his mouth "you think you do, but you don't". I wonder what corporate bullshit he repeats now?
---
By the way the only reason Blizzard didn't actually want Classic WoW because they love the money they get through boosts and mounts for modern WoW. Greedy bastards...
---
Without access to any resource for classic demographics like realmpop, it's hard to answer but I think Deviate Delight feels balanced, but it is RPPVP, but it's RP is kind of empty, at least on Ally anyways. Seems like all the RP is on Grobb.
---
This is awesome man, nice work, I’m jealous
---
Can? Yes.
---
Need to? No.
---
Undead epic mount is the best mount!  Rolled undead just for this reason.  Grats!
---
Me too! Feeling a really good sense of community!
---
Do you actually ask people to group or do you just rudely throw around invites?
---
Sometimes i just dont wanna talk to people and wanna quest on my own. 
---
If i join a group i have to make sure we're on the right quests, make sure we stay kinda together n shit. I don't want to seam rude so i just decline unless it's a quest boss or something. Even then if there just me and a group of 2 or 3 I'll just let them kill it first.
---
I have been going between Ashenvale, Hillsbrad, Stonetalon and running WC. Which seems inefficient but i couldn't find a place that fit that gap very well.
---
I find it hilarious when classic fans claim that other people have rose colored glasses about the past.
---
Like, you are aware that 'it's just nostalgia' was the biggest argument against classic servers, right?
---
Probably because when I group I kill like 4 mobs for every 1 mob the idiot kills so why am I sharing exp and loot with an idiot for a minimal boost to questing speed?
---
the people who go to forums like this tend to be the more serious players, why else would you slog through a website infested by leftists and gun hating bigots to talk about a 14 year old game
---
Why pick just one? Unless your trying to rush to 60 level both slowly.
---
Imo the economy is far more disrupted by how young the servers are rather than layer abuse.  Rn people are leveling mains and not buying as many mats to grind skills. Eventually the layers will go away and the economy will stabilize as layer hoppers stores of mats get sold/consumed.
---
You can get the shadoweave robe made for around the same cost at level 38, and the shadoweave is much better because of the +shadow damage. Fully up to you but after paying 5g for my enchanted gold robe and replacing it within 2 levels i dont think its worth it.
---
For the scor..horde!
---
Is there good money over vendor in selling BOE's in the AH?  Doesn't matter either way with me cause I'm sending all mine to my brother to DE but I am interested in whether the extra effort is worth it.
---
Basically separate instances of zones.  All of the players in any given zone are on the same server, however they might not be in the same instance of the zone on that server.  You can jump layers by joining a group as that forces all players on to the same layer.
---
Question about priests. Does shadow weaving increase damage from shadow wands?
---
Unfortunately the players have been forever changed with how they play the game. 
---
I was given a suggestion on how to counter this, try to find groups on the lower end of a dungeons level range. Don’t join the groups that are overleveled and just plowing through everything.
---
God, I love Darkshire.
---
No you need to buy every skillin order, you were misinformed.
---
I would also guess shaman &gt; pala for multiboxing.
---
So, both classes have some tedious mechanics. Pets for hunters, and the deadzone. warlocks have to deal with soul shards, and health/mana managment is more intensive for them. The real kicker is that hunters get mobility early on, warlocks have none. At all.
---
 By what, 8 feet?
---
You will ALWAYS need tanks.
---
That being said. I did all of stockades last night as a 27 Retpaladin with two 25 Rogues. No issue.
---
Good luck trying that shit in SM or higher though.
---
Yooooo pass that piece! Lmao
---
All the values are taken directly from the 1.12.1 version of the game. Early versions of vanilla were probably a bit harder since classes hadn't yet been refined but that's the only thing that would be different.
---
Write that without crying. 
---
Go back to retail and stay there thanks.
---
Classic is my job.
---
Not gonna lie it took me a second.

DD is like 70% Alliance, maybe Grobb, but sure not DD (the best server in game, period.).

---
Well, if you didn't know, blizzard has take the stance that I stated in this post and have made chats layered.  
---
Layering chats simulates a true vanilla experience. If I had 50 people in a zone in vanilla, and now in Classic I have 50 people in 5 layers in a zone, I would end up with 5 times as much chat traffic with server wide chat as compared to actual vanilla, 250 people in chat vs the original 50.
---
This also cuts down significantly on the potential to abuse layering since communication to other layers is limited.
---
At this point it doesn't really matter what my opinion is anymore because Blizz has already said no to server wide chat, they are layer specific.
---
I respect the work but... That's not what classic wow needs, phone adaptation is the absolute worst way to experience a regular game that was designed for pc
---
Yes. When else would I have time? Lol
---
Even if you keep it on follow?  If you sacrifice your succubus you get +15% to shadow damage, so the gains become:
---
\+5% shadow damage, instead of +3% total damage
---
In fact its not exactly +3% total damage bc you are trading +10% shadow damage (SM/Ruin) for +13% total damage (SL/SB), if you keep your pet un-sacrificed.  +13% total damage is way better than +10% shadow damage because it improves immolate, and your wand (I presume.)
---
EDIT: you cant use immolate in raiding, so really it just helps your wand damage, which probably is not that important for raiding.
---
Ah thanks for the info. So basically melee (or casters sitting in melee) have a lower threshhold for threat before they get aggro. I definitely didn't remember this.
---
Stonks
---
Additional supply depots required.
---
I guess I meant DPS gear with hit or +weapon like edgemaster since hitting more means more threat and less damage taken.
---
I have two friends and they are always in the same layer as me. RIP

The data layer is metal. It's usually sandwiched under the label. The thick portion of the disc is clear plastic.

This would be perfect.

There are a lot of empty areas and unfinished dungeon/raids that could be turned into “new” classic content.
---
Hell, there are whole “areas” on the map

that have borders but are not accessable (NE tip of EK, next to searing gorge, etc)
---
Nope, I'm not that petty.

You say you're PVE spec and couldn't help me with this stupid Hunter?  Jerks.
---
I loved TBC, but a few major issues off the top of my head:  
---
• resilience 
---
• 10 man -&gt; 25 man should have been 10-&gt; 20
---
• daily quests
---
• zone clustering - you HAD to go in 1 order pretty much
---
• no plan after black temple made sunwell anticlimactic and weird
---
• paladin/shaman on opposite faction I think hurt faction identity
---
Can you elaborate?
---
both, AH when it was worth/when I was going to sell greens/blues on the AH anyways
---
I see what you're saying but we won't ever go back to being inexperienced noobs though
---
For a moment I thought this was r/RoastMe
---
Wait, you guys are talking about the player-created "world" chat channel? The one only used by private server players, people from this sub, and those who join at the urging of said groups (meaning their first and second order social connections)? No wonder you guys think everyone is abusing layering. You're looking at a very tiny self-selecting subset of very hardcore players. From only looking at general, trade, and local defense channels, I've never seen someone request a layer hop. Most players either don't know about it or don't care to abuse it.
---
/join world and /leave world. There's a world chat that's very useful for group finding that ylu have to manually leave and join.
---
This is hilarious
---
It's not fake, stop getting sour please.

No, you couldn't lock your XP in vanilla.

---
Int cost like 1/4 my mana bar and there is no way im buffing someone mid pull.
---
You are correct it is a mindset and a positive attitude is key!  Warriors must level first aid ,cooking and fishing to save money on food cost and heals.  This is not a bad thing as it completes your character and adds to the immersion.  Also using rend on humanoid targets makes life really easy when they want to run and grab buddies in a fight.  Lastly the Warrior class quest are some of the best in the game.  Nothing symbolizes a fantasy game more than a warrior with plate drenched in the blood of their fallen enemies while leading a an epic dungeon crawl!  Sword and Board FTW
---
They still have to remove layers, so expect queue times to go up if more players stay active than Blizz accounted for.
---
Much of that was quality of life changes because the player base at the time was complaining about travel taking too long as expansions/zones were added. It had the side effect of making old modes of travel less desirable (zeps/boats). With classic, the world is smaller and the old ways are novel again.
---
It's not a problem, I don't have stealth.
---
not on a pvp server. and what about layering?
---
What's stopping you from continuing to play both?
---
I heard about it a couple days ago. 12 seconds later I had it downloaded and running. Guess where I found it.
---
Shadoweave robe is useable at 38. The only really annoying part is part of the quest in desolace, you need to kill lvl 35-39 demons for a drop. Then in arathi you need to kill the burning elementals that are level 38-39, you can buy cresting charms to kill them but those can be pricey. If you can get the robes early then yeah its worth it but it's quite difficult if you don't have someone to help you that's slightly higher level than you.
---
It’s a game changer!
---
It's absolutely going to increase are you a moron? There is barely any gold in the economy right now. But you want me to horde it in my bank for six months instead of giving it to someone to use for a few days. Players like you are why retail is as it is.
---
This might spread the playerbase too thin though, at least I'm sure that's Blizzard's concern.
---
Thanks for the insight. Much appreciated!
---
Sharding/layering is a necessary evil. They are trying to get rid of it as fast as possible. No one wants it.
---
I have trouble making money in  classic even years ago as well as today. I'm level 37 and only have like 15g. I'm not gonna get 90-100 until like lvl 43 ish
---
Looks great! How did you get minimap buttons to show on titanpanel?
---
I saw an assassin's blade for 10g and didn't buy it because I didn't have my mount yet.  Really stupid decision.
---
It definitely affects queues, so I'm not sure you understand. Layering allows them to have a lot more people on a single server.  
---
Let's make up a server. Server TestServer. Take a healthy vanilla server with a max population of, say, 5K. Back then, if 60K people were tying to play on it, you would have a queue of 55K people since the server can only allow 5K players. Now, with layering they can have 10 different layers going that can act as that server max. So, 10 layers going that can hold 5K players each mean that 50K can now be playing on our TestServer. The queue is now only 10K since 50K players are able to be on at a time.  
---
So, it's been a week since launch of our TestServer. Average active population has decreased from 60K to 40K. Let's remove layering so we only have one layer per server. Great, so now we have 40K people trying to log into a server that can only hold 5K players, rather than the 50K before.  
---
So, even though the popluation has dropped by 20K, removing layering has actually made the queue problem worse!
---
You really think Blizzard can't compare 4 numbers which are the two player's coordinates on the zone map? It's probably like a couple hours work.
---
&gt;I have him set to passive

This is why. Your pet won’t do anything on passive unless you specifically command him to, and then when combat ends, he will go back to doing nothing until your next command. Defensive is probably better for dungeons, but you should be commanding for the most part anyways to make sure he’s focusing the right target
---
80-20 rule?
---
Thanks for the explanation btw.  I didn't look into it at all and I'm surprised to see people fighting against you when the screenshot was clearly taken on a private server.  Their response to that seems to be, "So?  They're layer hopping to exploit the economy and have full bags of crystals." Which completely misses the point that the entire thing is fake.
---
#1 is the turtles on the shore north of alterac mountains. Vendor trash OP
---
Ironically, it appears you have rose-tinted glasses on when it comes to vanilla vs anything else. Or just how you ignore some parallels between vanilla and tbc.
---
Sure you can, bub. But that doesnt make you any less retarded.
---
Tell blizz not me. Unbunch your britches honey
---
People are talking about a hypothetical future of classic with new content. Blizzard said they don't rule out TBC or WotLK expansion servers. I'd personally prefer new content like that but still under the "rules" of classic: no flying, no new level cap... That wouldn't be perfect either as there would be a point where new gear is either super important or not at all so there would be no progression. I don't have the answers to this so I hope blizzard does. But honestly, permanent vanilla classic would get boring without any fresh content, like any other game.
---
Yes. Its not salt though, its me trying to troll you out of boredom.  you  engaged back and so I just roll with it. There is literally nothing for me to be upset about and I've not been this whole time, sorry to disappoint.
---
Hey I’m playing a Dwarf right now. I guess I just think it’s cooler to tame the top of the mountain than it is to hide underneath it.
---
Gotcha thanks! I've got a couple friends in the 40's that can help me.
---
There’s no way that team can dunk in full plate.
---
How is the undead leveling route compared to the orc/troll? All the guides say to do barrens and everything on that continent and not much is mentioned about silverpine and hillsbrad.
---
You can break the proc whenever you want by casting spells like battle shout or swapping stance.
---
I leveled with my favorite rogue idol talent build, 21-8-22 or something like that
---
Haha I was a noob back then
---
I agree with you to an extent. Jagex has had a hell of a time putting a new skill in because there are people who will always vote no no matter what because they want it to be exactly the same as they remember. Then there are the the people who vote no because they dont want to have to max out a new skill after they already are maxed in everything else. 75% may be a bit steep but it is how you ensure that more than half of the playerbase wants the change, or at least more than half thsy voted do.
---
You don't want to let your cat watch you play as a druid. Next time she's out she might go looking for a wolf to fuck up.......
---
It's so fucking hard to kill a hunter as a rogue. Even if you get the jump on him, it's either a miracle or the hunter was just bad winning a straight up 1:1. I've tried it too many times and rarely does it fully go my way. I can get close, but sealing the deal is the hard part.
---
Wait till they reduce the layer count.
---
Maybe, but its weird. I sit behind a 4k player queue a lot of the time and I have literally never seen someone ask for it. Ive probably got ~2.5 /played.
---
WHAT IS THIS GLITCH HAHAHA
---
You are right.
---
Their water bowl should never be empty, though. It's completely negligent to not provide your pet water.
---
More viewers more money. How much money did people earn back then playing wow? No one gives a fuck what you think either, they still gonna race and thousands of people still gonna watch and they gonna make more money with wow now. You just sound super frustrated (watch less porn!).
---
It's not cheating if everyone is cheating someone still gonna be first. If everyone knows the cheats and uses them it's fair game.
---
Well and people still read news about everest. Reporters still report on it. People still travel to it. The graveyard thing just gives people something to be proud of thst they are not those thst failed. Pretty basic stuff.
---
What's your rotation look like?
---
Also, I'm not familiar with that axe, do you know what the specs are on it? Damage, speed, stats, and what not.
---
Sick of these
---
Incorrect.
---
all of the bc dungeons are just straight lines. theres no exploration. no rare spawns. no chests. they dont even come close to the epic vanilla dungeons like blackrock depths, maurodon, dire maul, and sunken temple
---
At some point in the mid 20's, arc int starts to cost around 30% of our mana. And by that point our mana pools are such that we have to drink nearly two whole 20+ sec drinks to go from 0 to 100%. If we set a presedent of buffing ppl we encounter, others would likewise expect one as well. As soon as you spend a minute getting ur mana back, more friendlies come out of the woodwork and adad in your face. This leads to a cycle of perpetual drinking.
---
Grobb doesn't really have any RPers. Pre-launch it was heavily advertised by Reddit and the official forums as the place to go for "epic hardcore world PvP" and avoiding streamers. 
---
Roleplayers are on BB. We don't like PvP much anyhow, nobody wants to get ganked and griefed mid-RP. Doubly so when the gankers are all trolls.
---
So I guess some people thought this stuff was funny. It made me uninstall. Seriously just... kinda spat in the face of what I felt wow was. A little silly at times is fine, but up until that point, WoW had a pretty dark tone overall, which I liked. That stuff just became silly and childish to me. I tried again in Warlords and it just felt so incredibly cringey when they had the black bar cutscenes and the names of these mythical heros displayed on screen. It just felt so forced. Quit shortly after that. Wasn't until Legion that I got back into it, then BFA ruined it again.
---
AOE farming is overrated anyways. The time &amp; mana it takes to aggro, gather, group, and AOE 4+ mobs is not much different than 'fireball, fireball, tab, fireball, fireball, tab, etc.' ... not to mention the difficulty of finding areas with consistent respawning groups of 4+ melee mobs.
---
Well go run the dungeon without a party then.
---
Getting to the chest is a group effort.
---
There is an add-on called gnome sequencer. I think it allows stuff like what you are trying to do. I don't think it is against ToS, at least that is what my friend that uses it tells me. I suggest checking it out.
---
OMEGAKEK
---
Did really well farming spiders on duskwallow. Drop a lot of vendor trash and have a chance at spider silk
---
Cloth drops from humanoid NPCs. I'm not familiar with horde zones, but there should be some humans here and there, iirc
---
Same. I couldn't afford an epic mount until BC and I started playing in 2015. I also didn't really prioritize it though, and spent most of my gold on BOEs, respeccing, and gearing my level 19/29/39 twinks with BIS items/enchants.
---
Pve servers for the win
---
&gt; All of you guys are making excuses for cheating. If you don't see the rogue but he sees you and stealths you're getting notified. Thats cheating.
---
The addon parses your combat log. So if you don't personally *see* it, but they are close enough for the combat log to parse that information, then it notifies you.  
---
It's not *cheating* because the information was always there and it's not creating or doing anything malicious, it's just reporting this information much more efficiently and in real-time.  
---
Under your logic, Auctioneer and/or TSM would also be cheats because it can scan the AH in real-time while also displaying in real-time while someone using the Blizzard UI has to wait for each page and have limits to their organization. Do you consider those cheats as well?
---
This is awesome.
---
All of chat is just asking for exploit invites
---
I'm on Sulfuras on classic and there's still pretty much nobody in IF when I'm there.  Saddens me.
---
If by old woman you mean literally Onyxia...
---
Anybody have a link to a good rogue leveling/wpvp guide. Not sure if it’s easier to level with swords or daggers since you can’t front backstab mobs
---
Sure you can have some water, that’ll be 5s :)
---
I'm also nelf so I'm using starfall which is really mana efficient with holy fire since it has a 6 second channel into a 3 second cast time, and holy fire is also great for engaging, also ditto on the renew thing, it's mandatory for its efficiency and instant cast healing that I can use while running, the rest I can do without.
---
Basically damage out put or not, i remember in the old days (when we didn't know the best spec and exactly how every talent affected every spell) pets were more or less a liability in raids and we all cheered out loud when Blizzard made changes to help pet survive-ability.  
---
I was actually really upset when it became obvious i was a pet based class that was not supposed to use my pet. I was a DoT based class that couldn't use Dots.  I was forced to be a watered down Mage that did less damage and had to compete for the same gear.  Want to use Curse Shadows to raise your DPS not until someone uses Elements to boost mages first. Wanna have a pet out? get your imp to buff and be happy he can phase shift and go passive. Welcome to the life of a vanilla Lock.  Hand out your health cookies, summon everyone after repair, SS the priest and if you do that well enough maybe a mage will give you some water.
---
Good knews it gets better as content is released!
---
Shit dude my tortoise will probably outlive me but I still take care of the grumpy little bastard regardless of what else I’m doing.
---
RealMobHealth
---
It would be better.  Because they could of added a different type of progression system that’s not like AP
---
Leveling useless character levels in xpacs (especially BfA apparently) isn’t even fun anyway.  Nice try.  There is so much they could of done differently to make the expansions ACTUALLY expansions
---
What did you explain? You just said some stuff and gave zero proof of it.
---
For clarification purposes the actual points you put into Feline Swiftness are at levels 21 and 22.
---
It still counts as world first. Everyone was layering hopping, everyone was doing 6 man dungeons. It was an even playing field.
---
On the other hand if you plan on raiding and enjoy a particular role it is definitely relevant.
---
You don’t need to be over levelled or over geared to roll a dungeon. Appropriate level is absolutely important, but you do not need to be above the mob level to clear efficiently.
---
If you enjoying playing game it's okay.
---
I've noticed this too. Sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't.
---
It doesn't. Like it straight up doesn't. It's layering doesn't affect how many people are in a server
---
I made bags, if you do it while your are ahead of the zerg its good money.
---
I'm not a serious raider myself, so I can't say anything for certain about that. I can only relay what I believe is the general view on this:
---
Yes, it's very possible. Will they be at the same tier as the top tier, serious raiding guilds of a "normal" server? Probably not. But for 99% of people, they'll be great fits.
---
I’m sorry I thought dungeons were a group event. You can always stealth run for chests if you believe you are entitled to them.
---
I dont even bother hiding when I see ally group around, if they kill me then whatever. Once I hit 60 it wont matter anyway, I'll bath 'em all in their own blood.
---
Not since 2010
---
Had one that declined an invite for hunt quest cause "I got no AoE". I feared (AoE) his pack. He died cause had no heals :). He was mad as fuck lol.
---
It will alert you if someone enters stealth nearby, but you will have already caught them by virtue of proximity at that point.
---
World PVP in a nutshell is:
---
/4 layer invite pls xd xd xd
---
Any Alliance guilds on Herod like this? :)
---
Is it related to Point break?
---
indeed gaming will likely die, that's why fortnite makes in a month what most other dev houses make in a year
---
Layering needs to disappear ASAP and leads to many exploits.
---
Remove layering right now and every server that's medium or higher will be in multi-hour queues. The big ones will probably get past 24 hours lol
---
Not that it's right, but blizzard prefers " this game isn't fair because of x" instead of " I can't play because of y".
---
Okay:
---
Blizzard has split the server into sub-servers with 3k players on them each. Layers is their name. You can hop into a different layer by accepting an invite from a player in that layer. This means you can kill all the mobs on your layer, then accept an invite to your friends layer, and if the mobs are up on that layer, kill them again. Repeat and suddenly you can get really fast experience, or pick up herbs, mine ores or kill devilsaurs very quickly. So this breaks both economy and leveling experience.
---
Frost shines when you get deeper into its talent points, no matter the spec. Same can be said for fire of course but you will not have the same degree of utility.
---
Dude I feel you. My damn class trainer robs me blind every couple levels when I finally feel like my bank account is going upwards.
---
Oooooo....
---
Well now my friend knows.
---
Likely walked from Theramore to Feathermoon and missed the Thalanaar FP on accident or didn't realize they couldn't fly through back to Theramore without the FP in-between.
---
I think as long as you your hands is on a good weapon you will be able to kill things for sure, the extra armor and stats from your gear also help and aren't really that bad. Picking up early spirit and stamina on gear helps for leveling where later you can grab agility and strength, I have even found gear with all of those stats so it's been great.
---
I don't blame him. It's hard to make gold from anything on the AH except for greens right now because people are selling things for less than they vendor for or sometimes just a few copper more. Why would you want to make less money by undercutting more than a few copper?
---
Only the world boss iirc
---
I got blacklisted by somebody today for telling him to stop asking in LFG to have someone invite him so he can avoid horde ganking him to farm more quickly.
---
I played it for 6 years on PC. It just takes some time to get used to. I even used a controller for a while using the keyboard for keyboard things. Eventually I used the keyboard only which is far better.
---
I don't blame you for doing it. I blame blizzard for allowing it to be possible.
---
No thanks. I like not having Shaman on Alliance, it changes things up for end-game, as does having Paladin be unique. They are both intrinsically tied to their factions, and they had to essentially lore retcon Paladins into the Horde (and Shaman to the Alliance) to get them to work.
---
Mines wankbank too! Smolderweb alliance checking in!
---
So I almost ran into this problem, I was level 38 with only 40g so ill share my secret to making 60g in 2 levels. Farm elementals in Arathi and sell the charms. my server varies from 50-1g each and warriors need 24 of them.
---
This was a problem even in wrath.  If you were missing one flight point between you and your destination, it would literally make you fly the entire circumfrence of northrend.
---
Imagine being able to look at something and not have it control your life and emotions.
---
Question about azeroth auto pilot...is it possible to force the addon to switch zones in a sense? 
---
My lock is lvl 22 and I went to wetlands for stuff, now I'm back in ashenvale and all it tells me to do is go 8000 yards away for some quests in wetlands. I would like to stay in ashenvale and I'm sad
---
You could start running SFK. Alternatively, head to Hillsbrad.
---
Even not taking into account that this is WoW related, this is easily one of the coolest pieces of art I've ever seen
---
Tell me what happens in this scenario then. You have 1 continent on the verge of making another layer, the concentration of people are in STV, with 5 people in EPL.
---
The layer is now full and creates another layer. The 5 people in EPL layer hop to the new one and have a fresh new map.
---
The reason layers even exist is because there are so many players so farming nodes isnt going to be super lucrative because a) other people are doing it so supply goes up and b) there are so many players doing it that demand also goes up.
---
Yeah i ran to UC and TB for weapon masters so i could dual wield swords and use guns. rolled need on a sword in WC and someone said your class cant even use swords. I was like weaponmaster bro, and showed him i had a sword equiped he shut up quick
---
Have you tried handing out by the entrance?
---
welll you didn't use the sarcasm all capitals font smh
---
It won't for sure.  It was more a matter of proving it *could* be done where the larger assumption was needing BiS gear to accomplish it pre release due to pservers having far higher stats on raid bosses.
---
Can you explain layering to me?  How is it being exploited?
---
Makes sense cuz we ganking the f out of y’all :). But good man not layer hopping.  /salute
---
Rogue*
---
You can hide helm and cloak in game settings. :)
---
Did you miss the other 20 threads about this already?
---
I think the experience from the past showed that the destination servers tend to die eventually, while the originally popular servers stay that way. It's become a self-fulfilling prophecy, and Blizzard really ought to make stronger guarantees about maintaining realm population by aggressively combining, or by other means.
---
Did you factor in the incredibly high chance frostbolt would have to crit for 260 with 0 +frost gear?
---
..If you look like your class, then why did you have to specify the class in the title? ;P
---
I've noticed that lots of players either go out of their way to help warriors or just really like having a warrior in the group. I've had a much better experience trying to get groups going on my warrior, and it's a lot more rewarding to form groups too. It definitely adds to the social aspect of the game so far.
---
Then wait 2 hours to get back on?
---
You clearly missed the point. There is one miner in a group. There is one node. Do everyone roll on the node? No. Why should I even bother leveling lockpicking when the chances of getting the chest is 1/5?
---
Should be fine until UBRS, Strat, Scholo, etc
---
The earliest you would want to respec to tank at 51, so you can be 30 in prot and still have 11 for Anger Management in the arms tree.  And even then, that is not necessary.
---
If multiboxing programs aren't against the ToS I highly doubt remote desktop ones are.
---
Same. From biggles and this is the first I’ve heard of this
---
And what happens if they don't buy them? The the auction expires and you repost them at a lower cost. It's really not a big deal.
---
I think there's more bad blood between undead and humans vs undead and orcs. The scourge originated with Arthas doing some high treason shit, so there's a lot of history with humans. Orcs are more like "yo they look a little ratchet but so do we w/e"
---
LFG in Trade Chat or LFG channel, generally the best places.
---
Every 5 seconds is way too much, you probably are getting blocked tbh, also I'd try trade chat
---
Or just put a cool down on it ... significantly less work to do and less able to be abused.
---
Play a non dps class
---
What class are you playing ? Die you tried to create a group?
---
Try /1 in barrens and /2 in main cities
---
I'm all for people abusing this technique as much as they want honestly. If only a handful of players do it, then first of all it won't be fixed, and second they reap all the rewards for themselves.
---
Blizzard is to blame for it existing, not the players who use it.
---
How anyone can want Classic and not want BC in two years or so is beyond me. BC fixed all the stuff that people are complaining about in Classic right now besides the obvious "layer abuse" issue
---
I did some quick math, and it looks like SM/Ruin is about 12% damage difference compared to SL/SB when you have 8% crit without talents, and 17% difference when you have 13% un-talented crit.  I cant get the table to paste well, but here it is:
---
Spec	Nom. Dmg.	Crit Chance	Crit Dmg.	Dmg. Increase	Total Dmg.	Delta
---
SL/SB	1		0.1		1		1.15		1.27	
---
SM/Ruin	1		0.13		2		1.1		1.39		0.12
---
SL/SB	1		0.15		1		1.15		1.32	
---
SM/Ruin	1		0.18		2		1.1		1.50		0.17
---
So, SM/Ruin scales better with crit chance, which is intuitive.
---
2Pac song reference, so whoosh I guess?
---
It was a bad feature that was fixed an expansion later.
---
Every 5 seconds is way too often.
---
It helps to be in the zone the dungeon is in, some people look in the zones and not in world chat.
---
Nice try, Dreamthief.
---
This is why I'm here. 
---
NICE!
---
wrong sub, go to /r/wow
---
is there any way to turn off the red error messages as well?
---
If they aren't min maxing what are they even doing? Enjoying the thrilling gameplay of spamming shadowbolt, frostbolt, holy light, or whatever other single spell rotation they have?
---
Demand absolutely has changed.  The reason layers exist is because there are so many players.  More players = more demand
---
Did you do the mage quests? I wish I had my mount for those. Shimmering flats and desolace...on foot.
---
Looks can be deceiving.
---
From grind leveling hunter previously I have always done the simple HM+SS+AA, I will use the extra damaging or utility abilities if I am mana capped, pull more than I plan, or need burst to keep my pet up. Other than that keeping a steady rhythm, keeping mana up so I never have to stop and drink is my preferred method. Some people just carry water and mix it in while their pet gets a head start but I don't like that personally. 
---
Finding the same rhythm on druid has been fun for me so far.
---
We dont need another thread. There are already a ton of them.
---
Until blizzard says something, it is working as exactly designed, and we do not know if as intended.
---
Most of your damage comes from auto shot, not from pet damage; but pet damage is definitely second. You should figure out what rotation you can have and still keep 100% uptime. If you can mark, serpent sting, throw two multishots, and then recover enough mana to do that all again next pull then do that.
---
This is why agi/attack power is so critical for hunter builds. Maximizing your autoshot damage is the biggest thing you can do, since you will probably be pretty minimalist on the rest of your rotation.
---
You should not be downranking abilities except for your CC abilities to cast them faster if you are OOM as a hunter.
---
I’m annoyed that ours is written out “lookingforgroup” instead of just “LFG”.  Like I need more noise in my chat window.
---
Same, thought I was the only one. It only does it to my 2-handed weapons
---
How is PC reddit easy? By reading.
---
How are you dumb? Because you're confused by something easy.
---
Poe's law. Perfect satire should be virtually indistinguishingable from the source material. Basically just enough to make it satire, but this has the effect of attractive legitimate believers in the source material who think you're for real.
---
Well assuming I were to take the fastest route and strategy possible (keeping in mind that in any case this would be a longer term project for a long term self sustaining scheme) wouldnt I be able to cut that 50 hours down? Surely some of the faster levelers who have it planned out didnt take 50 hours to get to 35, no?
---
Slow down your rotation or use mana pots
---
Wrong sub scrub
---
you mean crit like a wet noodle
---
I had that happen when I made a target macro for a quest mob
---
I’m playing a mage.
---
Welcome to the shaman community!  Enhance is awesome because there's so little downtime.  You achieve this in two ways.
---
 1) Totems cost a lot of mana but last a long time so put down your totems then make multiple single pulls into those same totems. 
---
2) The 5 second rule says that after 5 seconds of not casting spells your mana begins to regenerate even in combat. Which is perfect for bursty shamans 
---
 So you blow your load on the pull, bring them into totem range, then auto attack em down while mana recovers. Rinse and repeat.
---
It is without benefit
---
ok, but you at least realize its completely different than the things you mentioned.  
---
should roll for ore, even when we're not miners?  
---
according to ya'll, we should  
---
paying for buffs? yeah, lol, not in 5-mans  
---
create free portals? uhhhh, where you find these mages  
---
i actually roll for my chests, but the sense of entitlement coming from half this thread is making me rethink that.  
---
i mean come on, you compared it to skills you learn from the trainer  
---
kinda insulting to the people who put in the extra work for it
---
But how else is he supposed to show off that sic vertical orientation?
---
It's appreciated, and to be clear I don't mind if non RPers play on grobb as long as they're respectful and nice folks. Lots of non-RPers were on my old RPPvP server and they just wanted a quiet server. No problem with that. Sadly grobb is anything but quiet.
---
Yea that's a great example. Now I'm thinking about how much information DBM provides that isn't organically available to the player...
---
you are probably blocked from chat by people who hate annoying spammers
---
some hit a pls no when i started in on an ore like pretty far away from them. I took one loot from it and left him the rest. For some reason "pls no" really makes me feel for you
---
You sell them on Craigslist and make 5 new accounts.
---
Please don't use trade chat for lfg...
---
Retail was apparently built on changes that were wanted by the majority of the community and look where it ended up. I don't trust the majority to make smart decisions anymore.
---
In case we're not all on the same page about this, I hope we agree that the established etiquette is that, if you join up for a kill quest and the other dude bails as soon as he's 8/8, that's TOTALLY OK even if you're 6/8. This will make it easier to find groups if people don't expect that joining one becomes a mini-marriage. Possible exception for elite mobs.
---
&gt;Not everyone is cocmpletely satisfied with Classic.
---
That's to be expected. Classic wasn't made for everyone.
---
You consider reason and logic mental gymnastics?
---
Well I'm liking the difficulty and feeling of exploration. The only thing I can think of that I don't like is that the lustre of that first week where everyone was beaming with happiness and excitement is gone now, and it has been replaced with just regular play like I remember from 15 years ago.
---
I’m petty as fuck, better believe I got a list lol 🤣🤣😈
---
Go fishing then you wont level up and you can make money
---
Good.  You still need to put the time in and get the mats. Why the hell would I want to craft sh*t gear anyway.  I would go farther and say we should be able to craft some of the best gear/weapons in the game for every class and make it a challenge to get mats and stuff that maybe drop off really rare mobs or something along those lines. Maybe rare mining/herb nodes that appear rarely
---
For people at work where this is blocked, what's the article say?
---
Most players play more than a couple hours each night for the launch week of a new mmo. Most player that have stuck with one character from launch will be lvl 25-35 now.
---
Which is why I’m not transferring.  
---
I’ve got time invested in my character and was lucky to get my name.  I’m not losing it lol.
---
Because I can. Simple as that because I can. Stfu
---
That wasn't layering. They were just done with their quest.
---
I think he said age from the start but edited it to IQ, because I was also thinking this

Trying to find a fungus that hasn't been looted...
---
3 to 6 items of varying quality. It's usually some money, grays, whites, and a green if you're lucky. I think you can probably get blues too but I haven't checked drop tables.
---
What does this addon do to give the ui a full overhaul?
---
God this sub often sucks
---
There’s a website that you can use to translate where they will see actual words
---
and potions!!! nothing like some mid level potions for those early world pvp encounters
---
Dont worry your network admin knows its installed already and just chooses not to say anything. We got your back, until someone says something then we just close the port.

You find a Black Lotus node?

A warning for taking advantage of the game mechanics you're supposed to take advantage of? Blizzard is the one who *encourages* world PVP.
---
Cannibalize is 100% a BM skill for a priest. Useful to have bound purely to eat alliance corpses.
---
I think a lot of it also depends on general game knowledge. The little things all add up, hard to put into words what I mean, but the age old notion of practice makes perfect is very true to warrior. Also out of all the clases, I'd say the warrior is the single most rewarding toon to pull off getting to high level. The difference between how a lvl15 warrior plays and a level 45 warrior plays is crazy. You really do FEEL the power grow as you level. Before you were scared if you pulled more than 1 mob, now you just kill everything.
---
I’m new, how else should I do it?
---
why would a shit item like that be so high?
---
So?  The concurrency is *much* higher with layers than without.  If you can't understand how having 50,000 concurrents leads to shorter queues than having 5,000 concurrents when there are a total of 75,000 people wanting to play at one instant in time, there's no explaining anything to you.
---
In the case with layers, if you're the 75,001 person to show up, you join the queue in position 25,001.  *Without layers*, you join the queue in position 70,001.
---
Capische?
---
lol gnome
---
Oh ok, new question then:  Who is Nijel and where is the rest of their basketball team?
---
The Barrens has a lot of great items as well as links into WC. You won't do SFK until you are ready to move on to Hillsbrad (level 20 - 24).
---
The WC quests are incredibly important for their gear, and the instance is important as well. If you quest in that area, you're just closer to a lot. Silverpine has some good gear too, but there is like 1 chain quest for SFK and the instance outlevels the area it is in. You can also grab the most valuable quests from The Sepulcher without having done any quests in the area.
---
In terms of efficiency, it makes a ton of sense just to quest in The Barrens. Easier to traverse, more mobs, *more people*, on level instance, tons of quests for WC, and a 20+ zone inside the zone. However, Silverpine is more fun to me, and Barrens questing is not something I want to repeat. Efficient != fun.
---
Weird flex, are you okay?
---
This guy classics
---
This is the best addon in my opinion. You get the full classic experience! ;)
---
Those are T6s, so that's not really classic content mate (and there is blood elf there aswell).
---
Why would that matter?
---
Did anyone transfer from Grobulus to DD?
---
Now that you mention it. 
---
I think the expression is similar
---
Yeah it's gross. It's a small part of why I've been against layering. It couldn't have gone any other way.
---
This was very common in vannila.    It's just for fun man you are reading way to much into it.
---
Lucky for you, there is a perpetual market for herbs, unlike things like Arcane Crystals. You get some crystals you use them to make some weapons and boom. Done with crystals until you make an alt or something.
---
Raiders will need herbs every week.
---
This might be off topic but how do I do the free server transfer? I am on ferelas which seems to be the second most populated server, even during a que I don't see the option to transfer.
---
Lok'tar, my friend.
---
Killing a lowbie once, perfectly fine in my books. Camping/griefing them.... absolutely pathetic behavior.
---
You're fucked; delete account.
---
True. There’s nothing wrong with that, necessarily. Also, different people have different “life” expectations for themselves that may allow for more or less play time. I just wanted to draw the correlation since this person is on the extreme end to the point where mental health is a concern.
---
I thought queueing while I was in the shower was smart!
---
i basically skipped wetlands and went darkshore/duskwood/some RR-ashenvale, i finished it last night and im 15% from 34
---
Easy if you can avoid all of the competition. Everyone wants to farm like the world first people/groups and the guides are out there so its very hard to find a good spot. I'm convinced the mage population is going to be much bigger today than it was in the past because of things like AoE farming. Pretty annoying TBH but this is WoW in 2019.
---
Thanks it does help a ton! will i level that much slower 2hing as a resto vs having enh points? RN i think im basically playing as an enh(auto + totems + shock) with resto gear/ talents.
---
you can just buy them; they're BOE.  i have no problem with crafted gear but good, BOE crafted gear is welfare gear the same as badge gear
---
~16.8 h/day since release.
---
Its hidden in classic.

A mage has the ability "detect magic" some other spells may exist but are required to see buffs.

You think someone wants a roundhouse kick from someone wearing these bad boys? Forget about it

What a point guard is, would be my guess based on the context of the question.

I know you meant that. Point still stands.
---
Don't get into a relationship if you're going to put a video game over spending any time at all with your partner. And don't bother trying to salvage a relationship by getting mad and throwing shit at their window with someone who quite literally doesn't even care about you enough to set some time aside away from a video game to spend time with you. If either of these people were grown adults I'd be really surprised.
---
Grey = sell.
---
White = check if any professions can use it and then check AH.
---
Green = stash for alts / disenchant / AH.
---
It’s the biggest deal since launch

---
Save em for about 2 months then sell. Not many people will be buying things like that till they have gold for twinks or leveling alts and such. IMO
---
DAE know theres a print screen key? HEHEHE IM SO SMART
---
Yeah I have a higher res one just dm me somewhere I can send it
---
Bold opinion. Unique. Edgy. From your post you are also a scrub that has to be forced to do any challenging content. Classic is the better game for you.
---
My dogs do this as well. We'll feed them/refill the water bowl and 20 minutes later my mom is filling their stuff because they chowed down
---
I would never just stand in a place fishing. I specifically run up and down coasts while going from place to place in order to fish pools while leveling. You get way better fish.
---
Do me a favor, tell that dickhead mage no, when he asks you to pay for the water.
---
Look up the 30/0/21 PvP build
---
Looks to be BiS twink items. Serious twinks will pay a ton of money for them
---
 How did they get so high of a level !!!?!
---
It’s no molehill when one person has already managed to farm weeks worth of high level crafting mats by hopping layers to mine rich thorium ore nodes. The economy is already fucked before most people have had a chance to participate. You have no idea what you’re talking about.
---
Don't forget to "Shift + #" to put your alternate toolbars on the numbers so you can cast with the keyboard.
---
its an unnamed goblind, not even mentioned in the lore... but the little isle on where that statue is located has a name tho: Janeiro's Point
---
Reddit app literally have a camera function to take a picture and post it in one go. Not everyone knows how to easily screenshot stuff and software to easily crop isn't super common.
---
You had to have a level 55 char already it's not the same. Also kind of pointless to introduce a new class that some players might never have the chance of seeing at 80
---
Enhancement Shaman advice:
---
I previously posted about being an elemental shaman. After research I have decided to be an enhancement shaman for the first 40 levels then change to elemental for the last 20 levels. 
---
Question 1) is this a good strategy to level quickly? 
---
Question 2) can someone post a link on which skills I should train in for an optimal enhancement shaman?
---
For the horde!
---
What faction are you, and what zones have you been questing?
---
Hold them until the pvp update is about to come out
---
Ah, that would make sense...
---
This guy capitalisms.
---
There's a thing called the point of diminishing returns.
---
It's the point at which, no matter how well you control a market, you cannot price any higher or you lose money because you literally cannot sell fast enough to cover operating costs.
---
People decide to do without rather than buy your over priced garbage.

Have not logged in since 9/26. Deleted the shortcut too.
---
The "up to" is in reference to the fact that spells have a coefficient based on their cast time that determines how much of that +spell damage is applied.
---
3.5 second casts are the 100% mark. So usually spells receive a bonus of +dmg / 3.5s x cast time. Instants are calculated with the global cd of 1.5s. There are quite a few exceptions for balancing reasons, though.
---
There won't be many chances to get them back in world pvp and BG's+Arena are cross server so I agree that you should be the only one keeping a list like this, as it serves no purpose other than to remind yourself how small you were thinking for that brief period of time you made that silly list.  Edited for a double dose, the type of person that would go to reddit to make this attention seeking post isn't going to be the type of person who's good enough to bounty hunt an entire revenge list like this.  Most of your list is just always going to be better than you.
---
How much gold do you think he will get from vendoring rare mats before layering goes away or he gets banned? Why should I care?
---
How would him having a lot of gold effect me? He will have "unlimited" mats from the AH but doing that will bleed him dry.
---
I usually just smite, mind blast, SWP, wand. Holy fire is a bit unnecessary in that.
---
I don’t like renew while leveling just because it’s not needed. When solo, things don’t often break through your shield. When in groups, you can just toss a heal out then wait for the FSR. Basically, with renew, I end up keeping myself in the FSR too often to make use of passive regen. But that’s entirely my thoughts.
---
wat.jpg
---
Sounds fun, but unlikely. If you'd like such a thing, you'll have to start it your self. It would probably work best on an RP-PvP server.

Looks like it says almost 3:00

There are other places other than Goldshire on rp servers

And so is your spot in groups! XDDDDDD

I haven't run into it yet but I really am waiting until the time I have to roll against a Rogue for some leather piece that would be great for Feral while I'm playing as my Feral.
---
Sure, but it sucks. Ele or resto are vastly better specs for pvp. Enhance is worse than lolret. The only players you can beat are keyboard turners on valium.
---
A true Classic WoW experience. Kicked because you might want an item you actually need.
---
RPPVP servers are badass.

Get owned son!

auctioneer and TSM will literally scope out below vendor price items for you.

Oh I guess I downloaded the non classic version and that dropdown menu was greyed out for me. Thanks! Cool ui

Get elvui, have almost more possibilities in 1 addon, be done?

Interesting. I'm 2h arms for lvling (sword shield for tanling). But iv always had a fanboy love for duel wielding so am curious how it's going for people. Info online seems very back and forth.
---
For now I'll prob stick 2h arms tho as I'm coming up on that ww axe.
---
Yes, that's mostly right. The agreement is referred to as the "social compact". It underpins the laws of the United States and protecting property is not exactly an afterthought. There's no requirement for putting your name on stuff though, just to save you the trouble. 
---
Thanks for that helpful post!
---
I haven’t downloaded WoW on my laptop because of this temptation lol
---
Do it however you want, it’s your game, play your way
---
Or Foror's Compodium of Dragon Slaying...
---
I was more talking about layer hopping and accruing mass amounts of rare materials.  Just because you farm up a bunch of stuff now doesn't mean you have to sell now.
---
Look at growth of players between TBC and WotLK. WotLK stagnates, which isn't a good thing. What do you think is better: an expansion that nearly doubles the population, or an expansion that holds it flat?
---
Wow your staff is really long
---
How do I get there? For research of course... oh also should I lather up before I get there or after ?... for research of course
---
I never understood the Wrath hype but Burning Crusade was the best expansion, I was only 15 so I didn't get that far progression-wise but fuck I loved that game. I just want a classic-BC experience so badly, that shit was so fun :))))
---
Not sure I've ever really seen the recipe linked, but can you shift click on that from the crafting window?
---
changesno
---
Probably hopping layers with addons like this
---
I'm level 38 on an RP realm and you kinda have to go out of your way to find people ERPing. Most people just play the game like you normally would.
---
wat
---
I taught 14yr olds back then.  Some even knew my realm and formed a coalition to find and gank me after a suprise test.  Never found me though- hard luck 9b x
---
Yeah that's a pain. I picture it as his final run through it, hadn't gotten that last 2-3 times and got too greedy (even though he offered money). But honestly, you should have just told him no, I'm gonna roll Need on it cause I need it too. If they can't understand that, theyre dumb. If you really didn't respond to his offers at all and stayed silent, then that's also not cool on your end. 
---
Communication is key peeps. Talk and be honest.
---
My guild actually just got renamed by blizz for having the word gang in it.
---
Ahh carrot on a stick... such a useless trinket yet you felt pretty damn fucking awesome when you got it since it was many peoples first trinket

Why not play a healer?  I did dps and tanks first too but healing was so fun.
---
You just hate druids. 
---
Classist.
---
Definitely.
---
Leveling is the only time enhancement is powerful, let them have their fun. Those warriors get to look forward to being the overpowered melee class at 60 while decent shamans switch to resto.
---
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT!
---
I never do. I only fight to defend other players from ganks and to defend myself in World PvP. I appreciate your support.

I’m trying to download wow on a thumb drive and then plug it into my work computer so i can play while traveling. Thing is our usb drives have thumb drives disabled. Any idea how to turn this off? I know there’s a way but I’m not asking the people who know how to do it.

---
Anyone know anything that works? MoveAnything isn't functioning on classic for me.
---
This is what I do when someone tries to take my node while I fight. Vanish and let them deal with it. Instant karma.
---
Yeah they only give you a stack to start with. Just go to the vendor in coldridge valley by where you spawn and you can buy more ammo to fill up your ammo pouch. It's relatively cheap so it's always best to just keep your ammo pouch topped up with the best ammo available to you. There is also crafted ammo (engineering i think?) for each ammo tier that provides a little more dps but not enough to be mandatory, vendor bought ammo is fine.
---
Hahaha little messi
---
Simple as in waiting for the leaders to spawn even when several levels and hours (days) behind the curve.
---
I was able to complete it last night at 1AM after polishing off some quests in a later zone. I just thought to swing by for fun with the quest still in log.
---
3 agi 1 stam.
---
&gt; all my mounts
---
So, private server then? Because nobody has had time to farm more than one level 40 at this point in Classic's history and as others have pointed out, drop rates and other things have changed so what was a good grind spot on pservers is not necessarily going to work here.
---
It won't work. Zones are contested now. The benefit he had was he was the highest level, no friendlies to compete with, no pvp to deal with. Now it just won't work. 
---
Try to find melee mobs equal to your level that you can group up and aoe down. You'll also need several friends to layer you constantly to be as fast as him
---
39 warrior here and my buddies are early 30s, but I mean I already have like two days /played so.
---
Bad phrasing on my part. I meant over Whirlwind, not Ravager, was more for the OP.
---
People like grinding---They don't like being told how to grind and being forced to wait for permission before they can be rewarded for grinding.
---
People hate retail because they reduced the grinds to a tiny fraction of their original length and then started strictly regulated how much you can achieve per day.
---
As a general rule:
---
50 hour grind that you can do at your leisure, 2 hours today, 10 hours tomorrow, 4 hours the day after that, 0 hours all next week, 6 hours next monday, 3 hours next tuesday, etc  &gt; 2 hour grind that you can only do for 5 minutes a day for 24 days and god help you if you don't feel like doing it today because then it becomes 25 days instead.
---
Immolation Warlocks are great for big numbers, but ask yourself how important trash mob damage is. DoT Warlocks are very consistent for boss damage.

Who's doing the shredded manuals quest at 30+ though?
---
Pro tip: Try to stay off any Warrior's list. At 60, we'll have you constantly using your hearthstone.
---
It's for all intents and purposes a brand new game, launched 2 weeks ago. On top of that, it has an enormous nostalgic pull, and historical significance even to those without the nostalgia. Of course it has way more streamers and viewers and interest currently. I know people hate to hear this, but I do expect the interest to peter out in a few months, maybe a year, and we'll see Classic settle into a fairly regular plateau - that I expect will be less than retail, for the simple reason that by definition, Classic cannot and will not receive additional content after a certain point.
---
Nah, it's 11:15 👍
---
Edit: (zoomed in..) oh I think you're right
---
This is the best quest to learn how the auction house works.  1g spent 3 mins at auction house made me 3650 exp and i sold all my other pages and profited.
---
Yeah it makes sense but this is classic. They’re recreating the experience and I think it’s pretty cool that there aren’t alliance shamans and horde paladins. Gives a lot more faction dynamics. I will say I like paladins more than shamans even though I’m horde. But I’m sure once I level more I’m gonna love having windfurry 😊
---
I've been gaming online since long before RuneScape was "popular". It was always a joke in the MMO community. From Ultima Online to Everquest to DAoC to Lineage and onwards, RuneScape was ALWAYS referenced as a joke of a game.
---
The only people that didn't think so, were the people who played RuneScape.
---
If they stick to their guns about it being like back in vanilla just blacklist them. Eventually after enough people also blacklist  them they no longer get groups and will realize reputation matters.
---
Plot Twist: Now it's a 5 hour queue in order to get to the migration screen
---
Why are you guys rolling on hunter items anyway?
---
Agreed. The Dark Portal opening was one of the best moments in gaming
---
You used to have the IF ah, the Org ah and the Gadgetzan ah. only way to trade between ally and horde was through the goblin ah. the other two were ally or horde only, even if you could get your character to the other faction auctioneers alive they were hostile so you couldn't use them.
---
Why are you meleeing? 
---
Or why are you running out of arrows?
---
Seems like people are leaving the worst servers though, just flew through the queue (Gehennas - EU) :)
---
Nailed it
---
Most of the people in NA won't get this probably.
---
I guess I can?
---
Have you tried going in to your device manager, then going to your USBs and seeing if you can reenable there?
---
Ya, it's ok. Just live the dream there on behalf of the rest of us.
---
Is this a joke about quest helper add-ons?
---
Server transfers are restricted to a very limited set of high population servers to a selection of new servers. I doubt atiesh will ever have free transfers.
---
Did you take this pic with a Gameboy? The phone pics are bad enough but this is just getting ridiculous.
---
Blizzard messed this free transfers thing up real bad on EU
---
Would have been better as a rogue lol
---
OP is mostly referring from the base of pservers, I assume. Before the faction balance really got shattered on servers, the expansion was halfway done. Only after TBC the server balance was really destroyed, getting further screwed with by EMFH.
---
If you  watched any launch of pserver TBC server with the established meta known by the average Joe, you can see how the devs did everthing possible from free goodies to faction locks to keep people from rolling *all* horde.
---
With arenas in which you fight your own faction, there is simply no reason to run the opposing faction again.
---
People like APES went alliance partly, because alliance pretty much always has shorter BG queues due to being outnumbered, dragging people over to the alliance side in vanilla.
---
No such thing exists in TBC, therefore you see an abundance of horde only servers.
---
Came here just to make sure someone linked this haha
---
Really? Doesnt /sit cheese not work in Classic? Almost every talent in Arms sounds like it's better to me for leveling than Fury, yet I've seen a couple people say Fury til 40 today.
---
Sounds shitty but that stuff happened in vanilla all the time too. There's good and bad
---
It's one of the least efficient heals we have going by HPM and the fact that it's instant doesn't really make up for that. Not to mention the risk of overhealing and wasting mana on that. It's one of our worst heals and should be rarely used.
---
I will need anything I need, I dont even bother telling them in advance
---
Why the fuck do you insist on comparing a coordinated team instance grinding strategy during a bugged version of the game to the average experience of the average mage? You're cherry picking rare experiences as evidence for why something is better for everyone with any experience, even if leveling solo.
---
STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND GO PLAY THE LOTTERY
---
Won't that coincide with battlegrounds though? I'd think more people will be doing that over world pvp.
---
"This person can get 10,000 of X item and sell all of them at insane Y price guaranteed and no one else ever is going to do this same shit even once to deflate the market or ever have them run into countless issues of not NEARLY enough demand for their supply thus tanking it's market!"
---
Your dumbass logic. 
---
Go back to school kid and stop trying to preach from idiot mountain.
---
not trying to crap on your idea I love the can do attitude.  Try it if you have a raid boss that will allow it.  I'm just afraid the AoE will get the better of your pet, so pack plenty of shards. 
---
But if I'm in a guild that isn't just walking the dog in MC I'm going to want Blood Pact if its available.  I'm going to want optimal builds unless i have optimal party make up.  Every advantage I can get.  That being said...im going to make a run as a bear tank (Off tank im not crazy but still)
---
All shaman specs do well in pvp, same with dungeons. Your biggest downfall is mana efficiency, so you'll be drinking a lot regardless of spec. Enhance is just generally easier and more convenient to level, but switching at 40 is fine, lots of people do this who want to go elemental.
---
Just kill them all coward.
---
It's automating a process, so it is indeed against the TOS and it's not even a good automated system because of exactly that, it's the same timed intervals which looks like a bot/script.
---
yeah yeah yeah, activison is why warcraft died etc etc etc
---
1) Is terrible cause Alliance racials are ass.
---
2) Again terrible because ppl PVE on Whitemane (its one of FEW west coast servers)
---
There are mechanics in classic that are balanced around there only being one or limited spawn(s) per server. Layer hopping destroys that and let's a much larger number of resources enter the economy.
---
Frog has nothing to do on Peepee of Fairbanks. #freepeepee
---
Ahhh... Classic.
---
Maybe instead of the barbershop, they could have a button on the website somewhere (maybe the ingame shop's website if they decide to make it free) for appearance changes and have it work similar to retail's appearance change.  I wouldn't want a button in game for the shop if they ever add one, I'd be fine with a website though. I can 100% understand people not wanting a barber added, but I don't see the issue with a service (free or not) since it can't be done from in game.
---
Psychstrick needs to put them tiddies away.
---
Yea classic is more about putting in time and effort while also enjoying the zone. They don’t follow the normal slot machine model retail has when you easily complete your 10th m+ key for the week
---
According the math people tested not only was it not applying the negative it was also applying the group bonus, effectively doubling (or better) your clear times at the same rate of XP gain.  
---
People saying they got "just as much" XP in 5 mans I'm guessing were with slow raid clears or not doing the math correctly because they were having more fun (which is worth something in it's own right). The raid clear XP abuse was substantial and was rightfully taken away by Blizzard.

Play the auction house it won’t matter what class you are.

Idk my mentality with farm drop quests is thay 2 players mean twice as fast mob kills, which means in about the same time it would take to do the quest solo, you doubled the mob kills for more potential vendor cash without losing any exp due to group. Plus I've gotten invites to do dungeons where people are wanting only grossly overleveled DPS for "exp farm runs" just because I helped someone out with a quest.
---
Usually if I am really only wanting to solo something I just send a tell like "hey just finished the quest sorry" or something like that.

---
What's your secret?
---
For those at work:
---
We’ve been monitoring players’ use of layers, and we agree that we should add a delay between subsequent layer transfers. Under the hood we have all the controls I talked about in the Reddit AMA before launch, a few secret weapons we haven’t discussed publicly, and we’re working on deploying some additional controls to further restrain layering from being exploitable.
---
However, we also want to assure you that the issue is a much smaller problem than some people are claiming. We’ve been closely monitoring the effect layering is having on economies and other aspects of the game, and many of the stories we see posted are wildly inaccurate. We’ve seen screenshots of banks full of rare crafting materials, which we’ve investigated and proved false.
---
Another popular theory is that you can determine your current layer by doing a /who in a capital city, and comparing the results against the /who your friend does. That doesn’t work because /who returns results from the entire realm, not just from your layer, and if the result set is too large it truncates the results before sorting them. This means every player gets different results, but those differences in result set have nothing to do with which layer you’re on. This has led some people to claim that they’ve discovered dozens of layers per realm, but that claim is completely false.
---
All realms have a single-digit number of layers. Most of them have a low single-digit number.
---
Rest assured that there are not people running around with banks full of Thorium Crystals or Black Lotus
---
I am apart of the community. Just because you disagree doesn’t make me a bad player. What work? I have to spend hours running around or swimming looking for boxes to unlock to level it up.
---
Three months ago, I would have told you I'd be no-lifing the game and level 30+ by now. That has not been possible. I'm playing as much as I possibly can on two different servers. One with friends who want to play PVE and another with my guild on PVP. My highest level character (out of three I'm planning to 'main') is 16.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I'm sure there are a lot of friendly people who love to group up for any damn thing at all, you've just out leveled them already.
---
Then that’s a difficult choice for sure. If my entire guild wanted to move, then I would absolutely make that decision as the guild leader to make everyone happy. I’m glad my guild mostly wants to stay put. 
---
I hope my worries are wrong and if you do transfer, everything ends up ok!
---
We did not make any of the decisions the first time around. Blizzard made all the decisions. Each of us chose to play as long as we played. They're going to make those same decisions this time around.
---
I’ll check them out thanks!
---
Classic+ is never going to happen.  It would overtly undermine their narrative and take way more investment than restarting classic.
---
Lol. You sound like a neckbeard.
---
And then in 5 years from now, they got gay married.
---
A shitter only interacted with shitters to form his shitter opinion,  weird.
---
Games far from a joke.  Simple maybe, but the world is fun and you could run it on a toaster in 2004 which made it well loved, so I regret to inform you that your subjective opinion is objectively false.
---
Trust me, the entire hour he was helping I was waiting for it. I kept thinking, "This jacka$$ is gonna gank me when I'm on a mob I can't handle." But sure as delicious peach pie this UD rogue helped me the whole time. And at the end waved and mounted up and rode off.
---
Ahh the reputation argument... most people dont give a shit if you are a ninja. It takes to much effort to worry about who is reputable or not for dungeons. The only time i ever thought about the player i was interacting with was when they held 100's of gold in mats to make me something.
---
Check to see if you have the highest rank spells in your action bar. Unless you manually drag your newly learnt spells into your action bar, you will use lower ranks and do less damage and healing.
---
I have a list of players who ninjalooted or camped boss spawns after already killing it and stuff. You know for later to know with whoom not to group up or raid.
---
It would only take 10 mins tops to skip through the vod and see which areas he used, but from memory it was essentially the same as every generic mage aoe grind anyone has done for vanilla. Farm orcs, tanaris pirates, wpl skellies, hearthglen etc. There were no special tricks or tactics, just get out in front and go hard is what got him the first 60.
---
I too regret the way my character looked and decided to delete a lvl 16 rogue and made a new one, I’m lvl 31 now.
---
And no, I dont wish for a barber or paid service. A big part of classic is recognizing your fellow players. Character customization matters, and it wont matter as much if players are free to change their core apperance whenever they like to.
---
literally unplayable
---
They simplified everything in retail over time, including pets, to allow players to focus on end game content. Unfortunately they unintentionally dumbed down the game and made it far more bland.

Hi, /u/No_Trace

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d06id9/community_service_focused_guild_exploding_sheep/).
---
I think they accidentally deleted your character. Nvm
---
Or "right".
---
Kro3 had their own little quirks like beasts sleeping like in WC3 at night which lead to a reduced aggro range. 
---
Obviously its not blizzlike, but I enjoyed it  alot.
---
Its really cute how you are interpreting that graph and you think its proving that the "vast majority of players" prefer TBC.
---
Even if we pretended that you're right though people have changed a lot in the last decade and many that thought TBC was great look back and realize the trainwreck that introducing arenas and flying became.  
---
Now looking at what we really see on the graph instead of whatever story you think its telling.  You could easily interpret it as BC *slowing* down the new subs.  Vanilla attained close to 8 million on its own, then only gain another couple million during the entirety of BC's run, which COULD be intepreted as BC stagnating the game.  This could be WoW simply getting older, but you could just as easily infer that most people liked vanilla over TBC as you could that people liked TBC.
---
The truth is this graph doesn't tell you much either way because there are so many other factors, but its really laughable that you are using this as a citation you absolute mouth breathing retard.
---
&gt; mass produce target dummies and farm fused wirings off of them
---
My target dummy did not become lootable. I don't think blizz patched this correctly.
---
Any cat from stv 😊
---
As far as I’m aware Jokerd did not do bugged instance AoE grinding. He just AoE farmed till 60. 
---
And he got ahead of the pack by AoE farming mobs, so yeah of course there is no competition, he was the first after all.

---
ahahhahahaha
---
&gt; It's relevant because you said streamers do it for attention when they clearly do it for the money.
---
These two are pretty damn related for a streamer.
---
why? the Alliance as it is in WoW wasn't present at mount Hyjal.
---
I am a neckbeard, good call.
---
Add then to your ignore list for a handy in game option.
---
Got 4 hooves killing 6 zebras I think that's a record
---
No idea what that is.
---
also maybe just dont use your mount when playing together until she has one also?
---
Hunters are Mel Gibson?!
---
Hehehe. Doing exactly the same. I just don’t have admin permissions, so i have to keep an updated version of the game on a thumb stick.
---
Closest thing you can get to a dragon
---
Gang gang
---
I make it my goal to pickup rogues, shamans and hunters more. Or the rare shadow priest too is always welcome. I've been doing the mage aoe cleave for a handful of SM runs and while they are amazing xp and decent loot, sometimes it just gets boring trivializing content. But, to each their own, it is nice having the option though, or getting random PMs from people cause I'm a higher level mage.
---
That's cool, thanks for being honest at the start that you will be needing on the gear
---
General: Warrior: "Looking for DPS"
---
Party: Shaman: "but, we have a full group
---
*Kicks Shaman out of the group
---
JK, I'm alliance.
---
I would say that worked well for the first few heads, but then there was the one that wonders around the pond and I ran in circles with a group for 30 minutes before giving up.
---
That's good info, thanks. I haven't been swapping layers so I'll give that a shot. I've probably been playing alongside the few other Alliance who also aren't swapping away from this 80/20 stuff.
---
First of all, play want you want to play. Play what looks cool to you. The point is to make a character you will identify with and you will love.
---
Thousand Needles doesn't really have an Alliance Presence. Thalaanar isn't even technically in it. But yeah besides that weird Badlands flight point every zone that's for 30 and below in Azeroth is pretty empty of Horde.
---
That makse sense, I was thinking either warrior or hunter. is warrior still going to be playable if im a casual player though?
---
I played Vanilla on Spinebreaker, a server where the Alliance severely outnumbered the horde for years.
---
To give an example, Alliance would sometimes wait for 10+ hour queues to get into Altarac Valley, while horde queues were nearly instant.
---
I absolutely loved the imbalance, always having someone to find and kill, and coming up with ways to deal with multiple opponents.
---
My current server has an unfair Alliance/Horde imbalance, and I hate it because I see way too much of my own faction.
---
You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
---
Each player grants legitimacy to a world achievement. If you think a player cheated or did not earn the achievement then with you it has no legitimacy.
---
I have it on a dell 5285 2 in 1.. it’s basically a tablet and still runs it ( though not near as pretty as my desktop). You’re fairly safe with any recent &lt; 3 year old laptop.
---
So do I still get the double bonus points if I was a Revenge Hunter before Arrow came out? lol
---
They just started offering server transfers if its that bad.
---
&gt; Someone could easily walk right thru the desolace from Red Ridge
---
Doesn't sound easy to me...
---
Yes, correct. I wasn't disagreeing with you.
---
Classes can use work - should that be done in Classic+? I don't know. But by releasing other servers running TBC and WotLK? Probably a good idea for both Blizz and the players.
---
Shadow word pain is the absolute last thing I would skip, it's priests highest DPs by far (being like 10 times wand damage with an instant cast in sustained fights.) Mind blast is nice but not mandatory.
---
Thanks!!
---
Around BRD it’ll be easier being prot. When raid dps is high, and healers are competent, you can go back to dps spec for higher threat.
---
Say it ain't so, a youtuber sensationalized something for views and the army of lemmings followed them? I don't even believe it.
---
Same on shazzar, was looking at mmo-champion every day and not seen anything about eu migrations, US yes, but nothing on EU
---
So basically you're saying if they just add a few more layers que times would disappear... you're wrong.
---
Sorry you chose to burn yourself out in retail
---
i need a target
---
Thanks a lot! A new one coming in about 12 hours or so xD
---
Just belly laughed so hard reading this at work. Co worker asked what I was laughing at. Told them they wouldn’t understand. Showed it to them. They didn’t understand.
---
When is this?
---
Can guarantee they are going to leave, especially if they’re waiting for ten minutes then I come by and steal that mob, people are going to quit. I’ve seen people leave guilds cause no one will invite him to later hop.
---
I believe they call it retail because that is how it was labelled at one point (maybe even still) in the game files.
---
I'm looking for specifics. Can you link me a laptop?
---
But it will receive updates for the next couple years.  Hopefully after that there will be a BC update.  
---
I don't think people who play retail and people who play classic are the same types of people.  Unless Blizzard really does some stuff to improve the community and general engagement levels in retail I'll never go back.  In short there are a lot of people looking to fill the void of a lack of decent MMO's these days.  I think It'll do just fine.
---
Nobody is negatively affected by free speech. Might I remind you that without the constitutional right to free speech and the freedom of association a lot of the social justice movements may have not happened as they did in the States. Some mean no no words is a small price to pay for absolute and irrevocable rights.
---
If warriors could learn Rex-kwan-do, all the mobs would be fucked.
---
Hero!
---
Super clean hi. What add on??
---
Everything sucks so we should keep it sucking.
---
Kazak will have a hard tether distance in classic. They fixed it in Vanilla so you couldn't do this and they confirmed that is how he will operate in classic.  
---
In vanilla, GMs had to literally intervene when Kazak made it to stormwind, else he would never die.
---
The highlight.  
---
&gt;Rest assured that there are not people running around with banks full of Thorium Crystals or Black Lotus
---
Restated: You guys got fooled by a screenshot from a private server.  Layering does not do what you think it does.
---
At work atm but I assume one says retail? If that’s it I get it but still a strange way to classify the two. Anyway not a big deal in the slightest just looking for clarification.
---
I say boar because it has a guaranteed taunt and a small immobilize skill
---
KoS addon
---
It's an etiquette. Different people have different etiquette standards. You're certainly free to choose to adhere to the idea that because you are the Rogue and you level your lock-picking, that you automatically get any chests that are locked. Other people may not see it that way and you may have to deal with them spreading negative things about you on the server because of that.
---
Not if the inflated price isn't moving product.
---
the world first 60 only really used layering from 58-60 and he was extremely far ahead of everyone else already at this point.
---
the exp in 10 man dungeon farms was not insanely higher than doing efficient 5 mans anyways
---
Classic WoW doesn't have a trial, unfortunately.
---
Repeating.
---
I’m trying to find a computer that I can record gameplay to upload videos and play wow on the highest settings at the minute, if you have any recommendations I’d be all ears. Got a budget of around 1500 dollars
---
Ya, farming arathi fire ele's and selling charms/fire elements is probably the best way to farm mount money atm.
---
Yup... Friend wanted to play pally unfortunately
---
I've been debating on main alting a rogue or hunter since launch. My main is a lock who is nearing 50 and I have no idea which to alt. 
---
I've mained a hunter or lock and alt the other one since TBC way back in the day, I love both classes. But my alt I want to be able to do WPvP well. dungeons and raids too! I'm just honestly not sure which to go with. Hunter seems nice and I know and enjoy the class but rogue seems fun, quirky and powerful in all phases and stealth is fricking beautiful. 
---
Thoughts?
---
Goddamn people are inventive.
---
Nope, use literally any boss guide that has been created in the last 15 years.
---
Kill-diet-sprite
---
Can you send me a link?
---
If it were I would be in serious debt
---
My beliefs don't matter, I'm more evidence and proof based kinda guy. Sorry for being interested in facts. You're welcome to give the info when you can access it. I just don't need my algorithms flooded with his clickbait more than they already are.
---
I don't give a shit what you roll on, as long as I have windfury totem m8.
---
Azeroth gold mint is a fiat currency, gold itself has little value.
---
Thought an RP realm would be ok with an occasional weird thing I would encounter from time to time. Then release night happened and in the nelf starting zone all they talked about was horse, cat, and other animal dicks and loads of animal cum to the face and mouth for quite literally hours on end. Decided after it not ceasing for hours that I was done, logged out of that character and never going to log back in. A bit sad as I had always wanted to try RP but that portion of the community killed it for me.
---
Trust me, the other end of that situation sucks too. GF broke up with me the Wednesday after launch
---
whoa whoa whoa, I am fine if a Shaman wants to roll on it but Hunters aren't even people.
---
Exactly, what you do is 3-4 weeks before BC "launch", create new Vanilla servers and let folks free transfer to them.  Those servers get the BC pre-launch events and stuff so people can relive them.  Then, on launch day, those servers officially transition to BC servers and the free transfer turns off.
---
To be the next Sam Deathwalker.
---
Haha dude that trinket is going to live in your bags for the rest of the game
---
Very clever and original.
---
I knew a guy in vanilla who did that after he was fired from his job.  He leveled a few characters two at a time and sold them.  He might have been an exception but it's definitely incorrect to say that 'Literally no one does that'.
---
Have you lived without internet the last couple of days?
---
Also Winkey + Shift + S
---
You could also probably just try a meleecleave, because that will be more fun for the tank. 
---
A spellcleave group just does not need a tank, therefore you are only a packup.  
---
A melee cleave consisting of 4 warriors and a resto shaman actually do want more sweeping strike cleaving warriors smashing content.
---
It's just the term have been using to differentiate them. They are different. 'Modern' or 'current' or even 'BfA' would probably work just as well, 'retail' just happens to be the term thats come into use.
---
Now that I think about it, it could be a carryover from private servers, where 'retail' was definitely not a description of what you were playing.
---
Yet I see people complaining all the time that their 440 trinket isn't an upgrade over their 430 benthic on live?
---
I've noticed some people don't appreciate tactical mastery and all it does for us. Stance dancing doesn't seem as prevalent. If you can stance dance Arms wrecks people's lives.
---
I am going to respec into Oomkin at 40
---
Catering to completely different crowds, operating under completely different magnitudes of players. Imagine being new to the game, the majority of players are on Tier 14 and the newest content, and you just joined needing to somehow find raids for Tier 1-13 to catch up. That isn't going to work very well.
---
Not even bis...
---
&gt;against the spirit of classic
---
Nothing better than people trying to police other people about what "the spirit" of something is.
---
Phony golden ages are what makes people dumb.
---
Every expansion, like the first time
---
Nice cakeday
---
Paladin could be interesting. IF they don't force you to heal.
---
True story when the US was fighting American Natives they used the term "nits make lice" and justified the slaughter of kids.
---
I see so do you think i need to respec? or can i just put points in starting at 23?
---
Holy. FUCK. Thank you SO much. I’ve been sooo confused. Only 30 levels in kek
---
If all the new blood wants is to abuse inauthentic game mechanics and make the game into a pointless inflated race then I don't want them.
---
The application being windows? It takes *literally* 10 seconds to go from key press to post.
---
Yeah I think that cool down was how we got mid combat layer swaps. the layer swap could be so delayed you could get layer swapped like 10 minutes later
---
Dont get me wrong i buff people saved many lives with nova aswell but if im sitting and drinking theres a chance you running past me i wont buff due to low mana and im a man on a mission
---
*gasp* That isnt classic! But seriously. Even with all iits faults WoW is still a beautiful game.
---
Yep...those were the days.
---
Isn't that the same end? someone breaking up with you
---
Wow! Hours is a long time! I used to know a way to get up there from Loch Modan, but it didn't take me hours
---
Silver and Gold Pawn......what's that? No sir, we do not have Battletoads.
---
I’m the rogue spamming where’s mankriks wife
---
Most of the layering abuse is fake.
---
So theres that. 
---
Before you downvote. Read up on it.
---
I'm not getting mad, I'm getting even. :) Don't be so afraid.
---
If you haven't psychic screamed with the last of your mana and cannibalized a corpse just to say alive then you're not living
---
Any. Wow classic will run on a potato.
---
Modern wow got the name “retail” back when the only way to play Vanilla was on unofficial private servers. The name just stuck and now Blizzard is using it themselves. 
---
As for why we differentiate them at all, they’re separate games. The only thing they share is the subscription.
---
Same - I could take it or leave it, the only real info I'm using on it is the XP/hr readout which XToLevel already has a nice clean mini-window of its own you can use, I just liked how it framed the UI so that there's very little else inside its borders and the hotbars kind of "pop up" out of it.
---
Most alliance are running to the dungeons because questing just isn't a possibility a lot of the time.
---
But like the blue post says, your still personally putting in the action to play the game. Whether your doing it to avoid getting kicked out of the que or not is not the question as long as you yourself are performing the action.
---
We learned in cata I believe that stendel was a farmer who lived by stendels pond in west fall and starting in cata there’s two graves (maybe in vanilla too I’m horde though so not sure) and you can now fish the pond for his wedding band that gives crit rating and non unique so OP as fuck in the 19 bgs if you have 2 also have like a 1% or less chance to be fished up
---
I stopped watching after Season 1 because there were just too many other good shows going on. How’s the rest of the series so far? Is it still going? I’d check myself but am currently on an airplane toilet and about to take off. appreciate any insight
---
You beat me to it, got confused when I saw the water elemental then saw all the extra options in the bottom right 😆
---
I dont know what server you play but on Incendious, Doug is our God
---
Stagnant Oasis. Multiple fungal spawns even a couple away from the lake and most people down there have already finished the spores quest.
---
Usually lots of dead Oasis snapjaws if you're a skinner too.
---
I have a shit list and a good guy list.
---
My shitlist is mostly people of my own faction that act like twats or ninja stuff. I put in a short reason beside their name why they are their. My good guy list is mostly tanks and healers that do a good job that I'd like to party with again
---
I first had the same thought. Does the add on mean somewhere on the cliff and it’d take for ever to travel to there?
---
Then I saw the train of mobs
---
No. It makes bag space more valuable. It requires more trips between a city or a bank or an auction house. This all is designed for a player to find Value in time put in. Even if something as simple as traveling. If you do not find Value in this this is not the fault of the game.
---
If anyone thinks they are going to run through EVERY expansion all over again are insane
---
That makes no sense. To just redo 15 years? Lol
---
They will go up to Wrath if they want and that's it
---
it's because some dipshit who wants to evenly spread out his points will end up in your raid hindering YOUR experience
---
in any group content, you lose all right to play "how you want". when it comes to group content, you're supposed to play a certain way or you're playing wrong.
---
this isn't gatekeeping, it's just expecting people to carry their weight so i don't have to.
---
the dumbasses who want to reinvent the wheel and play a "super unique" spec are bad for the game. shitty players don't help the game.
---
So it's "only fun" when it's perfectly advantageous for you? Sounds like you shouldn't be playing MMOs
---
It is currently _retail_ and _classic_ in the wow game folder.
---
By "most" you mean the one completely ridicules case of a guy claiming he has hundreds or was it thousands of arcane crystals?
---
That's "most of the layering abuse"?
---
Yeah that's been my experience so far to be honest, in both retail and classic. Thanks for your advice.
---
The cresting water elementals drop a enchanted water up to 5 at a time commonly those are good to farm as well.
---
I have it on good authority that pressing alt + f4 will triple your exp gained. That's how the speed levelers do it. 
---
Shhhh, be cool about it though. Don't tell too many people.
---

atonement still a bitch?

wtf is wrong with people don't even know how to take a screen shot holy shit
---
I've seen it twice in 43 levels, both times from someone asking for help with a broken quest.
---
Something tells me the people most affected by and upset by this are the same cabal of hyper achievement focused sleepless nerds. Yeah it'll pork up the economy, but that was always going to happen anyway...people had too much foreknowledge going in. And it won't be long before things like trading Classic gold for Retail gold becomes commonplace.
---
It ain't 2004 anymore.
---
sounds good to me!
---
I've made a chat on dreadmist called seers
---
Also--hillsbrad starts at 25 for horde, 30-31 for alliance
---
You get used to it - the key part is making sure you can still see them out-of-combat if you have missing health/mana, so you make sure to heal up between pulls etc.
---
On the other hand, do what's most fun :D I'll be rocking dual wield for a while too.
---
you are so insecure and your projection is embarrassingly pathetic. or you just made it all up because it doesn't add up at all that you are this "successful" person who can be so ignorant/abrasive/defensive on reddit to strangers.
---
I’m literally thinking the same man, works draggin haven’t even fished on my character yet... now tonight I just wanna stay awake all night and just fish
---
It's hard to take what they say seriously when you Farm a mining node join a group and it respawns in your face. To say people out there are not going to exploit that is beyond delusional.
---
On top of that Blizzard won't admit there is a problem because they want to calm the fire not throw gas on it.
---
Alright, lets do this...
---
Even the NPC stop and stared!
---
i'll hope blizzard fixes it soon
---
You need to use different ranked heals as a healer in vanilla wow, otherwise you're usually wasting mana.

You can change your name/appearance/race by creating a new character.

No, i've used the aspire e15 it was $500 but ran decent on retail. Acer is a good brand.

---
Oh I guarantee after layering is fully removed there will be posts like 
---
* "WHY REMOVING LAYERING WAS THE WORST DECISION BLIZZARD HAS EVER MADE" 
---
* "LAYERS MADE THE GAME PLAYABLE" 
---
* "WHY BLIZZARD WOULDVE INCLUDED LAYERS IN VANILLA IF THEY HAD THE TECHNOLOGY"
---
EDIT: I forgot the shitposter;
---
* "ONIONS HAVE LAYERS AND SO SHOULD WOW" posted by GitOutOfMySwamp
---
That's obvious but I was asking if there was a add-on like the retail dungeon journal
---
Playing devil's advocate. What if the player's enjoyment IS gatekeeping?
---
Alliance players are all equally misguided in their faction choice, and should be sent to rehabilitation Centers immediately.
---
this is like the third time I've commented this today, but it's just gaming in general.  
---
People don't play for fun anymore, its about being the best. I blame streaming and esports.
---
They've just died so much they have a long respawn timer.

What’s BM?

Cant use?

I have one more addon in use for my Shaman - SamyTotemTimers. It will let you macro "Twisting" keybinds that let you drop say, Stoneclaw, then Earthbind, then back to Stoneclaw... I haven't played my Shaman much but it seems like a great solution for managing totems.

at a roughly 3% droprate, it is impossible someone has that many arcane crystals at this point on classic, even if they were stationary and farming 24/7. Mathematically impossible.
---
the most rewarding part of pvp open world is killing equally matched opposing faction taking resources from you like mobs or nodes. and if you beat them again, you can confidently say you denied resources and time to one player at the gain of yourself.

the problem is if you beat someone silly they can just layer hop

You do know that AH takes a deposit for posting which you lose if your auction doesn't sell, right? That deposit is not very small either. If you keep listing them and they keep expiring, soon you will have lost enough money that it would have been more efficient to vendor the item.

I can't think of anything during leveling that warlocks and priests don't share. We had a rogue need on int/spirit ring and that was pretty lame, but if you are a caster, what even was it?

Out of curiosity, who was that? I know there was one guy spamming general forums with screenshot "proof" of a guy that had a bank full of arcane crystals, and a number of mindless people were accepting it as reality and that Classic is doomed.

I mean, honestly your just stating the obvious. Now yes Guilds were full clearing MC the first week Vanilla WoW was out but it also didn't have 15 years to be a game at that time. All the guilds that "for the most part" destroying MC have what matters most in there Team work and a cohesiveness. MC has never been a gear check its been a massive Team work check and knowing what your doing. Thats the big reason why so many people can be in there at 56 or higher, or even be a fresh new 60. 
---
Everyone has their play style. Take me for example. I'm the kind of person who hates dungeon grinding. I only do a dungeon if I have 4-5 quests to go in there, if I don't I won't run em. I'd rather mob grind then dungeon grind.
---
I was once told this in WotLK by a guildie while we were discussing a horrible Ret Paladin who was wearing all Cloth SP+ gear. "*He pays the same 15 bucks a mont that you do to play, so other than trying to help him better himself no one really has the right to tell that guy how he wants to play" - Said by someone much Wiser and smarter than me in my guild at the time.*

That's what I'm asking for here.  People who tested seal twisting and what they think.  I've tried all possible combinations and the only real seal twisting that works is soc into soj.  Sotc into soc or sor is kinda but not really.  It's more for the attack speed.  At least I couldn't see the ap increase.  I'll try that later.

I don't think that's true. Though I'm not super experienced in hunting old fish.

Anyone tried kiting servants of allistarj from blastedlands? I'm level 47 and can hit them enough that I feel like they shouldn't ever drop aggro, but they always leash when I get far enough from their spawn. I feel like they may have forseen the fun I would have and preemptively gave them a leash (even though they only said kazzak was leashed)

You assume that there is any logical reason why everybody else waiting in the queue alongside you has any less desire than you to stay on that server
---
Part of playing in a groups for dungeons is being a team player. If that person isn't pulling their weight, then sure by all means kick them, no one should get special treatment if they want a build with say, evenly distributed points in all their trees that doesn't really do much. Don't kick them because their talent tree, kick them because what they are DOING with their talent tree isn't contributing. That is their choice to make, as it is the choice of the group to remove someone who isn't part of the team.
---
That’s funny because I’m horde in shimmering flats constantly getting ganked by alliance.
---
Yeah thanks. Had to pay attention to that a lot today. That one warlock would always be at just under 50%. I stopped healing them. It went fine, they didnt die. Though I wasnt comfortable seeing them like that.
---
Then how would we see the pixel grids?
---
Alliance gets a pretty decent one from killing gnolls in redridge.

Going through this post, one would think that Blizzard still has tons of GMs closely monitoring everything that's going on in WoW 24/7. Anyone with a brain knows this ain't the case though. Why lie so blatantly?
---

Well, if they get carried through SM lol. But damn that's a nice axe.

Yeah bro, i also understood what op was saying in his post. Duck me, right ?

You lose your deposit and have to spend time relishing it.
---
it will show as a number on the player, not on the target. ELVUI has this listed as a known bug with no estimate on when a fix can be found
---
the elvui forum is worth looking at if you're an elvui noob
---
pro tip: you also can't get enemy target buffs to show up because it's not possible in classic. there is a mage spell that reveals buffs and this is why addons won't show you. you'll notice this at some point and it will annoy you too.
---
I enjoy watching Twitch streams but have almost stopped entirely of late watching Classic WoW for the amount of streamers simply cheesing the leveling process.
---
To each their own, but I'm like you: I find no enjoyment out of it.
---
I can see why.
---
cause they are bis(maybe not for orc/human) at max level for a long time?

---
The way SamyTotemTimers works is that it adds another "bar" to your screen that shows your 4 totem types, and has another popup bar to show what totems you have out and how long the duration is on them - that handles the visual part, then for the keybindings I'd probably check out the "Twist" functionality but ultimately probably settle on using 4 main keybinds, with modifiers for different totems (Stoneskin on Q, Earthbind on Shift+Q, Strength of Earth on Alt+Q, something like that)
---
You should need on Ravager. It is much better for large aoe fights like the one in ZF.
---
In the keybindings there is an option to set abilities on the bottom action bar to shift plus a number key so that you can use your number keys for more actions
---
Awesome. Do you think I could bind it to my mouse wheel scrolling up so I could essentially scroll through the marks as I mouse over mobs
---
Thank you! This was bugging me so much, I was about to remove the addon. Glad I didn't have to!
---
Depends... If it's a difficult quest with a 'boss' mob designed for a group, then grouping makes sense.  Dungeon groups are needed for the same reason, and sometimes overcrowded spots make it a necessity.
---
Otherwise, if I wanted all quest mobs to die within seconds, I would be playing BfA rather than classic.  I generally enjoy quests more at my own pace, rather than steamrolling everything in a group.  I'm not in a race to hit 60, after all... Leveling is the best part of the game, IMO.
---
Mind you, I'm happy to help others with heals and buffs, but I usually don't want help myself... It makes the game too easy (ie: more boring).
---

Dungeons are my favorite. How about restoring them to 1.0 version as they originally were.
---
While it's not entirely accurate, but the blue post itself states all of the server layer numbers are in single-digits, MOST of them in LOW single-digits. Following this, it makes sense that most realms would be no more than 3 or 4 (since 5 would no longer qualify as "low single digit" - it's the halfway point of single digits, and therefore not "low"). I can't speak for the high-pop servers, maybe they do have 7 or 9 layers (seems unlikely), but the point I am making is this comment, even if not entirely accurate, is at the very least pretty close to actual numbers based on the blue post.
---
Okay, so you showed nothing having to do with the economy. Blizzard acknowledged they are readjusting the cooldown for layering. You’re just calling bullshit in general or like, what are you trying to say?
---
I used paranoia during vanilla that had most of these features.

One thing to get if you don't have it is a nice mouse for gaming.  I have a Razer Naga mouse and it has 12 buttons on the left side where your thumb rests.  Using those 12 buttons along with a few keys my left hand can get to on the keyboard allows me to do pretty much anything on 3 or 4 actions bar with just my two thumbs.
---
You still have to put some thought into key bindings - I prefer to put the stuff I use most closer to 1 and the stuff I don't use as much towards 12 just because of how natural it is for my thumb to hit each of them.  Aside from that just key bind in a way that feels natural and prioritize key binding the things you use the most first and then the ones you don't use later.
---
I loved swimming to the Island and looking at the treasure it was filled with. It was just cool and made me wonder about the goblins who put it there and never came back to get it.
---
Just gotta take it upon ourselves to get this hatred boiling, and I fully intend to. I intend to breed hatred on the horde side towards alliance, and hope the alliance develop a KOS for all horde.
---
They will add a cd as requested by those with some common sense. I also expected them to make a statement regarding layer abuse , and possible bans, just to scare some people off. By abuse i mean what people do now, things like avoiding pvp, mob respawns etc,  not the exaggerated fake stuff that they debunked. The "inv for player" meta is retarded, sorry to say.
---
This better be in World Of Warcraft 2
---
Ah that makes a lot of sense
---
Do you think it's better to save crafting agents to use later or just sell it for the early game boost to economy
---
Love these moments!
---
Grats. But can anyone else not wait for the initial hype for the first month of classic to die down with everyone wanting to rush to 60 so that everyone becomes more casual?   
---
The people rushing realize that this is the content they'll have for months at a time, right?
---
Back I go...

Tested it with a friend and found him on another layer. It's not true.

This varies by cat age/health etc. My ancient foster cats get scheduled wet food in the morning then have constant access to dry food. They both have renal failure. They get to eat whenever they can/want to, and I can keep track of their appetites with their morning feeding. Kittens have to eat more frequently-- etc etc. &lt;3 Sounds like you've found what works for your fluffs, though! :)
---
You're not wrong. It is strange.
---
No, my employer doesn't allow them.
---
That's not really a huge deal. Realistically nobody that plays the game normally has the need to layer change often. I can see how there's a few fringe scenarios that would put you in the same category like joining a dungeon group, getting layered, removed from the group by the party leader, joining a different group a minute later, getting layered and then leaving on your own to join friends, getting layered again. Doesn't happen often at all and even if it does, it's not hat big of a deal.
---
Can also add other restrictions such as the requirement to be in the same zone or in proximity of another player of the other layer. You don't need to be in the same layer if the other party member(s) are 3 zones away. 
---
Fact is Blizzard can definitely figure something out that will prohibit the unwanted behaviour. They have the people to think about it and a solution shouldn't be that hard to implement.
---
You mean people on reddit and the BNet forums are posting wildly inaccurate claims with no proof and it turns out to be BS? Nooooooo waaayyy broooooo.......

Yeah you might be right on that one now that I think of it. Whatever, I stand by everything else I said.
---
Yeah I don't blame people, especially since most Hunters suck. It's still shitty to deal with though
---
Is there any type of spec/hybrid on a class that I can use for both PVE and PVP that is viable? I understand there is no best of both worlds but I want to go from leveling and doing dungeons (and maybe raids in the future) to also doing world pvp occasionally. And I heard with rogues for example, that the PVE spec doesn't really do good for PVP, and vise versa. I just want to do both without having to pay a bunch of gold to respec each time.
---
i thought this was fixed? that mobs will eventually always reset once youre far enough
---
&gt; I predict a 'Blizzard is LYING
---
To be fair, you should never, ever assume a corporation is telling the truth about anything ever. They may tell the truth, if it happens to be the response that serves them the best, but it's certainly not their goal.

He only used layering for the final 2 levels when he was already miles ahead to speed things up and avoid streamsnipers. 0-58 involved no layer abuse.
---
Accurate
---
They still would have to prove it was a world first I guess, unless Blizzard confirms it.
---
You're delusional. Have any proof of any of this?
---
Jesus.  You're fucking dense.
---
Do you not understand queueing and why it happens?
---
If 70,000 people want to play the game on your realm at 7PM PST, and the server supports 50,000 concurrent players (10 layers at 5,000 per layer), how long do you wait in queue?
---
If 70,000 people want to play the game on your realm at 7PM PST, and the server supports 5,000 concurrent players (no layering), how long do you wait in queue?
---
You know what's gonna blow your mind?  It's a *lot faster* in the first case than the second.  Because the concurrency is far higher, *and* the turnover is far higher.  And that is *exactly* why Blizzard has warned everyone on high concurrency realms that queue times are going to grow enormously once layering is removed, if active player stats stay as high as they are.
---
Wow.  BOOM.  Who woulda thought.

For the enemy target buffs they wont show as icons? You can see them with no addons on the target right?

I prefer Classic but for a beginner I would say retail unless you really want a challenge.
---
I seriously doubt that. 
---
First off, the top percentile has always out geared out farmed and out-earned the rest of the player base. Layerings, phasing or sharding might be contributing to the wealth gap but I think you are overestimating just how much. If one player plays for 2 hours a day and does not use layering to reset spawns faster while another player plays 9 hours and do use it then removing layering might close the wealth gap slightly but it will still be pretty massive. There are far bigger contributing factors that cause monopolies.
---
Secondly, by players abusing layering they are simply generating more resources. This drops prices of things like enchants and flasks. If anything it's beneficial to the players who have less gold to buy them.
---
I don't like layerings and from what I understand it is supposed to be temporary. I just don't think it's going to make players quit because they can't afford flasks. If you quit because you can't afford to buy flasks then you are going to quit regardless of layering abuse.
---
Leveling a warrior is a pain and leveling a paladin is boring. But together... it's worse. RIP $15.

---
if it were me I'd probably try to hang onto it and wait until the economy fleshed out a bit more so you could sell it for more later, especially when it could go toward your epic mount which is going to be more of a grind than your starter mount, but there's nothing wrong with just wanting the money now to get your first mount if that's more exciting to you

29 level priest looking for advice. I end up usually healing in dungeons and I was wondering if Im using the right spells.

The further the economy advances, the more gold you will get for these rare things.  If you need the money now, sell it, otherwise hold as long as you can.  You may even find yourself at a point where you just want to keep it.

The cooldown for layer hoping right now is longer than node respawn times. So until you show me a video that it is happening so fast that they can layer hop from node to node, then I don’t know what to say to you. 
---
You’re calling bullshit on blizzard for acknowledging the layer issue but alleging it is being blown way out of proportion, by blowing it out of proportion without any evidence. One 50 second clip some someone changing layer with a party invite is nothing new, or exploitative.

Definitely *don't* sell it now. People who do have the gold for it are saving up for their mount or getting prepped for raiding, not looking to buy pets. Hold onto it for a bit.
---
did you get a message like "instance not found" ?
---
I spend all my mana on attacking like a real Hunter. Mend pet? Reportable offense.
---
you have it attached to the info panel (bar on the bottom of your frame in elvui), attach it to the health bar if you want it there. all those other options on that health tab are for where you want that text
---
move it around
---
mine is set to attach to health, text is CENTER and i centered it up by fucking with the offset sliders since i use a 3d portrait but want it centered on my bar, not my frame
---
edit: and this may sound stupid but it may be something you don't know, you can drag the settings window for elvui out of the way so you can see the changes in real-time like when you're moving the offset sliders or whatever
---
In Vanilla, if you and a friend typed /who at the same time you’d get different results. If you typed it a few seconds later, you’d get different results. Were we switching layers then?
---
There isn't a single 1v1 in this clip it's just ganking  people in combat and a sad show of skill all around doesn't really seem to warrant a video!
---
Wait to sell, people don’t have much gold now but that is something that will be worth a hefty amount in a month or so
---
You named your pet *raptor* FilthyFrank instead of SalamanderMan?... It's like I don't even know you anymore.
---
You're sad.

Pray for those who were just seconds late coming for the zep

If you play enough you'll eventually get a helm that covers your face and hair anyways.

i like a bear tank for swipe, but a warrior with ravager might be better, a priest and at least 2 mages 1 warlock is fine.

Rogue can turn invisible how can you argue that they have it tougher?

That last part is still true as far as I know, the AH's (other then the goblin's) are not cross faction linked. Unless you're talking about retail, don't know how it works there

If you look up guides for what you'll need, it's fairly easy to start with two gathering professions, save everything you need to level 2 crafting professions on the way, and then switch both to crafting at endgame.

I do this with engineering and either blacksmith/leatherworking on my first couple characters.

Only if you’re grinding easy stuff. But so is every other class. Paladin is pretty fun to play in challenging environments and dungeon runs.

Hyacinth macaw is the one pet that I would absolutely not hesitate to keep for myself this early in the game.  It’s going to be a VERY long time until the available gold supply on a realm gets to a point you could make a good amount for the bird.

No need, IF will naturally become the capital as players reach max level.  On private servers, IF was always the capital.

Create the macro &gt; put the macro on a keybinding of your choice &gt; target OR mouse over a desired mark target &gt; the first press of the macro will put "Skull" on your target &gt; mouse over your second desired mark target &gt; the second total press of the macro will put "X" on your target  
---
The section {8,7,5,3,6,1,0} describes which order you want the marks to go in. This one has it as Skull 8, X 7, Moon 5, Diamond 3, Square 6, Star 1, Clear Target

Same thing we do every year Angwe, kill lowbies on the boat.
---
Can we get some moderators around here please.
---
Thanks mate
---
Queue inbound I feel your pain
---
Fair. Let's get some analysis on this absolute unit.
---
You’re salty.
---
Blizzard just recently said that is it an exploit.
---
Recurring
---
Why, though? I don't think I ever used more than 50% and I do nothing to curb RAM use. Do you render videos while playing 10 copies of BFA and watching 6 different movies?
---
Usually at risk of dying is when i start spamming heavy. Using a cat but was told to possibly try something else like a boar or bear.
---
Yeah but i like to play in bed cause my small apartment has no space for a desk lmao
---
Honestly a part of it for a lot of them is that they just aren't good at PVP.
---
Now this obviously isn't always the case, plenty just love to gank.
---
But for many players, the only time they'll find "success" in PVP is through these impossible to lose situations in world PVP.
---
You'd get different results if there are more than 50 players in your zone, because it gives a subset of the total players, and not a deterministic subset. Are you saying if there were only 2 people in a zone at the same level and they ran /who at the same time they would see different results?
---
Because your character is more than the sum of their stats, to many.
---
Go somewhere else. There are always multiple zones of your level.
---
got the same thing. stays on the loading screen then =&gt; world server is down
---
I agree.  I myself didn’t even know this was a thing and now that I do, I still don’t care to do it and also don’t give a crap how other people play the game. If they are exploiting layer hopping, so what. It’s not affecting me or my personal experience in any way.
---
Early on I agree but overall a rogue can probably solo quest much easier. You have sprint and evasion. Plus, you can sap adds, and more.
---
It can be, primarily due to lack of utility. However, I found if I'm killing things a level or two below me I am ridiculously fast. I think people expect to be able to take mobs 3 levels ahead of them and two at a time. With warriors it's about efficiency of questing or as previously mentioned, dungeon spamming.
---
I went to SM last night and got all my Scarlet chain armor, my shield, Herod's shoulder, my helm. I feel like a brand new warrior. Major power spike.
---
This got me triggered so hard.  I'm playing as a rogue by the way.
---
I saw someone in trade chat yesterday say how hard it is to level a warlock. It was not well received.
---
You're supposed to switch zones when you run out of appropriate level quests. Go to Loch Modan or Darkshore, there will be plenty of quests for you to do.
---
Hmm good way to look at it I didnt think of it that way.
---
Damn so what you’re saying is wow ooked you in the dooker.
---
Once you get spawn-camped for an hour you'll be singing a different tune.
---
I don't know who you were talking to but it only took 9 words and a number to tell he's a douche.
---
Oh hey, greetings fellow Biggles main. Huh and I felt like locks were over represented horde side based on what I had seen.
---
Thanks so much for this it was exactly what I was looking for
---
I live with my girlfriend, if you’re both independent people you don’t need to be attached at each other’s hips 24/7.
---
I had this same issue. So I just grinded out a lvl or 2 to make them doable. Another thing you could do is go to the dwarf starting area and do those quests. I think Loch Modan?
---
They need to remove layering. Just do it already.
---
This is just clips of you going 2 or 3 vs 1 after the 1 has already got low hp and mana from trying to level, theres no skill here and it doesn’t warrant a video
---
So?  One person out farming will do the same thing.  You can literally farm an instance infinitely.  One person farming the nodes is no different than five people farming the same number of nodes per hour.  You still have a fixed possible amount of nodes per hour that are spawning.  The only difference is if one person or five people have it.
---
Only 5 stacks?   Are you using a Quiver/Ammo pouch?  Hunters gain ranged attack speed when equipping them, and they usually have more slots than a standard bag (for a similar/cheaper price).
---
Ok, you're not getting it. The exact thing you said to format didn't remotely remove the percentage. You see that right. I've clicked, and slid, and all that shit. The percentage remains, as in the screenshot.
---
What you said to do just added a health text in ADDITION to the frame. As shown. 
---
See how no matter what I do to that "health text" it only moves around an ADDITIONAL text. Doesn't do a thing to the ORIGINAL text. 
---
I can move the percentage left, right, up, down but not REMOVE it. There isn't an option.
---
&gt; I feel an extreme lack of content  
---
I agree did Blizzard really think a game like this would be successful?
---
Dude, I have census+.  I'm literally doing /who the entire time I'm in game hundreds of times, if not thousands.
---
At some point I decided titan bars were absolute garbage.
---
Then I proceeded to essentially recreate them with a bunch of other indicators and SunnArt Viewport constraints.
---
What I realize now is that if I'm personally invested in something I otherwise think is trash, I'll keep it every time.
---
Not arguably
---
They are THE hardest to level.
---
Purple Lotus by the pound
---
So everyone is exaggerating? No way I refuse to believe the internet isn’t 100% truthful.
---
The only set for shadow is tier 2.5. The rest is useless. Shadow priests are only needed for their 15% shadow damage increase so they can make warlocks stronger. And you only need one shadow priest for that.
---
Lool I was taking on 3 mobs and this undead priest 4 levels below me who I left alone and let quest earlier starts attacking me when I have no mana and barely any health left. He then laughed and danced on my corpse...
---
Yeah, I will just have to experiment and find a combination of keybinds that makes sense to me. I have a Logitech g600 mouse with 12 extra buttons too, but only the first 6 are within reach of my tiny thumb. But I’m using them with shift and ctrl keystrokes for some of the more niche totems.
---
You were once a peaceful shaman who watched your village burned to the ground and the women gang raped by gnomes and their robotic dildos. You now seek to get vengeance by raining hellfire on the alliance
---
*ffffsssssshhhhhhhhhbhhhhhhhhh*
---
I had tons of success later in the evening 2am my server time. No idea if this is an option, but I set my hearth for shaowprey village and tried it first at around 7pm and it wasn't worth it to fight over cages and only end up getting a few every 5 minutes. For me, if I wasn't swimming to a new cage to open after the last and had to search around more than 30 seconds for one, I just gave up for that moment and came back. Was able to do it all at night. Have a friend/guildie/random inv you to a new layer if you need to, I didn't personally do/try this but I understand it could be an option for you.
---
That's only if there isn't 10 other people there though. That's my problem.
---
You are so wrong that it is funny
---
But most of the SM mail gear is absolute trash for hunter, only the gloves with AP on them are good, the boots with agi and stam are neat, but they're a random drop.
---
Because its nonconstructive and doesn't help the discussion at all?
---
MaYbE yOu ShOuLd HaVe ThOuGhT AbOuT ThAt
---
helps nothing, nothing at all id say.  Yes I'm probably mentally ill, caused by redditors like this
---
This is unfortunate, I am really looking forward to all of it (Raiding/PvE, RP, PvP, in that order) but it seems like it's a lot of the latter and little of the former and middle.
---
I hope that it picks up. Gonna be real sad if I put all this effort into a PC to have to go elsewhere to get my fix.
---
It's seriously a really long story.  I suggest you look it up if you're actually interested https://wow.gamepedia.com/High_elf
---
High elves basically never officially joined the alliance just helped them when it suited them.  Alliance ignored high elves when the scourge came.  Sunwell used as a magic source to sate hunger.  Sunwell became corrupted, and the high elves looked to fel to sate their hunger once again.  They became blood elves (or children of the blood) not because of this but to honor their fallen brethren who spilled much blood during the 3rd war, and their royalty.  I've skipped a lot of other stuff but that's basically the High elf to Blood elf story in a nutshell.  
---
Night elfs are just jungle people.
---
Edit: also many humans and other allies still distrust the few remaining high elves.
---
But muh pitchfork!
---
I hope layering sticks around. I think phase 2 will be a huge problem if this many players are still trying to play by then. If they are, I imagine congested single-layer servers will be unfun to play on.
---
Nah, it's quicker to just lie and defend layering.
---
I'd say 15 to 25 based on my server.
---
Now I just have to find some profession trainers and hunter trainers
---
Gnomes = tryhards
---
Dwarves = chill
---
Humans = boring, annoying, kill on sight
---
NE = probably dumb unless druid then chill
---
Realize that your undead form was a dream, wake up in goldshire with a bald head and red moustache.
---
I haven't gotten intercept yet, but I will definitely try this when I can. Thanks a ton mate.
---
No, Blizzard explicitly said that Earthfury is starting out locked to new character creation so that transfers can keep their names.
---
Looks great!
---
Anddddd there’s the blizzard we know. Underestimate the problem, avoid a simple solution (layer swapping requires same zone and higher level) and just say it’ll be fine.
---
When in reality, the problem won’t be realized until layering goes away and suddenly one bank alt has 500 of every rare mat and spikes the market up so high.
---
Does it touch a nerve when people call you out for exploiting?
---
All the spells do threat equal to the damage caused. I'd just use agony and corruption, since immolate does more damage up-front that's a big chunk of aggro. It's also the least mana-efficient
---
You're missing thousand needles / feralas zoneline for the connect to the island in feralas
---
Farm SM.
---
For every race except Orcs and Humans, there are no better gloves until phase 6. With the +axes, +swords racial that Orcs/Humans have, they never need this item.
---
Now that's how I want to ding 60
---
All I want is the percentages removed from Player unit frame health, mana as well as target unit frame health and mana. 
---
Say I have 2k health and lifetap. Now I have 1.8k health I would like it to say 1.8k with no 98% following that number. I'd like to repeat this for the "power" bar and my target frame.  
---
Should be super duper simple right.
---
Bags. Everyone always needs bags
---
It's because you can play without a subscription if you've purchased a wow token in the game.
---
I compared my census data (Alliance) with a mates census data (Horde) on Arugal after a fresh run (moved the saved data file to another location)  
---
On Arugal at peak time (while there was a queue to get in) we had 6k\~ Alliance and 8.5k\~ Horde. I'm pretty certain realm population is sitting at around 15k cap
---
Haha I was thinking of posting this exact thing. :)

On my realm there was a multiboxer named edan that was going around and showing everyone in a trade window how many mats he had. Seems like it is happening just not as much as is claimed.  But for blizz to claim no one is abusing it like that is wholly denial. Multiboxers seem to be the biggest perpatrators of this.
---
I assume by "retail" they meant "not a pserver" since retail doesn't have pet feeding.
---
Gorilla: Parry this you fucking casual-

Is that a dwarf standing in the Tauren starting area?

I rebound the pet attacks to alt instead of ctrl. I suppose it could be a weird keybind issue that's causing it though. I'll have to check that out too. Good idea

It's fun when there's a fight. I've had lots of fun PvP moments already... With players of comparable level. If you have fun getting mowed down by mounted ?? Players traveling in a small raid, good on you, but it's not really PvP.
---
Use /equipslot 16 and /equipslot 17
---
lmao u even got ported
---
When you get to AQ40 and naxx you can go fire
---
Dailies weren't necessary at all in TBC. You could get a mount or two, and some easy gold, maybe a little crafting mats. And they should have stayed that way. 
---
Badges were the worst thing brought about in TBC. Tokens for raid gear was okayish, I could go either way tbh, but catch up badge gear was dogshit.
---
How do you know streamers dont just do it for the shits and giggles? Like unless they are advertising it on their title seems like just an other person doing it
---
For anyone reading this, you can't get exalted in vanilla as a non night nelf character, In TbC they made quests give a flat 125 rep per quest regardless of level that swhen you can do it. Private servers use these values not the actual vanilla values
---
At lvl 30, you gain a rank in both. If you compare the raw damage done, they both have the same top end damage but smite has a higher low end. This makes smite better on initial cast (the burst) with the holy fire dot the only portion that brings holy fire above smite in DPM.
---
Now, if you begin all your casting on a mob at the same time, you begin wanding sooner with smite, which will basically make up for dot damage (assuming you aren’t using a shit wand, of course). The mob will die at close enough of a time (less than 1 second) that it makes the damage difference between the two negligible.
---
With spirit tap and decent gearing you will be at max mana or near enough max mana that the 15 extra mana you spent on smite is inconsequential. Unless you are continuously chain pulling mobs for multiple minutes (probably 20), they difference won’t amount to anything. Even then, it’s not often you chain pull in that quick of succession for that amount of time.
---
So it amounts to picking one you prefer and only leveling that one, and leaving the other behind as both aren’t needed.
---
not yet*
---
&gt;For anyone reading this, you can't get exalted in vanilla as a non night nelf character, In TbC they made quests give a flat 125 rep per quest regardless of level, thats when you can do it. Private servers use these values not the actual vanilla values

Imagine believing that hundreds of dedicated players playing 16+ hours a day having effectively 5-10x speed farming isn't going to have a negative effect on the economy.
---
Personally I would have sold it to you for 1 copper. I've got a pet to feed you know.

I checked through and nada, I've been to org and razor hill so I'll have to try that when I get home!

Is that priest girl bathwater?  
---
Yo can I get that?
---
I don't understand how it'd be greedy on the sham's part when the warriors start using plate at 40 anyway? Chances are SM gear is gonna be used from 40 on your sham until almost 50, whereas the warrior is gonna find some big dick plate at 40 and throw away all of his mail.
---
I mean, personally I wouldn't roll on something until I could absolutely use it anyway - but calling the sham greedy for wanting gear that he's a small while away from using and a warrior not greedy for wanting that same gear that he's knowingly going to vendor in ~4 levels doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense.

I'm one of these people abusing this shit for farming proffs and yes it is absolutely, 100% broken and will fuck the economy long term. Getting black lotuses on level 30s... come on now people this shit is FUCKED. Yes I'm abusing it, but the majority of people are abusing it for exp farm and rare elites. Once the majority of people are aware (youtubers/ streamers making it public) and with just how easy it is to do... god damn... the realm economies are going to be fucked. Needs to be removed simple as.
---
Yeah, that one. From what I understand people buy the tokens with real money and sell them on the AH for in game gold.
---
This is a great idea in theory but it would never work in practice. How are you gonna tell someone oh im sorry but you can not play on the same server as your friends?

lol whats with the passive aggressive shit
---
everyone knows horde players on pvp servers are nothing else but grizzled golden gods of gaming, come on
---
That might be true now for retail, but back in vanilla before the NPCs that locked experience were added (along with the separate battlegrounds for people who had locked their XP) twinking absolutely was about being able to one or two shot people who just popped into battlegrounds while leveling, while being damn near unkillable.  And that'll probably be the case again in Classic, since, again, twinks will be sharing battlegrounds with everyone else.

Sounds like sour grapes. Go enjoy the game and stop worrying about what your neighbors are doing. The game is 15 years old, nobody is a virgin here.
---
Used to be able to as long as the accounts had the same surnames tied to them. I doubt it’s an option for classic.
---
Stop believing idiots on the internet
---
the old one looks better if u improve the model and textures a bit
---
All you said is "i have no idea how the economy is imortant to the game" why not inform yourself before you talk.
---
Probably just multiredditors.
---
1. It didn’t happen.
---
2. Whatever happened wasn’t a big deal.
---
3. OP did it.
---
4. Whatever happened isn’t an exploit.
---
5. Blizzard can’t be liable for whatever happened.
---
6. It's just regular market forces.
---
7. Who cares if it's an exploit?  It'll be gone in phase 2.
---
Congratulations.  You're a literal meme.
---
"Friend" sounds like a dbag
---
The dombest thing I really like in classic are the flight paths. For some reason I always enjoy the scenic route they take.
---
This did the trick, thanks.
---
evidence would be nice. i'm not seeing an inflated market on my realms. i see people listing stuff for stupid prices but no one buying since there are 99 pages of normal prices
---
To be fair Deathwing did attack the city before the Cataclysm.
---
as a priest, mana regen so fast I buff everyone while running around and am full before I get to where I'm going.
---
Definitely hold, nobody can pay what it's worth right now.
---
Bamboozled again!
---
you can just download it from other websites
---
dont pay the guy for this type of scam.

Thats 3 monitors combined into one with nvidia surround!\~

&gt;The post made yesterday that's now locked.
---
This comment seems to be the answer to a question that nobody asked.  I'm just going to assume that you're trying to help but are using Google translate to post.
---
Thanks?
---
Okay quick question, I've just started playing WoW for the first time and I'm in a couple of hours however I'm not that happy with the class I picked (Paladin) is there anyway to reroll to another class/race without having to start all over again?
---
Heavy leather was on AH at vendor price so people are actually losing money selling it there.
---
In the end the 1% benefit and casual players lose. I have yet to cross a freaking layer knowingly
---
Farm herb get rich boi
---
💅
---
Or better yet, "Book of Grudges".
---
Bro you're telling me. How (or even why) people are level 60 with more than like 100g is beyond me. I'm level 33 with like 16g or something.
---
Thanks, OBAMA!
---
I say lets do high server ques
---
Can someone also tell me how to add level to the Target frame?
---
Nah it's the abundance of players with the same items because it's a fresh server. And layering. I buy stuff off the AH for far less then vendor price because the default UI doesnt show vendor price.
---
I tried aoe farming and it's just way too packed unless you play at non peak times. I plan on doing SM, and then ZF until like early 50s, and then I'll aoe farm for gold until level 60.
---
How do we know it is wrong. In what way could we know it was wrong. Because we just found out that they are not punishing anyone for it, it has a negligible effect on the economy, and we are free to hop as much as possible.
---
If people find a bug to layer hop without cool down after it is implemented that is a different story.
---
4/20&lt;3
---
Haha, was this Pagle? My group had offered 50s to whoever would tank BFD for us and another group offered warlock cookies to whoever would tank for their group, and then someone responded with this!
---
Guess it’s not foreshadowing after all :( I’ll go do a bit of reading about that ^^’
---
Lmao jeez, you got salty fast. OP even responded pretty chill, I dont think they need you to argue for them bud ❤

the etc band was insane. i love all their songs. the new frogs must hear them.
---
Transfer if it's a bother
---
No no, that's classic
---
Looks like he invested in some real estate.
---
It's good, but it's mostly Darnassus rep and you seem to want IF rep.
---
I did read their post, and it differs with what you can plainly see on live servers. Here's an example: https://imgur.com/a/YlFFy7k. I'm not intending to be condescending, I know I explained it poorly in my original post so wanted to ensure the steps were taken as I have them in my head.
---
Yeah, the ratio isn't thrown out of whack by the layers. Supply and demand both have the potential to remain consistent whether the server has two layers or six.
---
I feel this crap. Then If we lose Aggro in this horrible pre 60 tank class we get kicked from the group.
---
The shoulders are great because most hunters are rocking trash or nothing at that point. More mail and stam?
---
Hunter item.
---
Just incase you didnt know, if you hold shift and control and then click and drag the questie arrow you can move it :)
---
Of course its a problem and they never said there wasn't. Considering the post opens with them talking about fixing it, they are clearly admitting there is a problem. 
---
They just said it wasn't as huge of a problem as fake posts were making it out to be. Nobody has a bank full of black lotus or whatever.
---
soon you're going to have to give money to venders to get rid of staff of jordan
---
Yeah, it looks like Tauren are the least popular race as well. I thought it might be their small class list, but undead have only one more available class and they're soaring ahead of everyone. It may well be the racials.
---
I loved BC. I have nothing else to add
---
Ya I've had guildies and just people I've friended message me to inv them just so they can swap layers. Not only is it annoying but I just see it as cheating, personally.
---
I've disabled all addons, removed and deactivated all abilities from the pet bar and I press the train button, but nothing happens. Pet is high enough level and I have enough points, might just be a bug.
---
No. 
---
Picking another race or class means making a new character.
---
Blameaux used to have 2 hour queue times, haven't had 1 longer than 15 mins in a week, most of the time no queue.
---
Hello! My name is Elder Price!
---
Check out the latest post :)
---
Others touched on it already for most points, but one additional one. As a warrior, if you are willing to tank things, groups will ALWAYS want you. Tanks are a huge rarity.
---
I hope you get help for your paranoid personality disorder.

I grouped with my little brother to complete this and he got 4 hooves from 4 Zhevra. We should've immediately gone out and bought a lottery ticket

There was a post made yesterday claiming layering is bad because it's abusable by showing an image of a player with all bag slot + bank slot full of thorium crystals.

I tried retail wow a few years ago during the panda expansion. I didnt enjoy it at all and never understood what was happening.
---
I've throughly enjoyed classic even when I was failing. I'll likely stay hooked for several months at least. So they earned at least one customer, and I'm sure my story isnt unique.
---
Trying to automatically detect if a player is botting is a lot harder than automatically parsing through logged in-game events and filtering those that match certain criteria.
---
Glad you are safe.
---
I don't think you missed much, the peak of the bell curve is sitting inbetween lvl 10-15 atm!
---
F5x
---
Absolutely, while you game on it you can flip it over to double as a George foreman grill. That's a win If you ask me.
---
1. Op wasn't on my realm, he posted trade chat of his pvp realm. Not all realms suck like that. So glad you feel the need to defend trolls.
---
2. It's not a big deal because it can't impact economies - keep on ignoring math. You know what they call . people who feel the need to interject unsolicited comments to try and name and shame people... oh yeah.. a tttttrrrroll..  i'll stutter for ya
---
3. OP uses layers and complains about layers. Isn't that what they call trolling?
---
4. It's not an exploit.  It's mining a single node across layers. Even blizzard said its not impacting economies.  Blizzard knows math.
---
5. I never defended blizzard, I just explained the technical reasons for layering. I work in large scale distributed systems. It's a very elegant solution. I don't need to defend basic math.
---
6. It is.  Math is hard bro. Keep trolling
---
7. It's not an exploit and it will be gone in phase 2.  Blizzards own words. Like history shows, they expect massive population fallouts and I'm sure if TBC comes,they will have to revisit layering since the world scale can't handle the modern population demands and we'll have this discussion again and everyone will blame blizzard for their own ignorance.
---
keep trolling bruh.
---
Holy crap
---
Add a keybind to the special action bar, mine is on my mouse. So I click it once to stealth and click it again to unstealth if needed.
---
Yeah, it must have been from some time before that.  Thing is, I don't troll the chats, I don't spam, etc... so, I dunno.  Best I can guess is, I was typing out advertisements trying to sell my mithril spurs that were more wordy than just "WTS ItemX GoldY" and they decided that was *just unacceptable*.
---
My guild was originally going to roll on Gehennas, but switched to Gandling at the last minute. Whew!
---
Well, not that shocked.
---
Obviously has never used Dijkstra's...
---
I'm not banned because I use a pixel bot. Not detected by their anti-cheat and only really detected if a GM moves your character manually and sees that you're still trying to fish when there's no water. But there haven't been any GMs in this game for YEARS, so that's not going to happen. I also fish for 12+ hours at a time, but nobody seems to care about that either. Apart from that, they use cream of the crop AI-assisted monitoring techniques, lol.
---
This.
---
No they don't. If I don't do anything to the mobs or the player who aggroed them, the mobs will chase until they're done and then reset.
---
I believe it's much faster to craft shoulders for 130-150 because of reduced leather used the guaranteed level ups. I guess the guys who made who made the guide rarely got hides
---
Fuck me, how?!
---
Don't get along with my mother in law but rest of my family are dead or don't bother with me. So sure!
---
I'm completely new to wow and chose warrior, it is a bit of grind.....
---
DODGE?!?
---
Overpower time, baybe!
---
Overpower misses.
---
Lol, you're dumb.
---
what is faster for leveling a mage: dungeon spam or aoe grind?
---
Priests are very valuable for groups. You start rolling lv 50 instances and are swimming in runecloth, the gold will come. Everybody and their mother is going to want to hand in runecloth for reputation and you're an ideal class. Solo wise, holy nova can melt undead for cloth too.

This template is basically for people who get posted on r/gatekeeping

Leatrix Maps shows both flight maters and zone levels as well as dungeon levels, dungeon locations, map scale, move map, coordinates, map reveal all unexplored areas with tint, remove map border,  remember zoom level after closing map, all optional with easy config panel... its the perfect map addon for Classic!
---

---
fun fact "mop" is dutch for "joke". weird coincidence. 
---
I loved mop though
---
Nothing like seeing the mob be 1 hit away from either fleeing or dying and getting parried, or missing.
---
Bind A as strafe left, bind D as strafe right, unbind S so you don’t back peddle, and use your mouse to turn. It has many benefits especially in  PvP. 
---
I see why this gets downvoted but honestly just trying to help.
---
The implications of this would be to create an individual layer for every single person on a coordinate plane. And then maintain that for every lat and long on the map for everyone on every server and then be able to cross reference those with everyone else and bring them together. I’m not saying it CANT be done. I’m saying it probably not worth the hassle for what it achieves. 
---
Do you really want to be stuck with the AOE grinding mages for every major quest line? I know I don’t.
---
1) yes kinda? - okay so whike not 100% needed for every little thing you'll need them later on. Typically outside of starting zones.
---
2) Honestly dont worry about finding a guild. They'll typically find you. But it could still take a bit to get groups for dungeons/raids depending on the guild.
---
3) Very, surprisingly. You'd think neck beards would be more hostile. Not to say you wont find an asshole somewhere, but 8/10 you'll be able to ask in game or on a fourm and get a response thats somewhat welcoming at the least.
---
Never played wow before classic but played lots of other MMOs. Played a warrior to 14 and a Warlock to 9 so far. The warlock is substantially easier. I can take on mobs 2-3 levels above me. The warrior was a struggle due to a lack of sustain, even if I purchased weapon upgrades as early as possible via the AH
---
Hold or trade for a similar item of comparable value.
---
I love how a lot of people are ecstatic about WoW classic, and have asked me if I was going play. I have friends that played during classic’s original run, and have no wish to torture myself like that. I mean, if they released a Wrath server, I’d probably go play that.
---
It's almost like everyone overreacted.. like they always do
---
Yay! (No takebacks!)
---
I keep of list of people who attacked me while grinding mobs, ill give people leeway if they auto me once by accident but when a paladin sees you attacking a named mob, runs up next to you and pops seal of command and hammers you its game over. I am going to follow you to the ends of the earth and kill you any chance I get. I dont give a fuck if you are hiding in the deepest parts of Iron Forge ill find you.
---
They way I approached WoW was always to play the class that just clicked. I only realized after a fair bit of time that the class I chose did not fit me and rerolled. Yeah you are wasting time and energy but once you discover the class that 'just feels right' you will have a much more pleasurable experience overall. Don't shy away from a reroll with just 21 levels. I did with a level 46 in classic back in the day but it was the right decision.
---
Well if you’re being hit, you’re generating rage, so with 1 auto attack as you run away by strafing, you can use intercept
---
Yes, it's also the exact reason we rush it. To start stockpiling gold for epic mounts + consumables on world bosses and to begin BRM domination when the other faction goes to zone into MC.
---
Whenever I log on at night there is usually a queue of 30 mins - 1 hr
---
For real? My friend on Whitemane said he saw one on the AH for 50g, so I put mine up for 100g. Taking it down now, guess I'll hold and see what happens. Thanks.
---
I prefer healthy stam, especially since I play on pvp servers. 
---
There's no need to min max while leveling. I'm not buying leather with agi, I'm using what I can and saving $. 
---
Those shoulders are legit for Hunters, period.
---
Yep, buffs, resses, and heals for anyone in the world.
---
Group invites, bubbles, and holy justice are meted out for people fighting horde.
---
Lol with some of these warr tanks in dungeons right now you can wait 5 sec before engaging and still be threat-capped with autoshot
---
Noob
---
Rule number 1-5 right there.
---
Because their internal research says it wouldnt be profitable? Yes it is
---
Is it harder than some other classes? Yeah. Is it as hard to level as some are trying to make it sound? No.
---
Gnome who?
---
If you play with a track pad, good on ya! Lol
---
I know I'm just messing with you, but it is annoying that intercept has a rage cost
---
Fuck you level 26 warrior that killed this rare when I was getting on my hunter to tame it
---
The dragon died, but dropped absolutely nothing - was fun though!
---
Grow up Peter Pan. Christianity is such a joke.
---
When was this taken then?  At 4am server time?
---
We are the top NA guild from the private server Northdale- &lt;Fearless&gt;
---
Me seeing anyone max level +mount: "Probably cheated".
---
[Envy]
---
What makes you say that?  Why would they rationalize their way out of a conclusion if they didn't rationalize their way into it?
---
I fairy fire every undead rogue. I will follow them around in cat using the feral version, running and restealthing. All UD rogues deserve all the pain they receive.
---
Sounds like you think warriors are going to come across a full set of plate right when they ding 40 or early after. That may be the case for a few, but not the majority. And what is a small while in your eyes? As I said if I was 39 and a half, maybe even 39 fresh, I'd have no problem. But 36? No ones crushing 4 lvls so fast that they couldnt grind out another set later and help out their tank right now.
---
I'm not saying this is pure black and white for every instance of rolling on loot. But for a "casual" player, 4 lvls of time could take days to a week or longer.
---
Don't worry. It makes almost no difference. As long as mobs aren't at least a level below you, you will suffer as an undead, orc or any other race as a warrior.
---
I promised myself not to get back into the trap :P
---
Yeah. They are VERY rare and once layering goes away, there won't be many.
---
Whatever you say dude. Solo leveling is extremely slow due to rage/sustain struggles.
---
Yea, rage cost on our interrupt ability is annoying as well.
---
Just open the door, I can't reach!
---
You are looking for monkey quest, it is. Quest tracker only, and it highlights your progress. No map interference
---
 It dropped twice for 2 party members when i ran DM the first time. No way would I pay 7g for it.
---
It’s hard being a war tank. Very little early threat. A couple of misses and parties halfway through the pull means you lose threat. Gotta get sunders, revenges on everything. Every dps is targeting a different mob. My rule of thumb on my warlock is only DoT something that has a sunder on it.
---
I dunno. I think a lot of raids would take one shadow priest but I think that’s about it. Play whatever you want though. Unless it’s a guild looking to raid 7 nights a week for hours it’s probably fairly casual and open to people playing what they want.
---
How did you get up there?
---
this screenshot is great because there's a bit of an optical illusion with the Tauren in front of you -- it looks like you have a slightly smaller staff lashed to your other staff and it really confused me for a moment, lol  
---
Nice setup!
---
I don't think there are Target Dummies in Classic/Vanilla like there are in Retail.
---
Hmmm I have the twitch client and I’ve always gone to my addons where there’s a tile for WoW and that’s it. I can browse for more addons but never noticed a dropdown. I’ll have to look around on it.
---
Me not that kind of orc!
---
This guy gets it.
---
Could just make a raid group so you don’t get xp while someone runs you for your bis gear
---
That isn't what I said. Economy is obviously going to be different than launch because of a few reasons:  
---
1. We are on 1.12, not 1.0  
---
2. We know more about the game, and where it's headed, allowing people to make judgements about what is good now vs what will be good in a few tiers when gear is compared  
---
3. I'm aware of the vanilla economy, I played from beta through TBC launch, enough to nearly fail out of college (twice)  
---
4. The economy of every WoW server was not the same, variance existed across multiple realms and factions. Basing your current experience solely on your previous experience is misguided from the beginning and not mathematically correct  
---
5. MC and Onyxia have both been cleared week one, which changes the economy of the game drastically, as level 58s have access to Tier 1 gear with the right raid group, whereas previously they had to spend a significant amount of time crafting or dungeon farming. Not all crafting is obsolete, but most of it is far less important because of this.  
---
6. The "economy" of a given game, server, or faction (depending on how specific you want to get) is what is present, it isn't the idea of what was previously present. In economic terms what we have is what we have, that is our current economy, it includes layering. There has been a blue post ***today*** about how nearly all the doom and gloom "economy is ruined!" posts are incorrect, misleading, and based on non-factual information.  
---
I'm pretty well informed on this, honestly, so I feel like correcting misguided Reddit posts is in my wheelhouse here.
---
Why would somebody report the name Ss... what am I missing?
---
Do the quests you can reasonably accomplish. Then go to the equal level zone in a different region and do those. Cycle through these as you level.
---
Currently i’m rotating through Westfall, Loch Modan, and Darkshore.
---
Of course it can be done, anecdotally I heal tanked a 3man bfd as a 2H ret spec and no righteous fury.  
---
Your ability to have zero issues speaks way more to your skill than your talent choices.  Have you tried the other way?
---
A little janky at times but fun all the time 🙅‍♀️
---
Player: “I abused layering to get 500 black lotus in 30 minutes.”
---
Blue: “Lol, stop lyin’ For internet points.”
---
Economics 101 my dude.
---
Same thing happened on whitemane. Light and medium leather was double the vendor price week 1, now it's all vendor price. People are losing money selling it but thats their loss.
---
If the enchanter is the one inviting they never have to switch.
---
It is not an apples to apples comparison.

Nono that _one_ screenshot was fake, that means there's no issue anywhere.

The reason this subreddit doesn't care is not that they themselves are abusing it though. Hanlon's razor applies fully here.
---
What are you even talking about? Most data shows that barely any servers are close to 50/50, and some servers are closer to like 60-70 for horde and 30 for alliance
---
One Tree Hill huh..
---
&gt; Why do people think that Blizzard is looking out for the needs of their customers when it's been proven OVER AND OVER AGAIN that they will just do whatever they want anyways? I mean, don't you have phones?
---
Maybe because they make money from the game through subscriptions and if they want people to stay subscribed they need to make sure the game is doing well.
---
And some Mario Maker on the side. Hell yeah!
---
Imo, do what complements your class, or makes you the most money. They're not always gonna be around and your professions become your money maker. So while it might be handy to get a free potion every now and then, doesn't beat being able to farm, create, sell for yourself.
---
I do like my priest and will return to her but the biggest reason I want to swap is the dungeon wait time for Deadmines which for the past two days was about 40 minutes to an hour waiting for a tank.

Complaining about pvp in a pvp server.
---
Brilliant
---
Hmm. strange.  I thought it was older groups. I am seeing a lot of posts about parents playing with their kids, enjoying the fact that the game they once loved and played is now becoming favorites of their kids.
---
What's them being healthy have to do with this?
---
A layer isn't a pit. A layer a laddah

Wing clip and running can help you pop off a few shots at least.

amen

I'm sure it does, I never finished that quest chain on Alliance!
---
Some old friends started on Faerlina and since I didn't jump on till day 4 the queues were already horrific. I told them if server transfer come to then come join me on Netherwind else I'll just talk with y'all on discord.
---
I'm getting the same results as you when I /who. It puts a z before the zone/level modifiers and if I remove that z I see many more people in the zone, not just those in my layer.
---
Haha, yeah I am 29, almost 30 and its such a great experience. I remember late nights on school nights playing this game. I love it even more this time around
---
ty!
---
Deviate delight always sells, certain fish are needed for alchemy, and the seasonal fish sell out of season as well. Oh and the sagefish for mana regen sells.
---
You're not thinking about it in the right context.
---
The ads are for people *with* kids.
---
I'm very keen for that. I was hoping it would come out a month before WoW Classic!
---
Replace "Blizzard" with "Activision" and you'll get about 20k karma in r/wow.
---
Nah fuck Shammy’s . For the alliance !
---
Why’s that? The new engine optimizations are already in, and I’m thinking in terms of having the least impact on individual experience or giving some advantage to players whether it’s used or not. Compared to flying or something.
---
Dungeons for xp... no, that was normal/viable.  It was slightly worse xp than good efficient questing, but made a lot more money usually so it was kind of the better "power leveling" path.     Cleave groups weren't a thing though.  That's only a thing now because Classic's elites are objectively undertuned.   You had to overlevel/over-ilvl a dungeon to do that in vanilla.   I mean, I now solo equal leveled elites as a wanding priest now with ease/full health/mana to spare... that was an exhausting if not impossible task in vanilla.   And no it's not because I'm magically better now with 15 years of experience under my belt... I'm pretty sure I would've knew how to shield, dot, wand, repeat my way to victory back then like I am now  :-P
---
Lmao I’m the sad one but your the one crying about dying in a video game. Your complete trash, and resort to calling me out on my grammar like this is going to be graded or something. Keep crying little bitch. I see your active in osrs, your probably also the type that bitches and moans when I kill you and take your shit in the wilderness. Have fun always being a little victim.

So you're not going to let us talk to your guild? Okay then coward. Put a fucking bullet in your head. Your distain for social norms makes you human waste.

Today Stonespine at 20:00 was :
---
Horde: 9000 or 60%
---
Alliance: 6000 or 40%
---
If anyone looking where to play, if u chose this server go alliance please.
---
You think you have 10000 level 60s on your realm? Have fun removing layering EVER.
---
Layering exists to deal with the players who quit in a week or two. Those are _low level players_ creating extra layers for _high level people_ to hop around and suck dry of materials. Some level 20 tourist is not going to buy arcane crystals, ever. 
---
It is truly baffling how so many of you don't understand even the very basics of layering.
---
Yes I did that the other day! It was great.
---
I've noticed this from time to time.  So far, it hasn't caused any deaths for me... (fingers crossed)
---
It could. If every time you log on to level them you want to stab a fork in your eye, that does make it difficult to stick with it lol. Just a different kind of difficult.
---
I think the last poll pre launch had the largest demographic, around 40% of the playerbase, ages 24-35. I am on the high end of that range. Youre not too old.

That being said, bitching about ads is some shit old people would do.

Alright so I've tried my best to duplicate this. It sorta works well. My cell coverage isn't the best, even it I get unlimited data, so the game can hang. But it works rather well.

A reddit history full of 4chan and The_Donald. Why am I not suprised? You and your 'no no' words can fuck right off.

Pay attention and you'll see it with every single issue on this sub. There's a cycle. People freak out about something and complain that Blizzard doesn't care. Blizzard either disproves the complaint, or else does something about it. People move on to the next thing to complain about.
---
I don’t usually turn on the NC. I just use a wired passthrough. The drivers in them are really good.
---
Its not. According to my guild, about 50% of them are playing classic in some capacity but none have left and people are still showing up for raid night. What I just said is also not valuable. Its anecdotal.
---
I'd say that people were photoshopping screenshots just to troll the community.  Some people just want to watch the world burn.
---
Same hit chance. I use downranked spells all the time for slows and other effects. Especially in PvP.

Yeah I know most people I played with back than are playing with me now seems to be a mass mix of 26-34 yr old players with kids like me or younger stream generation.

I know right! Ive been hooked that all sudden it's 1 AM and I knew my son will be waking up in 5 hours but I'm not even tired... I just want to stay up playing all night till he wakes up but I know it would be a terrible idea lol. Sucks I can only get on after 10pm...

It happens when there is approximately 4-5 people in the same spot usually very annoying if you can’t kill faster enough for the spawn excellent xp per hour if you can

If you dont want to play BFA go join a vanilla private server.

Reroll on PvE. It's only going to get worse for you. Or you can level up and get good.
---
I personally like to take different professions than close friends. That way, even between alts, we can be self sufficient with eachother, and not compete over resources when leveling together.
---
If you can do something thats both different, and helps you, then all the better.

You're crazy if you think 90% of the people wont quit post naxx, theres nothing to do...

Why would you keep playing a game that has no content after naxx?

They will 10000% do BC, because we all know BC was much more popular in terms of how many players actually played the game back then and we're likely to see a resurgence of even more players looking to play a BC server.

There is a spot for them in raids because they have a useful debuff. So not a complete joke spec like enhancement shaman, but space is limited.

No. They absolutely shouldn't at this point. We don't need insanely longer queues, nor a bunch of dead realms.

Blue post, from today, that says this 100% isn't the case. You are spreading a false narrative.  
---
At this point I'm pretty much assured that a bunch of people are just looking for random bullshit to complain about and have little to no interest in the health of the game (even though that's the dead horse they keep beating) while thousands and thousands of us are still having a great time playing Classic.

I legit remember when this was posted.
---
It was also before dual monitors really became the norm because most people still had huge CRTs.
---
yeah Im almost 30.
---
Even or lower level. But not more than 2 levels lower, or the XP penalty is too great.
---
I am using the guide on [Classicwow.live](https://Classicwow.live) to level with. It has been pretty good so far. My main issue is that I won't get stuck knowing what not to do next. So I don't mind the small challenges in between
---
This is what I want as well, if they just go down the old tbc path Im done with the game.

Starndard levelling build is 2handed fury until 40 and then respeccing to arms for mortal strike till 60
---
In my experience:
---
- Trying to farm a monster for a rareish quest drop, they never spawn  
---
- Trying to clear out monsters near a chest, 3-4 more will spawn the second I kill the first one guarding it
---
The average age in my guild is 32. We still all act like teenagers, though.
---
Love that warlocks dedication.   Spending those shards to get more backup
---
That makes no sense. If it's that important it shouldn't be worth the risk. The risk is you could lose silver. When vendoring that's not a risk. Once silver becomes less important that risk is easier to take. I think you've got this backwards
---
I suffered this in retail, playing on a pvp server.   After being killed twice.  I would just log out for an hour....get a snack, watch some tv...whatever.
---
For classic, I'm playing on a pve server!  'nuff said.

Protip: People in their early 30s are also millenials at this point.

&gt;Not saying people dont sell accounts or boosts. I am saying that boxers generally are in it for the enjoyment.

Clarification

&gt;Multiboxing is a pain in the ass. You do it because you enjoy it. I have never heard of a Boxer leveling characters just to sell them.
---
Maybe that used to happen but not anymore.
---
Again

&gt;And I literally said I wasn't saying people dont sell accounts. Mboxers for the most part do not.
---
Each time I said something it was about Multiboxers, Just because you're a fucking downs kid that cant read more than 15 words at a time doesn't mean I have to indulge your ignorance.

"THE AIRPORT I MOVED RIGHT NEXT TO IS TOO LOUD"
---
I recommend holding onto it.. as others have said it’s an immensely valuable staff and now will go for maybe 50-100 but in most servers after economies have matured you’re looking at 200-600 depending on server and availability
---
The amount of people who will never beat naxx is staggering. We aren't all rush to 60 as fast as possible and burn ourselves out.

Classic is casual.

The rest can go play retail

Thats 100% not true, even if we Account for a hyperbole. You can only fight 3 mobs of current level by either being extremely well equipped for the level, or using cds or potions. Going out with same hp... yea right

When were auction houses added to the other capital cities? I remember it only being Ironforge and Orgrimar until burning crusade came out, but my friends insist that these new ones have always been there. Anyone know what patch they were in?
---
I mean, they obviously care but they're also lazy, greedy and willing to skimp out wherever possible. For them quantity matters a lot more than quality at this point. That's why we're seeing a lot more casual-friendly and even mobile games instead of another MMO. They're cheaper to make, easier to patch and produce just as much money. I as a gamer am opposed to this mentality as I think it ruins gaming and I will call them out on their bullshit when they're trying to promote laziness and greed as something that's to be expected.

Hi guys,  
---
I'm looking for a decent Threat meter for classic but can't find any. As a lock with a good wand, I constantly pull  the aggro off of the tank.  
---
Also, it would be nice to have a dungeon map addon where I can check where to go inside and instance. 
---
Any suggeston on these?
---
having fun doing nothing :D
---
I’m saying their character is also their backstory and experiences they’ve had with friends and random companions. Not everyone is bought into stats or raid performance being everything in WoW.
---
I’m nelf priest bc I like priest and like nelves (also bc smeld mc is fun). I could have picked something more ideal but I’m happy with my choice because it’s what I like.
---
I know you probably know this but it gets walked over a lot in favor of minmax raid performance and I think that misses a lot of the other side of what makes RPGs fun.
---
&gt; i knew this ~~sub~~ was full of hyperbolic morons 
---
It's the whole world I tell ya.

Yeah, like the grey 2 hand mace weapon called "The stoppable force" which was a joke towards the epic weapon called "the unstoppable force".

---
If you're that daft, I'm not sure what else I can say.
---
You are paying for a leveling guide? I didn’t know people did this when there are tons of free guides and adding that support them out there. What’s so special about this one that warrants a subscription?
---
Lol w.e floats ya boat. I had a friend in classic played for 2 years never got past lvl 41.

Yeah BoE and Eng

I would still take CU over NGE :(
---
Castsequence macros were crucial to vanilla and are not bannable
---
You have to toggle auto shot like if it was a spell if you turn it off during combat. You don't have to spam it. Works perfectly fine for me. Although i sometimes dont get why my raptor strike wont hit when the enemy is in melee range (and targetted), until i right-click on the enemy's hitbox (even though it was already targetted).

one on my list is "ayra"

It's impossible a group of mages came together and thought about all using their aoe abilities at the same time, I know.

---
@12:30 mark they talk about it.
---
It's good news for small servers and the overpopulated faction, bad for the underpopulated factions because the imbalance gets even worse.
---
I'm kind of in the same boat as you, above 175 bsm the market isn't really good. Iron is hella expensive and you will lose LOTS of money levelling from what I'm looking at. To make a profit if you're below level 175, however, Rough Bronze Leggings is where it's at imo.
---
They vendor for 9.62s, and take just 6 bronze bars to make. What that means is as long as you're buying bronze bars for under 1.6s, you make a profit (OR, if you buy the ingredients to make bronze for under 3.2s, to achieve this I usually buy tin under ~2s and copper under ~1s, I tweak the numbers often though because the market changes a lot). Definitely do this to 175.
---
Doing this, I usually make like 3 or 4 gold per day... which isn't crazy good, but it's about an hour of effort then I go quest or whatever. So far today, I've made around 6 gold doing it, but I invested a lot more time as a result. If I could find something that uses iron and vendors for profit, I'd be doing both (buying out bronze/copper/tin AND buying out iron), but I guess the market still needs time for a lot of people to reach that level of mining.
---
As for after that, I'm still searching...
---
Rogue of 15 years here... hahaha. Heard it so many times from people who have no idea what they’re talking about.
---
I think my favourite experience with this was when I spent a good 3 hours around UC killing anyone I could find who was flagged. Started things off by stealthing in and taking out a couple people as they left BGs, then moved outside. I spent hours taking out any and all people looking for me... the second someone split from the AoE spamming group they were mine.
---
Eventually a guy jumped on to his own max level rogue and did manage to catch me. Rogue duels are usually “who gets the other out of stealth” unless you know what you’re doing... he still lost, because if you think rogues take no skill then you’re a bad rogue.
---
Still it did lead to a cool moment, dude logged in to another account and made a level 1 just to whisper me and say congrats/that he was sorry for thinking I didn’t “have it”. Yeah I know, sounds like one of those “and then everybody clapped” moments but it happened. 
---
Druids.. yeah I’ve never played one at a high level but I’ve come across some that are utterly nuts. Crazy good players. Anyway, keep blaming other classes if you like, but I recommend just getting better.
---
I'd be willing to pay a one-time "expansion" fee to be able to copy a Classic character to a BC server
---
Something like this doesn't seem to bad if you don't want to go the second hand route. Tbh I would look at your local second hand sites like Craigslist and find something at a better price.

Well he did actually thing about that and said he wont streaming .. makes sense to me. There are reallly douchbag streamers that are big that REPORT PEOPLE for getting killed because they suspect them beeing "Streamsnipers" and those kind of streamer i understand how we can hate and especial the game devs that even would support to ban "normal" user over the streamers. ... PUBG dev is one of those (and maybe the Epic Games).

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d08dkf/when_i_buy_out_all_of_the_undercut_auctions_in/). 
---
I just turn the bar fully transparent. The info is there but just blends to the background mostly.
---
You have pretty eyes.
---
It can be sold for 2s though, so definitely not worthless!
---
I'm pretty sure they were added in 1.10 but you can easily check each patch to double check
---
Also depending on time you have and such, buying people who undercut you can earn you profit. Not LARGE profits, but sometimes it's good enough. You just need to know what it usually sells for. For example on my private server I used to play on, everything was always cheaper during the weekend, but it sold faster. Come Wednesday and Thursday you could usually get the highest price for it as everything put up over the weekend has been bought or sent back to the user. But the risk is there's a chance it doesn't sell
---
other times there may be a week where lots of people were powerleveling the same professions so prices for certain mats were 3x to 5x the normal price. You may never see it hit that price again, so it's really important to keep track of prices
---
Another thing is when most the guilds raid in your server. If there's a specific day or two where a lot of guilds raid around a certain time of day, prices for certain items will go up as they buy what they need.
---
Lots of options to weigh, so keeping track of average price and what time prices are higher or lower can really help. Personally, I love stuff like that. I go a little too far and make spreadsheets with all the metrics so I can try and catch trends to take the most advantage of sell prices. Sometimes it results in tiny differences that may have not made it worth it, but those times where it works and you hit big is super rewarding
---
Yeah, i was actually planning to prioritize PoE over classic until.. that.

No thanks, if i wanted to play tower defense, i'd be playing bloons on my phone at work.

You cut out the like warriors, you still die just not as much as warriors. Hard to level is usually measured by time commitment and frustration. I've seen more paladin quit leveling this week because it's so slow.
---
I played shadow in Vanilla and it was awesome. I was very geared and raided with one of the top guilds in my server AS shadow. That being said, I was also the only geared shadow priest on my server who raided that I know of. Point is, don’t be discouraged and always play what makes you happy. It’s just a game..
---
Typing /sexymap will also bring it up.
---
&gt; This is a good suggestion. I don't think you can ever abuse something like that.

It would allow you to escape in the event of a faction raid on your area.

There's an old video on youtube that shows you the path, the guy dose it on a mount but you can do it without one, the first jump up the tree is hard but you can do it.

Don't get a desktop, you'll end up spending a good portion of your budget on a monitor and keyboard/mouse if you don't already have one.

They'll absolutely smoke wow classic, and she'll have a good new laptop to work on too.

Both sides of play are valid and talking about it at this point is asinine. No one forces you to minmax. Havig "backstory" for a wow character isn't necessary. Just let people enjoy the game and stop with all the bullshit.

Man I appreciate your time, I’m just not practiced in computer technology as I should be. I’ve been on Craigslist and Letgo but nothing promising.

Lol, warrior isn't a free win at 60...unless really geared.

Idk how many warriors I just kited to death as a hunter in vanilla...trap the initial charge....wingclip and walk away....concussive shot for days. Can't charge in combat....pet can stun you if you start getting too close...

Looks great.

I'd like to play a bursty caster like ele shaman or mage however I play in a pretty large group and almost everyone is pure dps class so if I want to have as many in a group as possible I'm going to need to play as tank or healer in dungeons, I plan to do all content and for PVP I'd like a bursty caster but it seems it wont be possible if my goal is to also tank all dungeons, what is more important do you guys think, play what I find most enjoyable in PVP or be able to  have guaranteed spot among my friends, I know shamans can also heal but I prefer tanking and tanks are in much higher demand than healers at least among my friends, it be nice to just be the tank among my friends instead of always pugging
---
can boomkins perhaps be built in some way to be bursty so I can have best of both worlds?
---
Getting specific about hypothetical situations and passive aggressively quoting things is where I call it on debates. So I guess you do you and I'll do me. Grats on Ravager btw.

Not sure why I was downvoted because I’m a Warlock and my mount is in fact free.

Can you explain how wild tauren could be holy knights, servants of a Church, a cult thats not native to them. How could that be justified in any way?

Haha
---
not necessary imo just go arms till 60 and save your respecs for future raiding.

I've got to 30 with no issues as arms, plus server launches are best time to level a warrior plenty of people to group up with and get those tough quests done!

I want Vanilla, BC and Wrath. If I had to pick only one then I'd take BC but if there is a chance we get all 3 then I want to play them in order.

I'm loving classic right now and I don't see that changing any time soon but just imagine how awesome it would be if they came out and confirmed BC was in the works. I really hope the success of Vanilla keeps Blizzard motivated to keep going with the reworks.
---
Lol why would someone fake those photos? What’s wrong with people
---
Yeah true, though as said I don't mind the PvP and I love world PvP so I'd rather stay. Just the initial rush where literally everyone is in the 25-40 range that's sort of creating a terrible situation right now. But I think it'll get better.

I heard hunter is good at farming dungeons (princess runs &amp; DM tribute) and mages are good at AoE farming (but I don't know where). My question is should I level a hunter or a mage? What are to upsides and downsides with each class? Which is ultimately the better farmer? Thank you!

I mean they very clearly say layering was being exploited. This post doesn't deny that at all so I'm not sure why everyone is acting like it does. It just denies that it was happening to the insane degree of those fake posts
---
If it wasn't being exploited, they wouldn't say they're working on fixes haha
---
can we just get rid of layering at this point
---
Yeah Nah deadmines is VC.
---
This guy has a kid and wife.
---
You have no power here!
---
They'd probably just merge the servers. If there's 1 normal, 1 pvp, 1 rp and 1 pvprp server... that's fine right?
---
Can ye spare a few coppers?
---
I thought it took months to hit max when the game first came out how are people hitting it so fast
---
How do I rotate them.
---
Or better, how do I just tell it to swap two?
---
&gt;they are used to hold large amounts of white grade items to be sold later.
---
don't see the point in this.
---
There are vendors you can sell your whites to in every town in azeroth. why send it to another character?
---
You’ve turned his growl off when you enter dungeons right? ;)
---
We show our love through heavy sarcasm
---
Transfer then.
---
You know you’re replying to said guy, right?
---
Farmed him for his knuckles back in the day.
---
It costs us way less Mana to give you some water than giving you arc int, so yep
---
Only if you take a potato chip... and eat it in between keystrokes.
---
Current generation of kids need rails. They don't teach self thought in schools anymore just how to be a good sheeple.
---
You're just a blind blizzard fanboy and defend them no matter what /s
---
That’s my favorite thing about everyone that cries about layering. If you didn’t know about it you probably wouldn’t notice it.
---
But going to gnomeregan as horde is easy, and once you learn some skips you can clear it quite fast
---
Rogues are one of, if not the best raiding DPS classes. Hunters are needed for Tranq shot and Trueshot Aura/Furious howl.  You’ll see up to like 8-10 rogues and 3 Hunters in most raids
---
Everyone in my guild is saying hunter too based on what I laid out to them. Interesting.
---
I have a feeling I should "save" my priest for TBC and Wrath when Shadow priests start to rock..
---
I'm not complaining about other players, I'm complaining about layers. I understand it was needed at launch, but something has to be done with how it's abused right now. When I played vanilla, people sure as hell didn't get instant spawns or were able to get out of any ganking situation. In my opinion it's just as bad as sharding.
---
Almost all of the heavy lifting is done by your hard drive. I've run retail on mobile hot spot for hours at a time before.
---
I wouldn't use it as a long term solution, but in a pinch, it'll work.
---
Are you on Mirage Raceways? Pretty sure I've seen that guild before
---
She’s not lol, our friendship was founded on heavy sarcasm.
---
I'm not sure what's going on though. I'm in Darnassus doing it and it works there, but it doesn't work if i do it remotely in other zones with and without the "z-" thing, then it just shows the same amount.
---
So it only seems to work in the zone you're in? It's strange. But i'm guessing it's still related to layering.
---
And yea i'm factoring in that. I get 2 people in darnassus with /who z-Darnassus and like 6 with /who Darnassus. And i physically found the other guy from my /who z-darnassus in Darnassus. So he's in my layer. (this is all just my level range, not total people)
---
He knows too much
---
Lol my hunter pet almost abandoned me by the time the flight was over. Had to scramble to find food and feed it after landing.
---
first time i heard this joke i almost fell off my dinosaur
---
I'm going to sit here and watch this unfold.
---
Wait wait wait, I'm confused. How is this a non-issue? If it was a non-issue they wouldn't be working on fixes to make it less exploitable.
---
This post denies it was being exploited to the insane degree yesterday's post implied. It DOESN'T deny it was being exploited. In fact it does the opposite and says it has been exploitable, just not "bank full of that shit" exploited, and that they're working on ways to prevent that
---
If it was alliance I'd have you send an invitation to mine, Aceofbank.
---
In a perfect world that works, but it’s honestly easy just staying as Arms since you only need one good weapon instead of two
---
Yes. Today's modern person is spoon fed everything. From what to buy to how to think. They think you are a weirdo for saying this generation is getting brainwashed... Til they are in situations where the only choice is free choice and they have zero clue on what to do.
---
Gesus Chrizzle
---
Same, smart move by guild master to be honest
---
Ain’t that the biggest reach I’ve seen. Send me a link where blizzard says that players are exploiting. This isn’t it. It talks about the uses players are getting out of it and they want to tone that back while also improving on layering so that it can’t be exploitable. They even list actual examples of exploits further down that were proven to be false. They even continue to talk about how it’s not even close to as bad as people make it out to be.
---
It’s not going to cause problems. PvP servers have always been Horde heavy and life has gone on. Enjoy your short queue times!
---
Master of cheese more like master of lies
---
Why would you even ask.  This is a good, christian subreddit.
---
Change all our names to Ollienorth
---
Sure, just like it died in the 80s.  It ebbs and flows, like any genre.
---
My mage is currently lvl 21 with tailor over 120 and enchanting over 70 but I feel like I could use herbalism much more than enchanting to make money and do useful stuff maybe rising alchemy on another toon without effort.. Should I drop enchanting and take herbalism?
---
What addon are you using to show the !'s on the minimap?
---
Dumb question, but why do people say "Ding" when they level up, when it makes more of a whoosh sound? Is this something WoW inherited from a different MMO?
---
This game is still beautiful.
---
As a casual 40yo player I must ask who cares about layering? It does not affect the gameplay in no way or another – in the big picture I mean. All you need to care is about your DPS in single enemy combat.
---
Phasing is the other thing where the contents of zones change based on what quests you have completed.
---
The thing you're thinking of that it is similar to is called sharding.
---
You're gonna have to retire this characters and leave him there
---
Curious, why'd you delete your post?
---
Same time once everyone has selected.
---
Does she have a grey ! above her? You might be too low a level to accept the quest.
---
Whenever I get a major ranged upgrade and it’s a gun, I go to the AH to buy a bow instead lol
---
Okay Arya Stark.... I see you.
---
Claims to want minimalist.....has more add-ons in classic than I have ever had collectively across all expansions........
---
There's not a hard fast rule. If he wants to goto wetlands at 21 so what ?
---
Lol. Let it be a surprise
---
I think maybe "literally" doesn't mean what you think it does.
---
Want to ensure traffic cannot possibly be linked to a game. My other idea is just running a VPN and playing direct from the laptop. Just so I can do some fishing/similar in downtime at work as i'm in the office alone half the week. Massive novice when it comes to obscuring web browsing though.
---
Got that drip for sale at the corner of Mulgore and Mojache
---
Couldn't smash that upvote fast enough. FOR THE HORDE!!
---
“LFM melee cleave SFK speedruns”
---
It will run well enough to play, but it might not be the smoothest experience.
---
Data usage and bandwidth won't be an issue. Even Retail only uses like 150-ish megabyte per hour, with a few hundred kbit/s at peak.
---
The bigger issue will be latency. Not the average latency, but potential lag spikes due to interference.
---
Your talking to someone who clearly has not thought about how others feel. The replies make it obvious this is the person that will roll on a krol blade on a hunter or ninja your chest while you clear the mobs for him. 
---
Dont even waste you breath, you wont get through to them.
---
This guy’s world is about to blow up.
---
Bruh Azeroth NEEDS you. No matter what your age. Get on your computer and install the online sensation before we all murder you.
---
I like that you gave him a giraffe neck in order to include the beard
---
There are three (tiny) windows that pop up in combat- dps meter, threat meter and decursive. All of them can be turned off if you want (or put into TitanPanel) but thankfully cleaning up 90% of the other clutter in the default UI gives you plenty of space to work with. 👍
---
Agi is better in end game. Str is more valuable while leveling because your crit and TTK are so abhorrent. 
---
Flurry uptime is mostly irrelevant because a significant amount is wasted traveling between mobs instead of being stuck on a single boss where you can use all your stacks.
---
Philosophically speaking, is there a difference? And if so is there a diffence in how we should act accordingly?
---
Wow a wild claim with no proof except a single screenshot, no video or addon name, and no additional information except a bs /who explanation that doesn’t actually work is wrong?????
---
Almost as if people like seeking out and spreading things that upset them.
---
Bind strafe to a and d and use the mouse for turning.
---
Just because people didn't beat it back in the day doesn't mean people won't beat it now, mythic raids on retail are 100x harder than anything we've seen in classic.
---
Thats a fact, the difficulty of the raid isn't what makes it hard... its just getting people organized, stop acting like no one will ever complete naxx because "huh they don't know the challenge".
---
Yeah, that is the main reason I am avoiding it, I don't think it looks interesting to me at all.
---
I wish I had RL friends who wanted to get into WoW. I have a friend from the vanilla days who I still talk to who I hoped would play with me but instead he had to go play with his wife and brother in law on a different server and opposite faction. Dammit. I do have my 12-year-old daughter who I am teaching the game to, but she’s only with me on the weekends.
---
Yeah I always fill my quiver with arrows but even still I go through nearly 1600 arrows in a single dungeon.
---
How is that Zhevra running away without any hooves?
---
lol ive been on since day 1, and thats why i was wondering about these ads. Every SINGLE person ive talked to that age came up, were all around their 30s or higher. I havent gotten the feeling that anyone is a child either.
---
Dude thankful for the invite. Might check back once xfers are available.
---
Why you shape like that?
---
Looks like you may actually have time to eat dinner today!
---
I think during phase 2 we will see the big drop off of players
---
Deadmines is still VC.
---
I dunno man in TB I’ve seen some taurens preaching Cairne Bloodhoof and the glory of the horde more than once. Also I do lots of emotes in dungeons. Have had a few other random RP moments.
---
I want to do more RP phase 2!
---
I've worked that one out I just flick 180 degrees with RMB fire off any instant casts then flick back before I land so my direction of travel never changes its so fun 😁
---
It feels like sitting in the front row in a movie theater
---
Shine yer armor for some coin
---
Oh shit, ok nevermind lmao i thought i knew something
---
Yes, it only seems to work for the zone you are currently in from what I'm seeing. You can also see the result from the z- search change as you swap layers (as my Imgur album demonstrates)
---
Right, cause that's totally a thing based on class. Reality of the situation is the majority of *people* are turds.
---
Doesn't matter. Everyone and their momma wasn't using it and wasn't pushing the meta like they are now. I guarantee the percentage of people using it now is vastly larger than what it was in vanilla. Come on, we all know this.
---
It's pretty dumb dude. Ill enter a new area having no idea horde are even there, they will then pop in on my spy and when I click them they usually shortly after target me. 
---
Fuck spy. Completely makes it irrelevant to hide behind a tree or anything. Even buffing gives your position away. It's fucked and you all know it.
---
Axe bros for life
---
Also you can go to classic wowhead and search the quests by the rep given, I have a tab opened for me for Darnassus rep.
---
meta
---
We don't see them in classic but we are to assume that the factions have forces in the air of their own, like griffon/hippogryph/wyvern riders, and gyrocopters and planes from Ironforge air field. And the various towers we see everywhere that would canonically have archers stationed in them.
---
I layered into a group of horde and they destroyed me, layering keeps me on my toes. Haha.
---
Battle Shout actually generates more threat as long as there are people nearby to buff.
---
Not a fair representation, those mobs do a bonkers miss debuff that has 90% uptime.
---
True Vanilla experience.
---
Nah dude. Paladins are not bad to level at all. A bit slow but it's almost impossible to die. I'd say priests, rogues and warriors are much worse to level.
---
imagine imagining typing imagine typing this.
---
You're gatekeeping a bit here.
---
A lot of us loved classic or dislike retail for many different reasons. Not all of us actually like leveling...
---
Classic is for all of us, in many different ways. It only makes sense that people will have different opinions on where to go from here.
---
Human warrior lvl 27. It feels hard leveling in any zone. Am I better of tanking dungeons for levels for now?
---
Why does it matter?
---
I loved BC and Wrath, but Classic is simple and there’s so much to do. No flying mounts. No dailies. I spent several years on private classic servers with several characters and always had fun just coming home from work and playing the AH or cruising around ganking or helping people with dungeons or raiding. Now that official classic servers are live, as long as they don’t force them into BC servers, I don’t see myself ever leaving until the servers are completely dead. Vanilla WoW is the comfiest game for me as someone going into my early 30’s. I’m not in any rush, and I’m sure my guild members and friends that came back for the nostalgia will only be around for a few more months, but I’m gonna stick around and make the best of it.
---
Omg Pablo sanchez. Hell yes.
---
I got ganked by this guy ditox and it was a cheap ass shot. I proceeded to murder the next 50 alliance I saw in hillsbrad. Not that I’m holding grudges or anything.
---
Your brother is probably 90% of the people on this sub begging for internet points every time they loot a rare item, buy a mount, or reach level 60.
---
And even if people are getting 3+ layers worth of mats, the servers are 3x as populated so we need triple the resources just to support the economy.
---
Correct according to the war disc, you know, those mega elitist theorycrafters...
---
Retard
---
I saw that "screenshot" of the bank full of arcane crystals and thought that *has* to be photoshopped. But I'm still glad they're addressing it.
---
Impossible to say for sure without knowing your specs. But if you bought it in the past 5-6 years, you're probably fine.
---
Escape artist might be the best pvp racial in the game, especially for melee classes. Gnomes are even hard to click on.
---
But at the end of the day you need to be excited to play your character. Aesthetics matter.
---
Use slower weapons!
---
No BGs in phase 2, just the honor system
---
I remember back in TBC, someone multiboxed 5 shamans in arenas. He did quite well from what I remember.
---
I did notice that I always use abilities right AFTER my auto goes out
---
Hellfire is the strongest AoE. You can’t just run into packs and use it though. Wait until your tank has aggro and the other AoE in your group already have a few ticks on the mobs before you start in on it.
---
widepeepoHappy
---
Play both until 15-20. I'm doing the exact same.
---
I never die with a Mage right now so its a relief but there is endless mana refilling.
---
The Rogue is a pain because stealth is slow, combat spec has no great stealth openers, and you miss A LOT which could give you uncertainty in fights but once you hit 15 you get +% of hit rates and slice and dice.
---
By 15-20 you get a feel for fun melee and you can weigh it out vs casting.
---
I've got the klipsch quintet series with a 10 and 12 inch ground firing subs in 7.2. Low budget (for audiophiles, you know what I mean) but I absolutely love it. I'll just have to do some further reading on it, thanks!
---
whoa. And here's me using my work PC to remote join the queue on my home PC before I begin my commute home...
---
You can always level an alt, Hunters don’t really need a ton of consumables. Every raid is going to want 3 hunters, so it’s reliable and safe
---
I failed to mention I was talking about 2005 haha, good to hear they're slightly more functional now
---
I need in.
---
I still get lost going for deadmines
---
Are you okay with being a midget? cause that stuff helps, but if you're gonna hate your toon, it's probs not worth it
---
Switched strafe to q/E last night and I ain't going back
---
Suck what?
---
I made this comment on Wednesday. Do your research.
---
Not ashamed to admit I've been doing this constantly on my warrior tank. Sorry fury warriors, but you ain't coming
---
Goblins are the superior economic race, though. They have no pesky morals outside their own goblin unions. Have you ever noticed goblin camps in classic had titles for their workers? Operators, loggers, and human mages they'd contract to clear cut. There's a lot of flavor that I didn't notice when I was younger.
---
IDK. Turn graphics down and see if it helps
---
Alas, good ol' Xperl. Fingers crossed it gets properly ported/updated for Classic. Currently sticking with Shadowed Unit Frames for now.
---
It was a bug. It's been fixed.
---
I tried to find a hunter to tame him, but none had the required level, the closest was lvl 49
---
hm okay but i think warlocks are just not as good in dungeons as mages hunters and rogues
---
As a brand new WoW player having started my first ever character as an Undead, I love this so much! Thank you!
---
yeah, its from Everquest
---
here's the sound from that game.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P1SQYWChIM
---
Age old argument is that because it's PvP servers and Horde gets the better PvP racials.
---
Orcs: *Passive 25% stun resist chance*, on-use Damage increase cooldown.
---
Trolls: A spell that is essentially a bloodlust (30% decreased attack speed / cast speed) when used at low HP
---
Undeads: A spell that removes and makes them immune to fears and charm effects for 6 seconds.  Which is particularly huge right now because there's no PvP trinkets.
---
And Tauren: AoE stun that can be used to interrupt healers.
---
Alliance does have good PvP racials as well (Escape Artist is great for melee classes and Stoneform is amazing for rogues) but horde racials &gt; alliance racials is deeply carved into everyone's minds when it comes to PvP.
---
Don't know how much it affected the outcome, but I would argue that it makes a significant dent.
---
Thank you for your response. Luckily for me I have already made a night elf priest and had her in an inn earning rested xp. So 11 to 13 should fly by :)
---
That's what you think. The chat is full of people talking about getting trashed on by huge gank groups in STV right now. I'm near nesingwary camp, which is CLOSER to ally territory, and as I just logged in theres about 10 Horde in the camp, one being a ?? shaman (I'm 39). Some of these people will absolutely quit, making the population imbalance even worse.
---
I remember the first time I heard "I'm gonna ook you in the dooker" I fucking lost it
---
*Nervous laughter
---
Go to the settings in Bartender and increase the amount of spots per column, or row, or something like that.
---
I check it out but it looks like Questie does everything I was looking for already. Thanks for the response!
---
Maybe for wrath babies.
---
Too much porn.
---
Doesn't really matter, at the end it changes nothing. I'm just curious about the roll generation system in wow, and there's no such info on wikis or any blue post I could find.
---
&gt;But I assume it only checks active players with /who which probably has a *bias towards higher levels since they're more likely to be active*.
---
He’ll also ruin one of the biggest plots in cinema in the last five years
---
I used to get a similar box appear due to my graphics drivers, but it used to have a message in it.
---
Try update your graphics drivers and see if it fixes it.
---
Looks ok to me!
---
Jokes aside, are your drivers to date? Were you able to play before and this is new? Or is this your first attempt to launch the game?
---
Level 17 here.
---
he just looks like a nerd normally
---
[Dis here](https://imgur.com/a/PRMZ2cv) be a good route, mon. Ya just be careful of dem panthers and crocs and apes and whatnot, and da goblins will prolly try ta shoot ya on sight, but ya know... nothin' worth smokin' comes easy, eh?
---
Ya let me know when ya start dis op, I know a guy in Booty Bay dat can hook ya up wid some serious growin' crystals from a rogue Kirin Tor fella. Ya put em in da ground next to da plants and dey grow fasta and bigga dan a baby tauren in a haystack.
---
Took me like 5 mins to figure out you were talking about the raid not the mind control spell
---
I just don't understand why less than deposit plus vendor. At that point it's just worth to vendor. And yeah, those pages are a little gem atm. 4-12s per page on my server.
---
That's the route the cab driver tries to take when I'm wasted to run up the bill.
---
Simpler: Kill.
---
I was able to use it pretty effectively til I got the bow/gun from STV but your mileage may vary
---
brusk?
---
I'll tel you what the best course of action is: you right-click that motherfucker and have a tiny dragon friend for life.
---
For all babies including you deadmines is still VC
---
I just solo’d a shit ton of mobs to get those damn gnoll armbands and get a random invite when I only need two more? To heck with you and your cow!
---
Ahhh i get you now.
---
Thanks for explaining bro.
---
AFAIK people can't inspect your talent teee, so...
---
Often for the earlier raids and 20 mans.
---
You would be surprised how well mobile data works. Granted latency is always gonna be higher than a standard connection but as far as download speeds and bandwidth, Good LTE service in whatever your area is can do great. Especially with ATT and Verizon.
---
Guide? It's a common sense.
---
No. It's not "nice to have" it's the difference between life and death with escape artist. 
---
I can't count the amount of times if escaped just by something as simple as gouge+ ea+ sprint.
---
Also can't count the amount of times I've LOSed using EA for a successful restealth. 
---
Reroll dude, the fact that you're already aware means you're going to regret it if you don't. 
---
NE rogue is a meme.
---
Thank you for your response. I’ll for sure continue to level the night elf priest I have already made!
---
43 and having a blast. I don't get to play streamer hours, about 15hrs a week is all. Have a full time job and I'm happily married. Yet I still fit in one of my favorite past times, WoW.
---
Do what ya want in in life man!
---
Replace in the low thirties but thats just... like my opinion, man.
---
You're so smart, you should be a teacher
---
At least you tried.
---
Still 75 bucks a month for a hobby is low as far as hobbies go.
