I prefer Galv&gt;Then Drek

---
As someone who's never played wow, what do you mesn buy game time? Do you have to pay to play even after buying the game?
---
Dang, I forgot this was on classic but the theory stands.  If your opponent is fighting unconventional, you fight unconditional!  Just think how satisfying that Death Knight yank would be!  I’m envisioning a macro that yanks him and then says “hello”... do that ten times and he’d quit (if it wasn’t in classic of course).  
---

---
Getting 10 people to actually coordinate in a PuG is probably *way* more difficult than figuring out how to jump up there (ha!). Food for thought.
---
Pro tip: use the AV trinket.
---
Which 4?
---
1. is true, you can easily get all the tier pieces for your class due to very low competition. Bit worse with weapons etc.
---
2. Definitely is true.
---
3. There's a few specs that do a good job in PvP and PvE, especially 1/29/21, but optimized PvP specs will always be better in PvP of course.
---
4. If you use take it as "can kill you" and not "you can beat all but these in 1v1" it's true. Maybe warlocks too if fear doesn't break. However it sort of implies druids being 1v1 gods which they are not, so I'll sort of agree with you.
---
5. Easily true.
---
6. As of the newest patch, true.
---
I know, I know... easy for me to say. But I mean, Blaumeux has a pretty healthy alliance population! About a month ago I saw a census that had it as the only NA server with an exact 50-50 split. If I had to guess I'd say it's more 60-40 Horde, but it really doesn't feel like it.
---
During the height of the P2 madness I really felt like our server was pretty balanced. I had some nights where BRM was a cake walk and I genuinely felt bad for any Alliance who wanted in. Then there were some nights that I had to corpse run several times until I decided watching Netflix until they were gone was a better idea. I was grateful for both experiences, as I felt that it truly embodied what the Vanilla experience was meant to be like!
---
Alterac Valley...home...least it used to be before I fucked everything up
---
I was in a group that got 6 the other night.
---
The first recipe of the entire server dropped a week ago for a guild mate. I was pretty excited since I had the materials ready for over a month, but I was really disappointed that he charged everyone from our guild 288g crafting fee. For people outside the guild he would charge 399. We paid the fee and then kicked this greedy ass out of the guild a few days after.
---
So you're saying there's opinions outside of Reddit?! LOL. Good point, though.
---
i mean if the guy cant afford 15 bucks a month he fucking most definitely cant afford to be using his  free time playing wow
---
Literally been pondering which gaming laptop to get.  I travel for work quite a bit. Have a docking station at home with a large monitor, but how do you feel about the screen size of the laptop for gaming purposes?
---
What are you even talking about?
---
The highest M+ you need to do to get the best reward is +15. Any spec and any class can complete a +15. 
---
The only time meta matters is if you are trying to push well above that.
---
Both dropped on the same night for us too 3 weeks ago(while both MT were off that night for a random reason) .
---
So yeah they look alike except the colour, sound, glow, picture in the middle and casting animation.
---
That could be said about basically any spell in the game.
---
I'm sorry but if you're mistaking mage portals to summoning portals you need your eyes checked.
---
I am a shaman/druid player and the lack of dual spec is driving me insane
---
Guess you dont know how the rewards works. You get roughly the same honor if both factions kill lieutenents and commanders plus take bunkers at the end of the game. If both rush, ally gets like 3k if they win and horde 2600 orso. Also depending if you killed Galv before belinda. I have ally rush straight to last bos for just the rep and got 900honor lol
---
Exactly. I’m not. I’m grind AV rep for the rewards and that’s it. After that it’s on to the next thing. I and many others obviously are not in it for the PvP or the “journey” or “experience”. We’re there to get what we want and then get out.
---
\&gt;still complaining about capital city battlemasters and BGs being cross-realm
---
They are here to say. Keep whining and kicking.
---
Not a fan of Blameaux at all, Eternal thinks they're hot shit, and have you been in the discord? It's cliquey and pretty cringe. I rerolled off that server, but I'm happy for you.
---
This is investing for dummies. Why would you hold onto stuff till the day everyone knows about the news? A monkey would have stacked up twink gear to keep right until BG release. What did people think was gonna happen? 
---
I hope people will not make the same mistake with the Christmas holiday event/Darkmoon Faire etc. 
---
Watch the market, buy early and sell before everybody else. Which is not, the same day as Christmas cookies are released...
---
Can't follow in bgs
---
I can see the appeal to both the 8 min zerg and the longer fights! But yes, this was epic! :)
---
Theyre hot garbage
---
Yeah basically wipe the floor with the initial alliance pve zerg and they bend over lol
---
Haha
---
Seriously it’s like cocaine to GMs
---
/tar mick
---
/spit
---
&gt; enjoy a video game instead of treating it like a job
---
*Looks over with noose around neck*
---
First time?
---
Well clearly that’s you and not the guy in the video. Everyone doesn’t see things the same way as you do. I think he knows his best friend of 15 years well enough to not offend him. Go ruin the positive vibes on a different post
---
Nope
---
yeah, that's not something I do.  But I can understand how in the haze of desperate pursuit of ranking why people would rationalize it.  I ranked long ago and we didn't know enough to set up a pecking order.  I hated the honor system but I couldn't throw away months of my time by stopping either.
---
He prob means honor honor. Aka killing people
---
If their minmaxing is preventing me from having fun.
---
And my dicking around and/or smelling the roses is preventing them from having fun.
---
Then it's fair game either way.
---
But you need us to cooperate to mixmax, but fat chance ya'll don't have social skills.
---
So we win.
---
is it viable to level from 51-60 from AV? i just hit 51 and i'm really tired of questing and dungeons, just curious if this could work realistically
---
Idk man, the community isn't the one that fucked up the Runeblade of baron. Fuck new blizz (fuck this forum too, bunch of whiny bitches on here).
---
What a great group of guildies, that's nice of you guys.
---
There can never be enough Kevin Sorbo!
---
Idk what to tell you. 
---
Rush Drek or don’t...
---
Yeah but I waited years to play AV in  classic wow.  Idgaf about honor or rep per hour.   No one is hitting r14, we’ll all be exalted by Sunday.  Let me have fun
---
Very sweet of yall. My condolences towards the loss.
---
F
---
I actually wanted nothing more than to play the game from my teens with an adult's understanding of risk/reward and time investment.
---
It's kind of sad how many people I see posting here that just want to be kids again. 31, in a happy relationship, no kids, good job, plenty of free time. I wouldn't go back to my teens for a million dollars, and I mean that sincerely.
---
Oh no, not the positive vibes!
---
Sorry, but if anyone's first thought is "I better record this for social media," I tend to not think very highly of that good deed.
---
Oh my god, whos cutting onions in here. Thisis so awesome, I needed to see this, it brightened my day.
---
Hard agree. It took me a little bit to figure out, but I also think the game is loads more fun whenever you're focusing less on min-max optimization and more on playing how you want, or at least how you think is efficient. Half the fun is figuring out everything on your own!
---
Let me open your eyes for just a second. Have you ever thought about the fact that the content is so braindead easy that we make it fun by trying to clear MC the fastest, grind out the honor ranks, etc?
---
Asking for a friend! Need bot name
---
It’s not that big of a deal though. We still get good rep and honor. Doesn’t even marginally compare to how bad wPvP was for you guys the past month lol
---
Sounds like something a 14 yr old made who thinks they're being edgy, so probably the demographic of the guild.
---
I was doing it last night.  Definitely stayed skele in bear form, didn't try cat.
---
You aren't doing anything but spamming AOE for 5 days while avoiding all the objetives I'd rather have a game that goes for 5 mins.
---
so many people dont realise than in 1 week everyone who cares has done their rep grind and all that is left is the people who WANT to play AV, if you dont enjoy AV as it currently is. dont fuck over someone who just wants to get it done. in 1 week every match will be a turtle fest and you can 40v40 turtle all you want for hours.
---
about 5 people in my guild re-logged during the day yesterday and lost over 100k honor from what they had before they restarted their games. Today, the lost honor is still, lost. This is not a diminishing returns issue, this is from farming 16 hours of AV, this wasn't anywhere near the time the day resets, just a mid evening fu. I see from blue posts they are constantly 'fixing' the honor bugs, would love to see them fix this, losing a giant chunk of your daily grind is incredibly frustrating.
---
report naylo44
---
Casual wow is called retail/bfa
---
See yourself out cry baby.

Alliance call it turtling when a few horde go and defend and stop their instant wins lol

This needs to be at the top.
---
What if I told you that you can get fun AVs that last 40 mins but have lots of engaging pvp!
---
Dude... You are a wizard. I think it has actually been set to auto this whole time because I have had generally low framerate since launch. I was like "HOW CAN I NOT HANDLE SOMETHING FROM 2004!" Turns out it wasn't using good graphics card.
---
Making weird talent builds is a ton of fun too on that note
---
Yup
---
I’m having a blast! :D
---
It really was the classic community's fault they put in 1.12 AV instead of an earlier version that couldn't be zerged in 8 minutes.
---
I certainly havent seen any1 of you in my AV games calling for turtles. But keep pretending you are the community. Maybe upvote more trash pics of people downing rag after 2 months. Lmao
---
Tee hee ;)
---
Sorry if I offended you. Just a reminder that you CAN have fun without getting and rewards.
---
Good correction, that's more along the lines of what I meant.
---
Hordle can't handle a loss it seems so they prefer turtle games becuz muh faction pride.
---
Yeah, too bad the nochanges crowd ruined any chance of a fun pvp system revamp instead of this shitty system we've known was shit for literally decades
---
But this is the game you all wanted... remember no changes? lol
---
sort of. if you're farming honor the 7 min losses are the best bet, if you're farming rep the 14 min wins are your best bet. depends what your "goal" is but in the long run honor &gt; rep. having said that i hate it.
---
"Somebody...anybody...KILL ME!"
---
I haven’t seen any extra rep for that.  You get 350 when the boss dies, then the match is over and you get 3 marks to turn in for 100 more rep.
---
[removed]
---
Well, it's thursday...
---
The tower damage adds up to quite a bit more damage that needs to be healed by either sitting to heal or using healer mana, both things that make the zerg slower.  I think you are underestimating the difference it makes, horde will take literally 5x+ damage from the archers than alliance will.  It is so bad that you cannot run across the bridge by yourself, you will die before you can get out of range, alliance can run in solo and only take 3 shots total.  
---
You could be right about the distance, I tested it way back in WotLK and alliance as every bit as fast as horde getting across the map, that could have been after the change.  No clue. 
---
But it is all irrelevant anyway, as long as alliance only has to pull one marshal with drek they will win 100% of the time in an equal  gear/skill situation.  That advantage alone is absolutely insane.
---
poor Chronchitis probably didn't get a res for a while as people were busy staring at the log to find out who got HOJ lol
---
It depend of the mindset.
---
Personnaly, i see the BIS as a treasure quest. There is a addon where it list your BIS item and you have a nice checkbox in green when you have it. It feels satisfying. I have to do this quest ! kill this boss in this dungeon !
---
It's fun. I'm not an idiot so i don't burn myself out doing 10 time the same dungeon to have this item and i chase the 2nd or 3rd BIS when the first BIS is ridiculously hard or long to obtain.
---
So yeah, chasing BIS or trying to obtain a few can be fun and not be a min-maxing activity.
---
Nah, if you get caught playing another pre-made for a stalemate then AV pulls ahead.
---
Nochanges dictated that you must farm AV
---
Thank you!
---
Have you considered actually being good at pvp or is that too much hard work in-between swapping your diapers?
---
The warrior who got it over me instantly hearthed and our full BRD run was over :(
---
No other class is anywhere near as fun.
---
you know if ya'll wanna jerk each other off there are better more fun ways to do it.
---
Thats a good spec
---
PvE never had a problem. It was just the PvP servers that made everyone cry.
---
The rate I have been getting honor at in AV would have grabbed the standing 1 spot with 3-4 hours of play. 1 hour of AV is much better honor than 24 hours of world pvp.

What does you being exalted have to do with anything. You could literally fish and afk and get exalted bc every living person here is rushing...
---
Holy shit this is incredible
---
AV was never fun to me. But I need the rep. Once I get exalted I'll have fun in wsg.
---
It is a 100% horde location, has decent proximity to high-end zones, dungeons and raids, and is in the middle of the continent. Flight to Light's hope, UC and BB is pretty tolerable. Think about it, most lvl 60 dungs are in Lordaeron, only DM is in Kalimdor. Most raids are also there - MC, ZG, BWL, UBRS, Naxx. Kalimdor only has Ony and AQ.
---
I've seen far more resto than ferals, including tanks. Always have a bit of a chat with other bears cos there's so few of us on my server
---
The mods with no humour strike again!
---
I do, I love them!
---
yes
---
Shut the hell up and dive right in.
---
Lok'tar!
---
Anyone else still able whisper people from other realms after you load back to your sever from AV?  
---
Does the connection last until that BG instance closes?
---
Not to mention that with buff cap on tanks, Resto druid becomes obsolete at higher levels of play.
---
How are you the unspoken majority when this sub is full with people telling others 6 mins loss is better than everything else?

Lmao My man. Please just tell me how long you were running wolf face first into walls trying to figure this out.
---
There’s a queue??
---
Problems are always overblown. Classic is a great game.
---
I craft this, its free on my server but most folks give 25-50 gold. Depends on how many folks have recipe, before a lot of people had it I charged 150g per craft. Herod.
---
Shimmering Flats.  Nice self-contained series of quests that will get you at least a level or two.  That should get you to just about the right level for north STV.
---
Inb4 hotfix
---
Well seeing how this subreddit has turned from a place of information and knowledge to a place of crying players, I would think so. I'm pissed at alot of stuff in game, but I don't waste readers time with a ranting post about my personal issues and negative views of the game.
---
PvP community doesn't enjoy 5 minute wins. The 5 minute win AV is a PvE thing - they are just after quick rep and quitting.
---
PvPers want the honor/hr, so killing objectives give them honor.
---
This meme is stupid
---
&gt; and enjoyment is bad
---
Some people enjoy min maxing be being competitive about rank and honor. 
---
Enjoy your life without having any deeper insight in the world outside your cavedwelling views of the world. Never be able to understand that people can enjoy something else.
---
Jeffrey epstein wasn't afk
---
Try the advanced ones. I get roughly 1 wiring from 5 dummies.
---
But this was the map in the game you all wanted. You all cried for no changes and you have it.
---
It’s kinda like having a reunion frat party at 32 and complaining that everyone is going to bed early and isn’t down to play 19 rounds of beer pong.
---
Nice buddy! What add on are you using for your mini map
---
That's such a stupid argument because #nochanges went out the window long ago.
---
Totally unplayable!
---
Well clearly you don’t get it.
---
True love for God would change you in such a way that you love your fellow brothers and sisters. If not, then your love for God is not true. You might think it is, but God would disagree.
---
When everything's a carrot...
---
Sounds like a druid tank, not many decent drops for them in MC.
---
Not even. Most people aren’t teens anymore and a great new game coming out would be nice but not magical.
---
Aren't you in Blade of Kill?
---
I think I'm gonna suggest people report you anyway.
---
The alliance never stood a chance before, but now...
---
I've always played on PvE servers and had alts on both sides.  Kind of adds a fun dimension to playing the AH when you can move stuff back and forth between factions.
---
If your views on classic only come from reddit you need to realize it's overblown here. The WPvP camping was an issue and not every server had problems and you don't hear all the people having positive times because they are too busy playing the game. That phase should die down a bit now too.
---
The complaints about AV are people who had differing expectations to what this version of AV is. There's two sides to it as well, the people you don't hear complaining are the people who just want to get their rep/honor as fast as possible. It's sad for the people who want the old days of epic 4 hours AV battles but that's only one battleground in a game full of content as well so even if you prefer more engaging content just do other things. If we had those AVs you'd see just as much negativity here from people saying "how do i farm honor, i have 45 kids and work 12 jobs i don't have time for 4 day AVs and every WSG is just premades!".
---
So long story short yes jump in and play, on a PVE server you won't face any issues anyway and from my experience they are generally more chilled out/mature/helpful/less toxic but the flipside is the content progresses a little slower because there isn't as many players looking to be cutting edge min/max types.
---
HAH! nice try bud
---
he also has one of the most disgusting beards i've ever seen.
---
it's so weird how it start down so low on his face.  It almost looks like he waxes his face above his jawline.   He's the uber-neckbeard.
---
Have the same thing, not sure either.
---
This is one of those history rewrites where I'll be the only one in a couple years saying "Don't you guys remember that they announced the launch of Classic and opened name reservations with like 4 servers available?" and everyone else will be like "WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU AND ALL OTHER PLAYERS OF CLASSIC WERE THE ACTUAL ISSUE!"
---
It’s fine mate if you are a normal well adjusted adult you won’t even notice the drama
---
Thanks for taking the time to write this reply, this has absolutely answered my question.
---
He’s the president of a large company. He’s almost certainly a lying sociopath.
---
Fellow Sulfie! Yeah, now that horde are not camping searing gorge super hard it has been great.
---
Did you take this with a camera phone from 1992? I can't read it.
---
Wsg is still fun if you aren’t as conserved with honor atm
---
Stronghold or death grips
---
&gt; Why are you comparing honor between factions, but saying winning is pointless. The other factions honor is literally the only thing that doesn’t matter
---
I guess I phrased it wrong or you miss read it somewhere. You kill the npc that give honor. That honor is fixed. If you lose or win, you still will get the same honor of those npc. Im not comparing the 2. Im just saying that ally is getting 3k honor if they kill everything and get bunkers and horde get +2k.  
---
I also feel like all the people in this chain never played AV. Like you would know this if you just played it, or atleast played it for the honor.
---
don’t underestimate how incompetent people can be
---
You definitely got much less rep then they did. They probably finished 3 games after the deserter droped off before you finished your game. No chance you got anywhere near the rep they did.
---
because there is always a guy that will AFK longer than you.
---
Well the players found the most efficient way to farm honor in classic. What did you expect? Blizzard did what everyone asked - Classic servers. They should not be held accountable for the way players decide to play this game. 
---
They should not be accountable for your own decision to farm pvp this way. You want the grandmarshall ? Gotta grind the meta. But if you want to have fun, you can queue up for wsg or literally go wpvp.
---
You can be mad at blizz all you want. Still won't change the fact that players fucking up their fun themselves.
---
Unlike your post this actually is cool
---
Just because you are an orc doesn’t make it bad it just makes it less optimal. Get it until you can get an Axe from Rag or something.  If you look around you will probably see dozens of orcs using obsidian edged blade because they have no other option and it’s far superior to blue axes.
---
You think I'm in it for honor per hour? No, I'm in it to win it.
---
This has been in the game for well over a decade.
---
Better than a guildie who lost it to... get this... a priest.
---
&gt;Wsg was empty and no one wanted to pvp until they got their precious rep gear.
---
WTF are you talking about?
---
Wsg and ab have a 50-59 bracket, but why in the 9 hells would you want to do that?
---
AV is 100 times better honor than camping FPs so yeah this isn’t happening to anyone.
---
On a slightly similar note are the mage portals in Classic different from those in Vanilla? I feel like I don't remember the portals having the little wispy offshoots that they have in Classic.
---
Guess someone wont be getting a battle res
---
The only people complaining about Classic are the people who were delusional enough to expect the same experience from Classic as they had in Vanilla.
---
It's a completely different game, with glaring flaws, but also an amazing experience on it's own. Most of the people I'm playing with have never touched Vanilla or WoW before classic and are loving it.
---
Not surprising, Hydraxian Chadlords is a server full of cool people. I literally saw ONE asshole, and even then, he was just a smug jackass.
---
When entering AV blizz is yelling that I need to disable it to enter.
---
Well I’m not trying to flex “look at my e-peen” just informing people nothing has been done
---
I have seen 2 Truestrike shoulders drop in classic so far - and I probably have about 40 days played. I still need to grind those fuckers as I am reaching crit cap on my warrior...
---
I guess that’s true haha.  What do they say ? Never attribute malice to malice that which can be explained by incompetence “
---
That looks like sexymap
---
Wow. Some dude ran up to me when I spilt off from the rest to do a quest for a trinket and told me he reported me. I laughed and said "what" but then he was gone and didn't explain what he meant.
---
So he was reporting me for being AFK because I didn't go with the zerg? That's insane...
---
(Btw, if he really did report me, nothing happened. I was able to complete my quest and we won the game)
---
It’s been 48 almost now still nothing
---
I dunno man my guilds raid is about an hour thirty. I work a demanding full time job and try to maintain a healthy social life and still have plenty of time during the week to farm and raid
---
I'm not into classic WoW but I do think guilds have lost much of their meaning on live. I bailed out of BfA and started playing FFXIV and guilds still mean something there.
---
I never realized how much I actually missed the casual social aspect of guilds until I had a social guild in a game that still rewards guilds for being guilds. Hopefully we eventually get a TBC server.
---
Y'all are a great guild and great people!
---
Minimize negatives, maximize positives. Used in WoW, it means people are only using the absolute, mathematically-best combinations of gear and abilities. This typically results in characters that are cookie-cutter, and aren't very fun to play against.
---
to be fair there aren't a lot of RPers on Hydraxian Waterlords
---
Wow you're very racist
---
That’s pretty amazing
---
Yeah cause running is a real win.
---
Fuck anonymity. Name names!
---
Streamers are toxic
---
I also had very few negative encounters during leveling, but very many positive ones! Also at level 60. People just behave poorly in bgs right now, but meh, Just Reporting them and moving on.
---
I was surprised because I had always heard stories about vanilla AV taking ages. Until this week, I thought that's what we were getting. I didn't play during vanilla originally so I honestly didn't know they changed this in 1.12.
---
This fuckwits have been so toxic in everything they participate in our sever since their inception. From collusion to this.
---
Just watch out for that immovable object
---
Baaad
---
I bought two PCs for my friends who couldn't afford it, so yeah, there are people like him.
---
Yeah true, I’m aiming to get oeb actually because it gives sword skill as well and it’s easy ish to get. The competition in my guild once spinal drops is going to be savage. Thanks for the input! Either way I’m gonna buy and test it out.
---
Are particle effects changed with spell effect level?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1vcfqf/console_spelleffectlevel_1500/
---
Much more gear dependant for survivability. Goin nude as a SL/SL obviously won't work.
---
Nobody has anything, it's literally the best of the worst
---
Lol
---
So it’s normalized ap gain not swing damage? Why is that so hard to articulate lol
---
Thanks. That's not bad at all. Xbox live is 10$ a month, so it's basically the same.
---
If you want to play feral in pvp and pve you’ll have to be a bear tank. Which is fun. You just won’t be wanted for dps. I enjoyed healing as a Druid too though so don’t rule that out.
---
I just played a 30min AV.
---
1.1K rep
---
5.7K honor.
---
That is more than u get losing 2 10 minute games (+8min queue)
---
They have a team that investigates mass reporting, notice the majority of win traders who got banned. They're not just gonna drop it on the support team.
---
It'd be most accurate if the second part had no fun on the spokes and efficiency/minmax as the stick.
---
Why must AV be ended quickly? Why must we listen to those who want to finish with AV, dragging us to win every game otherwise we are bullied and shamed. I am playing an MMORPG, this isn't the type of game I'm concerned about min maxing, I play mmorpg like the old school relaxed (non casual way), not fucking rushing every damn thing so a few people can achieve exalted and obtain all that reward. Why should we be sheep and follow these people who play AV for only Rep. I and many others want to play AV the way it's meant to be played, collectively with variety (PvP/Pve mixed, not the min-max kill vann only in less than 10 seconds. These people who want to have every AV game less than 10 minutes so they can farm it until they won't step foot into AV again. Fuck that. These aren't my sort of players and these are definitely not the people who are going to define my game for me and the many of us who just want to have good old PvP/Pve fun in AV.
---
I know he got chatbanned lol
---
Ye I know but I have income issue from all the PvP.
---
Did she drop any good loot?
---
99% winrate because its a garunteed win for alliance when it becomes a race to the last boss
---
You're alliance.
---
I do enjoy this AV but ok
---
Fucking casuals, having children, like the world needs your stupid babies.
---
Imagine playing a game to try and win! What's next, enjoying it?
---
The strings
---
To be fair, I know people who are legitimately not having fun and yet refuse to stop grinding out honor in the most efficient way possible to the point where even asking people to do WSG to have fun PvPing instead of a 5 min AV Zerg is met with hostility and antagonism.
---
It's almost like people want to "get the grind over with" as fast as possible so they don't have to play anymore. 
---
It's honestly quite disappointing. I don't have a problem with min maxing as your goal but when you literally refuse to do anything else or even help your friends of 10+ years because you don't need that dungeon anymore and ran it so much that you hate it and will never set foot in it again, there's something psychologically weird going on.
---
You don't HAVE to cap the towers, doing so just reduces the amount of adds that are next to the final boss.
---
See, that's how I take it too.  I must re establish my dominance.
---
Cannot be used indoors, including inside fireplaces.
---
Hell-to-the-yeah with this.
---
But guess what big guy, you win regardless...
---
It's almost like people play wow to have fun and winning in 8mins with no effort isn't fun or engaging.
---
yes, I know. It was going so well, and now people have found ways to fuck it up. I'm just asking the team to stop fucking with what works.
---
Just finished a ~30min AV win with Horde.
---
1.1rep
---
That is better than losing two 10 minute games in reputation (WAAAAAY better) and slightly worse in honor.
---
Thanks guissssssseeeee
---
I had fun back then doing day long AV’s too, but I’m down for either way currently.  It absolutely makes sense (and did back then after a bit as well) to try and maximize your rep or honor.  Your experience is not neccessarily the norm though.  I only played a few losing games so far but also speaking as horde I was getting 3k honor and 300+ rep per 7-10 minutes of AV.  
---
The only really shitty part is people reporting others as afk for not joining the zerg.  The deserter debuff from this should absolutely count as griefing and if you pay for a subscription you should be allowed to not care about other people’s minmax meta game.
---
If your getting wow tips from Wikipedia you’re doing it wrong
---
You guys writing this same thing over and over again make me blow air out of my nose in amusement. 
---
Can’t wait to read the same thing tomorrow after you get done playing it.
---
good to know the advanced ones are working then, though all the dummies are supposed to have the same wiring drop rate.
---
Or you could be like me, which is to say be too ignorant of the game to know how to min/max :') being a noob has preserved my sense of wonder, and I only get flamed sometimes!
---
Wild to think that right?
---
W
---
Ok thanks!
---
Screw all the recent bitching about blizz ruing this and that which can be pointed back to playerbase. Wow classic brings people together. This is beautiful.
---
Sweet thanks!
---
There's nothing fun about taking 30 minutes to lose.
---
Keep worrying. What are you guys gonna do if 1 weeks come down? XD
---
What is a class leader? This community has really gone sideways.
---
Alliance:" BuT wE wOn ThOuGh." (900 honour)
---
The forums from day 1 have been a hellhole and this sub since launch hasn’t been much better
---
I realise the irony of this statement btw
---
&gt;Why is that so hard to articulate lol
---
Your guess is as good as mine.  I'm assuming most people don't understand what the normalization changes entailed.  Prior to normalization the formula used for calculating instant attack damage was something like 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
weapon damage + (speed \* ap / 14)
---
where now the speed portion is a flat value based on your weapon type.
---
It was for my own reference - so I could name the AV number and time.
---
Earthfury is a great server, slight alliance favor FYI
---
I'm laughing at your delusion, not being angry lol.
---
Imagine thinking anyone would confuse your confession of being toxic as flexing. It's pretty funny.
---
i dont agree at all with your fallout analogy. when i replay an old game i never try to "optimize" i just try to do different stuff. coming up with different ways to play the game and so on never try to find the "best" way to play the game
---
That's a poor way of looking at it. A 30min game that goes back and forth and ends up relatively close is much more fun that walking to the end boss and killing them with no effort.  
---
Winning isn't always fun. Do you have fun when you smash your little cousin at mario kart over and over? Probably not.
---
Managed to get one after 10 dummies, so it still works. Although the price for copper and stuff is going up on my server.
---
I doubt they will, we have had entire guilds on herod trading honor and nothing is done.
---
&gt;I doubt we'll ever see that again
---
By now their watch is ended.
---
Being proud of being a asshole is one thing , just admitting you are one is different. You seem very angry I'm assuming you were affected.
---
I'm 19, how old are you?
---
Lmao he charged a fee to guildies?
---
Didnt he get the drop in the guild raid
---
Firemaw is super serious about pvp, that’s all
---
Thats really just for speed runs.
---
Even top guilds don't bother getting all the world buffs and consumes every week.
---
This is beyond amazing. Fucking bravo. Bravo.
---
Play for fun
---
Find a way to be social with the things you enjoy to do. [Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com) helped me find a running group.
---
What addon was showing when the healing potion was ready?
---
It's still very enjoyable at that screen size. I went from using a 27'' on my desktop to using a laptop as my main system at 15.6'' The first day it felt a little strange but honestly after even just the 2nd day I was completely used to it. Now, 3 years later, It's actually harder for me to adjust to bigger screen sizes. I was going to build a desktop again this year but I just love the convenience of a gaming laptop. Easy to bring over to a friends' house or any travel destination for that matter, I can game on flights, or even in just comfy positions on the couch or in my bed.
---
&gt;I'm thinking I'll have a hard time getting above R6 or 7 playing 4-5 hours a night. Yesterday I got 50k honor in about 4-5 hours
---
 Decay explodes at Rank 12+, you won't have any trouble at all getting up to Rank 10 at least with those hours /played in AV
---
(obviously this is all a guessing game, but I am confident in the above)
---
&gt; Your logic is fucking pathetic.
---
And yet, you're the one who keeps losing. You can keep screaming about how everyone is wrong but you, or you can learn from your mistakes and move on.
---
I know for a fact some of the top 5 are not doing premade AV's on my server. Maybe it's cause it's horde idk. Either way that just makes WSG even more trash which is a real shame.
---
You probably already know but angerforge is really easy to 3 man, if you can find two friends willing to help you
---
Ah, to be young again.
---
So you want it to stay broken just so you can win an argument on /r/classicwow?
---
You either met the wrong people, or you might not like you. In the first case, get out there. In the second case, find a therapist, and get out there. =)
---
Disable some of your add-ons, for me it was my threat meter (alternatively update them since this patch broke a lot of add-ons)
---
Love to see stuff like this
---
I love tight knit guilds
---
Hope to be a part of one someday
---
Ahhh okay that makes sense lol it really seemed to blow up. I’m gonna check it out lol. This is my first time ever playing wow too so I prolly will like those videos a lot
---
Appreciate the support man! This post def attracted some ass hats sadly. Doing my best to ignore them
---
Yes Hahahaha
---
Priests have magic dispel, Paladins have Blessing of Freedom... you can remove slows at level 19 without being a Druid.
---
At max level, no one can remove slows and move 40% faster than everyone else except Druids.
---
I imagine them running around like Leroy Jenkins with there hair on fire trying to sort out how they are going to fix there mistakes. 
---
Honestly a bunch of this is probably exactly like it was way back when. Its just that two things changed. 
---
1. The internet is viral now and so everything spreads fast. Both good and the bad. 
---
2. We have both rose colored glass and also actual experiences to compare to, having played it before at different patch times or through the evolution. 
---
Playing classic makes me realize I would never want a time machine. Going back to a time when you know exactly how it plays out sounds terrible. At least this is a game so you can shut it off. It will always be looking backward at fonder times while also looking forward to more tech and ease of life improvements.
---
My PC bricked playing on a MacBook Pro LOL fuck my life
---
From another post, BG Holidays were introduced with the same patch as AB, so it's safe to assume they won't be in until AB comes in phase 4.
---
I solo'd him probably 20+ times. You have to break it though. 
---
* Kill the roaming fire pat
---
* kill the two guards in front of the ramp-&gt; kill the 3 mobs up top (where if you dropped down you would aggro the mobs at the bottom of the ramp to anger)
---
* jump up on ledge that leads all the way around back of angerforge
---
* pull with arrows and kill the adds
---
* keep bringing anger back and forth with the ledge trick
---
* at 40% burn like hell. Once he is dead hit loot and vanish.
---
I’m only 6
---
Is this what the patch notes were referring to in 1.13.3   
---
"Additional Updates
---
The lua API has been modified to prevent some addons from using communications channels in ways that are contrary to the spirit of the game."  
---
The first day of the patch honorspy stopped working, so sounds like they listened to you man. Honorspy now works again, im guessing they found a new method of transmitting data
---
This is what it’s all about man!
---
Ill never have timing like that, again, in my life.
---
Also, posted yesterday but i forgot my flair oof
---
I get 600 rep per win and that's all i care about.
---
They didn't fix shit, you can't even kick legitimate afks anymore.
---
Just do like me and force turtles. I’ve been constantly encouraging horde to do the same, because they’re the ones who are going to lose out as soon as all these PvE alliance are done with their rep grind. It’s to the horde’s benefit to make that take as long as possible, if they want to keep those near-instant queues.
---
I just decided to be the change I wanted to see in the world. The zergers think we have to play the game their way, but they’ll quickly find out that they’re not the only ones playing the game.
---
I dunno man, Herod and Grobbulus have been the most toxic ones from what I've seen. Haven't even noticed any Faerlina spergs.
---
Blizzard keeps messing up lol.  
---
They launched with 2 EU PVP servers and took weeks to get rid of queues.  
---
They never release patches on promised dates.  
---
There are tons of bugs not being fixed.  
---
AV gives 10x more honor than wsg.
---
Would be interesting to see how it works out, they're a decent PVE guild so they can multitask it better than most. You don't need that many people to take RH and start pulling warmasters and that's from my experience as a pug, if I had dedicated, geared players and voice chat I think you could do some bananas stuff with the current meta.
---
The incentive is fun. Or so the community told us. In reality is what the whiny community wants to play when they want to play it without feeling left out.
---
Yes if you want to rank up you will nov have to grind AV for the next 2 months. You can still however queue for WSG and have your fun.
---
"They have to reduce the honor" just for the sake of it is the dumbest idea.
---
Yep only 15 minutes though
---
What? I think AV is fine as it is. I enjoy it :)
---
Not entirely unexpected. This exact thing happened to old school runescape. And it’s not the game’s fault. This min max obsession happens even with brand new MMO’s. Turns out blissfully ignorant children play games differently than experienced jaded adults.
---
Yeah, I've had a lot of fun with games min maxing. Definitely didn't feel like a job either. I feel like if you play fire emblem on classic/higher difficulty the permadeath is enough of a deterrent to make anyone min max lol
---
Hey, I am a feral dps main. I played feral dps in few expansion on retail as well. It is very fun because you have a unique gameplay where you need to go in and out of cat form to gain 80 energy instant, allowing you to increase your dps significantly. Very fun. 
---
I did MC as a DPS and was overall 6th in DPS without being full stuff or fully buffed out. 
---
Honestly if you have played the spec before and are not too concern about being the absolute #1 DPS in all situation you will have a great time.
---
Because honestly, they're rare.
---
Also depends how social you are. The guild i'm in has a tight little group but I simply don't get enough time play stuff or being social with them to join that cluster. 
---
I'm quite introverted so its just not going to happen for me but it takes quite extroverted and dedicated players... and luck... to mesh into a group like that.
---
Most people just won't have all of it come together. Its just how it be. 
---
It also can't be forced, if it needs force its just not going to naturally become a tight group. 
---
Finding a group of extroverts in a game that is generally played by more introverted people is just rare.
---
Maybe. I know shamans and paladins individually have more players than druid, but both of those classes have more than one race option. You might be on to something
---
They're rushing for rep, not honor. Pretty big difference there.
---
That add-on doesn't account for hit rating based on weapon skill, it shows the same hit rating when I use an axe compared to OEB (+8 swords, plus human +5, giving me 313 swords)
---
Way to call him out on being an edglord, u/Iloveyouweed
---
Report him
---
There are a lot of mums/dads playing now, and most of us are fully supportive of a player that needs to take a break/stop for child wrangling.
---
We went 10 leafs in a row I know the pain
---
Can you link me the server? Would be fun to get in a group
---
The Druid I aspire to be lol
---
I've become numb to the losses in AV now, as Horde we just gotta expect the loss and the most honor we can unless we want to spend 45+ minutes in a single AV
---
I mained feral in vanilla. I main a rogue in classic.
---
Feral sucks in comparison, anyone trying to make the argument is in denial and has some weird form of class pride they can't let go of. The busted model where you have to be inside someone to shred, pounce requiring you must be behind them, among many other plethora of reasons... lets not even take into consideration the mana burn/viper sting bug that STILL hasn't been fixed.
---
Trust me dude, stay away from feral unless your a masochist who really likes being a successful underdog. Not saying feral can't perform, rogue is just better and I say that as a former feral who made it to AQ40.
---
Wrong. Its not happening because as detailed in this post and as weve all experienced in AV people who want to zerg have learned to abuse the afk system on those who dont, and those who dont have no motivation to abuse the afk system, so they just have to deal with the toxicity, and most of the people like me who want to play objectives quit AV entirly rather than fighting to play the way we want, since every time we do we get kicked with a 15 minute debuff.
---
Personally, i hate capture the flag. I dont like warsong gulch. Alterac valley, to me, was my favorite part of world of warcraft, and WSG will never be engaging to me
---
This was inevitable, and yeah they designed the pvp system based on how people played games back in 2005.  Not how they play games in 2019.  Any new game released now days with designs like this would fail hard.  So let the peeps win at a part of the game that is not that great.  It's ok... Really it is.
---
ZG and BWL can't come soon enough...
---
It's better than most dungeon blues for pve, though arcanite reaper beats it and maybe the nicker, but for pvp it beats them for sure.
---
Holy shit, I guess I am the boomer here. Sorry little guy.
---
Seen it three times on my alt. While farming it with my guild. I got the third one on my fury warrior lvl 55 :P. 
---
Also seen savage gladiator chest twice. I got it the first time and guildie got it the 2nd. We've got four people with that chest.
---
This is all in about 50 legit runs.
---
Last time we did it our first run for the night BRD arena n angerforge run. 
---
HoJ dropped.
---
2nd run. Savage gladiator chest dropped. We stopped there lol.
---
Just feed when you see them on your team
---
I also use twitch.  Late add here but the addon was definitely worked on and fixed quickly I will give props to the creator for that. I haven't had issues since like the day after this comment I made lol
---
time well spent
---
I think it is telling that your device auto corrects "piss" to "puss."
---
Doubting this.
---
Alliance are only competing against fellow alliance for honour, dummy. Horde could earn 10k honour a match and it wouldn't affect the alliance bracket one bit.
---
The lieutenants near galv and iceblood is where the honor's at.
---
There is absolutely zero reason to stop playing a character one level before the cap. That’s just insanity.
---
I'll raid 2 hours a week and get the same quality gear from BWL.
---
Farm for 100+ hours a week til your hearts content.
---
Or play to have fun maybe?
---
You would need to grind on mobs inside of AV, so not very realistic.
---
"Community" 
---
Lick his ass now
---
I'd argue that "people can afk without consequence in bgs" is a legitimate complaint and not whining, where as "people want room for their friends" is not.
---
If your on the fence about it go rogue. You will just have an easier time getting into things and being good which means an easier time having fun.
---
I'm a druid and have been since BC. also played a rogue since WOTLK. I love my druid but if i didn't have an affinity for em i would main rogue in classic. 
---
Set yourself up for success,
---
Full servers don't necessarily mean queues exist. There are few servers with queues anymore.
---
The community sucks lol
---
Love grobbulus RP! Grobb gang!
---
Don’t be a kek, rush drek.
---
i started classic a couple months ago and after playing for a week i barely made it to level 10 then realized w the amount of free time i have to play, there's kinda no point to even continue the game because i'll never be able to amount to anything endgame no matter how hard i try.
---
and to the "u play 4 fun" people, i played all through beta and vanilla. while it is still fun to relive the experience, i think the mild nostalgia jog was enough to satisfy my cravings - so now i just lurk the sub and live vicariously through y'all.
---
Well first, it’s not midnight yet. Second, I don’t believe BG weekends started until AB came out in like 1.7 so that would be phase 4.
---
Wow that's good
---
These days it's a anime reference to /r/konosuba
---
There's a goddess in its main cast and their followers are called the axis cult
---
What is the most efficient way to get av rep on horde?
---
The cool thing is they've kept it the same since 2004.  I expected a price hike at some point but they never did.
---
Take a break and come back (or not). Make an alt or pvp casually see where you get. I've been playing AV until I get bored then jumping on my lvl 50 alt. Great time to be out in the world. Few gankers.
---
Warrior Tank, been running a lot of pugs with casters AOEing the shit out of everything, which is allowing mobs to break from my threat. Was wondering if it'd be worth respeccing and putting 12-15 points into prot, for defiance threat increase. Currently running SM a lot, level 38. I'm almost fully specced into arms, but have 5 points put into cruelty. We're not wiping, but they're making it a pain in the ass to keep aggro when they just AOE through my marks anyway, which in turn pulls mobs out of their AOE spam.
---
It's insane how stupid and misguided your whole post is.
---
Zug zug much? Lol
---
That didnt come until BC or wotlk I believe.
---
GG
---
As a fellow horde I have no probs with alliance afk leeching, in fact it makes things better for me.
---
But I'll report suspected horde afk's quick.  First they make winning harder, second they could possibly be my competition for ranking.
---
Seriously Casual
---
My god all the dumb horde comments are making the FP gankfest worth it.
---
I have a sneaking suspicion, you might be a fucking moron.
---
To be honest, I'd be pretty surprised if TBC doesn't come along. I don't think a lot of folks here are very tech savvy and don't realize that they basically have nailed this down to where they can spin up or down virtual servers on a whim. 
---
That's a super simplistic way of saying it, and explaining the underlying tech, but with that in mind they could EXTREMELY easily spin off a branch of "Classic+" as well as spinning off a branch of "TBC" - one would never need to touch the other and they could co-exist harmoniously. 
---
Now, whether they'd try to capitalize on this and monetize it by using "Clone a Character" or something remains to be seen, as opposed to leveling a fresh character on a given branch.
---
OEB has +8 tho
---
OEB has +8 sword skill so it really isn't comparable at all.
---
Well alright if thats how u enjoy it it’s fine too. Just trying to help.
---
No you don't know a guy who played over his phone and got 200k honor in 8 hours. That's 25k honor per hour and between wins/losses and some long lasting AVs is simply impossible.
---
200k+ get nolifers who play 14-16hours on a daily basis.
---
What are you on about now? This nothing to do with volunteering time. There is no way in this world that Activision-Blizzard is micromanaging a decision this small within the scale of their company. The Classic team is already doing dev work on Classic. The budget was created, and changing the value for queues, from a development angle, is insignificant. You put the item into a Sprint planning meeting with all the other quick changes, and someone knocks it out in 15 minutes. It's a design decision.
---
Then I would prefer 1.9 AV and 1.12 DM then. (Yes, I want the harder versions.)
---
Damn this made me miss my old guild friends.
---
Good thing my mate has my back with nature's swiftness healing touch
---
Usually just someone from Herod acting like there 12. From my exp so far
---
I hit exalted last night. Gained 165k honor in the proses.
---
I just confirmed it is the 5 piece GS set. I was doing the fight with 6 pieces on and was getting the aggro/threat bug. I decided to FD and take off two pieces of gear and it didn't happen again since then.. So stupid that having the gear on causes this.
---
Wjy do healers always feel so entitled to thanks for everything? You dont see dps players say this kind of stuff.
---
Honestly it's been so long I dont remember lol.  You're probably correct since that would lengthen AV games compared to crazy stat boosts per tier in BC and WotLK.
---
Still doesn't mean that Blizzard deserves blame for you deciding to afk, even if the system wasn't designed to actively discourage it.
---
I played since vanilla so i used to be so hard on myself putting in the grind and all that. Yeah i dont have the best gear anymore cause i play more casually but i just dont care. Also as rogue its more skill based so having the best gear doesnt matter most of the time.
---
laptop gamer rofl
---
Whuh-chhhe!
---
I completely agree I did 1 wsg before the av grind and it was the best time I've had in classic
---
Do you just abandon if the Zerg fails or stick it out? Seems like you can still get plenty of rep if you play it out
---
I'd go back to my teens if it *COST ME* a million dollars.
---
What unit frames do you use?
---
Fair point.
---
&gt; Sunwell Plateau island (the name escapes me)
---
Isle of Quel'Danas
---
&gt; the template of what we hate today
---
It was also the best implementation of it we've ever had for two reasons:
---
-The daily rep grind was bypassable with instance farming
---
-For people actually doing the daily quests, it had server-wide permanent progression as people completed quests
---
It really felt like a sustained assault on the island, as you started on the fleet with daily quests to attack the beach, then once the server secured the beachhead you worked on taking control of the town outskirts, then the harbour and blacksmith. Each step unlocked more quests, vendors, and services on the island as your server slowly took control of the entire town. There were even server-wide "side objectives", such as creating the portal, rebuilding the forge, and building the alchemy lab.
---
Since then, only the Firelands patch has come close to the same type of patch progression, and that's a damn shame.
---
I mean everyone used to afk for AV back in vanilla too.  We also used to zerg the fuck out of AV and win within 10 mins just like now (after the av changes).  The only difference really is that far more people have tonnes of raid gear now that wasn't really the case back then.
---
I'm a DPS warrior and every MC run I start out near the top of the damage meters. 
---
But I'm also a 315 skinner, and have to off-tank in certain fights, so my DPS always ends up dropping off big time.
---
Luckily I'm in a somewhat casual guild, so they don't mind it at all. We get MC done in ~2 hours and we're all happy with that.
---
doesnt fix anything, just allows me to afk
---
Sorry, I went off the rails in another comment reply to you lol. I'm all over the place tonight. 
---
&gt;simply asking people to be nicer is disingenuous if you intend to actually fix the issue. 
---
Oh no, I'm not naive enough for that. My opinion is more that they should be reported, suspended for some length of time, and we shouldn't feel bad for them when it happens.
---
I would have thrown my laptop at the wall tbh
---
Doing just that. It's more annoying than anything. Had a Warlock die for doing it, but otherwise I've been holding it together just fine. I just figured that maybe sacrificing some DPS would give me less of a threat headache.
---
Okay so since I have the 310 wep skill I just have to have my items +% hit to add up to 6%? Is that what the 6% refers to just extra 6% hit from items right? 
---
Because then I have: 
---
Mask of Unforgiven- 2%
---
Devilsaur bonus - 2%
---
Tarnished Elven Ring- 1%
---
Blackstone Ring- 1% 
---
That’s 6% extra hit and I’m good to go?
---
Paladin actually! Seal of the Crusader
---
Thank you for the real reply, I shall downvote all other replies due to the quality of your response!
---
You can GTFO too. All this dude does is troll on every post and whine and bitch about Classic saying it’s dead and all this other nonsense.
---
Sure, either way, the important part is not being a jerk about your choice of play style!
---
If you do not let them learn now, you'll be grouping with them at 60 doing the same thing. Set the bar early.
---
i havent tried since the BG update, but i have gotten multiple fused wirings from the linen/wool level one
---
Sorry to burst your bubble

I got 3 pieces of MC gear on my first run.  I was in mostly greens.  Druid gets gear
---
What this needs is a panel above it where Blizzard is giving him a good push up to speed.
---
That is weapon normalization which applies only to certain instant strikes, none of which my class has.
---
Comparable to the current players that care more for Honour Points then for winning the game.
---
Dont forget the most important flaw in the honor system. It says absolutely nothing about how good someone is at pvp, only who put in more time grinding or afking in AV. Any good ranking system counts losses as well as wins.
---
It's still a conscious choice to let that frustration get the better of you and act abusively.
---
technically, it's affected by spell hit, but yeah. the dude above you is wrong
---
I gave 50G to the guy who made mine and he didnt even ask for one.  I was just glad to get it made I guess lol.
---
It's not the end of the world, I agree. It's the fact you think I should fucking carry your underleveled ass that's the problem.
---
Consider that in a PUG nobody knows you or your skill. You're far less likely to be the best level 56 than you are to be some other generic asshole.
---
Got exalted yesterday and they removed the ability to kick afk so I will farm honor afk, thanks guys
---
Wow. I finally got a response to my ticket. I’m not even sure they read what my problem was. Either that or I got the one GM who doesn’t understand that there’s a difference between graphical lag and network latency. Here’s the response:
---
Game Master Raftwill here!
---
Sorry to hear you're having performance issues in World of Warcraft... if you're noticing these issues particularly in Classic, then there was a change in the 1.13 patch that may be at root. We gave Classic a different filename (wowclassic.exe, to differentiate it from the current version's wow.exe) but apps that watch for which files are running don't all have that indexed yet.
---
Let's make sure the video driver knows wowclassic.exe exists and should be run as wow.exe was before.
---
1. Right click on the desktop and open the Nvidia Control Panel
---
2. Click on Manage 3D Settings on the left
---
3. Go to the Program Settings Tab
---
4. Browse and select the Blizzard game. 
---
&gt; If there is a drop-down menu called Select Preferred Graphics Processor, choose High Performance Nvidia Processor. This drop-down may not always be present
---
5. Click Add and close the Control Panel
---
Rerun the game!
---
Thank you for contacting us, and best of luck in your adventures :)
---
Lock. There's tons of priests. Not many locks and they scale well.
---
Hahahaha sure. It's not PvE players report-kicking players, it's PvP players, unless Skeram is now PvE and no one told me.
---
What class are you? Paladin I assume?
---
So what is a good way to farm honor?
---
F that, I woulda just waited a week or two lol.
---
Yep. Every damn time.
---
Spam AV.
---
To a certain extent there's only so much control you have over how a game goes.  You probably want to get the non-repeatable quests done, including the quests you pick up in Alterac, the quest from Org that takes you there, and some of the quests you get from within Alterac Valley (Brotherly Love, Fallen Sky Lords, etc.).  Most of them are at least 100 rep a pop for something that's usually along the way.  You should do the Proving Grounds quest as soon as you can, though it helps a lot to have a friend do this with you or just someone else in the group doing it.  It might take a few tries.
---
Overall, assuming you have all the quests done, the best way to get rep is to just win.  The rep you get is mostly concentrated in getting Belinda down followed by winning the game is really where the rep is, but the former is always going to happen and the latter is just do your best.
---
It's a perfectly valid analogy, as they're both abusing the system at the expense of the general population. Nitpicking on the legality of said abuse doesn't change that.
---
This is so tragic! Was she killed by the Hong Kong police that Activision/blizzard support? Or perhaps in one of China's concentration camps for ethnic and religious minorities that Activision/Blizzard supports?
---
Not sure why you are only just realizing this now. 
---
The honor system is 14 years old, we've known for 14 years that you need a serious time commitment to get a top rank.
---
If you aren't having fun with anything else in the game than yeah stop playing I guess?
---
I call bullshit.
---
As someone who did rank to 13 back in Vanilla I can tell you that it took a very coordinated effort with other like minded PvPers. Three was no way you were going to get the honor required to hit rank 13 afking in Battlegrounds.
---
It was recorded so he could share the reaction with the guildies who helped pay for it. Instead of just saying “yeah I gave it to him”. They then decided they wanted to share with the community. No reason to get all salty with people wanting to share a little bit of happiness with the world.
---
 \-They didn’t speak up at all during the entire p2 wpvp debacle. 
---
They release BGs early because of this...
---
This is fucked
---
Why not brah it’s twinking brah
---
It started to rain in my room
---
Rumour has it when you enter drekthars lair as alliance when merging he will tell out YOU PICKED THE WRONG HOUSE FOOL
---
That's what I said lmao but he was keen af
---
I would disagree, top guilds wouldn't be top guilds if they were slacking on wbuffs and consumes
---
P2 wasnt a blizzard issue, it was the player base that was completely misinformed of what would happen to the world when there is 3 locations players visit at 60 frequently and wpvp being the only way to farm honor. 
---
Anyone who wanted "fair" 1v1s and small skirmishes were delusional.
---
You guys are awesome! So glad to see this. Thanks for sharing!
---
BG players abuse mechanics for their own benefit, screwing over third parties in the process. Just like a corrupt politician will abuse the system, fuck over people and reap benefits. 
---
"ThE pOlItIcIaN iS bReAkInG tHe LaW"
---
Okay, so what? Is fucking over someone legally somehow better than doing it illegally? Would murdering your mother be okay if it was legal? Like, do you genuinely need a law book in order to distinguish right from wrong or what? 
---
So much for finding "fallacies" like a first year philo major, bud.
---
The Paladin using seal of crusader complicated things, it gives AP and makes attacks faster but hit for less, would that effect the +9 basically making at +7 or even 6 after the calculations? I don’t know the math on seal of crusader.
---
I love this!! I wish I had friends like this to play with but none of my friends are interested and I’m just horrible at finding people in game ): 
---
I still love this community though!
---
How can I join av with a friend?
---
It's the best way to farm honor...
---
Then Blizzard is at fault for the way they designed the honor system. You shouldnt have to 24/7 nolife for months to get to the high ranks. poor design, encourages the worst behavior both in-game and IRL
---
So true, all started with the "hardcore streamers". They set a precedent that their communities followed. It's not 2004, times change.
---
And beyond gear most efficient or best use of time invested. Most tears with least time/effort input
---
Why make these posts? Everyone knows Blizzard has no desire to make small changes like this without REALLY good reason. Nothing is broken or being abused. We asked for Classic, no changes. Roll with what we got. It is what it is.
---
&gt; BG players abuse mechanics for their own benefit, screwing over third parties in the process. 
---
Uh, that's what competition is.
---
Nope, thats not how that works sadly. 
---
Sure, you can "use" a 10y old laptop still today. 
---
The thing is just, that you just throw a ton of value into the gutter without actually having the need for it. 
---
You could literally have a 400$ Laptop with which you do all of that "little" stuff, and continue to do so in the future, while having a full PC for 600$ and have the best of both worlds.
---
A "gaming" laptop has like a third of the lifetime of an actual PC and that also only if its a decent one (which 1k is a long shot away from), and if not used for the literal intended purpose is just a literal waste of money and burden for the future as a PC that costs 400$ less is literally outclassing them in every single measurable way while also leaving enough money for a "sofa"-Laptop to do small stuff on. 
---
Lets face it, there obviously hasnt been done any research done and someone without any knowledge in that field just threw the idea into the room and everyone agreed.
---
It depended on your server.
---
If your server had few trihards, then you could do it solo.
---
"You guys" I haven't posted anything like this since Classic came out, and I'm not currently playing Classic. Why deride people for having thoughts?
---
I mean, thats just not true. Because I only care about the rep from AV and I have numerous guild mates that only care for the rep and wont do much if any AV unless they are turtling and doing the quest after they get exalted. Yes some people care about honor, but if you take something that gives good honor AND rep then people unite to do it. Once the rep players fall off and its just people doing it for honor it wont be as many people that are so gung-ho for quick games. I know once me and my buds get exalted we are gonna go into AV's stall the horde then summon ram riders etc and have fun.
---
Ahh the self righteous police of reddit.
---
Instead of buying water from mages I just queue into AV and ask for water. Faster and free. Don’t know if this would happen otherwise
---
&gt; Well first, it’s not midnight ye
---
He says at 3 in the morning.
---
Kill LT's, capture towers, actually do the objectives.
---
Oh I forgot about the 5 from the talents not being counted- so then using eye of rend would be better because I get that extra Crit Chance hit and I go down to 8% hit which is still above my soft cap of 6%?
---
I can speak from personal experience that having a support group like this is crucial to making it through something so life changing. I'm man enough to say that watching this video brought a tear to my eye
---
Are you even serious? You're going to flag non-AFK people as AFK, get them kicked out then put on a 15mins timeout, and all you've go to say is... "That's what competition is"?
---
Look, if you're going to act like a fucking asshole, at least own it. And while you're at it, learn to differentiate between abuse and genuine, fair competition. Giving yourself and edge via shady means that hurt others is certainly not "just competition".
---
I will admit. I watched way to long untill realised that thats it.
---
Blizzard knew all this. They are sabotaging classic to get people to play their trash retail game
---
Am *I* serious? You should be talking to *Blizzard*. They are the ones encouraging this behavior, not me. That's the *entire point of this conversation*.
---
Amen! Honestly, i just love the dynamic of PuG vs PuG WSG. Untimed makes it perfect! I'm just a little level 55 hunter having a blast! That is what i refer to as having fun playing a video game. I love the fact that i'm loving it too. It's too easy to fall down the road of what "needs" to be done in the game. Enjoying it takes discipline! GL guys!
---
You do it once for the parse, but a lot of these buffs take more time than you save and aren't worth doing weekly
---
One of the biggest deception for me. I did a mistake to have a big hopes they add this , not only as the bgs is starting but also for a couple of sec at respawn . I am also a priest and if i aint buffed/team buffed b4 engaging the opposite faction it does not push my class as effective as it should . Ive been talking with tons of priest about it and it seems that inner fire is the only buff to go at respawn. Sadly thats just the way it is , ill be enjoying more the wpvp and ill sit with my mage 39 to enjoy the bgs.
---
I am talking as a whole. 
---
There's going to be guilds who want to get their members into the AV the rest of them are in, by kicking other people out and having their members force queue into that specific AV number.
---
were they women?
---
You have a source of 45-75mins, Ive always gone of 60mins
---
Fucking Druid
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19885/track-hidden
---
Feral druid is pretty chill.
---
For pvp, you've got way more tricks up your sleeve than any other class. It takes a bit to get used to, but you've got a ton of things you can do in almost any situation. Feral charge, travel form, roots, spells, heals, it's almost too many options sometimes. Although the "better pvp spec" is a good bit into restoration, since the healing is ridiculously strong. In 1v1's, you're great at outlasting people, and bursting down mages, haha.
---
As far as pve goes, don't listen to the people talking about max parses. You'll have a more difficult time competing as a feral druid, yes, but rogues have a hard time competing against warriors too! You're gonna be able to beat a lot of them. You'll be getting geared up faster than them. Competing with other druids on the logs is way more fun than trying to compare yourself to a pure dps class. Rogues can't combat res, or innervate, in case you don't need it in a fight.
---
I'd much rather farm MCPs than roll vs 8 other rogues for a perditions blade, lmfao.
---
We don't do it because it's fun, we do it because we have to in order for us to get our friends in the games.
---
People are trying to force turtles are the same people rushing the boss.
---
Next time someone tells me that "internet friends" aren't real friends, I'm going to show them this post.
---
Is he looking at my direction? Oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy
---
I like to hold Blizzard to account when they're wrong, but I think in this case we might want to allow the possibility that Blizzard could perhaps actually be aware that more people might AFK in BGs now, but that it may be a lesser problem than the mass-reporting. There's also the notion—I think we can agree this would be ludicrous—that Blizzard might even be working on a long-term fix.
---
No, nobody ever encourage such behaviour. The mere existence of a way to abuse a mechanic is in no way, shape or form an encouragement to make use of it. That's as sound of a reasoning than claiming the government encourages you to drink because alcohol is legal and easily obtainable.
---
So I can survive
---
You can honor farms but going to the farmer's market and thanking the people there, maybe buy something too.
---
You have to make them learn that going all out on the AoE is not always the best way for them to deal damage. Sure they might get the big deeps, but if they die that's no fun for anyone. It's a team effort and if they're making your job harder for you then they're making everyone's jobs harder for everyone.
---
If you notice it straight from the get-go, let them know and kindly ask them to not spam or just wait for you to get a few hits in. If they won't listen after asking once or twice, kindly let them know you operate under the rule of "You pull, you tank". You can only taunt one target every few seconds and it's best they learn that now. 
---
If all else fails you've learned yourself a valuable lesson; you might save them from a mob or two but you can save everyone from themselves.
---
Other than that are you using any tools? A threat meter? A damage meter?
---
Seriously considering this for a 39 twink hunter, should I do it or just get the rake?
---
Wish they made QOL change on this subreddit which autohides QOL-posts
---
Try /reload
---
This.
---
&gt;4. Only hunter and maybe rogue can kill you 1v1
---
You forgot warlocks. The kings of 1v1.
---
Even 5 man would be fine.
---
Yeah... Someone on faerlina got 250k+ day one.
---
When all the honor farmers are done with it. Then you PVP chads can have your irrelevant battleground back.
---
Hopefully they reduce the stupid amount of honour AV gives so people who want to rank can actually play it
---
I've definitely had this problem before, Pokemon springs to mind as an example; Back when I was a kid I could play Red version or Silver version just for pure fun; As an adult I bought a DS and bought Pokemon Black but found myself compelled to constantly look at guides and try to min/max my natures etc. And it really ruined the game for me. Just couldn't go back to discovering stuff the old way
---
World PvP was good for Alliance rankers, it was basically free honor everywhere you go. Horde got way less honor and they had to work to find anyone or resort to suboptimal strategies like corpse camping.
---
The community would still be at fault.
---
rushing is not really a thing anymore, at least as horde. i instantly fuck with the alliance right from the beginning and then contest the objectives they go for, otherwise you lose everytime. i don't consider honor and rep gain though, i just do what's fun for me.
---
Quote at the end was the absolute best
---
Your missing the point.
---
It gets you (a waste of a player spot out of the BG) and stops you from wasting another spot for 15min
---
That is true except that it doesn't count as detecting a script, and 1-2 hours is enough.
---
Whenever I queue on my twink I ask for buffs from everyone queing AV it’s so nice
---
I’ve tried everything. Fresh installed. No addons and everything.
---
Some of the AV gear is probably decent for fresh 60s too
---
So you actually don’t watch his content but wanted to make a post about him. The fuck is actually wrong with you?
---
I'm glad you're having fun. Most people are, including most people complaining about problems. They aren't mutually exclusive at all :)
---
If I point out rightfully that braindead pve AV being the most honor per hour is bad, does that mean I hate WOW? Does that mean I'm not having fun? NO! It means there's a problem that needs fixing. That's all.
---
You call yourself a min-maxer and you wouldn’t go back to your teen years with a million dollar advantage?
---
Better late than never
---
Raw Whitescale Salmon, Raw Sunscale Salmon, Raw Nightfin Snapper, Lightning Eel, Plated Armorfish, Raw Redgill
---
You know the 2 factions are not competing with each other and the difference in honor is irrelevant right?
---
by that logic, you are saying Blizzard should just remove all PvP to prevent grief/trolling/abuse.  
---
Also make it so you can't grief mobs by introducing the retail system of every player gets their own loot from the mob, even if quest-related.
---
That would be fixing the issues, but then the community would still cry like bitches.
---
Well I didn't f*cking know! Guess I learned something.
---
Imagine being this stupid. Legit horde player.
---
The real meta is trolling /bg
---
Don't really comment much on Reddit but this post really hit me. Not sure if your GM will even see this, but I'm sorry for your loss. It goes to show what a truly amazing community WoW has.
---
Why? You realize that NPC's in World of Warcraft have a small aggro radius, right? Go try out the old AV on BfA, tons of mobs and mines you can EASILY avoid.
---
Any version of Vanilla AV would be zerged. Blizzard would have to make CHANGES to the battleground for people to get the experience they want.
---
Exactly what i asked for.
---
I cant wait to read the posts after the muh 3k honor kids will understand that its doesnt matter.
---
What? Blizzard is a west coast based company so no it’s not midnight it’s 6:46 P.M. for them lmao
---
Oh, are they? Is that why... They fixed it? You can no longer 5-man kick people as of right now. Heh.
---
"Logical fallacy" is a broad term, would you mind pointing the specific one you're referring to? Or do you need to snoop into your philo 101 notes first?
---
Tell me, when welfare was introduced, did the government actively encourage people to live off taxpayers like leeches? Because... You know... Introducing something that can be abused is the same as encourage said abuse, right? ... Right?? Or are we going to resort to double standards? 
---
I don't know why you're trying so hard to justify scummy behaviour. Just repeat after me: "Hi, my name is KevinCarbonara, and I'm a cunt who'll get you kicked out of a BG so I can get more honor". It's really not that hard.
---
I mean, seriously, what the fuck is actually wrong with you? Didn't your parents teach you to treat others as you'd like to be treated yourself? Do you completely lack empathy? Don't you realise that morally bad and legal are not mutually exclusive? 
---
Fucking cunt.
---
You completely missed OPs point and then go on to not make any sense.
---
Awesome!  My condolences and congrats.  Really nice to see people doing nice things for others.  Good job.
---
Me too man, 49 bracket has been awesome so far. Also 5 min ques. Havent met any toxic players yet.
---
Wtf did I just read . Anyways logging back in to classic...
---
Punish me daddi.
---
&gt;by that logic, you are saying Blizzard should just remove all PvP to prevent grief/trolling/abuse.
---
No, that's the dumbest thing I ever heard. There are five million ways to fix the system before you jump to "remove all pvp". Simply not letting 60s gain honor from killin sub-60s would have fixed phase2 already.
---
Yeah its still 6%.
---
You don't save a whole hit rating until you get to 315, which really isn't worth it. 
---
In fact as a human with swords it would be better to save yourself one talent point and just put one point in Weapon Expertise, because at 308 weapon skill you have reached your maximum potential to minimise the negative effect of glancing blows and the extra talent point doesn't help your hit rating either.
---
Honorspy has been thrown out of whack with cross realm BGs and whatever change was made to chat channels I think
---
It was for sure the case in TBC.  AV was still mostly half the raid standing around waiting for the towers to die, but there were at least *some* people out there skirmishing on the towers because backcapping them was a great way to keep the enemy team from being able to kill the boss.  It was a pretty decent change, added PvP to the game without requiring the hours-long pushes.
---
&gt; "Logical fallacy" is a broad term, would you mind pointing the specific one you're referring to? Or do you need to snoop into your philo 101 notes first?
---
If you're going to try to be pedantic, try reading first.
---
&gt; That's a logical fallacy known as a false equivalency.
---
I would say low skill ceiling tbh ...it’s the game I play when I am too drunk to aim...mindless
---
Also we get something if drek zerg fails.
---
If they do, its rank 14 time
---
On my server one guild will just camp his spawn with a full raid group many hours of the day
---
It bothers me when people have fun and enjoy the game. Blizzard please hot fix as the current state of the game is literally unplayable.
---
What is the first dungeon where 2H tanking is no longer viable on a warrior? My friend and I just started doing ZF and it seems to be fine for it(we're both 45)
---
What 13 and 1 duel vid
---
A two week ban for anybody who has been chasing R14 would be absolutely soul crushing, it essentially would reset their progress. A month would be glorious.
---
look at me, I´m the MT now
---
From one random person on the internet to another.. Fuck life some times. You've got this though. You've got this.
---
If you kick people at the start of every match in games that just so happen to be 99% your guild, you were wrongfully kicking people.
---
Fun fact: people can't be "AFK" the second they zone in.
---
People aren't woke enough to change their habits for the greater good. It's stupid to think otherwise.
---
Really? Never knew that as I’ve never tried, makes sense though
---
Weapon debuffs are considered minor. They will be overwritten.
---
They are kicking you to get another member of their premade in who's queued up.
---
This is what happens when your guildies are no longer guildies, they become family. Sorry for your loss.
---
What a cowards argument, trying to hide behind "oh well, you can never fix *everything*". It would fix some things at least, the biggest one being "60s camping 48s in open world pvp".
---
Can't lie, when i was playing back in original vanilla I sometimes stealthed on my rogue at a tower or graveyeard while watching tv shows and just walking a little now and then to look like i was active and claim i was defending.
---
Thank you for the kind words! Me and Ruta have been best friends since we were teenagers. We got to play vanilla together back in the day, and we were super excited for classic. This has been our first try at running a guild and are blown away by the community we have created. The guild is Fear Inc on Sulfuras Horde side for those asking.
---
There is no argument to be had. The poeple who think players have fked this are stupid.
---
Can you dual wield 2 brutality blades?
---
There are clubs for that, too. You'll have to start it, and you'll be the only member, but hey, automatic president!
---
Not with the way honor scales. If you don’t keep up it will make even the smallest jump in rank nearly impossible. Welcome to the grind.
---
What does lel mean?
---
Well I still think it's frustrating that Blizzard had to crossrealm marry me to your wife as well.
---
people who reported one or two people... versus people who routinely were reporting 20, 30 people every BG...
---
Blizzard should be able to quite easily tell the difference between those using the system the way it was meant to be used and those abusing it and being dickheads.
---
Often just ride past people leveling now. The honor isn’t worth the time to stop to kill anyone. I’ll gank someone if they’re near mobs or resources I want.
---
How dare Alliance win something, right?
---
Yo can I get an invite
---
I honestly did not know we have battlemasters in capitol cities in classic. I have been hearthing back to SS to then run to AV to join this past week haha!
---
Yeah officer... maybe she shouldn't have dressed that way!
---
Might just be the Oceania server group, but I have seen zero real afks in AV on the Horde side.
---
What’s the add on called? Sounds nice.
---
&gt; people that really are afk in starter cave long after game began 
---
how many people have you seen in games that you think are genuinely AFK?
---
Yeah, only INT have increased, Stamina,Strength,Agility all have gone down. And Spirit, man I don't even know what happened there.  
---
And the last couple of levels I think my INT gain have stopped.
---
You are not in raid group.
---
Do you feel better now?
---
Run to gate. Mounts up. Ride to boss. Kill boss. The ENDO
---
Their job is to talk shit, talk a lot of shit while sitting on pc. They are not saints who play with maximum glory.
---
Dude, you were never getting to rank 14. Please understand that this is not a grind anybody can do just by trying hard. Every single person who reaches R14 will be playing 18+ hours a day or more with account sharing. They will be organising brackets on their servers, they will be organising win trading with the other faction.
---
The 1-14 ranking system is utterly fucking insane and most people who try fail. Most people who succeed *quit the game over it*. It's 3-4 months of your life hating yourself the game. The people doing this grind have no damn clue what they're in for.
---
Put it out of your mind, you're missing out on nothing.
---
Imo just make it so you can't pull warmasters out of the keeps. Then people will have to cap towers
---
AV... It's fun
---
Seriously. It doesn't take even close to 40 people to kill drek.
---
Trash? Perhaps. Irrelevant? Far from it, the exalted rewards are exceptional for some/most classes ^^
---
Lol just queue for stuff?
---
That isn't what that says, but at any rate I was obviously just trying to make the guy admitting to doing it uncomfortable and don't actually believe these people are going to get actioned. Nobody with a brain would.
---
(Std means hours in German)
---
Just release phase 6 already
---
That's not a good reason to boot another player, cost them 15 minutes and a win.
---
A timeless classic that rings so true
---
you deserve it for capping snowfall.  Should be an auto kick
---
Nah the cave on with side I believe is far enough away from the zergs that run past. 
---
But if anyone is near then it gets split. So you can afk inside there and soak up someone else’s exp.
---
Umm yeah they announced it months ago, everyone knew it was 1.12 AV.  It is still a mistake to put 1.12 AV into the game.  It was a mistake to make so much of the game as the 1.12 patch, that was also known for a while.  Still Blizzard's fault, still not the communities fault.
---
Go all in ez epic mount
---
I play druid and agree with general comments. Playing a feral Druid is an uphill battle, raid spot not guaranteed and not really useful in PvP compared to a HotW / NS build. There is a tanking spec that is very close to the PvP spec but if guild wants you deep feral tank or deep resto well good luck farming respecs.
---
I am in this situation with guild wanting me with survival of the fittest so I PvP on a shaman and PvE on druid.
---
Internet person, let me tell you, they have logs of where your character moves for X numbers of days since that login, chat messages, commands and abilities used.  You just have to convince them to invest the time to look and not get some quantity vs quality GM.
---
Time to quit wow, classic wow. It’s how vanilla was and now is. Stale after a while.
---
If you're grinding rank it matters. Not everyone likes to only fight AI
---
hey Ive seen a keifchief on windseeker I wonder if that’s him
---
thank you! I am nearly 19 with all the gear. just need the game changing enchants that costs a billion. by the way, what is a talent spec for this class? I heard people actually do improved renew and blackout. is that really the best? I thought going 5/5 wand and improved shield was king
---
thats me sir
---
worst part is you can't determine who is reporting you.
---
Awww, it would be such a tragedy if you couldn't be an absolute cock to everyone you met with no repercussions. /s
---
Relax man, you'll be exalted long, long before you're done getting honor.
---
Welcome to classic wow? QoL is what make retail wow, you don’t want to go down that path.
---
I’m a priest who has benediction there isn’t a reason and even if there was I’d just afk grind it because I don’t care
---
Windseeker represent baby, pretty sure you’re #1 PvP rank on server too
---
Cope
---
Guild mates are actual friends bro.
---
What the fuck kind of communication do you want, a phone call to your house? They put out blue posts every single week and fucking talk to us on the regular
---
Wouldn’t be an issue if PVP chads and people below level 60 didn’t queue for AV.
---
But why autorun? You get flagged afk if you do this. Blizz stepped up their game with this early on when queues were really long
---
Streamers ruined classic wow
---
I'd say Druid. Warlocks love them hots, and you won't be too far behind him when he gets his free mount cause you'll at least have travel form. Plus errybody loves MotW
---
I’m guessing we just play the game dude... chill out. Your baiting for certain comments and answers. 
---
Majority of horde need to stop being booty tickled.
---
The fun of vanilla is to make your own spec, you dont need cookie cutter. If you can t figure how to build your spec .....
---
It doesn't matter if horde get more honor than alliance since we dont compete with them for ranks.
---
And if all alliance teams are doing the same thing, then it mostly benefits whoever can win faster.
---
Leave idiot
---
Right click on the "general" tab in the chat box and then click settings. You'll see "world channels" or somesuch and Looking for group is one of them.
---
I gave you their rational, I didn't defend it.
---
Nahh that's logical and sounds like the exact situation. Can't be right.
---
Every player is playing the game for fun. I promise. The problem is blizzard seems to go out of their way to make sure the differet sides can not mesh in any way whatsoever.
---
I means, it's pretty much the easiest rep to max.  Why not farm honor.  Exalted will come pretty easy anyway lol.
---
More importantly, they will not overwrite important high/med priority debuffs.
---
You got lucky as fuck no reason to be sad I lost to a bunch of level 55’s who didn’t even know what the item was smfh
---
yea, 2 weeks would set people back a lot
---
War photo: Two AV veterans at peace enjoying retirement.
---
Sounds like a my little pony mmo
---
Why can't you? What happened to all the nochanges crap?
---
If your gear is good enough, you could probably 2hand tank any 5man. But your gear won't be good enough to do it in, say, stratholme when you first hit 60.
---
What I've found is it doesn't always speed your run. You do more dps, but your healer has to spend more mana healing you. Which means you have to wait for mana more, slowing things down. Obviously if your healer isn't having mana problems this stops being an issue.
---
&gt; "got mine fuck everyone else" as is standard from the wonderful community we have.
---
its not the community, just humanity in general on this one
---
Everyone is grinding AV rep, of course the world is empty lmao
---
BGs killed organized wPvP. If your idea of wPvP is just random 1v1s or small skirmishes against enemy players when you are out doing PvE stuff, then flying killed that.
---
But you parse based on your gear. Our third most dps mage parsed higher than the top dps mage. Because the third one had worse gear.
---
This makes my heart melt, I’m so glad that he had you guys! Stay strong my friend.... I don’t know exactly how you feel but hopefully you’ll find your own way to make each day better.
---
Take care! Sincerely Pho
---
They can easily beat you in a 1v1 duel. Warlocks have no chance of catching a druid that wants to run, though.
---
You can not literally afk in AV, seems like a great fix :D
---
Wow, real scumbag.
---
Yes it stacks. Cap is 100% (meaning the talent / set bonus won't stack beyond 100% on DMC:BD procs)
---
Thank God.
---
Oh man they're never gonna let that go too lol
---
3 if you count the gnome
---
Same, but this subreddit being flooded with complaint threads is really annoying sometimes. Haven't seen a lot of discussion posts about the actual game lately, just some meta ones about the community and Blizzard. And memes, but I like memes though. This sub was a comedy goldmine before release.
---
Friend did that with a ruler duct taped to a oscillating fan, his only hit spacebar.
---
Nah, I think I will take the W by not giving a shit about trying to convince some idiot on the internet.
---
Hope you dont enjoy the rest of your life!
---
Honestly if you don’t have an epic mount by now why are you even bothering to log in?
---
Maybe because my first language isn't English and my phrasing is not the best, sorry. I didn't mean to brag.
---
Opps
---
Haha, I’ve had more happen than just see keifchief on Windseeker. Can’t count the times I’ve muttered, “f$&amp;@king rogue horde scum,” after getting ganked lol.
---
Honestly... with the rank 14 grind.. you weren’t gonna be able to rank SUPER HIGH without a lot of playing. The AV spam just sucks because these High Walords and Grand Marshall’s will be achieving their rank with very little “actual PvP”. If the AV was fixed, they would probably switch to WSG and AB when it comes out (which forces premade groups to actually succeeded to a higher level in the pvp bracket).. you would still be behind them in honor if that was the case, it just wouldn’t be “as much honor” but the relative honor earned by everyone would go down...
---
If I remember correctly rankings are based on the top pvpers honor earned ..which forms a bracket from that point down. Hypothetically if no one pvped and the top honor earner got something like 5k for the week. That would be #1 standing and would progress through their rank as much as if he was #1 and a shit load of honor . So the new AV sucks, but in reality you probably weren’t going to achieve a high rank without playing a lot. 
---
You really should raid if you can for gear and strictly pvp for fun. Which is what I am doing now. I am a previous rank 14 grinder and I cannot get behind spamming these AVs to achieve that “accomplishment”. I will be fine gearing another way and PvPing for fun. How it should be.
---
To whoever said only 5 people will reach HWL... I completely disagree with the format now. You will be able to solo pug to AV as long as you continue to spam. Back in the day it required a lot more organization with teammates and you actually could control brackets with fellow members of your group. This new system will act as a first come first serve free for all for the top PVE-AV spammers.
---
Got into one of these hour matches earlier on my lvl 46. we lost 2/3 to 3/3, and it was exhausting, but it was the best pvp I've had in classic so far.
---
Dude where in Columbus? I live in 614 too!
---
Yes, people are going to use things that you put in the game. Why are you putting something in a game that wont be used?
---
This exactly same thing happened to me when I first got ony attuned and did pub a few hours later.
---
And first MC was only 2 druids so got 2 pieces there also. Love the +1 system mostly.
---
Your wrong, this is exactly how 1.12 AV was.
---
What guild are y'all in? I'll make sure to avoid killing ya (although I don't attack greys anyways)
---
Yes I’m not sure how much of the op i can believe.
---
Why would I not want to keep all the things im farming?
---
Man i recall seing  TBC traler  and thinking, hey i wanna check it out I was around lvl 15 nelf hunter. i didnt know how to get to outlands, so i googled and found a vid where some orc fly with zeppelin from ogrimmar to stv and then rided to blasted lands. I found out where are Ogrimmar and then treveled from westfall to wetlands took boat to menethil harbor and followed road. died alot and some guy asked what i  lvl 15 was doing there, and I said. im going to ogrimmar to get to outland  he laught at me wished good luck in hord zone ( i toght wtf? whats that?) and went on.  Never finished my journey after being unable to get to zep coz of guards instakilling me. but i will always remmeber this
---
That's what I thought I remembered, so I was confused and a little annoyed when I was insta-booted earlier.
---
even as a DW warrior? tbh ill probably be happy with getting either on my warrior as im pretty sure our alt raids are just gunna be half pugs with ms&gt;os
---
Are you playing to enjoy playing, or only to get rewards? No rank 14 means that all pvp is off the table? You could try twinking, you can max out a low level character easily and effectively have the power level of a r14.
---
Depends on what you want.  Epic mount, plenty of weapons and offhands that are epic but slightly below MC level.
---
It's like maybe jsut maybe it wasn't about the honor!
---
I play horde on sulfuras and I always avoided searing gorge because thorium point would always be camped by allys when I flew in. Seemed like it was about 50/50 on whether horde or alliance would be controlling any given area, but the bulwark and UC elevators always seemed to have allys.
---
Roaming tank squads and flight point farms are dead, the toxic part is dead. Now PvP is usually what people envisioned, a 1v1 over resource node or farming spot, Small group fights that result from people calling their friends. You'll always have a small subset of people who grief to grief and you will still get ganked occasionally by a death squad of people who think it's fun, but mostly PvP feels organic again.
---
I'm 100% correct. 
---
It's you that made up the stipulation of "1.12"
---
I had said original AV. The one with more stronger guards,shredders and was known for longer games.
---
Don't put words in my mouth. Thanks.
---
Im thinking about getting classic or retail. Am leaning twords classic because I played and really liked tbc/wrath but i lurk around here and the place turns me off.
---
I’m going to call it out, they are using the newest SpyBracket addon!  It remembers your name and shares it with other players to build a database and once someone doesn’t like you, they just check a box and cause this kind of behavior!
---
Basic economic theory would help you understand that this trait is a human trait, not just wow players.
---
I get what you're saying, but I'm also entirely fucking jealous that guy's exalted and I wish the same for my matches.
---
Remindme! 12 hours
---
I know I worded my previous post in a confusing manner.  I'm actually horde.
---
I have noticed that alliance groups have started to farm more honor recently.  And I for one applaud them for it.  Anything that slows the alliance zerg gives horde a better chance to win lol.
---
My first mouse upgrade was to a 5 button mouse and that was aaaaamazing
---
HJaha yeah the classic community gave us 1.12, totally our fault!
---
2.5*
---
What exactly can you do with the “honor” you earn playing BGs?
---
This is my first time playing WoW and I’ve been messing around in WSG recently, but noticed you don’t get any xp and very little gold. Are “honor” rewards actually useful, or is it more just about bragging rights?
---
Thanks in advance.
---
blessing of sacrifice on lock prevents poly.
---
That is not really an accurate measure sir.  How would you explain realms that had no population loss also having substantially less auctions posted?
---
I didn’t realize complaining about the first day was still pertinent to... anything
---
Right now its mostly consumables. But when phase 3 drops there's some nice epic armor pieces you can pick up
---
It’s the same 1.12 AV. And we are in 1.12. This shouldn’t be hard to comprehend.
---
Yeah, threat and dps meter. Ground out Herod's head, shoulder and axe tonight. Ended up getting an overlevelled healer who wanted in for some reason so I ended up just letting them go ham. All in all, I think I'm fine with my tanking. Just wanted to see if there was more I could do, since I'm new to the Classic tanking scene. Casters are stubborn, man.
---
This is actually true
---
Please, I do most of this shit on a daily basis when I'm in game. (But he's better than I am)
---
(P.S. this is actually amazing and I think your Guildie should make more content like this.)
---
(P.P.S. the edit where he jumps in booty bay and falls then miraculously is on top of the thing he was trying to jump to is amazing and I love this!)
---
How did someone with this attitude ever plan on pvping in classic. Teamwork and skill and legitimately defeat higher geared players and yes they will have an advantage but that’s how classic is you gotta put a shit ton of effort in to get the best shit and only a certain few can.
---
Its for wsg. They make twinks at the top end because its fun to just melt people.
---
So for example they make a level 29 rogue with crusader and the best fear available and just destroy normal players. That's fun for some peeps.
---
Respeccing costs 100g/week. That's 2 hours of aoe farming.
---
Yeah you're gunna max out at 6% hit which if you get decent gear will be really hard to go below, especially in bwl with drake fang talisman, you'll be sitting on 4% just from helmet/trinket, our bis boots also give hit and so does ony neck so you're already capped from that alone
---
r/wholesome
---
Thank you, i thought i was going crazy lol
---
They’re like 25g on heartseeker. Shadowfang is 250-300 and assassins blade is only around 50g more. Everyone watched the same gold making videos and had the same plan.
---
Hardly any actual reporting and kicking was happening anyway relative to the total population. I’ve played 16+ hrs of AV and never seen anyone get booted, never been in a premade. Sometimes someone will call for a report on an afker. Super rare tho. Seen the summon scam but whatever.
---
No reaction?  Not even pushback from the poke?  Cats OP
---
Right?! The whole point ha. Not like I’ll okay AV once I’m exalted tho.
---
I think the reason people dislike minmaxing is because it’s an online multiplayer game where (in the case of PvP servers) you can essentially kill anyone at any time. The people who are playing the game for the first time are at a huge disadvantage and the game has lost it’s charm when your screen is grey most of the time.
---
I’m not advocating one way or the other. Personally I play OSRS as well and minmax in that game. That’s all that fun for me. Bursting slayer tasks, tick perfect skilling, three tick mining (albeit I don’t do that cuz fuck that). No one sits around fishing lobster anymore. No one trains any combat skills outside of slayer, NMZ or afking crabs.
---
But the difference is that in OSRS you can’t kill anyone outside of the wilderness.
---
It is what it is and the game will play out how it will, but right now I see the games issue being that the minmaxers feel like they’re running out of content too quickly and getting bored whilst the “for-fun” players are getting stomped (in PvP servers) and cant even make it to end game, so both parties are getting a little bored.
---
It's fine,  since alliance win 90% of the games its ok. Alliance were suffering from horde in phase 2, now its time for horde to suffer.
---
Wow hopefully this is your first play through of classic lol
---
The other person was completely wrong.
---
You cannot do anything with honor itself. The more honor you earn, the higher rank you will attain in the PVP system. The higher your rank, the better items you get. There are a total of 14 ranks, and to get to the highest rank you need to get more honor than literally everyone in your server and faction. This is of course impossible for anyone who can't devote their life to playing WoW.
---
For normal people, getting rank 7-10 is achievable if you spend all your WoW time doing battlegrounds.
---
This is insane and so beautiful 😍
---
I mean to continue with the original analogy, probably for the same reason I have a dick but dont go on rape sprees.
---
Except your point is useless as it's only that version because they chose that version.
---
"It's the patch number they chose and its what they chose"
---
They had decided prior to release 1.12 AV. It's not that this is the current version of the game. That's the AV they specifically chose forever for classic. They decided it prior to release. There's no rule stating it has to be this AV
---
The same is true for wsg.
---
The other day I went to do some essence of water farming. I got 2 within the first 5 kills, didn’t see another one for ~50 minutes
---
Is Balinda in AV a demon, or a warlock, or something? I was in one game where she yelled in the demonic tongue.
---
I’m so glad BGs are cross server because I don’t have hours to wait for enough people to queue for a game.
---
Well you see, blizzard bad. That's why I give them 15 bucks a month.
---
\#nochanges
---
\#unlessidontlikesomething
---
\#thenchangesplease
---
Playing on a private server before launch, everyone did this. I was surprised when in Classic almost nobody knew about it
---
"no changes" would have been the more accurate final panel.
---
&gt; Because the player base didn’t exploit every single min/max advantage capable back then.
---
Yes, they player base didn't exploit game mechanics back then. Not because they didn't want to, but because no one knew how.
---
Back when I played 13-14 years ago, I would queue up on my level 15 mage into WSG, and die endlessly. I had a lot of fun with that. Why? Because I was like 10 years old. Now, I'm not too fond of being shitty at the game. I actually enjoy playing the game correctly for a change.
---
It resets all your talent points. It starts at 1g then goes up by 5 every time you respec. 5g, 10g 15g etc.
---
Having no weapon skill will mean you do no damage.  But using a 1h wep to get your skill up shouldn't take longer then 20min or so to hit max. Just find some lower level mobs to grind on.
---
If say reset and try fury. Arms and fury are both fun. You might want to wait until 30 when arms gets sweeping strikes it gives you a big boost in power. There isn't really anything similar to it in the fury tree where you will get a skill and suddenly have a big power boost.
---
Alliance will always win pvp due to having palis and the bridge choke point. But what OP is suggesting will help shift the meta to a slightly more mutually fun point where the alliance will still win.
---
Yeah I was wondering why I never saw ours, like the nelfs left to go summon and then nothing...
---
That's amazing. Good luck forwards on your journey guys!
---
Yea, you are missing something, about 99% of the game
---
How?
---
It was released 109 days ago, does that mean you played 15 hours a day?
---
Plus any time spend on alts?
---
Go outside you pale vampire
---
blizzard is a company and wants to maximize profit. Why would the ceo purposefully want something to fail? What kind of baloney tinfoil hat logic is this? His job is to maximize the company's profits. 
---
They had major oversights in things like faction balance. However these issues were a part of the original game, as they are now. ranking is shitty, but fun and rewarding if you no life it. With how prevalent efficient gameplay is in 2019, I guarantee you if Blizzard offer server transfers, all the faction imbalance would just turn into there being one faction on a server. The major oversight was not offering more servers on launch, and not enforcing a 50/50 faction split on each server(which would never happen because of #nochanges). They can't do anything now or it would make faction dominant realms into one-faction realms.
---
You wanted vanilla as it was, you got it in 2019 with no changes. Blizzard's attitude isn't really out of touch, they are just taking accountability for their promise of no changes.
---
So, we are /r/gaming now?
---
Shit like this makes me unnecessarily weepy. Awesome stuff here and reasons why I’ve always loved what community focused groups can mean for each other.
---
Okay, so you arent blaming God for rape being a thing? Cause you know he didn't have to create rapists, just like the devs didnt have to create the rape button.
---
I found the best thing is to do dungeons for 2 levels everytime you hit a new dungeon bracket.
---
So bfd sfk would be one bracket.
---
Then rfk and starter sm
---
Then gnomer rfd and end of sm.
---
That way when you do the quests you will be a little overleveled and it will go faster.
---
But if you have to wait a long time to put together groups or wait for groups to come together it isn't worth it imo.
---
Im lucky enough to have a guild where we can run some thing 2-3 times in a row and get a level.
---
Bro, I’m in the same spot. 59 warlock and just got invited to a raiding guild. Almost full prebis w 30 sp enchant. WSG has been the most fun I’ve had in a while and met a bunch of cool repeat teammates (alliance so usually same queue) over like only 6 games. Honestly thinking about staying 59.
---
Youre tellin me you just want to play WoW for the joy of warsong gulch?
---
I don't care about PVE at all, and would only do it to get gear to PVP. Any PVP I would be missing? I don't care about AV either.
---
Actually it's #nochanges still.
---
As this isn't the original AV. But a butchered version they released later I'm actually suggesting they move it more towards #nochanges original AV.
---
Because its impossible to put an earlier version of AV into the game ...
---
... like a lot of people wanted.
---
But sure, its the communitys fault.
---
Never had any interest in playing WoW until just now.
---
I can say there’s a lot in my guild that would do this. There’s a lot of good people that play
---
I top the static fights (Rag etc) as deep frost, beating arcane mages.
---
You can have permafrost and imp blizzard, cone if cold and still smash meters, you'll just need to pop GAE for MC. Most of our mages are deep frost, the difference is minimal in this phase as the boss fights are so bloody short.
---
To go arcane you sacrifice sooooooooo much of what I love about mage, so screw that. Deep frost FTW
---
What the fuck dude. Go play the lotto
---
/r/retiredmemes
---
Yeah wtf man, American Airlines? Really? JetBlue gets me around kalimdor much faster
---
Make a macro for assigning skull to a mob, bind it, and then make it clear that they kill skull first.
---
After that, it isn’t your problem.
---
The point is they shouldn’t change it because it’s not the AV some portion of the population doesn’t like. A large amount of the game is affected by it being 1.12 as the starting point, not just pvp.
---
Lol Iv seen that guy in game.  Hunter.
---
Cheeeta?
---
Every. Fucking. Time.
---
*panic in healer*
---
That and AB, but yes. I'd be more interested in world PVP if it wasn't just roaming gank squads.
---
This is how it was throughout the entirety of vanilla
---
Yes, but ally could get 3k honor per AV and rank faster than other ally... but they just dont.
---
It doesn't matter that it isn't the original AV, because Blizzard never said they were going to give us that version.
---
What if they kill you then your farming suffers.
---
Still less of a grind than Vanilla honor system.
---
what?
---
Remember Alliance is getting low honor in AV, which makes WSG optimal for them to rank, which means the only way to be competitive in the honor race is to fight premades in WSG, which is hell...
---
Horde get comparable honor in AV to WSG premades, which makes it way better for Horde in the long run if this continues.
---
So they should pick and choose whatever class balance changes I decide I like?  Or just the original versions?  Should we get the original hunter talents, because you decided the original was the way to go?
---
Now, I would love them to give us the original AV, but that was never an option.
---
What do you want out of your alt? Group content? Pvp?
---
If you want to tank in pve, or charge into the fray in pvp, go warrior.
---
If you want to still be a pure dps, go hunter or mage.
---
Mage would probably be the most drastically different playstyle while still being a dps class. And it could be a good alt to have with farming, ports, etc.
---
I like hunter, they're pretty fun. Mage was too different for me, only about level 8 with him..
---
Im in the same spot.  49 fire mage having some much fun in WSG, I'm not sure I have any interest in leveling--at least anytime soon.
---
&gt; It doesn't matter that it isn't the original AV 
---
And do tell, Why wouldnt that matter?
---
&gt; because Blizzard never said they were going to give us that version. 
---
And why would that matter for us suggesting its the version thats better that we would like? Do we suddenly have to just love everything they decide for us?
---
Just ignore this subreddit. The game is perfectly healthy.
---
Can prot spec warrior do anything in pvp? I've never tried PvP before, joined a bg and felt so useless... People just cc me and run or straight out ignore me
---
But if every horde is getting the same boosted honor from AV it's like none of them are.. right now ranking up as ally is just as easy as horde because the honor is relative. Ally is just getting rep faster.
---
Thanks friend, best of luck to you!
---
Nah.  Alliance will always win because Horde are filled with just as many whiners who complain the second the game passes the five minute mark.  Horde can win AV just fine, they choose not to.
---
I am 29 with no wife or kids. Cant relate. Been straight neck bearding this shit since launch and loving every second of it. I am an deeper than I ever was then. Feels good man.
---
Just because someone puts it up for 2500g doesn't mean that's what it sells for. I bought mine for 40g.
---
It’s not. It’s another hidden re-roll. There’s a blue post about it.
---
&gt;So yeah as entirely predicted if you didn't have 2 days to spam AV and get exalted quickly, enjoy a long and painful crawl.
---
I can actually tell a difference on how it was compared to how it is now. When AVlaunched we had tanks and healers. Now I have run into situations where I could be the only healer and there are no tanks. So I suppose the rep grinders got the gear they needed and now its just dmg bois fighting dmg bois.
---
Yojamba is great
---
It's not that, it's just WoW made nationwide productivity to take a dive. Shit, I knew people who played at work instead of working.
---
It changes things a bit.
---
For Alliance, WSG premades are actually more efficient than AV, while for Horde AV is by far the most efficient.
---
and Details and TSM
---
It tickles my loins just thinking about the amount of hot-pocket scented steam that would be expelled from their waxy ears
---
Personally I would just do it normally unless my main was a mage. Getting in for aoe xp runs is better than boosting by far, normal runs are peobably easier doing normally
---
totally worth, i put a crusader on my ravager from 37 to 51 and i did big dick damage
---
If my memory serves me right; it’s only doable on NPCs
---
Does it though? I mean whens the last time he was in a successful movie? 10 year ago?
---
This show has always been a toxic shit show
---
Do you use shatter? And how many points in imp blizzard to pull off the ZF runs?
---
While tanks might be the only raid members strictly required to have fire resist gear, that doesn't mean none of your other group members have them.  Any class can have fire resist just to make themselves more likely to survive incidental fire damage they can't avoid or fire damage they take if something goes wrong, both of which can happen in any MC raid (or in Ony).
---
This is definitely working? Early comments when classic came out was that they were unlootable. You can loot your own dummies once they are killed or once they expire?
---
Repost but you ruined it
---
There are alliance playing efficiently though(either killing lieutenants in AV or WSG premades) and they are destroying the AV pug players.
---
Play the game as you see fit.
---
I will say - if you enjoy pvp as much as you sound like you do; it may be worth getting to 60 to be able to earn some of the cool pvp gear and what not from rankings.
---
Yeah i stopped reading there tbh.
---
&gt; as long as everyone is getting the same
---
But everyone isn't getting the same. Alliance WSG premades are crushing Alliance AV PUGs on honor.
---
Awesome was about to post this ha
---
Lol it also took us I forget exactly but enough UD strat runs for everyone in our usual 4 man to get revered with Argent dawn bedore the pimp hat dropped for our mage.
---
Are.. are you okay?
---
Alliance sociopaths never letting Horde win smh
---
Iceman bad
---
&gt; They will spend a good amount of time gathering up a huge list of people and then send out a ban wave right before the next phase drop.
---
Good joke. They'll do the same thing they always do when popular streamers break the rules; ignore it.
---
Most people were playing alliance cause of LOTR
---
So spending all my mana dispelling is an efficient use of mana?
---
10 healers is a lot and you'd be better served with 2-3 more dps
---
I optimized back then too. Google still worked and I am not dumb lol. This shit still happened folks.
---
Because you could farm much more if you didn’t waste all your time pvping? And there’s no sense in ganking lowbies
---
Sometimes there is aoe fire dmg from other mobs and it will help everyone if they don’t have the fire resist debuff

Rank bracketing is setting up an unofficial weekly cap of honour gained amongst your faction so no one is actually competing for r14, and all those participating will get a turn. If you ignore your servers bracketing agreement and exceed it they try to punish you like afk reporting, ban you/your whole guild from premades etc. it allows you to grind honor less and make the journey to r14 easier for everyone
---
To be fair no one knew you would teleport to the place you queued. What boggles my mind is Horde queue for 20 odd minutes just.. standing there. No mining, no roaming, theyre too scared to die and lose the queue pop, lol!
---
"I will have fun after" as they grind AV and then proceed to grind WSG rep.
---
They are on an endless cycle of "Have fun after" until they eventually burn out
---
So you’ll be exalted by Saturday ha. I’m impatient like you and halfway through  revered, trying not to get into that obsessed min/max mentality.
---
yeah they log relevant stuff, how long someone has been in a bg before receiving a report is not one of those things lmao
---
yes yes yes. you may have ran into me, i am teak the shadow priest
---
Don’t think it’s a visual bug tbh. Increased my pvpingn 5 fold this week and still lost standings due to this ( all my pvping was Monday/Tuesday
---
There’s clearly a difference between farming an area and mining nodes lol
---
I’m Chopsticks on the Ally side, I love our server. I ran into a tauren druid named Chopstick during launch week but never heard of them again :-(
---
GeForce experience does not allow you to point it to the new executable. So renaming the Wowclassic.exe to WoW.exe it is the only option until GeForce experience do an update.
---
didn’t* and your** at least use proper grammar if YOU’RE going to be an ass. See? That’s how it’s properly used.
---
They can either put effort into Classic+ and kill off a bunch of the core playerbase of WoW Classic or they can go on with TBC and take less chances.
---
One requires work, risk and investment the other is just a risk with half the work. Less advertising needed etc.
---
I’m just saying they arent likely going on to classic plus. If they do i’d be surprised (and out but i’m a man of my word so not a threat haha)
---
That's not even true at all
---
Except they're not.
---
The only people who will be playing it in a few weeks are gonna be the hardcore rankers, if you thought it was toxic now then just wait until then
---
honestly no, the community is to blame. No matter what a dev does it’s almost impossible to engineer around this many individual actors. Sometimes the best medicine is letting a population learn the hard way. It’s like telling the dumb kid not to touch the stove top cause it’s hot, sometimes they just wont learn until they burn themselves. This is what the community is doing, it just hasn’t learned to let go of the stove top yet. If you farmed one faction of your server into transferring off well live with your mistakes, welcome to life. Don’t like it? Re roll on a different server and try to learn where you went wrong last time.
---
Cant train weapon skill on players, but you dont need it on players either. Even with 1 you Will hit as if you had 300
---
Doesn't matter if its very likely that those people you mention abused it. I even agree. But that doesn't matter. They have to prove it. No company is going to take such a huge action without real evidence. Thats just logic.
---
Most people that raid should have these by now. It was established pretty early that they are absurdly common in classic.
---
You all click at same time then type/say your bg numbers, repeat until you are in same one.
---
When I played WC for my guild, I ran [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/230001--05350233132351351) spec 24/7 for raids, pvp, and for farming.
---
I wanted to have the option for both Blizzard farminig and CoC kiting since I use both, but you can efficiently do the main farms (DME Lashers/Satyrs and ZF Zombies) without Imp Blizz if you wanted to drop it entirely in favor of more clearcasting points. I wouldn't really drop shatter because doing so severely gimps your ability pump out burst damage in PvP.
---
You can always chose to lvl if you get tired of it 😊
---
If it was a 15 minute game, there was no BoK group in it.
---
&gt; So turns out that given the chance  *to actually have a 1v1 and not get killed by a group of 15 horde* you are no different from them.
---
Now I can afk honor farm, gj guys
---
Thats a really long way of saying "it depends".
---
Black dragonscale are BIS if you have 3-set and do not have Rank 10 pvp gear.
---
The amount of time played per person makes a huge difference. Sure if someone is grinding it 16 hours a day like you, youre competing. But the numbers of people going that far isnt much. Its the best honor farm that there is period.
---
It's not "mostly the community". Blizzard REFUSED to offer more server on launch day, something that anyone with half a brain said was going to be a massive mistake and GUESS WHAT, IT WAS. Yelling at people who refused to leave a server that all their friends are on is pretty dumb too. Layering was always going to be abused by sweaty try-hards. I, personally, just accepted it as a feature of classic and learned to live with it.   
---
Blizzard has provided close to ZERO support for classic. It's pretty apparent. I personally know people who have characters on the populated servers who have bought well over 30k gold without raising any red flags from Blizzard.    
---
Both the players and Blizzard share blame for whatever "issues" are currently in classic, but Blizzard is just as unwilling to address them as the community, if not more.
---
I'm almost never nonstop casting heals.  At least not at the very beginning of a fight when I need totems dropped.  Instead of putting myself in gcd hell droppiung 3 totems, I cast then put myself in gcd with totem to give myself a second to think of next heal.  Of course ideally you'll pre-drop, but you don't always have that opportunity.
---
You haven't been outside and seen the real word lately have you scyy?
---
I’m not crying! You are crying!
---
Seen several epics drop but so far i've won 1 random greenie and a 16 slot bag. Could have been worse!
---
No gorels allowed!!
---
I get the kill on a druid 100% of the time as a warrior.
---
The only thing that matters is hair style and color and then skin color. Thats all you really see anyway.
---
I think it's funny how much horde camp alliance at FPs for "The Honor Grind" but have any problem at all with this. If you wanted fair pvp maybe you'd go for fair fights in wpvp.
---
I have a sneaking suspicion that you don't know how to place your commas correctly.
---
That's good because the reporting system never did that in Vanilla. When they implemented it, it put a debuff on you that you needed to remove.
---
Just wish the people who sit in the cave and do fishing in the AV pond get rightfully booted. They are equally as scummy as the groups who mass report people who aren't AFK.
---
Those archers hit like a truck and had twice the range in the original AV.  Going around them lead you to mind fields, sounds like you never played the early version of AV.
---
This subreddit has devolved into the biggest cringefest I've ever seen in my life
---
This is the post that finally convinced me to unsub from /r/classicwow
---
Grats
---
Rep is better than honor...
---
The AVs I've been doing all day have been massive PvP shitfests. Maybe it's different on US and EU but on OCE most AVs turn into either horde or alli turtling and just running at each other in waves as they respawn. It's brainless PvP but it's PvP nonetheless.
---
No one likes it the way it is now. The only people that would say that are the ones that don't like AV and just want to rush to exalted for their epics so they can never run it again.
---
Yes, strafe spamming. Any guide on that? I don't know how it got popularized...still can't find info on it using 'strafe spamming'
---
You can't compare horde to alliance. Horse are only compared to horde. So yes they got more honor than alliance.  But they got the same as the other horde.
---
No, but thanks for the reply \^\_\^
---
Every tiebreaker I've seen has been the last roller. It's kinda awful if ties are not decided with an invisible roll but always with the last person to roll.
---
It's only 2 hours of farming per week to cover respecs
---
One or two in the fields of strife too
---
Yeah more horde are going on D and wiping the alliance zerg over time. It results in longer games but horde generally wins when the initial ally zerg fails.
---
You didn’t call anyone out, this isn’t some type of peer reviewed discussion where we are citing sources and data. It takes common sense to understand that if x number of people feel the system is bad, yet the posts are always downvoted and disagreed with, that the number of people who feel the opposite is equal to or greater than x. You’re just ignorant.

Im on Pagle US PvE, the server is still populated but it seems by only 60s, it feels co pletely dead pre-60 now, can spend hours looking for dungeon groups at low levels and you'll never find one, nor any questing partners. It's caused my alts leveling speed to slow to a crawl.
---
Fucking blizzard with their marriage and kids.....
---
Lol, I'm just not a socialist who hates successful people like so many here on reddit.
---
Couldn't you also select a specific battleground instead of first available?
---
You would likely have a longer wait though
---
A large number of people like it the way it is now. You have no idea what you are talking about.
---
Not in my country :(
---
Shit happens I take my ass whooping. I didn't roll on a pvp server thinking I would win 100% of the time.
---
You do you man. Just make sure to look up your best in slot for the bracket your staying in so you can get whatever bop  items you need from dungeons/quests before you risk out leveling the lvl you’re staying at. Might have to make an alt to farm gold for whatever boe’s you need.
---
AAnyone have a good 39 rogue twink gear list?
---
That awkward moment when you've spent an average of 60% of every hour (not every waking hour, literally every hour) for the past 109 days in game playing World of Warcraft.
---
It's because once horde starts turtling, all the alliance just leave anyway. Such a waste of time. And everyone knows first week or two is rep&gt; honor. And then you start honor farming.
---
You're competing with WSG premades and Alliance groups that do push for 3k honour.
---
If someone in my guild charged guildies for crafts, they would no longer be in my guild.

Just ignore his rant, they won't change it anyway.  And even if they did, he'd probably still complain about something else.

---
We don't have posts like this happening either. Unless of course you meant like on the official wow forum where the stickied threads announcing 1.12 got like 100 hearts and the ones that were not stickied asking for earlier version got 400+?
---
Viskag is BiS sword period so it's obviously a good choice...IF you can get it.  Don't use daggers for Hemo, it's terrible.
---
I mistyped, in the prev sentence I was talking about rep
---
It's not a good analogy. Blizz has always had PvP/Dev issues here. 
---
It's like getting a high five from your mate everytime you punch your wife.
---
It's bad, but cops don't arrest you or care. After she leaves you just get a new one. 
---
There's not a really a system in game to have players "learn from their mistakes etc." It's designed to maximize their rewards as they reap. Actually encourages it lol. It was literally the last thing they cared about back then. Blizz was very much anti-pvp (Hence why the game has terrible pvp) and it was begrudgingly in the game and balanced even less. 
---
Most of the PvP happened when arenas came out. 
---
It's not impossible to engineer a game around (this many) players. That's silly. It would be impossible for Blizz to commit any more dev resources than they historically like to though. We've also heard management's opinions on classic wow (trash).
---
Yeah but you’re a rogue so you’re about 60% as annoying. If you’re undead make it 90%
---
I’ve heard frostbite can proc on rag and trigger shatters, so deep frost is more competitive on that fight. Normally, though, arcane definitely wins.
---
The decay was the most stupid thing in the system. It was really harsh, just a flat -20% of current rank points each week. There would be a lot of ways you can improve the system while still having a really difficult and long grind, without the system being very punishing.
---
I'm the complete opposite it's hard to enjoy my 15" laptop screen when I have a 27" that can show so much more information at higher density.
---
Ranking up as Ally is harder because you have to compete with WSG premades and Ally groups that go against the meta to push 3k honour.
---
Unless you're doing one of those things, you're falling behind as Ally.

---
I mean it's not wrong info for any alliance browsing though.
---
Whatever you say.
---
You misunderstand. Alliance only getting 900 honour from AV puts them behind the Alliance groups running WSG premades.
---
Thanks and cool idea 😉
---
I've passed on a few upgrades because other people were really desperate for the drops. On their tenth+ run, it's the only reason they're there whereas I know I'm going to be back there again.
---
This is when a rogue is your best friend. Of course teamwork is best, but in this situation, the continual moving target is best dealt with in melee combat, and you're best off with a rogue for this. They're best suited to rooting out these nuisances, by a long shot. Sometimes all they need is opportunity - if you can set that up for them, a good rogue will optimize their chances and return the flag again and again.
---
Many thanks 😊👍
---
yup and another thing was when asmon cried about how advertise bullied him and "streamsnipeed" him even tho its really easy to spot someone  very popular without going into there stream.
---
But it's not the same, that's the point. Alliance WSG premades are getting much more honour than Alliance AV.
---
t. faction that spent an entire month hiding in capital cities
---
Jokerd first lvl 60 speedrun and first Method Contract speedrun
---
Explain where hes wrong and form a real argument. The retail pvp system requires you to outplay and beat opponents to climb the ladder. Classic requies you to have more free time than your opponents.
---
Your early levels can be knocked out pretty easily, I don’t think I’d reroll (unless you wanted to quest with him in the early days).
---
Its been out for 2days. lol If thats your "data" then my original stance of you pulling it out of thin air def stands
---
Then stay inside?  Seems pretty simple to me.
---
Those same people won't even bother queueing after they hit exalted, they just like the way it is for fast and easy rep.
---
I assume you're talking about melee players strafing side to side really fast? If so, there a couple reasons people do this that I can think of. It makes you slightly less predictable, it gives casters a harder time to cast directional spells on you (if you're doing the movement through them), it keeps your fingers warm and active, and it just feels good to do for some people.
---
Hanlon's razor. "Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity"  
---
Some people aren't out to get anyone. They're just stupid.
---
No it wouldn't. 60s would still be incentivised to kill sub-60s because sub-60s could still help their 60 mates kill opposing 60s. You would have to make them dishonorable kills, and doing so opens up a brand new world of grieving opportunities, so it won't work. You would have to implement a more recent iteration of honour system? I'm not sure.
---
/2 LF LADS.
---
Not what I meant but thanks for the reply.
---
Yeah, exactly. I feel like 1-60 and everything once at the start is the best experience. All down hill after that with the end game loop.   
---
Made 2 60s, Ran all the content, hung out, burnt out. End game probably feels a lot more bearable to newer gamers. Everything is very easy, just very time intensive.   
---
I watched some retail vids and oof, feels like they took this formula and distilled it into it's purest longest drink of grinds at times. Classic is def the original Coke. Tastes the best.
---
Thats fucking insanity
---
That’s my approach. 100g to respect and 70-100g for a flask. All in, 3-4 hours of ZF farming each week to support my raiding habit.
---
After doing my inspection of this picture, I can confirm that it was indeed taken on a Tuesday.
---
Don't be a cunt
---
That doesn't work. Tried that and it still treated us as having selected first available.
---
Sweet, this is exactly what I wanted. Not like it's much of a difference between actually 'playing' AV.
---
Pinter would be ashamed. You call that a dramatic pause? Get that pause pregnant!
---
Guys, it was exactly like this back in 2006...
---
It's remarkably faithful!
---
I dont see flairs on this subreddit,
---
Once again, you are bitching and whining after 2 days and have no data. Your arguments are trash
---
booooooooooooo
---
You can do ZF runs without blizzard doing a CoC method
---
roll pve if you can't handle pvp on a pvp server
---
volume 2 is in production!  🛠
---
you're an idiot, it doesn't matter how much honor you get if everyone else is getting the same amount as you lmao. Honor is faction exclusive, horde getting more honor doesn't affect the alliance at all. we get relatively the same honor gains as you + way faster rep grind.
---
&gt;You would have to make them dishonorable kills
---
No you wouldnt, cause players dont give DKs at all.
---
So then dont log in.
---
It's gonna drop off hard next week.
---
wait what???? My queues are instant.
---
Prot warriors are awful at flag carrying. 0 self-peels and 0 mobility.
---
What we do is "321,queue", we all say what bg popped (eg AV 259) and we go there. 
---
If there are multiple, we leave and re-queue.
---
Wow, I've noticed this as well. It's insane! Anyone not arugal is scum apparently
---
Well it's America, people are a lot more caring about friends then Sweden at least
---
Not exactly fast but its nearly 0 effort, can just watch shit on a second monitor far more relaxed than questing or grinding. You'll also get a ton of rep, getting you close to having the exalted rep items available immediately available at 60, including the 640g epic mount.
---
horde mad
---
Yojambros fo life!!!
---
It was Blizzard ignoring players when told that blanket is dangerously close to the fireplace and then Blizzard doing something once the house was on fire.
---
Cuz sword spec is OP and will win you fights you have no business winning
---
This sounds like my own personal hell. Glad you guys are getting things done and enjoying the game, but your description literally made me uncomfortable.
---
I hope once they finish their AV rep grind, they start destroying your major cities again.
---
impossible to be camped for 3 hours and have no pvp in bgs one or the other.

Reading is only as useful as the writer is coherent.

That’s wholesome af!

---
Some people also don't like those who try to defend. I came late to an AV (horde) and my team was  heading to the Alliance bridge. Instead of running up, I went to base to defend the towers that were being capped and a small team defending Drek's gy.
---
People in the north group wanted to report everyone botside while I killed a rogue hiding in one tower and capped both towers again solo while the group defending the gy cleared out the Alliance there and retook the gy.
---
People are just ridiculous and abusing whatever they can to fit their preferred strategy. Not much we can do at this point but suffer the abuse.
---
You did. You literally suggested they change the system. Surely you aren’t so thick headed to recommend that change because you think your own opinion is enough to make that type of decision.
---
I’ve had crazy good success with 8-10 playing D at Drek and 30 pushing Bel and then for Van.
---
35 x .344 = \~12 dps
---
Definitely fair, and most people are decent enough to be chill as they can despite being frustrated. But there are a lot of folks in AVs right now, so if you’re queuing for multiple you’re bound to strike an asshole at some point.
---
Yeah just because you can log in and not get immediatlely camped for a hour straight doesnt mean we cant have fun right..... right?
---
Yes, but this is the ONLY case
---
we were REALLY good at defending our flag carriers
---
Ok boomer.
---
Start playing the same.
---
how you don't have a billion up votes is a reflection of how f'd up this subreddit is. I can't believe they put this garbage version of AV into the game. I miss the trolls, the war riders, collecting the enemy parts. This AV feels hollow.
---
We need gnome druids. I wanna be a tiny kitty
---
Emotions are weird, especially grief. I don't think I cried around any of my friends after my dad passed (did get choked up a lot) and it wasn't because I was trying to be cool or macho or anything, but rather I just felt like I was already such a burden and didn't want to add to that.
---
I think it was probably a year and a half or so before I cried in front of someone else, and it was mostly because I was pretty (very) hammered at the time and my gf was hugging me and I just kinda broke down and sobbed like a baby for a good while.
---
Grief really fucks you up, and in ways that you don't even expect. It's truly a horrible thing.
---
You literally had it right with a ratio and then went and fucked it up by including your second sentence.
---
Niccce
---
If you want to solo DM E in mostly greens it’s going to be difficult. Your damage won’t be great and your survivability won’t be great either. Meaning it’ll take longer to kill the necessary bosses as well as have less room for error. If you cheese both bosses with the method that makes them run back and forth and get your timing and precision down, it should be doable with greens/blues. I’d honesty get some better gear first tho, will make farming DM E a lot easier
---
I said how to fix current Zerg as a suggestion. Ive never once claimed that "people like this Av better" like you did nor have i said for sure that people like another Av better.
---
Are you actually pretending to not be able to follow the conversation? You're literally the only person here trying to talk on behalf of the majority here, and you did so after admitting you didnt have an ounce of data to support what you claimed.
---
What a joke man.  Grow up.
---
I'm actually suprised that Gehennas people are pretty decently behaved from what I've seen, considering it's "that" server in the EU. And I played like 30 hours since AV release, so my sample size is pretty good.
---
Most AFK spams from premades etc we’re done as people zoned in. Kind of easy to spot the abuse.
---
Do like the concert ticket re-sellers: "I buy a lvl 5 gery item for 500g"
---
I don't see why you couldn't just give them the gold
---
Yeah, I definitely think you’re right. 90%+ of the folks I run into in game, whether they’re the kind of player I group with or not, is generally pleasant. I’ve only even seen this myself once, so I think most people don’t do it, but when it happens folks will hear about it, and they also won’t hear when an AV goes off without an abuse like this.
---
 Maybe im misinformed or sth but during my playtime I couldn’t stealth when in combat.
---
That's nostalgic as fuck lol, it was super common to see that in vanilla. I fell for it the first time I saw it because I didn't even know you could have a message after AFK or DND status.
---
idk.  I took almost an entire week off during holidays as well.
---
And send them back to neutral with Stormpike/Frostwolf :D
---
All pugs I joined yesterday did galv + lieutenants first, then went to drek. 9/10 Wins still.
---
And what? Played 38 hours a day?
---
Son born yesterday, this is good to hear lol
---
Except they do. The BG times are logged, the instance IDs are logged, the time the reports are filed are logged.
---
Sounds to me like you’re worried about repercussions to being a dick in BGs.
---
this is a reason i chose this class tbh lol
---
How? Explain your thoughts, I am not a mindreader.
---
Still cant believe they made azsharite the mechanic of BfA
---
Alexa play - 'Alvin Lee - The Bluest Blues'
---
Why do they buff the bosses in the Korraks Revenge version of AV, which is supposed to be an older version of it?
---
&gt;&gt;What'd he do?
---
&gt;Reported.
---
I didn't even know about it (my first real time playing) and was stressing out being lvl 40 with 11g to my name
---
Every single AV I’ve played, which have been multiple every day since it dropped, has been either a zerg or a turtle infected with people complaining about it being a turtle and calling people idiots. But go ahead and make a shallow attempt to debase my point.
---
Use: Aspect of the Hawk for ranged AP. Aspect of the Monkey for dodge. Aspect of the Cheetah for increased movement speed unless attacked in which case you will be placed into an infinite daze.
---
Grats! The kids don’t do much first six months since they don’t move around.

You’re literally the dumbest fucking person who has been active on this sub today. Blocking you so I never have to encounter this dumb shit again.
---
haha nice! the 100% one is about 4-600 at most gold
---
They do this like this on their discords mostly.  If it's on stream it can get clipped so they just do it "secretly" in their public discords.
---
Dont let the door hit you on the way out. Thanks
---
it doesnt work like that.
---
I put my phone in the bottom right corner of my laptop,then plug it in to a USB port on the laptop .
---
Do you go afk a lot? Please tell me you go afk a lot
---
but...nochanges?
---
or just fuck it and buy the MC bracers
---
Yeah, that is way less than what I get from AV as ally but also a fair bit more than anyone got from world pvp on ally side on my server. Yesterday I got an average of 25,4k honor per hour in AV.
---
Those keybinds 😐
---
I feel a liiiiittle bad though? Ive been playing a ton since launch and Ive lost a total of 3 games. The rest has been a smooth cruise to nearly exalted. I stopped earlier when I realized that when I cash in all the marks that are in my mailbox Ill probably be exalted. That was what...3 days?
---
It seems like the Horde really are taking it up the rear on this one. I guess you win some you lose some.
---
Good hunting!
---
Or you just have them do the AVs for you
---
In vanilla I had some RL friends who "twinked" my first ever character. I started a warrior after patch 1.9, and they ran me through a ton of dungeons. At lvl 19 bracket, it was ok, but I was easily wiped off the playing map. This got my attention, though, and in 29's I began to find my way a little. 39 was where things really took off, and my warrior was beginning to be a lot of fun.
---
But at 49... that warrior was an absolute wrecking ball. I had been run through a ton of stuff, had all blues and some BoE epics they gave me. I went DW fury, and nobody saw it coming. That guy was so geared I could nearly 1-shot most non-twink players. I remember charging into a group of horde on a flag in AB, and killing three before they brought me down - a few alliance saw it, and after that I got myself a pocket healer, instantly becoming un-killable. We wrecked the horde so bad we camped them on their own graveyard - something I had experienced facing horde twink teams, but never having done to them myself. It was so much fun I played at that level for a couple months, and I now wish I never leveled after that. It was amazing.
---
&gt; you aren't getting it, your pug is rushing drek, other alliance are in premades getting max honor, so you are losing to those people.
---
Alliance pugs arent doing that anymore. All day today we have gathered all LTs and burned them down THEN still killed Drek. We are getting the wins and the honor on alliance, and in record time.
---
There aren't any downsides for us anymore.
---
Yeah but everyone is not getting the same amount as you lol.
---
There are Alliance WSG premades that get way more honour and Alliance AV groups that push for 3k honour instead of the usual 800 or so.
---
Bit of a noob when it comes to hunter pets. Unless they are less complicated than I give them credit for. Mostly concerned I won't reach max loyalty on broken tooth between lvl 37 and 39. But I might be overestimating how much xp that takes. 
---
I know the attack speed isn't as great but I'm thinking of keeping my durotar tiger. (It's still pretty decent at 1.3)
---
Don’t hand in the one off quests until Revered. At Revered you stop getting 5 rep per lueitentant kill. 
---
Also, if you are grinding it out in a few days, try to hold as many Neck rewards as you can before turning those in. They are unique (20), but extras get mailed to you for 24 hours. 
---
Lastly, anyone who hands in blood, armor etc gets rep for the whole team, so as long as someone is doing it, more rep per game for all.
---
305 cap zone, same as Feralas
---
I kinda miss wpvp. Seeing all the same names on the regular. Same people at the top. Same enemies. Knowing who's probably with them. That was kinda fun. Made it feel like I know that guy. 
---
Wpvp was a short window of time that will be missed. For the balanced servers anyways.
---
Even though the community could stop being assholes its simpler to just fix things like this by not allowing it to be possible.  
---
I feel thats true for 90% of these its not blizzard fault its us.
---
Also i read it did not even used to work like this in vanilla, if you were reported for afk you would simply not gain rep and honor. I think premade would stop griefing with a system like this cause it would be way less effective. A few ppl leaving but a tons more just giving you shit all game and reporting you.
---
Aha yeah maybe
---
Exactly, the alliance meta has completely changed since day 1. We kill all LTs now and still rush down Drek. 
---
Win win.
---
Yeah that is pretty much what happens aha
---
Yeah uh, if you have no friends I guess.
---
Dang, I wish I knew this earlier, I hit revered not 3 minutes ago.  :(
---
Yeah I mean PVE. If I can get 9% hit without edgemasters would 2h fury still be preferable? PvP I’ll go arms for sure :)
---
Bit of bias here, but classic for sure. It’s got character and depth for days, a lot of fun to play. Community issues are real, but very exaggerated and mostly it’ll be a minor annoyance when you’re playing, if that.
---
Hordes honor per hour is irrelevent to anyone but the horde. Alliance doesn't compete against horde for ranks. Bragging about the 3k honor doesnt mean anything to Alliance because they arent competing with you for honor, the people you are playing with are.
---
Stalemate on the horde side.
---
As a rogue, I’m enjoying spinning my big wheel on a high pop PVP server
---
Alliance are still salty about Horde PvP that's why lol. They can't admit when they're losing out.
---
DO pass galv, do not collect honor
---
A solution [https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e959w6/more\_pvp\_in\_alterac\_valley/](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e959w6/more_pvp_in_alterac_valley/)
---
Would people who like WSG for honor support it, or any other change?
---
I think teams in BGs should be balanced based on gear, which would give PUGs more of a chance, but that's a separate change.
---
An individual can influence AV, at least non-rush AV. Knowing which objectives to capture or defend. Even with rush AV, if you're Alliance you could probably help by going after lieutenants/captains etc.
---
I agree 1 should pick druid, that way you can tank al dungeons while you level. ( and its fast with travel speed) maybee skip the rogue for a shaman. So you can heal all dungeons while you level. ( also ghost wolf for faster travel speed )
---
Yea this is the best/easiest way since I was asking the same question a while ago. One click and you go it.
---
Yeah or if yr friends/guildies are busy or whatever. Feel like theres a lot of reason why ppl PUG.
---
Go db mirah
---
Which is why it's up to the game devs to obfuscate the "optimization path". The unique quality that MMOs have is that they have gated optimization behind the social aspect of the game.
---
For example, how is a player going to optimize his path towards looting the Dark Edge of Insanity? He can't rely on winning rolls. If you want the loot council to pick you for the axe, you gotta put in the effort helping the guild, contributing to raids, getting to know people and making friends. 
---
This is the magic bullet that resolves the novelty problem. Every human being you meet is a new "novelty". The game developers don't have to keep forking over cash to pump out more content. The players are the content.
---
Man that would be a steamroll for leveling. End game may be hard to find dungeon groups I feel though. Maybe not idk how many tanks/healers there are maybe they are flooded
---
WSG it may be worth while to go SL... if you are spamming AV as alliance then it is SM/Ruin
---
Picture in picture mode is available on a lot of streaming sites.
---
Here on europe old hatereds die when germans and russians meet or when chat is being filled with hebrew/greek. Seen many irish literaslly wanting brits out, quite nice to see.
---
Guess he had a type-o in his comment.  He's comparing alliance wsg premades which are getting far more honor than AVers.  There's not much difference on horde.  The solo horde pvper can actually be fairly competitive, just by doing more time.
---
Are you saying you wanna force this rogue to have sex with you?
---
How about you stick to 6 hour AVs and leave game design to Blizzard, okay buddy? Alright then.
---
1.12 was the standard on vanilla pservers. Ones like Nost, who were a part of classic being a thing. The community most definitely had a hand in 1.12. If it wasn't 1.12 all the pserver assholes would have flipped a collective shit, and we'd have what we have now, except with pre launch filled with massive amounts of bitching too.
---
Just wait for ally to quit and Horde realize that 30 minute long queue timers aren't worth the Honor per hour and go back to farming World PVP again.
---
That smile, that damn smile
---
We had tuesday in my guild. First time we see them though we got 2 eyes so far.
---
Well then thanks for supporting our community and more power to you learning English!
---
Yeah, realistically with the time it takes to Galv, we should still win np.
---
If you push for the extras in the way you need some serious DPS at the end
---
Usually takes a few times. Been watching prepares to do it last two days and it’s seems like 70%+ people  get on .
---
Really cool video. More of a Druid PvP trailer than an actual PvP video. Still really liked it
---
Im enjoying classic to! And i have been playing wow for 15 years none-casuelly. More power to you friend.
---
That really blows my mind. People make it seem like SP is all powerful. So by taking off 35 SP you lose that little DPS?!
---
Quality content lmfao
---
You should probably see a doctor then.
---
So much this! Mmo, now it feels like retail with soloplay
---
To transfer 1000g, just let them put 10x 100g auctions on AH and u buy them
---
Yeah they're really bad, you should hit me with some suggestions
---
Protec drek for more rep (and rek)
---
Try noggenfogger!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3GH5cWPFOE
---
I don't want to deny that this might be the case, but you compare the login screen with an ingame screenshot. Maybe it doesn't render the same way...
---
Also you compare a male human and a female NE. That should be the difference for holding position.
---
When do you learn? It's 15 years old game, ofc it's  boring and easy the way people minmax things these days.
---
Loyalty isn’t only based on experience. Just standing around while the pet is happy increases loyalty.
---
It's not. It's a known bug. People have been reporting it for awhile
---
yes and there are also horde premades getting more honor then the typical 1.3k or whatever the pugs are doing too,
---
so your argument is completely moot? lol
---
It was not an epic battle. Take off your fucking rose tinted glasses. 9/10 times AV was a AOE spamfest stalemate that lagged peoples PCs to death and was completely unplayable for melee unless they had a pocket healer available.
---
Yes...
---
It used to be (not sure now) that if your team had all the towers down and the other team none then you would have zero marshals. If you had none and the other team all then you had 8 marshals. With everything in between. So generally you always had to do marshals.
---
Your suggestions might end up making the horde start further back making it even easier for Alliance (like it is now) so best not take it further.

&gt; Lol, I'm just not a socialist who hates successful people like so many here on reddit.
---
I'm not a socialist either, but I've read enough about billionaires to know that psychopathy is a prerequisite for being one.  That is true whether you dislike wealthy people or not.
---
I would thought it then goes alphabetical on a name, seen a few of these and it's always been an alphabetical roll win. I'm not convinced that it's a numerical.
---
I thought so since the DPS increase is so minimal
---
You dont have to zerg tho? Go pick off people in mid like a roleplayer and have some fun
---
lol cross-server BGs was in Vanilla. It was fine. Also not sure what your server is like but on mine there is 100+ people at AV entrance in Alterac Mountains all day and night, plus every queue NPC in major cities are stacked too so people are seeing eachother all over the world...
---
wtb
---
People on pve and rp servers are quite nice. Its the elitists that rolled on pvp servers that sort of suck.
---
We want to clear as quickly as possible. We are interested in ranking on our server and overall. 
---
We are also trying to build a core of raiders who prove to be capable of raiding with full consumables and buffs. This is the best way to be sure our raiders are able to consistently obtain the buffs and maintain them through the raid.
---
practice makes perfect. I you master the technique with greens you will have really fast runs with epic/blue. :D Give it a try.
---
Drek rush still works like 75% of the time for me.  Honestly horde defending isn't even an issue.  It's the people just letting them pick people off is the problem.  I dismount on every given chance to shatter proc a horde in the face that tries to face check the zerg.
---
Theres like what? a ring or 2?
---
Wait it out.  
---
Just like everything, first it was the queues, than the P2 wPvP massacre... wait it out a week or two until tryhards get their hype down a bit and it will all be awesome, the way it's supposed to be.  
---
Patience is key.
---
I fucking wish this was how it went. Now all horde dumbasses do is turtle. You're getting less honor per hour, less rep per hour, and more than likely less fun per hour because you're standing around achieving fuck all without any good PvP.
---
This is the kind of content I live for. I hope this remains a cherished memory even after everyone moves on.
---
Alliance have instant queue
---
No you don’t, u get dunked on by my aimed shots.
---
How long were capital city battle masters NOT in vanilla? Like how many months of the whole xpac?
---
The dispells are needed, the trash can (nearly) 1 shot people with it. You are not healing but preventing dmg + saving buffs! Should be a group effort though
---
What do you mean 5/7 is perfect
---
Dude his post was satire. Lmao.
---
Let me guess , the guy is a warrior, a tank probably the MT ? Feels insecure ?
---
This. Will probably be somewhat better when the PvE:ers have reached exalted
---
I believe the Mask is still sliiightly better than the Eye, even with Hitcap but only on Horde tho.
---
But difference im dps is likd 2-3 atp
---
Maybe in 05 you cared less or had less info about the most efficient way, so you queued WSG and had fun. It was not all abiut WSG for honorfarmers in 05
---
I was acutally thinking whether there was a cap, like can you stack it above 100% :)
---
&gt;and the community has a massive amount of toxicity and elitism.   
---
Elitism?? Lmao. Never seen such nig crybabies as on this subreddit. Nothing "elite" about them.
---
Since frontstabbing isnt a thing you're right but he specifically said he preferred daggers so I was saying thathes already the best spec for his preference not that combat daggers was better than swords for leveling.
---
Addon for the minimap class circles?
---
Lel
---
Ok, I hope you see this comment. I think I’ve fixed my problem (No thanks to Blizzards idea that I should fix my network lag by changing a graphics setting). 
---
After spending hours going through every troubleshooting step I could find and having nothing work, here is what did it. I went into the network settings in game, and I unchecked the box for “Optimize Network for Speed.”
---
Yeah, it’s the dumbest fix ever. But it worked. No clue why.
---
Cry baby sub these days holy shit. People have been afk’ing in AV since the day it came out. Yes it sucks and it ruins it for others but it’s nothing new. Take a look at yourself and ask if you’re still enjoying this game. If you aren’t, maybe it’s time to let it go. If you are, then stop with the negative Nancy karma grabbing whine fest posts!
---
This
---
Except AV would be great if you're not in a premade because if you're pugging it'd probably be better honor than a long WSG game. Right now even if you're in a strong premade a 5 min 1500 WSG win is still worse than AV.
---
300 honor for that, no ty.
---
I can read it all just fine.  
---
This is like the blue dress/gold dress thing, only with dicks.
---
How long did it take you to get exalted after that?  I'm getting much less rep from games now.
---
wut
---
Why do you keep posting this
---
Yeah, even though convenient, it kinda took a lot out of the actual game when the random dungeon shit was introduced...
---
Thank the community for proving yet again that they can’t be trusted to manage themselves, instead using every possible opportunity to abuse and/or troll everybody.
---
Then people wonder why games just get more restrictive.
---
This, I either use my phone or a tablet.
---
But I can't really watch anything while playing, 90% of my focus will be on the game.
---
Noone is going to quit BfA like "PvP" where everyone just chasing the rewards, not trying to engage in even combat, because it slows down the farming of points.
---
Yes but people arent there just for honor.
---
Its a random group of 40 people, not everyone wants the same thing as you.
---
You can get 300 skill easily don't worry. I'm guessing you just meant since you're not human you lack the extra skill for PVE. You'll love that bad boy for PvP and 5 mans. With that said though you'll find 1H axes better for raiding. The only two handers that will beat them right now for raiding as an orc are Spinal Reaper and Obsidian Edged Blade.
---
Don't feel bad though about the TUF my friend. So many of us old school warriors of vanilla rocked that bad boy for the longest time. It was a right of passage to go from Ice Barbed Spear to TUF to Ashkandi for many in my guild.
---
What's broke with druids? I've got a level 30 alt, haven't noticed anything yet.
---
I mostly just listen to South Park episodes I have seen before,unless I’m doing something super mindless in game .
---
Anyone who recalls get murdered before their loading screen completes
---
Wish granted
---
Play wsg, ranks are boring time waste anyway. Go have fun in wsg.
---
A lot of early instance 5 mans are mess of aoe and threat. This stops around your lvl 40ish. Basically healers will start telling dps to stop aoe pulling just as much as tanks because elites will be start doing too much damage. 
---
  
---
In regards to defiance it is a must imo... eventually. Even the fastest wowlogs have warriors in defense stance/defiance/dancing but dual weilding. The threat modifiers is just too much.
---
Threat modifiers are multiplicative. 130% for defensive stance and 15% (defiance) is not 145 its 149.5% threat. If you are tanking in battle stance or berserker bc dps = threat per forums....you are actually at 80% threat. Flat difference of 70%.
---
&gt; AV is going to change in the next patch whether you like it or not.
---
Yeah, I dont think so.
---
lul
---
Don't give away your gold/stuff. 
---
You are getting back and you will regret giving away everything.
---
They’re probably working on their epic mount.
---
I don't think for every faction it's back to hometown
---
pretty hilarious though
---
community in 1.5 AV: there is too much Pve!!
---
Blizzard: Ok, 
---
Blizztard: releases 1.12 AV, now its 100% PvE.
---
Can I have your autograph
---
We have a badass over here.
---
Alexa, what is the print screen button for?

My guild is part of a coalition of guilds that work together for the kill. \&lt;Fury&gt; will spawn camp them often, but if they aren't camping them we'll generally get the kill unless we wipe or otherwise fuck ip as we tend to be faster on the scouting and summoning. My guild has gotten 2 pieces of world boss loot so far ([cold snap](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19130/cold-snap) and [empyrean demolisher](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17112/empyrean-demolisher)), so can't complain really. This is on Fairbanks
---
&gt; What if I told you we were playing a vanilla version of AV
---
I'd say youre wrong and have the data to back it up.. :D
---
When we kill you to get honor, you complain. When we let you live so we can get more honor, you complain.
---
❤️
---
Heals does not make you deal higher damage
---
If someone was walking around self healing for 600/5s in a BG it would ruin the fun of the game for everyone but that person so it should have been removed or never put in game at all.
---
Yet here they are, still camping fp's and inns.. hrmm it's like it wasn't about the honor or the rewards.. hrmm.. it's like they used it as an excuse to grief hrmmm.
---
Flamelash was pretty typical 60/40 before alliance packed things and left though.

It was at least 12. Unless we're pretending EU doesn't exist. [https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/45367-new-wow-classic-realms-opening-august-26th/](https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/45367-new-wow-classic-realms-opening-august-26th/)

We all live in Amerika, right?

Beta plebs only do what twitch players do, which will always be new content.  Large scale World PvP is mostly dead unless it's a world boss to fight over now.
---
Don’t, me and my horde guild mates are 1000/1000 exalted as of tonight. I’ve got 20 marks in my inv and 60 that expire sometime tomorrow in my mailbox in case it’s an AV weekend. 300k honor in 3 days. Not stressing the L’s as I’ve got my tome.
---
I say 3 weeks of ban time, but spread out to be every other week.
---
Maybe if you use a potato for a pc
---
&gt;I understand the players I described are in the minority
---
They are not the minority though unfortunately.. i played 5 rounds of AV and the longest one took about 20 mins.. nobody wants to play objectives, people start the BG shouting "GROUPS 1-4 DREK, 4-8 BLA.."
---
It's exactly like retail lol..
---
I assume people are also there for rep, which you also get for doing Galv.
---
The other reason would be fum and I really hope that's the main reason people are there. Rushing Drek is surely fun for a very narrow demographic
---
I’m sad that your time is worth so little you’d rather waste two hours, every week, to be BiS at all costs.
---
GaLv GiVeS No hOnOr Or ReP, AuTo LoSe BeCaUsE yOu DiD gAlV

Marks in the mailbox?
---
Imagine your boss: 
---
"Yeah you earn 15 dollah an hour but ima pay you 10. I mean, its basically the same salary accoring to doom-bap"
---
Isn't that restricted to real life winter months?
---
A shield is useful on big pulls. Smaller pulls can always be tanked without a shield.
---
Also, spec isn't a big deal if you got decent gear.
---
god bless that guild that is prioritizing mages and locks for staff of dom. dear god please dont give it to a druid.
---
It's the easiest matchup for druids by far, I've died to a few warriors using restorative potion - but mostly because of me recognizing it way too late.   
---
If i duel a warrior, I always let them get the charge opener because of how bad it's for them. Still I think it's basically unwinnable for a warr that isn't gnome or using thinks like fap and restorative or spider belt.   
---
5k hp balance/NS druid here, I duel a lot.  
---
Are you not lvl 60 yet or maybe you're dueling feral druids?
---
This, my fellow comrades, is what happens when some guy plays SIMS too much and is than introduced to WoW.
---
Alot of servers are dead on one sides so cross realm was a no brainer
---
So servers triple the size of the original caps weren't a fuck up?
---
Allowing people to trade gold from retail to classic wasn't a fuck up?
---
Going mostly silent on class altering bugs that have been around since the beta wasn't a fuck up?
---
Honor before BGs on servers with the massive population wasn't a fuck up?
---
There are plenty of mistakes to go around. Trying to say that blizzard is innocent in this is just wrong. The community is responsible for its actions, but blizzard is responsible for enabling all of it with prior mistakes.
---
My experience as horde so far is losing AV but we make 3k honor compared to the alliance 1k honor. This is the average anyway. Fine by me.
---
Go seek, defend, get a turtle....
---
In another guild. On another server.
---
Every game (5) I played today horde won due to strong defense, get stuffed fuckboi
---
They sent to your mailbox if you have 20 in inventory
---
Actually, going super technical about something not meant in that way is incredibly moronic. Ofc they can just ban at their discretion. But they wont, because thats incredibly stupid. I dont even know why i bother replying to people like you.
---
Horde makes strat against this, killing the 60% guys (40% or raid usually). Cutoff in middle ish
---
I donated the gold cap worth of gold to my guild before quitting. I popped in afterwards when there was a return event during Cataclysm and saw on Armory that they kept me in guild, as honorary member. Flew around for a few hours through the barrens, and joined a WSG to faceroll some guys, but quit knowing I didn't like the direction the game went.
---
I did give my account info to little brother and a coworker, whose friend stripped my alts of valuables.
---
Flow it to them in small amounts like a laundering scheme
---
I see you can fish in AV, is there good stuff to catch during a long turtle?
---
This has to be a troll. I dont believe anyone is stupid enough to do any of the things mentioned in this post.
---
people who play like you and your group are the bane of my existence
---
&gt; If only you could have it for shaman tanking
---
Shaman raid tanks produce very good threat, actually almost on par with feral druids.
---
This. On the first day my guild made a group and we played WSG for like 12h straight. I made like 80k honour. We won 30:0 and never lost a flag and finished most bgs with around 6-10minutes.
---
I actually deranked that day. I didn't even get enough honour to battle my decay.
---
I mean, half the reason I go back and defend is too piss off the spergs. You seem like a sperg.
---
A social in my guild didn’t get a spot in MC on Wednesday and joined a PUG instead - and won the fucking bindings on a roll. That poor guy is cursed now. Will he ever get the second binding and can he ever scramble together the mats?
---
Sometimes I wonder if you guys even play the game. You CANNOT KICK ANYBODY before the gate opens or the game starts. I see so many of you claiming otherwise when it's blatantly wrong. Go ingame and try it yourself.
---
More than WHO? U need to understand that horde dont compete with alliance for ranks, if everyone in raid getting 3k honor, its the same as if everyone get 1k
---
Some people actually enjoyed old school AV's.
---
The stick should spell "horde" and it would be correct.
---
No he didn't... J.A. Brack said that because he thought the inconveniences in the game were too frustrating. Running to dungeons, slow levelling, etc.
---
He was right, we thought we did but we didn't, but he was right for the wrong reasons. Gaming, and in particularly the gaming community, has fundamentally changed. Hypercompetitiveness causes overly zealous min-maxing. Anyone who doesn't have fun like you is a stupid asshole who doesn't know how to play.
---
I believe this is part of the reason that minecraft is making a comeback. It's just a chill experience where you can just play with friends, and it takes you far away from all this toxicity that is omnipresent in gaming today, at least on private servers...
---
Dont tell him:D
---
Lol its lame when people are so toxic about AV... We all want rep and honor. Just have some fuckin fun its been 3 days lmfao. Shitty to hear you got chat banned man
---
Yeah tonight was strange, think I lost 2-3 games outta about 10.
---
He said “only people with huge dicks can read this”.
---
It’s the only way horde wins.
---
I won 6 games back to back yesterday by abusing my fellow hordes in /BG to come defence.
---
The ally’s will rush faster, u can’t beat that map design. But if you slow their offence, and wipe them. They respawn and your offence get time to kill boss.
---
OMG YOU JUST REMINDED ME
---
Yesterday after my MC raid just before bedtime I saw someone asking to deathroll in Chat.
---
I did a couple of rolls with him and won 300g xD Then I went offline and he was probably quite pissed :P
---
Can't wait to get home and spend all my hard "earned" Money on epic weapons for my rogue ;3
---
I mean there are still going to be ally groups smarter than the average ally... U are competing with them...
---
I dont have it on my phone and i didnt want to google something you could google yourself.
---
Majority may have realizey that honor/Ranks fon't matter. 
---
&gt;90% will never get any epics from rank, so why bother? Rep grind is all that matters.
---
It ends in like feb or march i think
---
I do it all the time and manage to get in the room most the time, especially if they have the Marshalls pulled out and everyone is focusing them
---
Look at the tier 3 belts, when you're wearing a tabard. They're hilariously broken.
---
It's true that a lot of realms are Horde leaned, but I still think a more cautious approach with introducing cross realm would have been beneficial. Now we will never know how bad the queues for unbalanced realms would have been without cross realm. And we will never know how few cross realm connections for those realms were needed to reduce queue times sufficiently.
---
Alliance are losing out by getting less honour than WSG premades and other Ally groups that push for more honour in AV instead of just getting quick rep.
---
No, 90% of the players are not competing with anyone. Let the 10% worry about that

Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you."
---
I think the heated alliance hit exalted already.
---
That smile... _that damn smile._
---
&gt; Holy Smite/Heals works nearly optimally for raiding while also allowing much smoother solo grinds.
---
However, smite spec is the optimised dps spec for a damage dealing priest.
---
Distract cancels auto run/afk run. The player must be pressing W.
---
He’s not entirely wrong though. The top honor farmer this week on my server is currently a Scout.
---
32 and out of energy to stay up late? Someone needs to see a doctor.
---
But hey, don't be unreasonable now! This small indie company would financially collapse if they provided this relative simple service that they used to provide some 15 years ago, when they were significantly smaller!
---
Av also had multiple different versions with the one we got being the worst and xrealm was only added in 1.12 near the very end making it way harder to snipe same games with friends but yeah lets pick and choose everything arbitrarily and make garbage decisions
---
Did you actually read the post?
---
They’re just working off a preset list without thinking for themselves. 
---
It’s just like when you call Apple and tell them your phone already has the latest update and that you already restarted. 
---
2 seconds later: ” OK sir I’m going to need you to install the latest update and restart - have you done that yet?”

my retail guild. made a spreedsheet picked the faction and side. i was gonna play horde but i wanted to play with them. i had work they day classice came out(they all started at midnight) when i got online they were allready lvl 10. and when i got to 14-15 they had done deadmines. and decide that was egough for classic and went back to retail. i kept playing classic there was on guy who join the guild i join randomly. from my retail guild. at 42 he whisper me that he was gonna overtake me. and then he never logged in again. but i never group with any off my retail guild in classic. now am a officer in my guild and is about to go to a officer lan today. the people you start with is rarely the people you finish with, my retail guild was mostly reallife friends where was i childhood friend with 1 of them. help people in your guild go on discord. its surprisly easy make really good new friends in classic. as long you make the effort
---
The matches are 6-7m
---
If you're only interested in rep then sure but if you're trying to rank it's much better to get more honour obviously.
---
Dwane hangs em high Trihard
---
So how sad is your life?
---
How wide did you spread those cheeks? Prolly never won an AV.
---
It’s not a proc tho, its a passive.....
---
If you're frost, you ALWAYS take the reduced casting time on Frost Bolt. IT reduces the higher ranks for 16% extra damage on single targets, AND it reduces rank 1 from 1.5 seconds to 1 seconds, which is a huge benefit if you need to slow a single mob. Technically, you never need rank 1 frost bolt, and never need to use max rank frost bolt when aoe farming, but the general utility is huge.
---
If you respec fire for pvp, your raid performance will suffer a lot, and respeccing for raids seems fair, but if you're not playing 50+ hours a week, just compromise a bit on a few talents and don't respec.
---
have a great time m8!
---
Enjoy your journey and remember. As soon as there is something you don't 100% agree with please come and make a rant post on Reddit. 
---
We love those :P
---
Good luck killing that filthy Horde scum!
---
Calamitous Intent, same super amazing guild that camped Org for way too long before BG’s and made the faction imbalance even worse.
---
Lol blizzard don't even ban ppl buying gold from actual gold sellers. You will be fine
---
I still think it is result of esports culture, just not the professionals themselves. People see esports and think "wow that's cool these people are so good!" and then turn around and try and improve their own skillset. What they don't know is why these profesionnals are so good, and just min-max in whatever way they can, even at the expense of fun.
---
I see this in dota 2 all the time... I hate metajunkies and often when I get berated for picking off-meta heroes, I ask then why these heroes are off-meta. 
---
"because pros don't pick them". 
---
Yeah but why? 
---
"because they suck"
---
Ok but why? 
---
"because pros don't pick them"
---
They completely lack any understanding why the pros do their things, no wonder they then also turn around and destroy others' fun.

A 29 twinked our hunter was taking on 4-6 people in the 25-30 ranged on my server. Dude was relentless and using pots and engineering, but he also used the full kit and knew how to handle people. I think hunters can wreck, but 19 seems low.
---
It doesnt reward any sort of skilled gameplay. It is literally who can play the most hours in a day
---
i mean... wow is a game so kinda?
---
Imagine actually trying to play this version of AV we got. Better to afk and get it over with
---
But if AV is bad for alliance, why would alliance queue? Are you gonna cry when the horde AV queue goes up?
---
Yes probably right.
---
Cross realm is also good at offering instand Queues at different times of the day that would usually be less popular as well though.
---
For EU that is quite big because we literally get instant invites any time a day.
---
But yes CRBG's could have been tested with a bit.
---
But if Blizz had the time and Money and Manpower to do so then there would have been 1001 other things to put the time and effort in first.
---
CRBG's were a Thing in Vanilla as well. They make sense and don't take away tooooooo much.
---
But I do agree that there is defenitely space for improvement too
---
Yeah, but with enough efford and dedication, you can actually achieve to stay mediocore (or even worse) at everything
---
Druids are the top "we don't find another player, should I invite the druid" spot fillers
---
Some people are there purely for rep.. Not everybody has the time to even bother chasing ranks
---
This -- and even saying that I've noticed a new meta emerging where Horde side engages in PVP encounters across the entire field of play.
---
OP needs to calm his tits I think.
---
The honor grind of 2005 isn't even comparable to Classic. At first there was no xrealm bg, no battlemasters and AV was completely different. If you wanted a quick bg you went wsg, not av. On lower populated realms like mine, one av even happening was quite an event.
---
Mate the raid leader could straight up remove people from the BG/
---
Why leave out the best part? This same guy is probably the one that made a level 1 alt on Heartseeker to PM us this and help create a spicy new copy/pasta: you and your little !@# ass premade are failures. Yall aare absolute trash and ima call you out everytime I run with yalls stupid little PREMADE crap. you're literal trash at this game. all of yall... probably the same guy who called for Drek rush and capped IBT to cuck us, but love being the meme villians of reddit :)
---
Why tell him the price tho? Repeatedly.
---
This!!
---
I play on Gehennas (EU). Didn't play a lot of wow prior to classic but this community is toxic as hell, same level of toxicity as League of legends but the average player is like 25-30yrs old... yikes.
---
Lier. I was first HWL on your server.
---
When you get punished for doing the opposite.
---
As long as it's less competition for brackets, hell yeah let them "win".
---
You people know nothing about the real vanilla if it takes you less than 10 hours to clear MC. I bet you even have a warrior tank like a real bitch. Our guild has lab grown forty 15 year olds genetically perfected for incompetence, ten of which are always afk at any given times and ten of which sign up for a raid but don't show up because they got grounded. That is the only true vanilla experience.
---
While I understand the need for cross server BGs to avoid insane queues, I am very disappointed it seems to be all of the servers together. A single server is better for community, but small battlegroups could have kept at least a little of that.
---
Ouch, 2 months? I'll probably trigger some hunters by saying that I got BT the second day of checking his spawns.  
---
Even more triggering: I got HoJ on my warrior on the very first BRD run. Some weeks later I shelved the warrior due to there being just too many warriors around and started playing hunter :)))
---
Yes but the point is that Alliance who only zerg AV for 900 honor are going to get buttblasted by pre made Alliance who get 2k+ OR do pre made WSG.
---
In a few weeks all the Alliance zerg rush only players will be 2-3 ranks lower than the Alliance who didn't zerg so hard. And the really smart rankers are playing WSG probably.
---
you know blizzard implemented the 5min pve version not the epic pvp version....
---
Yup 35 lock WSG super fun’s!!
---
Yes. Need at least two more chars exalted. And they arent't 60 yet :)
---
Beautiful, just beautiful...
---
We should rename this sub r/classicwowwhining
---
Always a cool request to get :) Unfortunately it may not do you much good as it is not in English. I can find you some of the source material I used if you’d like? I recall a few great articles in English.
---
Actually, I believe they included it in the latest update of the addon.
---
Oh shit didn't think of it that way. I'm going to start telling horde to 'win'.
---
This is the exact content I love Classic for.
---
Aye it is good value for the money, even if it is a lot of money long term. Has taught me that and much more besides - English, for one.
---
Lmao are you the guy who made a level one to send me this after the game? https://i.imgur.com/z57nVP7.png
---
We had a random cap iceblood gy and it forced the horde into a turtle after a ton of them died.
---
Bruh I'm alliance and I hate the Horde turtles, but even I feel like this is cringe as fuck.
---
is that how this happened?  [https://i.gyazo.com/9ea84266b6aa5e8143d9328099e3351a.gif](https://i.gyazo.com/9ea84266b6aa5e8143d9328099e3351a.gif)

lol

Ok loser

I use numbers from 1 to 5, and then q  e r, also alternative same binds on shift and ctrl

Touche
---
Seems rigged but funny nonetheless
---
Hmm - I just played on a totally different Server than all my irls...and ye..its fun. 
---
All of my irls wanted to roll on a german server this was a no go for me so I rolled on Gehennas and I have so muchhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh fun
---
Glad to hear brother.  I think the best part about Classic release is not for us salty veterans but for all the people who never get to enjoy it.  Granted a lot of the old schoolers speed-clearing/power leveling/etc might ruining the original level of immersion due to gleeful ignorance but still it's nice to hear this stuff.
---
Yes everyone give us your opinion on what should have been but will never be so we can all know what you would have prefered!
---
Do mara!
---
No, that would be the players....stop trying to blame things for what YOU do.
---
Gotta remember, we're in 2004 ;)
---
Only the guy who knows he fucked up bad could be salty enough and post this pepelaf.
---
Awesome mate :)
---
Except it evens the playing field for Horde and widens it for Alliance. Horde pre made groups are barely going to get more honor than regular Horde can right now in AV.
---
Pre made Alliance who get triple the honor that PUG Alliance zerg rushers get + WSG premades = huge gap between them.
---
In a couple of weeks, a regular Horde player might be 1-2 ranks lower than a super hardcore player. Alliance will end up being 4+ ranks lower because they think zerging for 900 honor is a good idea.
---
Nope, wasn't me. Only have chars on Fairbanks. But judging from the comments on this it's a wide field of suspects, good luck!
---
Well it still worked and the game is smooth again
---
This is classic, not retail..... The only reason these games are only lasting 10 minutes is cause both sides just agree on a no-rush
---
My guild started bringing me along to MC when I was level 57, 'cause they're a few people short anyway. I've done two runs with them so far, and I already have helmet, shoulders and bracers, 'cause the one other resto druid had all of those. I'm not even 60 yet!
---
Finally Alliance can win at PvP! When there's no actual PvP involved kek
---
When I premade AV i ussually get 3k honor+ rep winning. So just playing only for rep is no dense when you can get both. There is people with more than 300k honor. And they didnt get that honor winning AV with 900 honor.
---
Winning AV with only 900 or 500 honor is just stoping winning another 2k honor+rep just to end 2 mins earlier.
---
There are plenty of ally groups doing the same as horde. The ally are still losing out on honor...
---
&gt; best way to get honor is by doing pve
---
Oh no, the normies can compete in the honor grind just by queueing AV.
---
And what, praytell, do we see more of in AV right now? PvE or PvP?
---
I am on board with the rationale you're quoting for AV changes, but thanks to the community (I'll just point fingers in the way of pservers) AV is being played as a 5-10 minute dungeon right now. Maybe you're ganking someone on your way there, but mostly everyone is ignoring everyone else and just riding off for their respective "dungeon". Irony at it's best, right?
---
It is a passive that procs isn't it?
---
You do damage and when you proc the passive your target gets frozen?
---
Don't worry. It'll be over once everyone has their rep
---
You can play both! Just gey a sub, test the waters and play whichever you wish first. Bored? Go play the other!
---
Community side, it really depends. I'd say both can be negative but that's just the loud cries of the always angry people.
---
Ye lets just perma ban every one. I'm pretty sure that'll keep the game alive. Just think before you post for once god damn it. 
---
 A lot of people might not come back when they get their account permanently banned that they have invested days upon. Not being able to grind for a week is already horror for these guys. So just making it a time based punishment is a good deal.
---
1 played 1 Av. Didn't like it and only played wsg since then. I'm having a lot of fun to.
---
It is possible to not min max you know
---
No it doesn't. Just last week I saw someone running into a wall and turned him around.
---
No that’s frostbite
---
vanilla players like my dad (rank 14 on chromaggus) had to grind like 50-100k honor per week for their bracket 1. I'm 3 days into and approaching 500k so this is the thing, competition is bigger and better because people figured out how this shit works
---
You get as much rep for killing Galv as you do for turning in 3 marks. Take at least the last two towers, they'll cap while you pull the other warmasters. Spend 12 minutes instead of 8 if it even takes that long, earn plenty of extra Rep, astronomically more honor, and still win. The "don't be a kek" meme is hilarious and awesome, but I really don't get why so many people insist that every game be a mindless PvE zerg race when you can reap so many more rewards with so laughably little extra investment and actually do a little PvP in the process... and even if they kill your boss first, you still keep all those extra rewards.
---
It's much, much better to kill Galv for extra rep (and honor) and lose the match than it is to fail a Drek rush because the horde forced a turtle and then get nothing... or worse, end up stuck in AV forever. I just don't see the risk of the rush as even coming close to worth it for the measly reward. I'm not going to run into Galv by myself, but damn I wish more Alliance would even *attempt* completing objectives like the Horde do in every game. In plenty of games, the team won't even bother trying to tag the relief hut let alone secure it and that objective alone is the source of so many of our failures in AV as a faction.
---
And kill the damned bowmen!!11!!1one
---
I fucking love my sl/shadow burn lock.. Every other specc feels too squishy in my opinion :)
---
Or they could've added PvE reps with similar rewards back then. But they didn't. So here we are having to farm AV a little while. The current meta is fine. You also have longer games. Nobody wants the two hour bullshit.
---
My cat doesn't poo at all during the day when I'm out. I return home and within about 10 minutes he drops a log. Not sure how I feel about that.
---
I haven't had fun in a video game since 2005, everything I do is just because I want it or im addicted
---
Nah man. Only the few horde defenders matter. If there are some competent mages and rogues they can easily 8man def the 40man ally raid.
---
Awesome!
---
im on windseeker, hes on fairbanks. cant set that shit up
---
That's pretty normal, if horde sets up a turtle it's a big waste of time and people would rather go take a break for 15 minutes. And wiping a premade is not hard at all.
---
What an asshat charging guildies - sure, it may be an epic pattern, but come on! I would just have started charging him for every profession related thing he asks from the guild, or have the guild master / officers tell him to stop screwing around with guildies.
---
that can fuck right off.
---
nope, you could in vanilla but not now
---
since you know, \#nochanges
---
hahaha :D
---
Dude if you're doing that, it's fine. But why advertise this shit? 
---
Imagine people crying whole phase 2 about getting killed when questing or being on a way to a dungeon but now joining battlegrounds to farm exp while every other shit is safe. What a joke
---
Also imagine you pull up on AV and every time you have to hope you have the less wheelchair players that needs to be carried, because all they do is kill mobs in AV for exp
---
For that sort of experience, you'd have to be a kid again. Because look at how adult gamers approach new video games - we *don't* just dick around aimlessly, we understand the structure of these things too well for that. So even if Blizzard hypothetically released a brand new game that was just like vanilla wow, but with different zones and quests and dungeons... You'd still figure it out in no time.
---
Not quite, oceanic have their own battlegroup essentially
---
Good! I figured out a solution to my high ping problem as well finally.
---
As a horde on Heartseeker... fuck that guild.
---
yeah, because camping Searing Gorge for 8 hours every day was so much better...
---
90% of the ppl whining about honor farm never gave it a real shot
---
Only true if you kill him before horde kill the girl. Which happens 1 time out of 10 when some mage slow the horde.
---
Nah bro. OP is being cringe asf but  he's right. All "procs" are the actualization of a passive abilities/aura/effect/enchant that has an "x"% chance to occur. We say windfury procs, but it is a passive aura that has an x% chance to spawn on every melee hit. We say deathbringer procs, but it is a passive effect on a weapon that has an x% chance to cast a shadowbolt on melee attacks.
---
Shatter is a 20% increased chance to crit on frozen targets. When someone who is frozen gets crit, we say shatter procs.
---
The Human Spirit (rep gain) is an example of a passive ability that does NOT proc. But in the case of Shatter, which dramatically increases the random likelihood of a crit occuring in certain situations, we would say it procs.
---
The main difference between your single player replay example and replaying WoW in ultra min-max mode is that since WoW is an MMO with a large focus on community, there are ripple effects to min-maxing mentalities that affect more than just the people who want to min-max.
---
"Semi-hardcore" has become the new norm for guilds, meaning guilds that aim to clear MC / Ony and soon BWL, but have expectations of players, such as have full pre-BiS and consumables. The amount of chill, casual progress guilds is lower as a percentage of all guilds than what it used to, because the attitude of "Link 400+ DPS WCL or you're useless" has radiated outwards to the general playerbase.
---
It's much more common to see players who obsess over skipping every single skippable trash back in a dungeon, no matter how risky the skip. People now get rejected from groups because they don't play mage and thus can't spellcleave, something which didn't really use to happen. Or more obviously, everyone and their mom joined FP / boat camping raids, because far more people now had their eyes on the fancy PvP ranks and gear, which was evidently not a very healthy attitude for the average player of an MMO to have.
---
TL;DR: It's fine for you to want to be more tryhard this time around, and aim to achieve things that you didn't before. The problem is that you aren't isolated in this game, that mentality has permeated into the general playerbase and has created negative consequences. 
---
Furthermore, it is somewhat amusing that so many people kept complaining about a lack of content (mostly during P1, but still to this date) when the reason for their lack of content is that they min-maxed the fuck out of the game and ran out of content way, way faster than they would have.
---
Gangbangs of pvp where casters rain aoe from the back and melee sit around because there is nothing they can do does not seem fun.  When av becomes a 10v10 count me in, but an 80 person battleground where nothing notable happens for 3 hours does not seem like a great experience.
---
I started with a group of people who I played vanilla with. Easily a dozen strong in our own guild with aspirations of greatness. Within a month of launch, that guild was dead, I was 60 and beginning raiding, and one other friend was in the high 40s from lagging behind trying to level with another friend who just... stopped.
---
The guild was dead and all our friends with exception of me, my buddy, and one other had scattered to a few other guilds on server with better times/more casual play to fit their needs.
---
Fast-forward to today, and we're in our new "forever home" clearing content and having fun. I still see the occasional person from our first guild, grown up finally and raiding for themselves. Most just quit playing though. 
---
Make new friends. Forge new bonds. I've had more fun making a new crop of friends and raid-mates in the past ~2 months than the past ~2 years of Retail.
---
Can't deal damage when you're dead
---
I think I got lucky but I got 6 fused wiring off of roughly 30 regular target dummies
---
Around 50-60g on my realm. 
---
I remember this story circulating on here but can't recall the realm this was on, there was this one guy charging outrageous fees (500ish?) for ages since he did have monopoly on it, and when he lost his monopoly he started spam whispering people who undercut him with more reasonable prices, being generally obnoxious and aggressive towards them. The golden nugget was this one guy who in the end was paying people 5 g to let him craft the helm for them just to spite this particular crafter.
---
Retail has the priority and I can’t understand why you would think they would do otherwise. There’s no future in a 15 year old game, it’s just a fan service.
---
Does this even work? We only report people that are actually afk in the starting cave and they only get kicked a few minutes later. If someone just spaced out for a bit they have plenty of time to reach the action.
---
I do the Same every av i enter and its great to Just slow them and dismount them they will Be slower than your zerg and you win 99% of Games. Just deny the pulling and capping i allways Rush in the enemy zerg head on when they try to Rush to barlinda. Every time someone tryed to Report me afk but Just Return the favor you can allways Hit an enemy in time becouse you do PvP and they Just braindead pve at front. They dont have enemys to Hit so they will get kicked Out and Not you.
---
well I mean, I guess I lol'd
---
Well yes, regions are of course still separated. But every EU EN server is on one big heap, which is just awful.
---
The process getting the ring sucks, but widening the gap between a character and others can be satisfying for many.
---
Most no-lifers are probably salty that their long planned WSG premades aren't the most optimal honor/hour. "We want better PvP" is just code for "my favorite activity to farm honor isn't better than solo AV queueing". The people crying for longer AVs wouldn't want their WSGs lasting 2 hours because that's just bad honor/hour.
---
i bought all the BOEs for my 39 rogue on week 2 after release. cost me about 80g. love to see how much that SVBB is going for now.
---
eh no. it's mostly poor decision-making by blizzard with 1.12 av, 1.12 pvp rewards when not even bwl is released etc. Sure this game has its flaws but the most complaints aren't the fault of the game itself or the playerbase. I Don't think anyone expected no minmaxing. I mean the mindset was different already on pservers why should that change
---
A man's gotta fish you know
---
&gt; I guess you win some you lose some.
---
Except in AV since forever.
---
... This is the dumbest thing.  
---
I love it.
---
i'd say probably yes, as its a database transaction in the background and those are usually logged.
---
Well my matches are 6-15mins long!
---
probably around 20h of queuing AV without AV weekend.
---
top lads!
---
I read that Nightfin snapper is the best stuff you can get. 
---
Someone asked about Winter Squid but no reply to that - I somehow think those are open water only but I could be wrong. Nightfin is a decent catch though, \~35-45s apiece on my realm.
---
They have quite a few randoms. They're also clearly not farming honor so this post is not about them. Probably just a decently large rep farming group.
---
I've had one where literally every horde was from Heartseeker and they were missing a lot of players for most of the BG, now that's very suspicious.
---
Nah mate, it's all BG now
---
Every AV I did last night we killed Galv.
---
This makes me a bit happy. I don’t have more than a few hours a week to play so i’m not even at 60 yet. I love the slow pace of classic giving me a shot at catching up in later patches!
---
It's Sublime, it's godlike. its gooood
---
Had a rogue on Herod say “you didn’t even parse a 95 on luci?!”.... my parse is a 94.... he took the time to go to Warcraft logs and look me up....
---
This is after he did the “you have been reported for being afk” thing and my gf fell for it (I laughed at her for being so gullible) and I called him an asshole lol
---
I opened this thinking 'I can handle a bit of cringe this morning, let's do it'.... but it wasn't cringe at all :D This is awesome.  Well played sir.. well played.
---
That's what I meant. You can enjoy retail AV because there are enough sources for (good) gear. In classic there is currently no better option than Don Julio's Band so you "have to" farm it.
---
So stop playing.
---
Mate, I'm only 20 and I've been out of that energy for years. If you're in your 30s and still kicking it the same way you did at 15, then consider yourself lucky.
---
We all knew the systems and the problems they would cause beforehand and we were warned it will lead to this. Complaining about the systems and those who control the systems when everyone was warned from the beginning is fucking idiotic.
---
What is the updated ranker rewards? To my knowledge grand marshal gear stayed the same throughout vanilla. I don’t recall an update to them or any other pvp reward with naxx release. I cant recall when exactly pvp ranks were released but I do know several of my OG guild had it in BWL... I wanna say it was in between raid tier patch gm gear dropped... I’ll go do some research.
---
Enh Shaman able to use Thunderstrike closer to becoming kind of viable?
---
This is exactly what I do. I even managed to cripple the alliance by stunning their ranks when they pull and watch them die in there.
---
Do you need exalted with a race to ride their rank 11 PVP mount?
---
The game is great and there is no problem, the only _problem_ was a few weeks after phase 2, when the honor system was introduced, when it was legit torture to go out in the world cause of all the gank squads (so pvp sv problem), otherwise it's great and there are plenty of servers with a healthy population and ok balance.
---
So can this toxic entitlement to try and dictate how people play.
---
Yeah! That totally wont look suspicious at all!

I miss recognizing the names of the people im fighting against and with.  Now its all a jumble of random people, I get happy when I see someone from my own server
---
Talk about having the cake- and eating it:D
---
Can't please all of the people all of the time, my friend!
---
Need to have them leash with Drek/Vann then.  Otherwise you can still just pull the 2 on each side of the room without getting Drek/Vann and kill them before the leash spot.  So make all warmasters/marshals leash with the boss NPC so you cant piecemeal them if they are up.
---
As I heard the brits want themselves out
---
^This 100%
---
There's far less people leveling - not many new players anymore, and since BGs just came out nobody is playing alts. On top of that, RFK is not a very popular instance, since it shares level range with early wings of Scarlet Monastery.
---
And december isn't a winter month?
---
Settle down junior.

Op might have a problem.

Still oom within 10sec :D

Ohhh well I guess I should have stayed out of this discussion to begin with as I am a druid xD
---
Cross-server HAS to happen due to servers being terribly unbalanced. Sorry, it's just how it is. Yes, I feel your nostalgia. I'll agree with you on the other points. We deserve 1.7 AV; post-fixes, pre-nerfs. And AB should have been released at the same time. Honor should be nerfed in AV in a boosted in other BGs because you are right, AV is where you HAVE to be if you want to rank. I'd be fine if they made it so in AV you couldn't even target Drek or Vann until all four towers/bunkers were burned.
---
Whats your gear?
---
Preach dawg, this is the best post on this sub in the past 10 months. 50%+ of you are morons who never played vanilla and actively ruin this game. Pleas go back to retail or wherever the fuck you came from, and stop masquerading as “the guy that cleared Naxx in vanilla”. Fuck you, you lying piece of shit.
---
Rogue is very overpopulated compared to cars. You don't see too many cats, most ferals are bear. If u enjoy having to work really hard for mediocre dps over spamming sinister strike then go for cat, but it's not gonna do wonders and you have to spend a lot of time in gnomer.

I tried to Venmo a friend money and my card was declined I look up what’s wrong and 24 hour fitness was billing me. I put the account on hold for 10 dollars a month and they are billing me the hold fee plus the normal 44.49 gym membership. This put like 5 overdraft charges on my card too
---
no thanks, we'll keep turtling and having fun pvping in a pvp BG. :D
---
good thing i never played WoW before so classic has been a great time for me GGEZ #notaboomer
---
Could be, I haven't updated the add-on since DM came out
---
All you turbo virgins sure get angry when your favorite streamer does some that you don't like.
---
Damage does break it, usually theres enough chaos going around where nobody notices if you pop it right away
---
People like you are what's wrong in Classic. Cannot downvote this bullshit enough.
---
I bought a gaming laptop, so play on the sofa watching movies as I grind AV rep! :D
---
&gt;They set up domino's, we called it, domino's fell.
---
I was a bit different from what I remember
---
Blizz called the domino will fall, community relentlessly mocked blizz and insisted that they want dominos, then we called it, then they fell.
---
So that is Silver, Platinum, Diamond Awards. But what is that "Car at a gas Station" looking thingy? xD
---
Is there a schedule for BG weekends? When does the AV weekend start?
---
u could actually farm mobs in the mines and cave ...
---
You can also die at the boss you need and get someone to kill it, you can still roll on drops and you wont get xp :)
---
Cruel but hilarious.
---
We thought we did, but we don’t
---
That’s fair m8, and good for you - a decision well made, and undoubtedly a hard and mature one. My point is though that if you had had a genuine psychological problem, a compulsion issue, you may not have been able to do that. 
---
To explain the compulsion system in simple terms, if you go to the store and get an urge to buy ice cream, you as a person with a functional compulsion system is capable of deciding no. No lasting impact on your day. It is basically our ability to decide our vices.
---
People with a compromised compulsion system do not have quite the same choice. For you it might be a tough decision still, but you could make it and forget it after 5-10 minutes, or at least after leaving the store.
---
For these people, once the compulsion sets in, it can become obsessive - which is what we see as addictive. The inability to not buy the ice cream. You know these people as people who can’t stop shopping, eating, hoarding - whatever it may be, it is a compulsion issue (this is all far more complicated than I’d go into on a reddit post, but I feel a basic understanding would do many WoW players good. Many stress excessively, often unnecessarily, about whetever they have an addiction issue when in fact they merely have a hobby they love - one they perhaps need to manage better, but not something they need to be an addict over. I do not mean to belittle that challenge in any way, but I do want to make the difference clear).
---
Suffice to say that the word addiction is thrown around far more frequently than it is genuinely present or understood. A distraction is not an addiction. A game being compelling does not mean it is psychologically damaging. Sometimes we all need to set aside our hobbies and focus on irl, and there are far worse places and ways to learn that than playing WoW.
---
And my guild won’t even invite me to scholo on my 58 holy priest 😂
---
We report people that never leave cave, they get kicked in a few minutes if they don't come back. Seems reasonable enough.
---
keif gets solo'd by level 41 hunters, true story.
---
Funny everyone was shit talking the private sever community for being too elitist but all these new people are way more elitist. There were less meme specs on the private servers but they were way more relaxed than all these new people coming in. I wish blizz would have never released classic because the people who played before they did were way more enjoyable to play with.
---
It's ironic but sad in the same time since the whole point of layering was to avoid making a lot of servers bound to be merged later with a lot of related problems, Blizzard addressed it even before launch. Yet he refuses to accept that because truth hurts.
---
Its the first thing I would like to see gone if they were to do classic plus.
---
Debuff cap was always entrely a technical limitation, and never intended by Blizzard.
---
So salty lol
---
That works for some runs sure but i dont see why i should burden my friends with several days of rend farming
---

I see you can't count. And 4 servers per region obviously wasn't enough. Did you even read the articles you linked?

Man, i just ended a real AV match like this.. here, take a look:

Upvotes, maybe add the gofundme link to the youtube video as well so viewers can see it?
---
I went into classic with the aim to experience the things I never did at launch, raiding and playing with the best of the server. Strutting around that epic weapon in the capital. I'd look at those people and go 'whoa that's amazing!' but I dropped out from playing before getting even close.
---
Now I'm one them and it's a completely new way of looking at the game. Feels great!
---
Paladin weapon
---
Gap in ranks will be the same (can't beat forced percentiles), rankers will just need to put in more time to maintain their advantage.
---
isn't teebu's better right now
---
I can't seem to find a reliable source for information regarding the amount of +hit gear that I need for wielding a 2H mace against a 63 boss as human. I can only find some posts from august before the game was launched but they seem to cater to dual wielders.
---
Glad you had a good time! It's a shame that AV became a rushfest because minimax, so it's good to hear that you enjoyed it how it was intended to be.
---
oh, roleplayers definitely exists, but are also a big minority. It's far from, let's say, Argent Dawn on Retail, where you'll find more roleplayers in 1h than in one week on Hydraxian
---
No I mean that ability that I can sneak up on your ass from 41 yds through objects with.
---
When u stand there focusing on some poor melee. That’s the one I mean.
---
Aimed shot &gt;auto shot &gt; multi shot = dead clothie.

Hunters is the king of AV no matter how you twist and turn it thanks to 41yds advantage.

Shit like this happens all the time. Blizzard would not hesitate to ban anyone and everyone they thought had abused the system if they thought it was worth their time and the money they'd have to pay their employees for doing it, regardless of how accurate the evidence against any individual person was.
---
I’m not sure how you inferred that from my comment. My bitterness stems from what I’ve experienced while trying to level.
---
Yojamba is undoubtedly the chillest server
---
you can move the raid frame if you doesnt know haha
---
I haven't had a single proper AV match yet. It's either drek rush or galv&gt;drek rush, sometimes split groups to shake things up, but that's it.
---
You would see buff/raid stacking for reduced warlock threat, much like you see stacking for warrior DPS these days.
---
guids
---
no lie
---
my pleasure
---
It's a game, dude. Calm your tits.
---
Lol no
---
world of whining, the boohoo crusade.
---
I love aoes.
---
If you prefer wPVP to BGs just camp FPs or dungeon entrances. People in there have to go to dungeons anyway.
---
The social aspect of gaming gets often over looked. It's mostly negative reports about addiction violence
---
Horde wouldn't know that.
---
I play on Fairbanks, i often find my self in groups with dad
---
It's easiest to summarize by calculating your honor/h and if it's less than meta then you're losing in a long run if both players are putting in equal hours.
---
If alliance premades get 3000 honor a game (10 minutes) and you only 1000 (in 7 minutes) then you will have a bad time ranking. Or actually you might end up deranking.
---
The meta is fast games, do objectives and don't defend. If you do anything else than that then you are relatively getting less honor than other ranking players in your realm
---
And they say that video games make people violent... You guys are the best
---
Is there a tracker on the internet of the current holiday weekend? Of course you can log on and see for yourself but this is not possible if you are not online.
---
Heartseeker is legitimately a server populated by quitters so this behavior is unsurprising.
---
You don't think Mythic+ or mythic raiding, ranked pvp is skillful? Most players cant do that stuff.
---
It used to be in the ingame calendar, but that doesn't exist in classic.
---
By the by, what is the current bonus weekend?
---
It's the meta and it doesn't matter if everyone does it. If you do that meta most you end up winning. If you do something else equal hours then you can't rank up. It's that simple
---
I just took 900 as an example since that was mentioned. My own honor from AV has been way above that most of the time too. It's no surprise that premades are better though, that's expected :P 
---
But as I wrote before, if there is better honor from WSG or whatever then obviously that is better. I really take no stance to what is the best, I'm just arguing that if there is a trend where the whole faction, in general, gets the same honor regardless of source it doesn't matter how much it is :P
---
No, it's when you for some reason set icons to giant size and don't bother with clustering settings
---
Powershifting bugs out Leader of the pack and Predatory strikes.
---
You need a special macro to fix it. I don't have it handy, but should be one of the top results if you google powershift bug vanilla.
---
It sucks. I need the rep more than the honor and the zerg allies only go for the "let's win with 3 times less bonus honor, because apparently that's the fastest'.
---
It's not that hard to organize in groups, cap some towers as well disrupt the horde and still win. Just stay in groups of 5. We had a 18 minute game with 3700 bonus honor once. That's more lucrative than the 1500 9 minute games. The difference? We went for towers/GY's too.
---
&gt;  add some pve content
---
they just did though? its called Alterac Valley
---
you run past a bunch of horde and then you kill a boss named Drek'Thar that drops no loot but ends the instance
---
and then you start over.
---
How does AV factor into IF rep?
---
A ban is unnecessary, just a pvp rank reset back to 1 would be fine.
---
And I can actually quest now without getting camped by a raid :)
---
It honestly sounds like this game might be unhealthy for you if that's how you truly feel.
---
The only ones that could kill me 1:1 in Vanilla were Warlocks. And often enough it was a stalemate when I died after I killed the Lock.
---
Hunters and Rogues are no match if you are in a fair 1:1 duel situation. With Rogues that is not always the case cause they might catch you in the wild when you are low mana and low health and their initial combo will kill you.
---
If graveyards are captured it can create scenarios where one faction can do nothing but turtle soon as a few players drop. They will spawn into the opponent faction and will be unable to reinforce properly. It creates a snowball effect of more people dying since they cant reinforce and suddenly you have whole enemy team at their own base fighting to get out and it looks like theyre defending while they really just want to get out.
---
So what? Feel free to continue ganking, most of the players will still be there: levelers, BiS farmers etc.
---
How's that going now?
---
It wasn't possible to report people away before the gates opened.
---
I want to be a druid!
---
Shit man sorry to hear. Our main tank is 1 item away from preraid bis atm and as a dps warrior a will gladly give up my items, like the +2 hit ring(the name escapes me right now). My reasoning for this: He'll generate more theat! So i can push damage harder. Nothing is more annoying than having to stop dps, cause of low threat output from tank. So to all dps, gear your tank so you can go fucking bananas! Try to explain this to your loot council, i mean you'll never change anything if you don't talk with them. Otherwise there are always others guilds or other games.
---
very well said
---
It's actually the allies doing that. They 'win' the game, but the scoreboard shows the horde get more honor and more rep, so in the end, *they* win. They get to exalted faster.
---
Just goes to show that the so call classic wow community "toxicity" is not a thing, theres more great helpfull and cool people playing the game  than there is toxic players.
---
These are those kinda of experiences of vanila that made me want to come back to the game.
---
Great stuff for you mate, keep rockin dude.
---
When I innervate myself, do I in theory lose out on ~15% since I have the talent?
---
I paid 80g tip for mine.
---
This. "We" in the context above refers to the GMs, not the dev team, OP just misunderstood the reply they got (which, granted, is ambiguous).
---
Because there is clearly a connection.
---
What's up with these 7 minutes games? I played 1.5 day to hit revered and not once did a game take less than 9 minutes.
---
Yup LOL. Grinded AV for 24 hrs straight bc I knew that Alliance would eventually start losing and have more turtles. Hope Horde win every time now!!!
---
Well it's the #1 honour farm so I guess so bro
---
I actually got BT after 1,5 hours of waiting lol. I was freshly dinged 37 and went to the badlands to look for it before logging off, there I met a hunter with the pet who said they had tamed it 10 minutes ago. This was 1 AM, and I knew he had a 6-8 hour respawn, therefor the earliest it could spawn was 7 AM, and if someone killed it just as it spawned it would spawn again 1 PM. So I logged on 1 PM and waited, and an hour and a half later it spawned!
---
The point of a Druid is: you don't need him if everything is working well. But if the shit hits the fan the Druid is the one that could turn around the fight.
---
They are really good at that.
---
So think of it everytime you wipe: This was due your lack of good druids in your raid.
---
They don't go "oom". They can fix things if other people fail.
---
Problem is: only good Druids can do that. Bad Druids do what their groupleader and raidleader is telling them to do, stick with that and only that and don't have any clue what a fight is about.
---
1 month.
---
BGs were added in 1.5, June 2005, Battlemasters were added 1.7, July 2005
---
This is bait
---
This is a good analogy. It acknowledges that both sides are at fault here. People are toxic shitheads and Blizz implemented systems that those people can abuse.
---
Anyone know which addon keeps telling me, “You are not in a raid group” during AV matches?
---
Turtling gives you more rep per hour tho as you have more time to cap all the GYs &amp; towers which allies skip.
---
Do you know how much money a billion is ?
---
Yer your right. And in Vanilla nobody wanted AV to be nerfed to the state state it is in now. They wanted the original AV....and they still do.
---

---
Fire mages in aq will be broken af
---
The arcanite dragonlings attacks does a debuff in the target which increase fire damage taken by an amount which can stack, so if all 40 players uses it at the same time, it will be Thaddius lvl damage
---
You forget that tons of people who may or may not be interested in BGs, wPVP or PVP in general are farming AV reputation for the new grindable BiS. Once that is over, which will be soon with the given meta in AV, things will change again. Stop this “Now this broke that! Game over!“ on every little change/unlock within the first 5 minutes please.
---
Meeh that doesn’t sound good for him 😂
---
I was told last night that i am a abusive sociopath because of my action in AV.
---
What did i do you ask? Recapped Frostwolf Hut, forceing the alliance to spawn back at their base and thus having an old school AV round.
---
Last night was a good night.
---
Frantic alt-tabbing.
---
Building a raiding guild from 10 players is a hard thing to do. However being a 10 player core can prove to be an advantage when joining another guild lacking a few people to finish their core. 
---
Many guilds are having a tough time and are still missing some members, and with 10 players with you, you have a sting hand when negotiating terms. 
---
If u do decide to start your own raiding guild, I think hosting a weekly pug will be your best way to find additional members. And keep an eye out for imploding guilds, and snack up the good members. 
---
Glhf
---
Fellow Kromcrush, feel you pain.
---
I'm just glad i got my exalted and can just ignore it for the rest of the classic
---
You know, I wanted classic AV to be exactly this. I thought with classic I would not have to talk about old beautiful AV any more. But they had to release NOT the version everyone talked about for years.
---
Is battlegear of heroism set in the game yet? if not, when does it come? if yes, how exactly do i get it?
---
To bad the summoned bosses stand around in mid for 10 minutes before doing anything.
---
Whitescale Salmon. it goes towards War Efforts in AQ

DS/Ruin with corr is better than SM/Ruin with corr
---
good to see dad out here grinding with the rest of us
---
Your comment is very ironic because you make fun of someone for not realizing something except he actually knows something you don't.
---
Alliance premades are getting 3k honor a game meanwhile you're only getting 1k in same time. And you are in fact competing against them and losing right now. If they play 16h a day with at least double honor rate then you must play 32h a day to make up the cap... Maybe this comment opens your eyes and have a better week ranking next week!
---
640g and nope! Only rank 11 pvp mounts require riding skill
---
It's a MAGE blade stop giving it to locks!!
---
Any prediction of when they will announce TBC legacy  servers?
---
little under 2 days of spamming av. most classes have a bis item they need from av vendor, i did too. bought the healing offhand. nothing else.
---
Pretty sure they dont automate permabans.
---
As Alliance on the same server, we don't particularly care for them either.
---
This is due to Blizzard changing the name of the executable from Wow.exe to WowClassic.exe. This causes Discord to no longer recognize Wow Classic as a verified game and thus it no longer lists you as ”Playing World of Warcraft Classic” nor enables the overaly. 
---
A solution is to copy the WowClassic.exe and name the copy ”Wow.exe”. Then, always launch the game by clicking that executable (i.e not from the Blizzard launcher). You will have to enter your password every time, but the overlay starts working again.
---
A guild mate drop it on 1st run, I instant BL him
---
I don't agree. Current AV is not the one people talked about for years. Not the version one heard of so often. It is the version where you rush Drek. What wasn't possible in majority of classic. And this feels even worse than retail AV. And it doesn't belong in classic.
---
fuck the streamers. tru parasites
---
My guild are flamelash refugees who moved to earthshaker a few weeks ago, but most of the horde also transferred during The Great Flamelash Exodus so there wasn't really much of a difference last week. This week though....
---
We did MC and Onyxia yesterday. We flew to Thorium Point and ran to MC with no problems. There were 2 horde outside the MC spot. 
---
Took the Menethil boat. Again no horde. Outside the lair... also no horde. If there were any horde raids (which there probably was) they just calmly went into the instances without staying outside looking for a fight.
---
7/8 cenarion after 3 mc raids. Ez

310 weapon skill will give you 4,5% hit and a  glancing blows reduction of 5%.

An officer might have gkicked you just as well.
---
He's gone by many names. I think this is his 3rd or 4th account
---
I hit exalted EU yesterday and most games took around 7 minutes. There were some turtles and few lasted 50 minutes but other than that most games have been very fast
---
what is your gear? god damn, those parses
---
&gt; Itemization is a lot better.   
---
read: loot is boring. I much prefer classic's quirky stats to retail's hyperoptimisation.
---
&gt; Have you ever considered that maybe some people like PvP for the sake of actual PvP action
---
No.
---
Yes hosting successful pugs and recruiting through them is a very good way of recruitment.
---
You get to see how people preform, and they get to see how the guild atmosphere is. It’s win - win.
---
I very much doubt the CEO of a multibillion company would abuse his status to get his "I told you so". If major stakeholders get wind of him fucking up a perfectly viable money making cash cow for an "I told you so", he'd be out of a job the next day and have his career destroyed subsequently.
---
I mean being #1 heal in term of healing done is just a matter of sniping heals. Anyone can do that tbh, picking a top healer is harder than just looking at meter.
---
aint no warrior anywhere in this phase anywhere close to a druid on TPS with a pummeler
---
It's a brand new player... stop being dumb.
---
A thought for the people who wouldn't believe me 6 months ago when I said that with BG, World PvP would massively scale down like it did in Vanilla and one for the people, last month, who were telling that it was so fun that it would surely continue even with BG.
---
No one cares !
---
That behavior is what gets you banned. Just give it to then in trade.
---
I will never delete my thrash blade or my mirah's song. Or my mark of fordring or Blackhand's breadth. Shit's staying. If for whatever reason I might want it again, I can't get new ones. Idk, just doesnt feel right to delete it.
---
I dont even know what game this is but you fucking game on you crazy diamonds, loved it.
---
You can by making everyone do a backdoor jump but that's highly unlikely in the current pug environment.
---
Cowabunga, dudes!
---
The great part is that they still did get her with 6 people!
---
It isnt yet. It would be one if they were tank 12 or 13, but at the current rank 7 or whatever it isnt as bad.
---
if you can run away from the players that can kill you, you never lose.
---
Then, you always win
---
Why is everyone spamming about locks going crazy because of that?
---
Of course it is going to be a boost for them, but a single corruption costs a global cooldown and the total damage it does is less than a single shadowbolt crit.  Pretty much the same applies to Agony (you also have to figure in 3 locks having to do the minus armor and spell resistance curses instead)
---
Inb4: muh nightfall procs - it's 4% proc which is kind of low. And if it procs while you're casting and if you decide to finish the cast then gg, the proc is lost.
---
I like you too, wanna buy me a laptop? I'll join your guild?
---
When using a restorative potion, will it tick right away and remove a debuff? Or the first remove tick comes after 5 sec?
---
wait, you can use other skills than moonfire ?
---
Because its reddit and opposing opinion is not allowed
---
Well it is neither confirmed or denied that tbc will even follow classic. I get how it would be profitable so it could happen tbh. We still have 3 major raids yet to release, BWL, AQ40, Naxx, so I'd assume there wouldn't be any announcement for another 9-12 months.
---
Offhand is his come aq.
---
Guilty
---
First tick comes right as you use the potion I believe. Not 100% sure though.
---
&gt; Instead what we're seeing now are servers dying because the Horde/Alliance ratio is anywhere from 60/40 up to 80/20
---
How would having more servers, or not having layering have changed that though?
---
I've seen several people who didnt abide the rush and instead retapped stuff get kicked.
---
How long until we admit that galaxy brain blizzard was 10 steps ahead of us from the start?
---
We thought we wanted classic. We really did.
---
I mean, is it even really "winning" if it's actually just straight-up worse reward to win? It might be more reputation to rush and kill the boss, but reputation has a cap where getting more reputation does nothing, whereas Honor doesn't have a cap.
---
60% runs to drek, rest goes for galv or lieutenants whatever.
---
Think you can get one of the fishes needed for the War Effort. But also nightfin during the night.

4 hours lol I never experienced it this level of pro play in classic. More like 4 days

Raid with other guilds that are not yet a full roster, preferably the same guild each week, so that you only need to fill maybe 10 slots. Once you get more members, recruiting through pugs is a very solid option, that's what we did in the guild I'm currently in.
---
That damned smile.
---
How is it a better deal when reputation has a cap and honor doesn't? There's a point where getting more reputation does nothing, but there's never a point where more honor does nothing. Unless someone's goal is to strictly get exalted and dip, then "winning" is not better.
---
Faerlina so assume a good chunk of the time is anti-afking to skip queues
---
I think it's because the BG group makes some of the addons confused, since it's not a regular raid group.
---
Silly question, but, how much reputation was needed? 3+6+12+21K?
---
I had to set my hearthstone to Org because Kargath has instantly become a ghosttown which meant no more portals for me.
---
Yo can you finish the sentence please?
---
Confusing when you think about it but... "allow" is a just a rule, not something that affects the mana regen number you currently have.
---
You're only competing for standing with your own faction though, so the disparity doesn't matter. It works out better for Alliance as they will get rep faster and straying from the AV farm meta won't hurt so much, especially when during the 2x WSG honour weekend.
---
One solo kill in wpvp xd
---
1h 55m Horde win yesterday. Best AV so far!
---
OMG! you guys are amazing! what a great move &lt;3
---
My guildie afks every game to exalted on 2 toons and has only been kicked once. SMH
---
Yes it took your guild members 1day to get exalted. But they're humans with a bonus to rep gain, and day 1 av games on alliance were 7 minutes long. The metagame in av is changing. Games are taking longer and alliance aren't winning as often. You should get exalted now before it becomes extremely tedious to do so.
---
Azshara flightpath is actually useable again. No longer have to fly to Ashenvale and ride to Azshara. (Yes thats still faster than corpsewalking, dying a second time, corpsewalking, then actually getting to do stuff in Azshara)
---
Some private servers were smart enough to release BG's with honor from the get go...
---
And if it procs m
---
Camping FP 24/7 and ask people "it's just a game bro" is the new "dont be mad, it's just a frank"
---
it was even worse back in the day
---
you could set up a program (not that i would have ever used such a thing) that would constantly queue you into AV's, leave when done, and re-queue you while moving around every 5 min to avoid going AFK in game
---
people i knew (definitely not me) would just run this program while at school and get tons of honor
---
"We lost because you rushed Drek!"
---
"No we lost because you stopped at galv!"
---
Every fucking time
---
I’m not doing av under any circumstances idc if the greatest gear of all time flows out of the vendors like hot cakes.  I rolled on a pve server for a reason and I would quit classic before I would be required to pvp. Thanks for the info though
---
ahah thanks. Your calculation skill is on point!
---
What is your toons name? I also play on smolderweb alliance.
---
Indeed. I’m surprised so few picked up on this :D
---
You can target him with /tar &lt;name&gt; and interact by binding "interact with target" to a key.
---
Do I get 415% of my mana regen when Innervate is active or 400%(15% from talent wasted )
---
Horde can just back door it and bypass the bridge and towers
---
It is almost like grieving people has some sort of effect.
---
I stopped playing retail when I realized I had over 900 days played time on my account. I had to take a step back and process that I actually spent almost 3 years of my life logged into the game. 
---
Not that I played the game for 3 years, but that I was logged in and playing for 3 years of my life.
---
Life is short man, make sure you take care of yourself, those around you, and your obligations.
---
We usually lose too, we can't put up with their speed.
---
I just go grab icewing bunker and by the time it's been capped the game is almost over. (I'm horde)
---
Vanilla vs classic*
---
This is literally what players who complain about the Menethil Harbour Boats are like.  
---
Oh I'm too lazy to get a guild mate to help me, \*'gets ganked'\* hurr it's the boats fault!
---
I don't think it will come, and I sincerely hope it won't come. Indeed the time around TBC and WotLK was the most profitable years for this game with the highest sub numbers, and TBC was the expansion I personally most enjoyed with, but let's be honest, it's the first step toward retail with the addition of flying mount, new races, horde paladin/alliance shaman, arena and the irrelevance of the old world of Azeroth. If you despise modern retail, many features in it can be traced back to TBC. I'd say that it was the best expansion for raiders, but if you don't raid, I don't know what else is attractive to you. If you like PvP, then you would find that resistance makes every fight long and boring.
---
How much is horde av que?
---
&gt; So servers triple the size of the original caps weren't a fuck up?
---
Can't see how that has anything to do with the stuff people complain about in here, so no. 
---
&gt; Allowing people to trade gold from retail to classic wasn't a fuck up?
---
You can't even do that, so that's just a lie and not a fuck-up.
---
&gt; Going mostly silent on class altering bugs that have been around since the beta wasn't a fuck up?
---
Not really informed about this one, might be true.
---
&gt; Honor before BGs on servers with the massive population wasn't a fuck up?
---
Honor before BGs is how it was back then. I don't see how server population affects people abusing ways to farm honor. 
---
The whining of the community trying to blame Blizzard for stuff that they (the community) themselves created is just pathetic.
---
Sounds like the issue might be with your guild loot system...
---
it means lul
---
AQ 40 Avenger pally gear and the warrior gear also look extremely dull and washed out compared to its original vanilla model. something with the new lighting im assuming is fucking it up.
---
You can frost trap the backdoor jump too, even more effectively since they'd miss the jump.
---
Honestly if you don't roll need on AV loot you're deranged
---
Well 1/2539 is the chance. Or aprox 0.04%
---
I don't know what gear you are running for hit, but I've had great results from using TS, Devilsaur and BSR and TER as rings (a long with the hit bracers ofc)
---
you know you're losing the AV as alliance when you see like half the raid on welfare mounts
---
This version of AV marks the start of the decline of WoW and its classic values. Protip, there is more of this come TBC. I dream of revamped classes and talents in a classic+ setting but with Blizzard as it is this seems like an unreasonable think to hope for.
---
AKA russians
---
My winrate so far is 0/9.
---
It's going well...
---
Yes, some of the best priests in my pug runs are just spamming flash heal. Try that in a progression fight...
---
&gt; Okay, so you arent blaming God for rape being a thing?
---
You know that's essentially what you are doing when you're blaming Blizzard for stuff the community does right?
---
why is the whole chat box black?
---
Don’t paint your cynicism on me bud
---
Respec cost takes away money from the economy and helps fighting inflation.
---
Unlocking a second spec for 1000G and needing to talk to your class trainer to swap between them could have worked.
---
How many games have you played? I'm averaging 300 rep per game, which is about 130 games to exalted.
---
It depends on population, most fizzled out overnight so 6-12 hours was more common than multi day on most severs.
---
They're not MMO PvP. They're essentially just mini games tacked onto an MMORPG. You might as well play a MOBA to avoid the gear and class imbalance issues because most of the advantages of an MMO are gone (e.g. a huge overworld where you can have ever-changing PvP encounters on varying terrain).
---
But an open world PvP system *requires* a code of honor, otherwise it just becomes a mindless zerg fest like the past months in Classic have been. Like in Dark Age of Camelot, where the best groups decided to only fight 8v8 among each other and not interfere with ongoing fights.
---
Kills 3 people - "I think I killed their entire team" lmao
---
It might surprise you, but for some people having fun is the incentive.
---
On what server are you and are you horde? 
---
If you're on Noggenfogger EU and Horde and want to commit - i'd say join us as we're building a core raid group atm and I'll have a talk with you and your friends and you can all have officer roles/other roles to help make the guild grow into a stable and, more importantly, fair guild
---
Nothing? Not a simple Little Response? xD I thought so...

What kind of insane being are you?

and number 6 on top 10 world of warcraft mysteries, what did lunatic say?
---
I'm leveling a Warrior (Tank) for the first time (played Paladin Tank in BC).
---
I have enough points in Protection to get Last Stand (and Improved Shield Block), and am working towards Arms for improved Rage.
---
For tanking up to 60, should I put focus on Protection, or is Arms viable? Arms seems like it would make leveling easier, and generate more aggro. Is the extra survivability from Protection necessary?
---
The best thing ever is when a Tauren Warrior picks up the Berserker buff in that little hut on the Alliance side. The buff makes them larger, so now they don't fit through the door anymore and are stuck until they remove the buff or have a target to charge/intercept.
---
Happened to me on my Druid as well, but luckily I thought of using the smaller cat form to escape.
---
No. You just need Epic Mount Riding Skill.
---
There is no rating...

These never get as much traction as the whine thread. The subreddit is negativity driven

Why would you unsubscribe?

You will get better gear than rank 14 when naxx comes out if you are in a raiding guild for all specs but hybrid classes spec-ed in dps
---
Expire. They last 15 seconds after placed and can then be looted
---
Zero keybinds 0.0
---
Is there a particular reason you talk like an incel or is it just from exposure?
---
no
---
They should have dropped the debuff cap (technical limitation) but kept the population cap (gameplay decision)...
---
What’s that addon called that adds “targeted by”?
---
Well for all I care they can lower the honor gain next week if this week is unfair.
---
But, but I like teaming with russkies...
---
You're complaining about not getting gear after 10 days LMAO

I don't think I said that, anywhere.

You think you should get loot after 10 days?

For feral dps raid BIS lists include several mc epics like wristguards of stability (which I have) and core hound tooth (which I can get) l, but compromises the 9% hit cap unless you have band of accuria. Should I drop the hit cap for epics/stats? On one hand hit increases omen of clarity price, but at the same time crits synergises well with increased combo points and smoother rotations. I parsed 95 (ilvl) on Sulfuron Harbinger this week with hit cap intact and the epics in my bag, so I currently stick to my hit blues.
---
You can hearth to kargath, have horde guards, can repair, etc.
---
I think lvl 19 priest is grear... skill wand specialisation and get the best wand for your level and you can basicly auto shoot people to death in like 4 blows ... put your bubble, healing, DOT and rest of the spells in there and you got yourself a highly efficient, self sufficient caster
---
Been playing this game since the original open beta in November of 2004 and just rolled on my first PvE server ever.  Always thought I’d be ‘missing out’ on world PvP, but the reality is I NEVER enjoyed ‘world PvP’ because it really doesn’t play out the way I hype it up in my head.  It’s really only ganking in reality which I don’t enjoy doing or having done to me.  Not sure why it took me 15 years to finally realize this, but I don’t plan on playing on a PvP server again if a PvE option exists.  I’ll get my PvP fill in BG’s or other designated PvP aspects of the game and be perfectly fine with it.
---
I afkd in vanilla

Haha i got one today. cheeeeeers \^)

Just got my 6th piece of the set yesterday :) so i'm working on it. I'll try finding mad's videos on this, thank you.
---
The thing about 49 thinking for me was it’s a really good bracket for alts if you wanna pvp a lot on an alt without having to spend a tonne of time raiding to get viable gear.  Instead you can farm mostly relatively easy and relatively cheap gear to get your absolute bis.  And but most of it with gold instead of taking a lot of time running alt raids.
---
They do this for honor, so this will never stop.
---
I did this with Paladins. Herilooms, dungeons and PvP. I'd lock my exp and dungeon farm for gear. Then blast my way through BG's until I leveled enough to exp lock and farm again.
---
Went through I think 3 Paladins to 60, with my brother.
---
Horde typical AV honor is 2.4k-3.2k about 90% of the time. Don't know where you get that 1.3k from.
---
Where's my $5?
---
Escapist behaviour is not something to condone, normalize, celebrate, or be proud of. Get help.

When I think of 6ft3 athletes who have honed their phsyiques and reflexs to perfection I think of Asmongold and Timthetatman.

Nothing man :)
---
Had someone asking people to pass so he would greed for enchanting. I suspect he was joking thouhg.
---
&gt;in AV so they less likely will queue and rushing drek takes more time for alliance now. Chances are that there are still geared horde doing AV so they might have a good chance winning while getting 
---
If the horde literally doesn't defend at all, Alliance can just pull warmasters without waiting for Relief Hut to flip, thus straight engaging Drek with 35+ people the moment they enter the base
---
This was so wonderful and so feel good. As long as he's not horde.
---
They need to rebalance the raids anyway, if they are anything like MC they are going to be too easy.
---
Like MC is that easy it’s actually boring. I’m almost fully geared now and there’s not much keeping me from logging in.
---
Honestly I still enjoy the franchise. I played up until legion which was pretty horrible. That being said I have high hopes for Shadowlands, and really hope that they've taken something from the amount of players they had returning to play classic, in terms of game design and mechanics. I know that they have already, but hope to see it in many aspects of the game.
---
But as I understood, they fixed it right? It is not possible to report someone anymore?
---
Yeah cause they all left 5 mins in probably :P
---
They need to announce it before Naxx is released (doubt they will have people playing WoW with no content updates for 9+ months after Naxx). My guess is they will announce it during AQ release or ZG.
---
Heartstriker EU , but with paid transfers we might all move to a more horde friendly Server.

The rest of the guild might still need some gear?

Surely you did not solo MC right? And those people helped you get all that gear.
---
thats exactly it
---
Push-ups, sit-ups, X-jumps, do some cleaning, laundry, food prep. Some may require line of sight to computer and loudspeakers.

They don't get any buffs. Or at least I don't think they do because they are already quite weak with all towers up.

No it isn't because it's not possible.
---
What world have you only lived in for 15 years?
---
Fish and watch movies
---
You know that you also gain honor for killing enemy players in battlegrounds?!
---
I just hit freidnly :( How much rep are you getting? I'm managing 315 per game it's quite naff.
---
Take your self promotion elsewhere for the love of god
---
Damn right. Go back to where your opinions came from!
---
True, no game-dev has ever made an enjoyable game.
---
This is my plan, save enough for the AV mount and a sizeable stack to keep plauing the AH. Think once I sell everything i'll be at atound 750g. Per day gold is really increasing atm, everything has rocketed up in price for some reason.
---
Yeah they are reliant on a FAP, but strong otherwise.
---
Totally agree with this TBC wasn't a bad expansion, but so many of it's features were highly damaging to the longevity of the game. Blizzard themselves admitted that flying mounts was only of the biggest game design mistakes they have made. I honestly don't see the point in making the same mistakes twice. Might as well learn from it and try a different approach.
---
this. one of the worst developments I absolutly despise in classic - people asking for gold to tank or heal
---
Yeah sorry, I meant that's why they introduced the buff to account for it. Worked well until everyone was geared up and could go back to ignoring it.
---
Calm down.  Drink some water.  Talk to a real live person, face to face about it.
---
I worked for Applecare for 2 years and you would be surprised how many people I talked to thought they’d updated things they hadn’t, or thought they restarted their phones but just put them to sleep.
---
It sucks but in the interest of saving time sometimes you have to assume user error before software error.
---
Makes you laugh at the knee-jerk pve rerolls. People warned others that phase 2 was going to be pure aids and they still rolled pvp. People then warned them that it will chill down when BGs release but yet again it was ignored.
---
Wonder how many pve rerollers are going to come crawling back to the pvpservers now the oldskool worldpvp starts.
---
It does matter though. Some alliance player on your Server will be in an av during the time and making the same amount of honor the horde does in yours.
---
Yeah, it doesnt matter if you are getting less than your opponent horde, but it shows that you are missing out on lots of honor/bg other members of your faction might not miss out on
---
When 90% of the playerbase on pvp roll horde, you know there is no such thing as "enjoying a video game"
---
2H is simple: 6% hit any you won't miss any yellow or white attacks with 305+ weapon skill.  9% without.
---
Alliance don't compete with horde for honor.
---
Paladin is also very strong at 19 as a huge amount of abilities for the level and very versatile.
---
You’re alliance,  it i can pass on for my plated rage bar brothers that all warriors /love you.
---
A renew, a fort and a dispel and timely heal you’ll have yourself a loyal pit bull who will never let a rogue jump you with out getting on him.
---
You’re like hunters except your pets have rage instead of focus and take multiple spells to tame.
---
There are a LOT of players, most are not willing to only go for the 'efficiancy' route. This is a game, people enjoy it. Plus once you get AV exalted you need WSG exalted for more BiS gear. You want to start that farm after getting the PvP stuff?
---
I just rediscovered druid, the class I mained for years on retail and I'm in love with it - again.  For some reason I rolled hunter for classic and now that I have nothing to do but raid 2 nights a week I've decided to give druid a go and man, I couldn't be happier. 
---
I don't care if they're not top performers at anything, druid is still the most fun and versatile class this game has.
---
You argument against a short zerg AV is that you don't have time? This is the best possible outcome for people with little time. You hit exalted fast and get what you need out of it. If you don't want to zerg, pick an AV with your friends and queue longer. Or just pick off a couple people on their way to Derek. It doesn't take much to stop their zerg.
---
In all fairness, you aren't really a shadow priest until you get shadow form at 40. When you do, you feel like a God. And you get that feeling every time you get a new rank of mind blast. Lol.
---
But warlocks are a class that seems lacking this time around. So that's a good road as well.
---
My druid alt is almost 60 and i power leveled it the whole way mob tagging
---
I want to heal but feel so weak. 
---
How do you heal as say a level 57 in brd. I tried and ran out of mana on the first mob pack and we wiped. I have about +250 healing gear and the rest is int stacked.
---
Also how do i even kill mobs my level, i am fully resto spec
---
I'd put my money on it being DBM. The addon itself tries to distinguish between BG raids and standard raids.
---
God I wish it was tho. 2 weeks in and I'm already over it
---
You specifically mentioned rankers though. For now we're hoping they're going to adjust AV honor gains or the meta will shift itself to make WSG competitive.
---
Yeah over 90% of people aren't getting past rank 10 or 11. At least in the first couple months.
---
ouch, that hurt right in the feelings
---
So all i have to do to get toxic premades to fuck off is cap that gy? I guess ill stop fighting the mages trying to stall.
---
Depends what your goals are really.. if wanting to max honor probably hearth to Kargath when you can and gank around BRM, or fly to azshara otherwise (assuming PvP server)
---
i think you missed the point. most people read the quest text the first time they play through the game / when they're younger, hence contextualizing WHY your character is doing the quest
---
the comic suggests that now, the player just reads the objective of the quest, and not the lengthy body of it
---
Tanks and Healers have no reason to do the dungeon for the 100th time - and why should they do it for free? Its not fun to guide a pug through a dungeon.
---
I know it is an issue with mine. I'm finding it impossible to gear up when I have to roll against 6 other hunters.

Out of curiosity, wouldn't it be better to keep your unit frames somewhere central, under your character for example, rather than somewhere off to the side? Assuming that you're healing, that is.

Haha I was just kidding shoulda /s just joking about how it literally stands for away from keyboard
---
Cool theory but no. Classic makes retail look good before the stockholders since they combine their sub numbers.

I don't think they would make JA Brack the ceo if he was that petty of a guy to put his feefees over business.

Awesome video!!!

Oh interesting. I’ve been wanting to get exalted with Ironforge but wasn’t looking forward to the cloth turn ins. Thanks for the info

That is soooo true...

1+1 = Blizzard

I fail my math test = Blizzard

My wife leaves me = Blizzard

I mean personally I can’t imagine playing the neutered pve experience in this game. It’s not insane that people want to play pve but it is pretty insane the number that think pve is somehow a superior game mode lol.

I enjoy turtles.

But he forgot to include the Rotting Bear Carcass!
---
Ya thats gonna be a problem when he is raiding and have to tap a button

Looks like SexyMap. There are other options for customizing the minimap in the addon as well.

It does work
---
Yup. Reason why they cant win for shit if we play any semblance of defense.

AOE taunt

Best HOTs in game

Just saying even these rankers need to realize they need to be in the top 1% on their faction to get past rank 11. So unless this game is your job good luck.
---
What's ridiculous about it?
---
I'm doing great with my standard UI, at this point I'm also really used to it, been playing for years without any UI-Changes, it's just not a thing for me.  
---
Objectively I'd agree with what you're saying though :)
---
Then you would see a few arms warrior dps.
---
Yeah. In a nutshell.
---
I'm using the [Curse Forge website](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons). You still need to look at what version you're downloading though, clicking on an addon, you should scroll down a bit on the addon page and check out the bottom right corner where there's usually two versions to download - one for retail and one for classic.
---
As d07RiV pointed out, all addons are not yet up to date as they're user-made and maintained, pro bono third-party creations. The current patch broke a lot of addons, but most that needed updating have new versions up there already.
---
I think the guy on the bycicle represents the whole classic community.
---
So it is the community that fucks something up (as a whole - even though it really is only a couple of People) and then blames Blizzard (which you are correct - probably is different People)
---
It’ll get easier in a week or two once everyone is done with their rep grind.
---
System -&gt; Advanced -&gt; make sure that your GPU is not set to "Automatic detection" or whatnot; select your actual graphics card from there. The patch made this setting switch over to integrated graphics for many users.
---
I've a resto shammy main, which I raid with, and a druid bear which I leveled just so I can tank for friends in 5-10 man instances, so looking to roll another char for BGs fun only :D
---
There's no theory to debunk... I know of the bluepost. It was just coincidence I found interesting.
---
Ah, an excellent point! I should get me a pair of those too.
---
How do you get the rare spawn dragon around your health bar and stuff? Nice win tho lol
---
Warrior loot is hotly contested. There’s warriors in my raid who’ve not got more than perhaps - piece of gear from mc simply due to bad rng on drops for melee.
---
Everyone thinks they will be rank 14.  No time for dungeons.
---
I have gotten about 2800 most game as alliance and usually takes around 8min if it goes longer we usually get a few hundred more. And then you get an additional 395 honor from the 3 tokens.
---
My god I would instantly jump on your Train if it wasn't the 298472 post about a different Topic this time - saying that this is the first Major fatal mistake...
---
Has been said with every update recently and never was it true. 
---
So I can't take this serious sorry.
---
Yes AV looses it's Magic once you are exalted. Yes that sucks.
---
Yes it is even worst that it gives so much honor but I am sure blizz will fix that.
---
In the end AV will be like always - a zergfest - once all the People that just want to farm rep are gone.
---
Just give it some time
---
 Nah people are rep grinding right now.
---
Whenever I see my eye of kilrog out it just does and the mobs drop agro. Even with a shield. Am I missing something here or has this been Patched?
---
Blame that on the People though.
---
There is always plenty of Players that want to do pvp but THE MAJORITY of Players doesn't want to and just farm rep.
---
You are pretty much outnumbered.
---
Give it 2-3 weeks and you will have much more zergfests I am sure
---
alliance? yep
---
Its a shame that you are parsing 2nd and 3rd out of the 4 boomkins that raid.
---
Just like hunters.

It's not that simple. Aion online took that approach and the whole dynamic of aerial combat is incredibly difficult to engage in, yet alone enjoy. Aside from that fact, suddenly bumping into people in the open world becomes almost none existent because rather than having a flat plain to run into other people, you have an entire void of space that equates to several hundred times more than that of a standard land zone - which breaks the community up further. For obvious reasons this then makes things such as world PVP / random encounters extremely rare. If it was restricted to a single zone, that might work and be a compromise, but otherwise it's a very difficult game design due to its inherent drawbacks.
---
Very nice. Indeed, knowing when he's gonna spawn helps a ton :)
---
I usually quit the MMO once I notice myself start to play that second way.
---
In my opinion it is the first really fatal one, because it doesn't change. The gsnking at least stopped with the start of battlegrounds.
---
Hopefully, what you do in life will matter to you though. In 50 years, you might look back at your life and reflect on what you've accomplished. Just a thought.
---
1hr av lmao no thanks. After 15min I usually go afk.
---
40-49 is my favorite bracket! I eventually got bored of it in vanilla and chose to finish leveling. I started 60 with an unstoppable force and most of the blue pvp set, so I continued to have a good time at 60, though getting rolled by the first BWL geared premade was quite a new experience!
---
You havent met the arugal alliance.
---
It's so fucked that actual pvp isnt the meta for getting ranked well in a hardcore pvp system. 
---
Was this the meta in vanilla? I had fun back then, and I'm having fun pvping wsg now, but holy shit theres something so unsatisfying about not being rewarded well for being an actual pvp player instead of mindlessly grinding pve content.
---
But I guess we already knew how bad/grindy the ranking system was. I just didnt think pve content would ever be the meta in a pvp system. I wish av was never released in this state. I wish blizz listened to peopl who said they wanted old av. Maybe theyll see how bad this is for pvp.
---
After you guys bitched for 3 nonstop weeks about "fairness" in WPVP?
---
i got lucky with the hides, skinned 2 beasts b2b and got hides from both of those. Sold one for 400g and trying to sell other one as well for 400g but it hasnt been selling. I dont see point of that item for 900g if BWL is right around the corner and drops way better chest. 
---
I am also missing a lot of hit rating and it seems to mess up my rotation. I usually get around 95 in warcraft logs as well but could be better with some additional hit gear. I am running an hybrid spec for threat (when i need to tank in beer form) and dps. Need def ony neck for hit rating and band of accuria hopefully
---
should i continue running this build - &gt;  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLV0oZEx0sfbdtV](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLV0oZEx0sfbdtV)  
---
or this  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhoZeL0sfbdtV](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhoZeL0sfbdtV)  
---
will be mostly dpsing and OT for some bosses and tanking 5 mans
---
In my hypothetical world the buff cap is removed instead so I can actually toss a HoT on my Druid. As of now HoTs are banned in raid due to buff cap.
---
What does it change if you win or lose the BG? Honest question.
---
Nice, then 6% is what I'll aim for. Although I think there's still a 1% miss chance that you can't get rid of, no matter the +hit stats.
---
Cross server should be apply only to medium or low population servers and servers where one faction has 30% or lower a/h ratio on one-side. Since Classic servers has 5x more population, Servers which always high and has 40-60 (or better) ratio shouldn't have problem with the queue.
---
Crazy.
---
Yea, but you can at least see why they tried, no? Faction imbalance being one of the main issues they wanted to prevent.
---
Great content huh.
---
I'm pretty I didn't read much of the quests in 2005. I came to WoW without knowing any previous Warcraft games, I had no idea of anything in the world and I didn't understand most of what the quests were about. I just figured out the goals and pretty much forgot the rest.
---
If anything, I'm paying much more attention to the quest text in Classic right now, as I've got 15 years to grasp all the subtleties of the Warcraft lore.
---
Swear words? fine, kids can block it. A bit of sex talk? Boob talk? A kid old enough to play WoW should be expected to at least be getting to the age where they're hearing about this stuff..  What does a "sensitive subject" mean exactly? Talking about the rights of another human? Do you think people should be allowed to be racist or sexist in chat? 
---
The problem is, lines have to be drawn. You might be a perfectly adjusted adult, but we're seeing more and more psychos that have no issues with being psychos online.. They shout all kinds of hate speech about anything they can just to look edgy and get a response.. Fine.  
---
I think we all see these people in chat, and we always know, even when they veil it, or say cryptic shit that they're saying what they're saying SPECIFICALLY as an outlet to be a shit person.. Literally everyone who isn't underdeveloped or a child sees these hateful people saying hateful things in chat and wants them muted instantly.   
---
By blurring the lines when you say you "don't think it should be that heavily policed" you open the platform to these hateful people. Protecting literal childrens right to play video games without being subject to hate speech should come before anyone's right to discuss ANYTHING.
---
I'm doing it for the offhand for raids and for the ring/weapon if I go enh
---
Ranks are still within your own faction on your realm.
---
saw one drop last night
---
also lost
---
Every druid ability is broken in its own way
---
Affliction Warlocks, Sub Rogues, Arms Warriors, Shadow Priests would all be significantly more desirable.
---
Whoosh
---
Time elapsed: 1 hour 18 minutes.
---
It’s a world drop afaik?
---
Yes, in this instance. Usually I have a lot of time to set aside for shit like this, but not this time around.
---
Although I guess it makes sense. Wow Classic rewards early action heavily in nearly all instances.
---
Druids exel at healing main tank with two heals over time and horns
---
So funny
---
It takes 3 seconds to tick. Very rarely useful fromy experience and it's always better to save the CD for another potion.
---
Nice, resto shamans are pretty  awesome at pvp, once they are kitted out. So might be worth testing that out if you haven't already. 
---
With priests you generally have to be healing spec for group pvp unless you got really good shadow gear and the group isn't min maxing. If your solo pvp then shaddow priest is great fun! 
---
Or get some flag carrying on your druid! That looks like good fun.
---
Actually you’re wrong. as long as they do turn ins they are being more useful than the people actually afk
---
Lol my bad as well.
---
Some say their are avarage, i say they are best at everything
---
Explanation would be nice ...
---
The fun factor? Clearly you are not a competitive person. I am very competitive. I hate losing, and i like winning. At everything. Always.
---
Pretty accurate
---
You're competing against your own faction for rank. If you get less honour, you're either losing out to people in your faction getting more honour or you're not getting as far ahead of others in the same faction.
---
they're good i think he just means it's harder to play. e.g. on my warrior i just mash buttons and do OK. :)
---
In case someone hasn't seen the [original](http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b305/GrifKingdom/pictures_nanos_bro.jpg)
---
Alliance wins most of the time in the BG that's designed in their favor? Who would have thought.
---
So you let guildies roll so they can trade you it and are mad the pugger won? The irony
---
Just like wow
---
What class did you roll?
---
It's the warrior discord, it seems like quite a decent place for all kinds of theorycrafting - read the rules and FAQs etc there before posting, though.
---
Still I don't see the harm in trying to get some theorycrafting and a discussion going here, it's not like it will obscure all the low effort memes and AV complaints.
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
Ofc
---
There is no reason for geared tank to tank for hundreth time scholo/strat/lbrs when there is no single drop for them, all greens/vendor items are won by 58 mage you are practically boosting and your repair bill is 10g, because those 58 pulled wipe lol.
---
So pay up or roll a tank my mate.
---
Seriously it's like everyone on this subreddit hates the game. I like grinding for nice rewards and classic scratches that itch like nothing else.
---
Even if turtles would happen 100% of the time you will still get your rep sooner or later as it does not take that much time anyway.
---
The thotbots
---
AV seem to be getting longer. My average AV time seems to have doubled yesterday. We even summoned the Icelord once.
---
My only real comparison is from Arthas back on vanilla where I know Alliance had ridiculous queues, but I think it was actually 2:1 instead of 60-40 so I'm not sure what point queues become unreasonable, but I'm happy with anything that gets more people from the same server together.
---
But you are having fun, and havin fun aint wasted time
---
Just seems crazy the gold per hour per would be that high.
---
Competitive AV, I gotta laugh.
---
I'm competitive : I want to make the most honor per hour to rank up. That's competition. Results are what matters. 
---
If you enjoy seeing scoreboard that says "waow you win gg" that's not competitive.
---
All versions of AV are shit. AV was shit in vanilla before the patch and after the patch. 
---
At least this version lets us get our rep quicker. 
---
If anything I'd like to see the amount of honor gained in AV turned down so that you could reliably do WSG without fucking yourself.
---
Only way to implement them would be to 5 man raids so you don’t run into issues with the 16 debuff limit unfortunately.  So the direct answer is, you don’t.
---
Is he soloable?? Surely rogues get crushed
---
Yeah, but that is only 3-4 months, which fits well with a TBC release if it were to be announced at AQ/ZG release. How many will stay after 9 or more months of no new content?
---
Unspoken majority: A 12 hour+ game of AV sounds like it would be fun for the first 2-3 days, and then just get unbelievably toxic.
---
I mean gnome/dwarf racial are incredible too. Gnome racial is BiS in pvp for warriors for example.
---
Could be to share with the rest of the guild that donated...
---
Oh no I played one day shortly after returning from a one month solo trip through Europe as evidenced by my post history. Such a nolifer, you’re right.
---
I wish I had a guild like that, so I could play my warrior like I had intended aka as ARMs
---
Yeah, definitely not the community that's being toxic and shitty.
---
I appreciate that :)
---
Did it 15 times in a row last night in a 15 man premade. We don't even send a mage or hunter to slow the horde.
---
4 pieces
---
During an ama where they was asked to, their response was "#NoChanges". But that one specific thing is impossible to do "No changes". If you keep the mats the same, people hoard them beforehand and that's a change. If you change up the mats, that's a change.
---
lol, what no name realm did you end up on?
---
Why play MMOs then? Single player games are specifically made to deliver the first type of gameplay and usually do it better than MMOs that try to cater to both.
---
How many people do you think are doing this? Why do you think the average player would want them back?
---
60 to 90 minutes isn't anywhere near Classic AV though? That shit lasted multiple days.
---
As you should.
---
As...
---
[*Pause*]
---
...you should.
---
My priest has a leaf and my hunter has an eye
---
Blizzard still put up system without even thinking of the potential abused linked to it.
---
It's like they don't even know how player interact these days.
---
DEV cannot be responsible for every problems and they actually take some good decision
---
 ie: early BG release.
---
Plus you are delusional to think that the player where that much different back then, it was all about glory and power through gear.
---
If people had the Intel it would likely be not even shared like it's now and wouldn't be abused at the scale its now, but if people knew they where an easy way they would have take it. 
---
Blizzard aren't the solely responsible but you cannot dismiss their failure.
---
The point of my ironic post is to poke fun at the people who expected for the classic release to be exactly as it was when they were a noob.  A lot of players have had unrealistic expectations, like seeing the world through the eyes of a child again (and that everyone else playing would too).  Nothing can recreate that, and that's the point of my post.
---
Hey, unless you have a pro-alliance anti-horde statement of some sort you're not allowed to post on this subreddit! 
---
/s
---
One other thing I would like to add to your statement "Fun is tied to novelty" that certainly has to do with minmaxing, is that "learning is fun". It is a fact that learning is a fun experience for our brains. And when I say learning I don't mean studying or going to the library/university (although for some people even these things are fun, also because their brain is learning), I mean learning something new e.g. in a game. Learning that Priests/Warlocks can fear you, learning that Stranglethorn Vale is a dangerous place to be, learning where to find your trainer and where to find the dungeons, learning the general game loop, the language, and so on.
---
If you minmax and just do the things a guide tells you, you don't get to learn these things by yourself which hugely decreases the fun your brain experiences from learning these things. Finding things out by yourselve and verifiying their truth and importance is a huge fun factor in any game or activity. 
---
I merely minmax e.g. my talent specs since I don't feel like reading through everything and calculating what is the best spec for my purposes.
---
Nonetheless, I would like to point out that both approaches to the game can be fun for different reasons. I just feel like minmaxing takes away the "learning" part in fun
---
In all honesty, there is so much to do in retail that I’m more likely to play retail the top way and classic the bottom way.  Not to mention how competitive classic is. Only reason I play classic is if I’m feeling nostalgic but most of my time is spent on retail.
---
Someones been a busy boy ! Healing pugs can get pretty lame fast, i feel your pain. Find yourself a good premade though and you will be showered with compliments making it more enjoyable. Healing classes struggle to kill most things unless there's a massive gear/skill difference unfortunately. 
---
Sounds like you need to make your way to the character creation screen.
---
The PvP grind in vanilla has never at any point in time been about skill.  It’s strictly about who can spam BG’s for 18 hours+ a day the longest / fight off the depression that sets in in real life if you actually do it.
---
If you skill to be a factor, you’ll have to either engage in dueling for fun / player run tournaments, or hope TBC releases with arenas.
---
These guys are awesome! And here i am my friends irl ditched me after my mom passed because i was too depressed and hard to deal with.  Bravo to these guys!
---
It killed open world gangbanging? Good. There was nothing fun or even close to how it was back in the days during p2. Getting jumped by 10 lvl 60's whenever you wanted to quest or run to a dungeon might have been fun for you, but for the majority it werent.
---
Maybe in raids, but in dungeons it's common for healers to be unable to find groups, because there's too much of them. Warlocks on the other hand are rare and in demand.
---
Have you checked you are actually in a raid group?
---
Horde isnt any better in the open world. Havent been able to quest peacefully since Tanaris basically as there are constant gank squads going around camping people.
---
He looks pretty cute throwing his little frostbolt in anger
---
For warriors that still need HoJ, you can two-man angerforge quite easily with a priest. Here is a video of how to do the run: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1uaxWrB7EpM
---
Using this skip, you only need to clear 4 packs to get to Angerforge. These are easily doable if the priest uses mind control on one of the mobs. This is how I got my HoJ after losing mine to a hunter the first time one dropped.
---
....is that how I'm supposed to have been doing it?
---
Any numbers to back that up or are you just following the sub trend of bullshit conjecture without proof?
---
you can move the raidgroup in standard UI, no addons needed ;)
---
You would see a lot more shadow priests and locks. Shadow weaving stacking would be nuts. Enhancement shammys would be allowed to show up probably.
---
The dance.
---
yeah hordes like to stall games for 0 reason
---
Read where?
---
The rank 10 mounts are 90g.
---
I got traveler helm green from AV lol..feels like a waste of roll
---
Pick herbs
---
No, I'm not trying to take away anything from anyone, and I'm honestly surprised that's what you took away from my comment. 
---
I think that if you value your achievements in any game then there is nothing wrong with that. If you're a guild leader of a successful guild you will probably remember that for the rest of your life.
---
Perhaps single player was the wrong term here, there are games you can play with other people as well that are designed to be finite and don't devolve into min/maxing. MMO just seems like the wrong genre if you want to avoid that.
---
Google chrome has a picture in picture plugin which lets you overlay any video, not just youtube, over your game. You can watch netflix while playing classic.
---
Beautiful stuff :)
---
I know, it just doesn't feel right anywhere else at this point :)
---
but you do know 95% of games are now 10 min
---
If they announce TBC at least 5 months after naxx release, there won't be any content update for at least a year. That will kill classic more than a few guilds breaking up because TBC classic is coming 3-5 months after naxx release.
---
Is AV bugged or not?   Why are the last bosses not getting buffed by the towers?   Why can you pull the mobs out one at a time outside?   Why can you pull them so far out before they leash?
---
Perception is nuts aswell.
---
I think it's easier to tank on a druid than on a warrior. My fingers hurt tanking on a warrior. And it's sort of easier to gear up the druid tank since all of your stuff is in dungeons. (DPS though, yeah, I wouldn't even try.)
---
Is that a trinket/consumable?
---
As soon as you defend Alliance folds
---
Yes no I get what you are saying. (Yes no - best Thing I ever wrote) xD
---
I'm totally with you that the old AV would probably have been nicer. But then again a huge wave of complaints about that would probably have come in too :P
---
I guess you never make everyone happy... 
---
Everbody preferences are different too so for some this is like "meh I don't really care about AV anyway" and for others - perhaps even you - this is a huge deal because you were really looking Forward to this...
---
I have to remind myself sometimes that not everyone thinks like me :p
---
Also there is no real solution to this as you said. It is going to stay like this - I don't think they'll add one that is the old Version so we could decide - that Train just left the Station and it won't turn around.
---
I do understand you are upset - if it was something different I could also be very upset because there just is some things you really want.
---
I'm hoping that it'll Change (metawise) and that you can enjoy some AV later on too :)
---
aww, the horde warlock is sad he's forced to fight on equal footing in BG's now. It's okay, you still have soul link
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/news=299484/warsong-gulch-vendor-item-clarifications-items-added-in-patch-1-6-coming-with-bw
---
&gt;~~it's~~ *we're* just less in it
---
I think this is a far assessment. I came into this with the intent to take my time and I have really enjoyed it. However, I have noticed that sometimes I slip into the second panel and get anxious because I am not 60 yet. Then I usually take a day or two off and come back.
---
My favorite is whenever another alliance group showed up they would all log off in org and flame the alliance for “honor jumping” and claiming org was their area
---
They were introduced in P4 in vanilla.
---
WotLK was the beginning of Retail. TBC was an expanded Vanilla.
---
Arenas. Expanded professions. Viable specs. Heroic dungeons. Badges and gear tokens. PvP gear. Various raids with truly demanding attunements.
---
Flying wasn't bad in TBC. Netherstorm was a great zone, and Blade's Edge utilized the flying very well.
---
Leveling was still a relevant experience. I think they cut the XP requirement only by 20% or so. So a 200 hour experience became a 140 hour experience.
---
TBC was great. WotLK was the true beginning of the end.
---
Depends on spec and rest of your gear. I think if you're a swordspec rogue with ony head/DM Buffs it should be doable. I personally haven't tried.
---
Resto pots are insane, situational, yes, but absolutely insane when used correctly.
---
I did warrior priest with a bud and it was a blast! Both classes complement each other well. Lock Priest is very strong too. Shaman + anything is pretty cool too, loads of utility. I’d roll hunter or Druid with a shaman so you’ll both have increased speed (ghost wolf+ aspect of the cheetah/travel form)
---
Kargoz has a 30 min video on YouTube about the strengths of duo leveling. It’s crazy informational and will answer loads of questions for you about leveling as a twosome.
---
Yu ugly for alli tho.
---
I agree entirely about the cross server BGs.
---
I mostly agree about PvE AV, although I don't miss it much it would have been nice to have it for a while.
---
I absolutely don't agree about original, vanilla AV with that fucking Neutral Troll boss. I can't even remember his name but fuck that guy. Course he served an important purpose and him leaving is why Alliance and Horde just run past each other now, but still.
---
For me, I like the idea of playing with other people. But I also enjoy the single player experience as well. Diablo 3, for example, I usually play solo.
---
“Why don’t these whiny kids just farm my honor for me so I can AFK in peace” doesn’t sound as badass as you think it does.
---
Fishing is okay with its part of the game.
---
Bots can DIAF
---
As someone who missed out on vanilla WoW I’m having a blast.
---
Louder for the people in the back please!
---
And are you on of of the three mega servers?
---
Call to arms Alterac Valley,!!!
---
Twas my favorite way to level back in Wrath
---
You’ll be fine you think Blizz wants to piss people off like that and miss out on 45$ for banning 3 people for a month? Nah you can give your friends whatever you want!
---
Same, I specifically remember in Classic having my lvl 60 talent built fully mapped out before I got to lvl 10 on any and every character I played.
---
What where are you suggesting he move them to? Bottom middle above action bars? I'm confused but would like to know more as well as reasoning.
---
I join AV and run around looking to PVP in the middle.
---
We dont need ferals though, especially almost all of them want to be feral tanks. We need healers.
---
Good one
---
Sure 90% people on pvp server roll horde for faction/race/aesthetic. Yet  on pve servers, it's always the majority is alliance.
---
Warrior. They hit like absolute fucking trucks once they get decent twink gear.
---
I was fishing in there at lv 150.
---
all of it?
---
Fair. I thought you were agreeing with the guy at the top of this thread.
---
In my experience, if you don’t rush Drek down in 8 mins, Horde wins at 11mins.
---
I really enjoy my hunter but I’ve been eyeing priests. At 19 they have a great kit and some really OP gear like gravestone scepter, paladins too with their mail and and lots of skills
---
The Soulsborne games do singleplayer/multiplayer quite well, in my opinion.
---
I'd say at about 250 spell damage and 3k hp is when the fight becomes a lot easier.
---
Were those pants added in patch 1.6?
---
Awesome, how long would the av have to be for this to be efficient?
---
Psychiatrists are not magicians. Staying alive is healthy.
---
What turn ins? You cant turn in any fish. It is all cool if they take mines or whatever and then turn in the stuff. But with fishing they help noone.
---
I think they do all right overall, AFAIK they have less utility and cooldowns to use than warriors, but they seem pretty fine except they have a hard time getting def capped which is (to my understanding) one of the main reasons for them not being popular tanks in raids; that and their lack of cooldowns. 
---
They come with a big HP pool which compensates to an extent, and I think they perform well over pretty much all levels (based on healing them in dungeons), and at least for current raid content they are just fine.
---
Horde
---
\&gt;  or npc 
---
So... keep grinding on those harpies is what I'm hearing.
---
How many alliance are there on pvp servers? How many of them roll gnome? How many horde are there on pvp servers?
---
Fold laundry, find stranglekelp in south shore or ride north to WPL and kill kids who think it’s now safe to quest again.
---
used to be against the rules... really irritating. i guess my opinion isn't shared with many anymore.
---
People playing Classic will keep playing Classic because that's what they asked for. We understand that there's no content after naxx.
---
But announcing TBC before naxx will simply siphon a chunk of players from Classic to TBC before it even releases. Repeating the same mistake of Vanilla.
---
Thats why WoW Classic is 10x as popular as Retail WoW.
---
5-12min
---
PvP mounts require rank 11 I believe?
---
May be you should stop being a hypocrite?
---
Probably server specific, but I really don't remember any actual PvP waiting for the queues anyway.
---
I legitimately don't know where Horde queues for AV from. The AB queue for both Alliance and Horde is in a pretty defended location and it's the same with WSG. When waiting for the queue I used to just jump around the portal, same as anyone else.
---
You get a badass wolf and we get... a ram :(
---
This is what the games all about ^^
---
Please shave me off some of that good luck I will be that Level on my rogue soon too and I don't want to waste my life in there :3
---
He's from the upside down land.
---
thumb stands for thumbnail
---
Accurate.
---
It is because that was how AV was in 1.12... 1.12 is arguably the worst version of AV that exists. There was no AV quite as bad as this one, neither in the past nor future.
---
If you are interesting in using pots: you can also prepot the greater arcane protection elixir. They are surprisingly cheap (80 silver or something)
---
I remember in vanilla we had AV matched which lasted several days...
---
My hunter's Viper Sting and Intimidation/Beastial Wrath would like a word.
---
I can fully customize the sizing of mine but I do like them to be a bit bigger as I heal and have info on the bars. Might try rearranging tho. Thanks for the info!
---
I feel like a game you play is to have fun and accomplish things outside of your real life, so maybe just chill. 
---
You’re not losing a whole AV due to one dude fishing, meanwhile, there’s 15 of your team fighting mid.
---
Im on a pvp server level 18 hunter. Been playing since release just questing and chillin. Havent had any problems.
---
Saw a level 30 ally priest we waved, he killed my pet then laughed and moved on with his day. Which was kind of hilarious
---
damn PVP.  i may do it anyway.! hahah thank you !
---
You can get a Frostsaber though.
---
Your druid is trash then. Druid TPS with MCP is way higher this early on.
---
Attending a 2-3 hours raid weekly is called "nolifing" these days?
---
I didn't know how keybinds work until almost the end of icc lol
---
Boomer meme tbh
---
You sit in the capital city and queue for a match that instantly takes you to the BG, that's same thing as LFG. I remember playing before the battlemasters were added, and we actually had to go to the place to queue. And sometimes there would be world PvP happening with people waiting in queues.
---
Arms is a massive dps loss unless mobs are dying in 30 seconds or there is a ton of cleave. In 5 mans arms is actually better.
---
Level 20+ and still didn't know what the EXP bar was? Yikes.
---
Is that why every top guild with DPS pushing over 1k DPS uses a warrior tank?
---
It’s your own damn fault you play this way. I don’t.
---
I’m 49 currently. Been playing since classic came out with my best friend. It’s been so much fun.
---
My girlfriend - now fiancé - loves the game as well. She’s never gamed before but we’ve been leveling together with an alt of mine.
---
Classic is amazing.
---
I quit the game today. Sold all my stuff and gave my gold to a guildie. Feels like I can breathe again, the game took up so much time just thinking about it and playing it. Guess I was a bit addicted and it was not good for other parts of my life. People say that its nice to have an escpe, for me it started to become more than that. It became the thing I enjoyed doing the most.
---
But im happy for all the good times and i really think this community is fun and awesome! Just wanted to share and enjoy the coming patches and BG’s.
---
Yeah I know but requires a lot more rep grinding!

If you're able to grind somewhat later on (like Zul'farrak) you can earn yourself a pretty penny too.
---
I enabled picture in picture in Firefox. Load up my streaming service and pop it into pip in the corner. Then farm. Usually just watch shows I’ve seen already though so I don’t have to fully pay attention.
---
that exists right now.
---
Eh. When you make a commitment to others you have at least some obligation to give them some closure.
---
The post is about unrealistic and misplaced expectations.
---
So true it hurts.
---
Oh wow that is super clean and nice. Idk if I could make my action bars invisible. I swap between toons quite often. I might have to look into bartender tho. Thanks!
---
Primal Aggression is a trap. You shouldn't pick it up unless you're a 100% cat dps and avoiding all bear talents. Instead, may I interest you in Thick Hide? It's a huge armor buff for when you're off tanking/dungeon tanking.
---
The extra threat talent is incredibly nice if you need it. Personally, I don't have threat problems with my guild, and I can skip it. (I'm very liberal in my crowd pummeler use. :p)
---
One other consideration for you - The talent that adds extra combo points for your crits is a dps increase in the single digits. It's very comfortable to use while soloing, but if you're mostly in groups, Primal Rage (the rage version) is amazing, as it can proc from any crit you do.
---
Tbf most of the hot weather (at least in Sydney) as in November when all the bushfires started
---
How are you doing a premade? I couldn't even get into same av with 2 friends
---
WoW is really not the same, though
---
It is exactly that.
---
Classic appears to be doing bad but Blizzard is the only one knowing how well it is doing. How the patches are REALLY percieved etc. 
---
On Reddit you always pretty much only get the complainers. Why would you be on reddit if you are currently loving what you are playing?! And why would you write something when all is fine.
---
I think People are just too entitled nowadays
---
I will tank now for greens or orbs to finally get my epic mount! :D
---
Also damn. Jealous of the hides, grats. :P
---
Alliance have the edge in PVE because of a combination of racials being significantly better, and palas just barely edging out shamans in terms of utility.
---
Any gear setup advice for MC MT or OT? Or your gearset for 5 man?
---
I'm not. Its a game not a job just pay attention to yourself and try not to control every person in a 40 person BG
---
Sorry, but you're completely wrong.
---
Blizzard has the most power in influencing player behavior. IT's their game after all. And if players are acting outside the scope of what is expected they need to design the game in a way that encourages the behavior they want.
---
This hits home
---
Level 18 since release? That's pretty pathetic
---
Learn you place,  mortal!
---
Yeah I can't blame them if they're just trying to farm quick wins/rep. Turtling for an extended period of time sucks balls. I'd rather take the 15+queue than waste 30+ mins in there.
---
Got shit to do.
---
I think WoW was baby's first MMO for a lot of you, and it's got some serious nostalgia bias in place for things that just were never as good as you're imagining them.
---
And WoW quests are definitely one of those. The WoW questing system might have been a novelty when it first came out, but after the inundation of theme-park games that have copied it, it's clearly become a scourge on the genre if anything. 
---
Maybe back then I read the first few quests until I got to the tenth one which was basically the same thing as the last 9.
---
After that point, I'd read the description and skimmed for the area I had to go to do it, and then bring of thottbot if that wasn't clear enough.
---
Despite Grace of Air being *slightly* better in terms of total damage increase, I've not had a single melee ask for it over Windfury.
---
People always do the following:
---
* subtract 10 pounds from their weight 
---
* add 2 inches to their height
---
* say they win AV in 7 minutes
---
Absolutely, Alliance has more of the classic RP vibe of the righteous guys fighting evil, while Horde feels like a feral war pack.
---
I need to link to this video every time I hear people say you can't make friends playing computer games. Lovely.
---
Back in the day I only played Horde. This time around I played Alliance and honestly it's like a brand new game to me. When classic first launched, I just walked around Stormwind for an hour. 
---
Min-maxing is dumb. Have fun. I get to play an hour or two a night if I'm lucky, my main is a Druid which is something like 1-26-12 and I know it's probably a newb build but I don't care. Just enjoy the freaking game!
---
Yeah good guide, can a warrior and healer also solo arena?
---
Also a good chance that the people rolling Horde roll on PVP because Horde generally holds all the top end players and guilds on retail.
---
Which should be obvious, since once WSG/AB become the meta Horde will have 15-30 min queues while Alliance can play instantly.
---
No one who waited for classic wanted the nerfed AV. The second they announced it was gonna be the nerfed version, once again, everyone knew the outcome. It was always going to be grind for rep int he first two weeks, then never visit again.
---
Luckily most ppl enjoy WSG. My jam is AB, but thats not out yet.
---
You are not alone!
---
I am totally fine with that.
---
In on AV there is probably an average of 5-10 People not actively fighting an objective and rather AFK'ing / Fishing / Farming / on the Phone..
---
I sometimes am also on the phone. That is the great Thing about having 40 People :P 
---
So I don't care. No
---
I did a raid and AV. Gotta run some Strat UD for cape, or UBRS for last T0 piece, or WSG when AV gets boring. But tbh so far it's not as bad as many picture. There is even some PvP despite what they say!
---
Screw BoB IMO, too expensive for a short-time bis :)
---
the draenei starting areas where really cool. I loved the over-arching story
---
theres 3-4 a game now
---
I am looking for addons to help me to heal , dispell, buff a raid as a paladin, thank you
---
I've got a bridge in Brooklyn that's for sale.
---
Yeah that's a fair enough remark. :)
---
Arathi basin is so much hph that when it launches PvP will be the norm. Although it will be steamrolled because they will dodge other grenades ab at least involves actually murdering opposing faction members to hold points.
---
Thanks! Yea, that did take some getting used to, but it's a real space/vision saver. I started off with pulling down the alpha to \~30%, making them mostly transparent but forcing me to memorize the necessary stuff. I think I have 19 or 20 totems keybound, in addition to multiple ranks of Healing Wave, Chain heal, Earth shock and Frost shock + 1 rank of LHW and all utility spells - it's just practice. 
---
I only play one alt though, and last raid I tried to Life Tap back some mana on my shaman :) Coincidentally, it shares a key binding with my Dark Runes, so it did work out pretty well. 
---
Bartender is my favorite action bar addon, and can thoroughly recommend Grid2 for party/raid frames. Great addon, light weight but powerful.
---
one escape every 5 minutes isn't as good as 25% resist stun (that you can stack with other bonuses).
---
It's okay, but not as good
---
Yeah thanks imma just pvp in my Battleground if you don’t mind.
---
AV honor being reduces means less people zerging AV for honor and more people doing AV for fun means meta changes means AV plays differently. meta created by the players and not by the devs matters a LOT more these days in games overall.
---
To be fair, the number of dwarves priests are 20 time bigger in classic than in vanilla
---
Seriously gives you an idea how many people will play the MMORPG, until they choose not to play the MMO part.
---
Shh, you’re making too much sense. Remember, it’s the community that made, released and sustains Classic WoW so all blame is on the community and not the perfect Activision Blizzard who never made any dumb decisions like releasing 2 PVP Servers for all of Europe. These guys are the genuises. /s
---
Not a fan of them, but it’s just an intentionally bad name to “trigger” people into commenting about it which honestly works pretty well
---
"I'm not even sure what I typed" sold the joke to me
---
/yawn
---
people like you are in the minority when it comes to the player base.
---
People do not want long AV matches. They're a novelty event. If you want to log in once a week and get a good long AV game, you're an outlier. Most people don't want to do that.
---
&gt; My question is, how much of an asshole am I for just leaving them high and dry
---
It makes you a pretty big asshole.
---
First off, don't even attempt to make the argument that because other people in this guild did it that it somehow makes it more OK for you. It's just a bad argument. Other people doing shitty things doesn't make you doing a shitty thing less shitty. 
---
If you've made a commitment to other people, regardless of if its a video game, RL event, or whatever else, you at least owe it to those people to tell them what's going on.
---
Imo the best move is to tell them you don't really want to play the game anymore and give them 1 more raid to find a replacement for you. If you weren't the MT I'd say just talking to them and letting them know you wont be playing anymore is enough, but the MT has a bit more responsibility than other roles. You really should do them a solid and give them 1 more raid.
---
Leaving your guild 'high and dry', just going completely MIA is a bitch move. It's what people who are afraid of conflict do. These people on some level invested their time and effort into you, you at least owe it to them to give them the heads up that you're done.
---
WTF is wrong with u guys?
---
For every fisherman in my game the odds of loosing is higher. I always tell ppl to report fishers. Why shouldent i?
---
If u dont have time with BG's, go fish in the open world. 
---
Its a fucking BATTLE ground.
---
I’d disagree, I think world PvP is the most genuine it’s been since the first few weeks of release. There aren’t 10 man raids farming zones anymore, so fights feel more real, even, and random.
---
Haven't gotten lucky enough to get Truestrike shoulders yet! Saw them drop, but saw my roll of "12".. :p
---
I was using devilsaur until I recently finally got my slaghides to drop. And I can pop on my +hit rings, but I lose the fat armor ones. I dunno! I'm using +hit bracers, though, and I can bring my mask/rings/devilsaur set if I absolutely need consistent snap threat on something. But I'm usually relegated to tanking the second target, at most. :p
---
Doesn't say it has to be biologicalor attached, so i guess that's why I can read it.
---
So, you’re saying that you’re not having fun, and continually tilted about 3-4 players fishing in the game? What’s your solution to this problem? If you can even call it that. Blizz bans anyone who fishes in AV? Are you just here to complain to Reddit? Are you getting rank 14 any time soon? 
---
You’ll be fine either way.
---
Guilds a bunch of cockheads, but the names intentionally bad and seems a edgy name to “trigger” people and bait these exact comments.
---
If you don't mind my asking, how only 18 if you've been playing since launch? I would figure explore exp and killing stuff would have you at least past 20 by now. Or do you mean playing since launch but not online a whole lot.
---
You killed it man good job
---
Honestly, horde side AV feels like a D2 Baal run.
---
Group up with a ton of randos, kill unique monsters. Occassaional there is that o r gabker (in this case the 20 60% mount players about to get curb stomped for more honor) everyone runs over to kill. And rinse and repeat every 8-15 minutes 
---
I fucking love it. When the alliance do port back to the stormpike town to defend the bridge. Pop my toep, EleM CL and watch gnomes explode.
---
I can't believe  about to say this but I think I really like hr horde meta for AV. Quick, fun rewarding games.
---
Youve got some weeks left before BWL not much else to do.
---
I don't play 8 hours a day, infact I stopped playing Classic altogether shortly after DM was released. I just think it's funny how passionate you all are about someone who doesn't give a shit about the game you "love".
---
Im away with work a lot, but when I get free time on a sunday Ill have a couple beers and play for an hour or two. 
---
I love the game and just don't have a lot of time to enjoy it. So because it's my relaxing time I dont care about leveling up fast. Ill explore random stuff and search for loot chests.
---
Fucking ridiculous
---
Ban them and take away all honor and rep gained since they began abusing the AFK system.
---
Laol, this ked is PissT!  Me and my mega dong crew q up and if one of our boiz can’t git in, u kno we kick stupid noobs. Insta smashT and I whisper them after laoling at them for their 15 minute break cuz they sux.  So plz cry mor, idiot
---
RP servers are still here for you
---
&gt; Warsong Gulch vendors will only sell items from their original list of consumables (and one tabard) for now
---
I really can't tell you. I would assume all gear rewards appear when BWL launches.
---
Not online a lot lol. Just played it the first day! I waste a lot of time when Im on too exploring and whatnot.
---
Human cringe lord uber mage.
---
Even if you didn't "prioritize" playing this chore of a game you'd still amass more than 10k xp after almost 4 months.
---
Com from ZandalarTribe won mine, gz either way haha
---
Lots of people have pretty intense lives...even more so if you have another person in your life.
---
most of them cheating and cant even speak a basic english. And then come to the eu forums when the eu player dont want to play with them. Its really annotying to play with them or against them most of the times that why on retail is a common thing to kick them from groups or leave it.
---
If you ever see them dmg-numbers pop up like a confetti explosion you know why.
---
This is kinda racist.
---
Fake News.
---
I play as the top part. Just got to 42 and still no mount but having fun. First time Horde and first time shaman. Playing full resto. No regrets.
---
The only thing you're missing is the other things you can maximize than stats and materials. I get what you mean I just think there's no need to be absolute about it.
---
I can't imagine how boring that is.
---
Nothing new, every AV I get in is a rehash of the same old arguments/strategies I saw circa 06/07. It always boiled down to "to rush, or not to rush".
---
This post is racist.
---
That's good to know with the decay. I'm more worried about just not being able to keep up with the other players inflating the requirements for each rank.
---
all russians are banned from global sporting events until 2024. is that kinda racist? 
---
dont be a dummy
---
&gt;allakhazam's
---
Havent thought about that site in a loooong time. I remember going into work and printing out dungeon maps from them for EQ. Good times.
---
Yeah, it's part of the Leatrix Plus addon. The plain picture is just so boring. There's options for Gold / Elite / Rare etc.
---
 
---
Druid is officially the least represented and the weakest class in all the Classic. It has one of the highest skill floors and skill ceilings as well. For some reason Blizzard decided to give attention only to Resto spec, designing tear sets specifically for healers. All other Druid’s roles suffer from the same problems: 
---
* Poor itemization. Very few epics can be obtained in MC for both feral and balance druids. BWL has some more loot, but it’s highly contested by other casters.
---
* Sub-standard damage output for DPS specs. Boomkin and Cat deal half of their respective “pure” class counterparts by design. 
---
* Arbitrary limitations, that make these specs’ lives even harder: you can’t use resto abilities in moonkin form, you can’t benefit from on-hit effects or use pots as a Bear or Cat.
---
* Little to no defensive cooldowns.
---
Now I’d like to talk about feral druids specifically: I’m a former r13 feral druid on Light’s Hope, and had more than 150 days /played on that character.
---
* The first and main feral’s problem is fixed damage in cat and bear form. This is so ridiculous: just imagine any “premium” class like warrior or rogue stuck with a blue-grade weapon until AQ; and in AQ this weapon is changed to another blue weapon, but with higher ilvl and slightly better damage. Ferals have deceptively high base stats that allow them not to fall too much behind “big four” in the first 3 phases, but the longer game goes, the further ferals fall behind in scaling.
---
* Second big problem is terrible itemization: there are only 3 items for you in MC, 1 in Ony, and 6 in BWL. Most of these items are competed by warriors, rogues and hunters (DFT, Shadowflame boots, Accuria, Prestor’s talisman), so chances are you will never see them. R13 set is a huge bait: while it gives you all the good stats you need, you still starve on +hit, so with time most of this set will be replaced completely.
---
* Low synergy between specs: as a feral druid if you start mixing in caster or healing gear, you lower your melee capabilities dramatically and almost completely lose your already small burst potential. When you gear into full feral, your healing and caster capabilities are laughable.
---
* No reliable CC: Entangling Roots work only outdoors, Bash has 1 min CD, Pounce has 2 sec duration. You have no interrupt, no CC chains, just an outrun potential. Combine it with laughable DPS and u get a sad but funny picture.
---
* To be viable in PvE you have to pull every trick out of your sleeve: put at least twice the effort into consumables, actually push more than 2-3 buttons for your rotation, and still you are like 70% of a good rogue or warrior.
---
* In PvP deep feral is a hot garbage, so you have to put some points into resto. As a result, you are a big sponge that can absorb absurd amounts of damage, but can’t really hit hard in return.
---
To make things worse, many raid leaders overlook ferals, treating them as third-class garbage and 3% crit machine with some extra utility: innervate and BRes. Truth is, that if you are a decent self-respecting feral, you keep innervate for yourself, and BRes is rarely needed in good raids (for bad ones it won’t matter much).
---
And if you think that TBC fixes Feral Druids, you are terribly wrong: the main problem with low damage output and low CC capabilities will haunt us until WotLK.
---
Dont be a kek, rush drek!
---
Because the majority hasn't fallen into that routine yet?
---
Is there a consensus on whether Deathdealer BP or Ogre Forged Hauberk is better for Hunters? 2% crit vs 1% crit and 20 Agility. I see a lot of different opinions on it.
---
I feel like 20 Agility is not enough to beat out a full 1% crit but I'm really not sure.
---
yea, sad but true. great cartoon!
---
I wouldn’t say nobody does that, I for one do and RP servers exist for people like me
---
4 x 2 is 6? Wild. 
---
I put the game down out of sheer boredom when I realized there was nothing more than fetch quests and a few dungeon crawls after level 40. I have forgotten when Classic released as it has been out of my mind for probably 2 months.
---
I was never a part of that since my computer was a potato and couldn't handle much back then, but I'd always hear the stories of the  overnight AV's lol
---
You should definitely gtfo then
---
Does it get a little better? Right now I feel kind of helpless. I feel like feral druid PvP isn't the *greatest*, and I get shredded by some classes. I also kind of get bummed I'll never top the charts in dps in dungeons. I'm level 36 right now. 
---
I do enjoy the opportunity to clutch heal/tank when people need it, but a lot of the time I feel just kind of like a back-up/support character and not my own, if that makes sense.
---
You can tank in 31/20 spec just fine. Prot tanking is just easier (rage when blocking, less rage for sunder, shield slam) on you.
---
Ahhhh excuses, wonderful aren't they?
---
You're sorry but you didn't fear him back out. :)
---
That's what he's saying. They used to get buffs for each tower left standing.
---
I guess OP is hoping that enough of us will adopt his idea, and spread it around the community, as opposed to it being a one man show, trying to win over 1 bg after another when people are already in tunnel vision mode.
---
Link?
---
same for the spanish realms
---
Been playing MMOs since UO released in 1998, I still enjoy immersing myself in whatever I’m playing
---
What's the recommended bandwidth to play wow classic? All I have is a hotspot and when I hit my data cap, I get gimped down to ~600kb/s. I can play other online games fine like apec legends. Do you think wow would work?
---
It’s really not, lol. There is people streaming doing exactly the same. Just get a premade and it’s not even remotely difficult.
---
Avoid regrowth and rejuv unless you have the Regrowth crit talent and a fatty mana pool.
---
Until you get around 300-350 healing power, you'll want to use the highest rank healing touch you can without overhealing. The extra mana efficiency from higher ranks is worth more than being able to get multiple healing power uses.
---
There is no epic mount riding skill.
---
good riddance.
---
Finally the horde realized that if they sent a small team back to recap stuff and slow the alliance down, they put their team in an advantaged position because all the ally know up to that point is zerging.
---
I don't think it would have the enormous impact on raid-dps one would immediately assume without thinking it through. I'm sure people theorycrafted it back on Elitist Jerks back in the day and people on private servers have probably simply removed the limit and saw it for themselves.
---
What's cooler about removing debuff limit is getting the Judgements up. My guild screwed around with stuff like that back in the day and it was hilarious seeing how much self-sustain various classes obtained.
---
Well they have obviously spend a lot longer not getting any gear. That aside, my guild applied a decay over 500 dkp.
---
I related to the "meme" and then decided to read the comments. I left a comment and a bunch of passionate neckbeards got their panties in a wad. What I said is the truth though.
---
useless.
---
True,but I dinged inside the BG, hit Revered, and then we won the match after 1 hr+ standstill at Frostwolf entrance haha
---
&gt;Your point about AV is completely wrong.
---
You could say "I don't agree with your point."  I'm not sure if there is such a thing as "your satirical point is completely wrong."  Regardless, if you haven't stopped reading yet:
---
Give me 10 of my current guild members, and 30 pugs and put us in original pre-nerf AV.  Understanding how the battleground is won, and having 10 players who also understand, we could beat original AV in 30 minutes easily.  Yes, you have to burn all of the towers, and you might have to do them one at a time.  That, in my opinion is quick and efficient.  I would absolutely love it if what we got was original, pre-nerf Alterac Valley, but make no mistake - those would be fast games too.  Yes, it was impossible to take down the generals without first burning towers, but a quick win would average 20-30 minutes still.  
---
4 day long games were never going to be a thing again, even with pre-nerf AV.
---
Been playing wsg on my 48 rogue alt, its actually FUN! No more stressing over maximum points and shit.
---
Horde: Why do we lose?
---
Also Horde: tries to zerg when the map favors Alliance in a zerg strategy, sends 40 people to kill Balinda then goof off at towers for 5 minutes.
---
he's a racially unconscious north Amuritard, what do you expect
---
You know what’s not wonderful? Despicable human beings like yourself shitting on people for being level 18.
---
My PvE realm was crowded in low level zones even last week. Maybe less alts because BGs?
---
I believe the raid difficulty is so low because they launched Molten core with pre bc gear upgrades. You shouldn't have all this spell power until aq. Molten core pre bis was stacking int and spirit for casters.   This should normalize when aq launches as the content will have caught up with the gear to an extent. I believe vanilla level difficulty will finally exist with naxxarammas. 
---
TLDR: end of expansion gear means only end of expansion content won't feel nerfed.
---
Ride it in wsg for the next 6 months trying to get exalted
---
I've always enjoyed it. Ran a full playthrough of DS3 co-oping with a buddy, was a blast.
---
I’m on Grobbulus, so not one of the mega servers, but still fairly large.
---
Eh, I just thought the plain picture was super boring, and the option was available so I figured why not
---
50 50 split on my server, just about. Alliance dominate some areas, horde others. It rotates often. It’s perfect.
---
Yes!
---
https://www.nerfnow.com/comic/450/comments
---
The comic is about 9 years old, according to the comments. Maybe it needs a third panel.
---
Same for me. I spent days and days on Elitist Jerks. I just learned it had been killed off in Classic. Theorycrafting and minmaxing was a huge part of the game for me back then, even more than now because the answers are more readily available/common knowledge. I've played that way ever since Pen&amp;Paper and Ultima Online.
---
What I want to know is how a premade all got in the same game? Me and 3 of my buddies cant do it.
---
I use healbot to cast heals with left right and center clicks. Decursive to dispel with a click, and pallypower to sort and assign blessings.
---
I said it's pathetic, which is the truth. You know what's even better than "shitting" on someone? Doing the same but feeling righteous for doing it. Absolutely fucking hilarious.
---
He's not saying Horde honor compared to Alliance honor is relevant.  He's saying this: If you pug AV as Horde, you get about 3k honor per game every time.  You get about 4 games an hour, so ~12k honor/hour.  You really can't farm WSG as horde, because the queue is like an hour, so ~12k honor/hour is our optimax for all Horde, at which point, only hours played differentiates you from others attempting to rank.
---
The same is not true for Alliance.  If you're pugging AV (at least according to the score screens I'm seeing) you're getting about 900 honor for killing Drek in 10 mins.  Instant queues means you should be able to get in 6 games an hour, 5.4k honor/hour.  Alliance premades are getting 2-3k honor per game, same game length.  10-15k honor/hour.  Alliance WSG premades with instant queues are getting some other value which may be higher or at least more consistent than AV premades, but is certainly higher than AV pubs.
---
That's what he's saying.  Horde really only have one choice, but it's a very stable, consistent choice resulting in only hours played factoring into ranking.  Alliance have 3 choices (assuming you can get into a premade), but pugging AV is probably the worst one.  Therefore, if you're pugging as Alliance (AV or WSG) you're not ranking up.  Everyone is pugging as Horde, and if you put in more hours than most, you'll rank up.
---
Warrior is the meme class. Everybody thinks you always need a warrior tank, when that’s not even remotely true. That’s why everybody uses one, not because it’s necessary.
---
I can't imagine how boring your life is if you think that way.
---
I like playing mmos the first way but what makes wow good is the people you play with and share experiences with.
---
is The World Anti-Doping Agency a racially unconscious north Amuritard?
---
He is soloable is you use the kiting method with the ledge.  A rogue can’t face tank him
---
is The World Anti-Doping Agency  racist? they banned all russians becuase they cheat
---
I might aswell rename myself to Skankhunt42 with how god damn upset the lot of you are.
---
I really have no sympathy for rankers. Everyone knew the honor grind was long, unfun, and rewards nothing but time. So get que'd because this is your choice.
---
The honor is all relative to your faction anyways. If anything, the threshold for horde is a lot tougher when everyone is getting 2k+.
---
When an MMORPG is new and has no minimap telling u where to go, you are forced to read quest text to know what to do.  WOW questing before questie addon was an adventure.  QUESTIE ruins questing.
---
But the leader turning on master looter isn't against any rules. And trying to get him kicked for being AFK is also a misuse of the report system as well.
---
Don’t waste this here, post it in your next AV. When I see messages like yours in chat I know the game is going well. To me, the meta isn’t to beat the opposing team, it’s to get the rep grinders to AFK out.
---
I don’t come into your raid to PvP, don’t come into my battleground to PvE.
---
I'm on rattlegore but I see people from herod and faerlina in my battlegrounds, is it all one large battleground now?
---
Warlocks are the only ones who would see an appreciable increase.  The others would improve, but still be much worse than other options.
---
The bigger bonus for rogues would be the ability to use deadly/rupture than anything for sub.
---
Considering nobody will have rank 11 for two more weeks, one can say they're not out yet.
---
So true
---
&gt; This was my first time playing any WoW game ever. I rolled on Blaumeux (PvP) because some friends picked it, which ended up being a very balanced, non-toxic, and populated server. The friends who picked it even admitted how lucky we were selecting what turned into a great server so blindly. I rolled a Tauren Druid because my friends told me it was versatile enough for me to figure out the playstyle I liked. 
---
You realize that this server is not balanced at all and all top Alliance guilds were essentially forced to transfer because there were full raid groups camping every major flight point and most of the surrounding minor points that are walkable to the next major.
---
To get from Eastern Kingdoms to Kalimdor you literally had to get a mage port or corpse walk 20 times at a harbor.
---
I'm sure being a horde is nice and fun on this server, but saying Blaumeux is balanced is highly inaccurate.
---
How gimp would I be as 0/30/21 for flag carrying?
---
That's clearly in AV, he was hoping one of his friends or himself would win the roll.
---
I’m a lvl 22 horde warlock. 
---
What are some good spots where I can grind mobs for a few hours to get 1-3 gold? I’m looking for high grey drop rates I guess?
---
Tips appreciated.
---
And I think it's funny how passionate you are about calling out someone for the amount of time he played a game he loves
---
Don't be late
---
I see you keep saying that but you do know youre wrong? Russia is banned not russians. They can still compete just not under a russian flag.
---
The positive is that as more people finish their exalted farm, less people are going to queue AV, and increase the queue time. I think that in the end, even with no changes to the current honor reward, the honor/h is probably going to be lower than WSG because of queue time limitation.
---
I want to lvl a pure balance Druid and jut stay in boomkin form
---
That's cool, not trying to judge lol. I know the feeling. I'm pretty sure back when BC launched I had explored the entirety of Eversong and Ghostlands on my Rogue by like lv13 or something. Just going to the locations to see what the new zones were like stealthing when I couldn't fight the mobs there.
---
Absolutely! Looks like a solid build. :o
---
Russia is banned. Not russians. If they want to compete thry can just not under the russian flag.
---
Ty
---
You're in a negative echo chamber on Reddit dude, the vast majority are just playing and enjoying the game not commenting here
---
Alliance are losing to other ally that farm objectives in AV and to premade wsg, while on horde the max honor is from losing AV.
---
20m... Wow.
---
Alliance in Hydraxian Waterlords have less then 5s queue on average atm lol.
---
Glad you had a great experience so far!
---
This is how it goes.  Every one in awhile a game like this is fun.  They are not fun when they are every game every time.
---
this is incorrect. if your standing 100 with 10k faction players with over 15 HKs you will get a much higher bracket than a server where your faction only has 1k players with 15 HKs
---
The existence of other players is the number one complaint of this sub lol. The people who get angry when other players play the game differently than what they would like would probably have more fun playing single player games.
---
&gt;The difference being (in my opinion) anyone can train and become a professional gamer
---
This is not true. I will never be a professional gamer. I used to play counterstrike 8 hours a day and at my peak I was half the gamer of the good people on my server, much less professionals. I just don't have the ability to be that good. Some people do, Shroud isn't as good as he is because of practice alone, he has a natural ability. Some people have insane vision, are able to pick up tiny movements, are able to click really fast etc. In the same way that anyone can train their whole lives and only ever get to the minor leagues in baseball, the same applies to gaming. It absolutely is a skill, not everyone has good enough hand/eye to be a pro. You don't have to be physically fit, but you do need certain physical traits to be the best.
---
Expose also prevents a warrior from even using sunder, which is a bigger issue.
---
I've been playing WoW since 2005 and othere MMO's since 1999. I guarantee you the REEEEEE is just as prevalent then as it is now.
---
The problem is, if AV is this lucrative in honor, there's a good chance that people will continue to queue for it long after they are exalted.
---
Not in this battle but yesterday I had a nice AV experience too.  5-10 people defending the base can really make a huge change and while the minmaxers leave that BG more of those who enjoy longer battles remain. 
---
Right now I just ride to the base instead of rushing to the front. Some people always join. :)
---
No, you're saying to be competitive in the honor race you have to actually organize and PvP? The horror!
---
He's arguing for short AV.
---
A rogue needs combo points to build it up anyways, the warrior would sunder to get threat. But later in the games, especially with our fury prot tank. Once he has a threat lead, he isn’t losing it. And improved sunder once the rogue has his first 5 CP can override the 5 stack sunder to improve raid wide damage.
---
This happens if you're using TinyThreat. All addons have bugged with the coming of the new patch so you'll have to fix them.
---
Did they get sick of loosing in 20 min instead of winning in 7, when horde started defending?
---
At least itll be players actually pvping and not killing npcs 90% of the time.
---
Seems like there's a lot of people on this sub who's fallen for this trick O\_o
---
i will give it a go, as in 5 mans aggro is a real problem all the time
---

Spriest ooms 30s into a fight
---
annoys the crap out of me watching the 15 100% mounters sprint off to delv, like they can solo it while the 60%ers are picked off, frost nova'd etc by 8-9 horde. If we just stuck together, dismounted and rolled over those clowns we would be putting 30 people into galv and drek and just murder the handful of horde gankers trying to stop us. But no. Instead we get picked off, sent to stone hearth then spent the next 20 mins trying to cross and being ganked, then watch the horde win and we get fuck all rep. Its demoralising, shitty and rage inducing waste of time. Can't wait for exalted so I never have to so this again.
---
Finally a good one
---
There are plenty of that guilds that allow people to play sub-optimal specs, but it requires you to either build up trust as a social or stick with a weaker guild as they progress MC a bit slower than others. It's more than possible to play how you want, but it will require more effort and patience on your part unfortunately.
---
Yeah, they’re hardcore honor/rep grinders that are actually minimizing their rep/honor per hour. It’s funny, by attempting to take the easy way out they’re actually doing it the hard way.
---
Russians aren't a race.
---
I think it's kinda pathetic for judging someone based on how much of their free time they throw at a game.
---
Uninstalling!
---
I remember making a handwritten BiS list and have all the drops I wanted from Ony and Rag listed out waiting for raid day. Wait no I did that last week at work and the list is still in my wallet lmao.
---
It's funny and all but druids are fucking amazing team players. They fit the hybrid so well. I run raids as cat DPS (often pretty close to top meters on single target fights and give melee 3% crit, so the fury warriors and rogues beg for the group). Then when the fights come up that we need a OT, there I am being a big ol' fatty bear. Long fights, hoppin out doubling up a healer's mana bar with innervate, throwing some heals and decurses, poppin a tranq. What's that? MT died?! Shit, lemme go ahead and get him up mid-battle. Whispers filled with "Can I get a mark? Can I get a mark?" Druid is the quiet All-Star.
---
Cool, thanks.
---
It's correct if you replace 'standing 100' with 'having a standing that ranks you at 25% highest for your faction. Whether that's 900k honor or 90k honor, you'll get the same ranking points.
---
Honestly it stays like that. You are a support class, I would strongly consider rerolling to warrior or rogue.
---
Druids can be fun if you like battles of attrition, but they require you to play very well to beat some classes.
---
I was letdown on classic long before it was released. When they announced that the itemization wouldn't follow the original flow, that we would be playing on 1.12 version of the game. This also meant I was expecting the 6-10min AV's as that what it was by 1.12 after they removed everything.
---
Something I never really got to enjoy in vanilla was WPvP outside of southshore and tarren mill. I am playing horde on Heartseeker with a 75A/25H split and it has been the most fun experience in gaming in awhile. We won so many out numbered fights that we should have never come close to winning and had rivalries with the enemy faction. Sure not being able to go into BRM or fly to Everlook  was annoying, but it was apart of being outnumbered and I am glad I transferred to experience it. The alliance on the other hand complained a lot about there being so few horde and only really seeing other alliance groups compared to what sometimes felt like a constant onslaught of alliance. Skeram would have been that for us with its 75H/25A population.
---
Raiding I don't think will be fun till we get ZG/AQ/Naxx as our items are the 1.12 version which had stats improved over patches as well as having 1.12 talents. This makes all the previous content incredibly easy on top of some bosses being nerfed(Some of the bosses in these instances were nerfed too). I never got to do Naxx at 60 and only every joined one AQ40, so these will hopefully be as fun as WPvP was to me.
---
They are probably alliance so instant queue.
---
Dont know what your intensions with this propoganda is, but russians clearly only rush B
---
Had a warlock in my guild that was 93 arena runs deep and a prot warrior rolled on the caster belt because 'he needs spellhit for taunt'
---
Yea I'd be done.
---
"BuT if We dOn'T kIll GalV wE oNly GeT 500 reP"
---
2 IQ play
---
Anecdotal, but I'm the exact opposite. I was not reading quests 15 years ago, I was just killing what Thottbott told me to kill. Now that I'm going back as an adult, I take my time and read the details and get into the world more.
---
Sold that dagger for 650G the other day
---
It's like people don't realize it just came out. The meta has already shifted and horde got better at countering the zerg.
---
If people are bitching this much about being rewarded with honor and fast rep, just wait until they start playing wsg and realize losing just fucks you.
---
It would be MASSIVE, now Arms might just be viable... we can now use Mortal Strike.
---
Praise the \[T]/ sun!
---
Your brain is calling for that constant reward the game gives you. Nothing wrong per se with that but this has clearly become an obsession/addiction. 
---
I urge you to get some help, once you realise that after a few years that this game will die and all your “achievements” are worth nothing, this might get you into a deep depression. All those precious hours in your life wasted in a game just to be “ahead of the curve”. Once you realise that the game also becomes a lot more fun when you do not have to engage in the forced behaviour of having to min/max everything but rather just play for fun. Having all the epics and being the first and best player in WoW, will not do anything. Once the game moves on or is dead, this is completely worthless. Plus it will give you the opportunity to spend time otuside of the game and do something with real people, loved ones, family.
---
Anyone being a toxic arse and trying to defend his clear addiction should re-think before answering. There is a clear line between compulsion/addiction and just playing a game.
---
&gt; What are some good spots where I can grind mobs for a few hours to get 1-3 gold? 
---
Mobs at this level drop greys that cost few bronze coins.  
---
If there was a place where level 22 could earn 1g per hour - level 40 will earn there 20g per hour.  
---
And we all know that such places doesn't exist :)
---
Russia is banned, not russians. Also the ban itself is the most laughable political power play between the West and East. I would not take it too seriously.
---
I just go by what's upvoted and what's downvoted. It's hard to pin specific people to what they say, and if they turn out to be hypocrites at a later time, but you can certainly see trends.  
---
Such as this, people cheer for casual/inoptimal play where you actually have next to no impact on the success of the AV (not actively defending, not actively attacking), but the you have a massive group of people on this subreddit turn around and cry like banshees about streamer being a plague and how they are the abomination of modern gaming, how dare they afk in AV!?
---
First, second and third boss is doable naked. Last boss might be trouble with low gear especially if you're unlucky with Withers.
---
You mean rep farm for allies bro
---
I think the patches would work better for TBC because T4 content was directly nerfed so many times by by the time 2.4 dropped.
---
I'm on Herod and got ganked by alliance constantly for the last couple weeks. I love it. Great server. Game is fun as hell.
---
Good SHIT
---
Now the real fun begins. Get them Robe mats!
---
That literally never happened to me on my server. The horde did make it so I couldn't finish a quest, but I never actually ever felt so trapped that I thought my only option was to log out.
---
The first example would place you in the top part of bracket 12 with between 10k to 9k rank points
---
The second example wolud place you in the top spot in bracket 9 which gives 7k rank poins.
---
I already told father Vladimir. He will be Putin it down
---
Quality shitpost
---
Are there even mmos that exist that doesn’t devolve into this?
---
I am having PTSD now.
---
Thats the beauty of them
---
Fury prot easily puts out more threat, at the cost of being not very tanky.
---
What are you talking about. The game is much better every way.
---
Before your options were to venture into the world. And run into a high chance of adding 20-80 minutes to whatever activity you plan to do.
---
Now you have the whole world available. Herbs and ores are free. People in the world are even peaceful.
---
You can now
---
-	Run dungeons again
---
-	level non-spell-cleavers in the world again
---
-	herb or mine
---
-	do quests
---
-	go have fun in WSG
---
-	CHOOSE TO do av if you prefer
---
-	do actual world pvp
---
You could do **NONE** of those things as of two days ago. Sometimes I am really worried about people‘s level of comprehension here. It is really worrying.
---
It‘s like you had cancer. Your chemo was a success. The tumor is fully gone. But you fucking whine that you lost your hair for 2 weeks.
---
It‘s literal insanity to me.
---
I forgot to say one thing, while skinning leatherworking may be tempting you should select herbalism and alchemy as for professions!
---
I guess its not from classic as I see death knights there
---
I've got both, and as with everything else, it's situational.  Honestly their probably about the same.  Some people prefer the boost static AP (derived from agility) provides over crit.  I ran strat a week ago with a hunter who was in full raid epics with Rhok'Delar.  He chose to wear brutality blade in stead of the Lok'Delar staff because he preferred the static AP bonus from brutality blade.  
---
At the end of the day, the difference is probably minuscule.  I wear the ogre forged hauberk because of the other stats, int/agi/stam it's a well rounded piece.  Plus, it's not as hideous as deathdealer.
---
Absolutely agree!! I only got up to Master Sergeant out in the world, but I had some amazing fun out there pvping. I think druids are a bit underestimated in actual fights, being seen as just flag carriers or healbots. :o
---
Also, not being the best just makes me want to try harder. And it feels even better to beat the warriors/rogues in dps. ;D
---
Make some friends so you can be invited to some pre-mades.
---
This comment is a good example of the difference in players.
---
I don't think they aren't inviting him because of his DPS, it's cause he's level 56 and he will aggro a bunch of stuff and just in general make the instance more frustrating. That's fine between your friends but you shouldn't expect random people to shoulder that burden of taking someone lower level.
---
It is and for this exact reason.
---
After spending far too much of my life grinding out things in WoW, and leveling so many characters I know the questlines by heart, I now take a new approach to MMOs: I play them like co-op RPGs that I can co-op without having friends, finish them, then move on. I recently did all of the story quests in FFXIV. Beautiful game, well-written. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am, I'm done. So basically this.
---
I'd respec to 1/29/21
---
HOTW NS is the best flag carrier build.
---
Just lvl up doing quests and Dungeons. Money will come naturally, the higher lvl you are the more money you get from doing normal stuff, and if you have two gathering professions can sell stacks in AH to get even more money. Really though at your lvl money should not be a concern
---
I can recommend putting one point in Nature's Grasp. It's really nice watching those rooted warriors in your rear view mirror while you zoom out in travel form.
---
Could use this:

---
I've never attempted the blizzard pulls with less than 3 so unsure. This build would be decent for aoe/pvp/pve but not bis for either. I'm in the same boat as you that spending 100g/week for respec is stupid but at the same time I think you owe it to your guild to at least spec somewhat optimally for raids because its their time too. But thats why I wanted to be the WC mage.
---
I've been leveling as Balance, and it's not been bad. My recommendation is to get Omen of Clarity. Get a good staff early on, like Emberstone Staff, and throw a few casts and Moonfire, then melee the rest. 
---
Omen of Clarity procs help with mana issues. Not as efficient as Feral by any means, but also not terrible. 
---
Have mage friends with free water helps too.
---
Yes, players have gotten all nutty with minmaxing on their own accord. Nothing about the game necessitates it, especially in Classic. Yeah, there are points where it pays to be a little more optimized, but that comes with steep diminishing returns — you’re eventually good enough and further optimizations don’t do a whole lot.
---
Vice-versa here (my group transferred to Horse in Wrath, but I missed the vanilla leveling experience). My experience was, more or less, "Wow, the horde side is high grade crap." I miss Ironforge and Stormwind. I missed the fantastic, story-driven early zones. I even miss the fantastic orchestral musical stings that play for Alliance zone transitions.  It's painfully clear that the Horde side experience was a rush job in Vanilla.
---
Everyone defines fun and entertainment his own way. I play the way it's showed in the second panel, That's what's fun for me.
---
It goes easily twice as quick for alliance based on the fact that they can do twice as many avs per hour due to queue times.
---
And AV favors Alliance.
---
All this is fine and was known long ago.
---
Delete this
---
But it's not efficient
---
/S
---
I would say that this is somewhat correct, but I was in a nearly 2 hour AV last night, and it felt like Vanilla.
---
&gt; Why are you on this sub if you don’t play classic anymore?
---
Because it's interesting to still interact with the community, or see what's currently going on, etc.
---
No streamers, but also no shortage of hardcore nolifer pserver guilds who’ve been grinding honor nonstop. We’ve had a bunch of R9’s before BGs.
---
late 30s is hard for bear tanking. but that is instantly fixed when you hit 40 and get dire bear form. 
---
yeah, you’re not going to top the dps meters with this class. 
---
but you can tank great or heal great, and make a great slippery healer (or flag carrier) in pvp. 
---
if you are only interested in damage though I think most of the other classes would be better. maybe rogue? what do you like about the druid?
---
Is afking actually bannable? I see lots of people doing it who seem to think it isn’t.
---
Compensation for little epeen
---
I quit in retail, and now my gold there is paying for my classic subscription.
---
Even better!
---
other players suck (Not in a 'they play badly' way, but more in a 'I can't stand other people' way)
---
Horde are forcing more turtles.  I'm using turtle relatively there.  They're not remotely turtles compared to what they used to be, but they're turtles relative to the 6 minute AVs we were having earlier this week.
---
Only tauren druids have horns, nelfs get spinning jumps and they dont really help
---
I enjoy the game by min maxing. How to get the most out of my dude while being fair to my guildies. I enjoy chasing the pieces. But I’m not chasing world/server first anymore this time. So I’m having a lot of fun with that. Just because you find it dumb doesn’t mean others do. When I was leveling I only had so much time in the day and beat my rl friends. They caught up and now we are raiding.
---
One act of kindness does not mean that toxicity isn't a thing. It is very much still a thing.
---
If you need a 30+ premade to get anything done in AV you're no better than pugs anyway.
---
&gt; "Wow, the horde side is high grade crap." 
---
You're entitled to your opinion.
---
Catch me outside IF though, punk. :p
---
Thank you so much for your feedback mate!!
---
Are staves or wands the way to go? And how do I keep them updated?
---
Omg how did I not think of this?! You solved this problem!
---
Same here.  No issues since adjusting.
---
On Gorgonnash DE we had 1h30m to 3h queues for AVs that took around 2 hours.
---
We wanted them to last long. That way you could get 1k+ rep out of AV and maybe hope to get Exalted in a month of doing 1-2 AVs per day.
---
Meantime I was herbing mostly.
---
Biggest issue was AV was 10-15 fps for me. I literally could not go to the front lines. I had to kill npcs throughout.
---
They already lost you as a customer, what is the worst that could happen?
---
I used to be obsessed with single player games.  Ever since I started playing wow, I can't do them anymore.
---
Same thing happened to me yesterday, I think what describes it best was the one boy/boyette that wrote something along the lines of:
---
"What is this feeling?"
---
"This tingling sensation..."
---
"OH NO, CALL BLIZZARD, I'M HAVING FUCKING FUN!"
---
Was it optimal for the stupid fucking grind to get my BiS so I can not get called a noob? Nope.
---
Was it more fun than doing the same stupid thing over and over for hours? Fuck yes, I had a big smile on my face for the first time after just farming dungeons and AV for the last week.
---
That genuinely made me laugh, gg wp.
---
I don't think it's the min/max mentality solely. It's just that a lot of the min/maxers (a large portion) are elitist, cold tryhards that no one enjoys aging with/around.
---
I looted a travelers backpack and to my dismay the whole raid got to roll on it 😂 totally lost it.
---
I'm still a bit confused as to how much an epic mount costs. If I'm revered with SW, how much? Do i need riding too? What if I get exalted with Stormpike, what will that one set me back?
---
&gt; AV is a boring nightmare. 
---
AV was always a boring nightmare, once people figured it out anyway.  It was only fun and interesting the first month or so after it was released.
---
When people said "It'll get better once BGs release," we didn't mean AV was some amazing thing.  We simply meant the honor pillaging in the open world would end.  And it has.
---
First sound is a burp by some basement dweller. No need to watch any further.
---
Druid can't shift out of the net?
---
The grind is soul crushing. As much as I love the frostsaber, it isn't worth the suffering.
---
Thanks! I’m really smart.
---
Just started yesterday. Played in the past during TBC through the end of Legion, so I know how to play. I'm just not sure what add-ons people would consider essential for classic. I grabbed details so far, but yeah not sure what's considered essential.
---
Well it doesn't have to - but in every Version of Alterac valley it is a PVE BG.
---
It is the way you win the Battleground. By doing PVE. That makes it a PVE BG. Of course there is PVP in it but it remains a PVE BG.
---
It shouldn't in fact be the fastest way  to grind honor IMO.
---
For me - you farm exalted ASAP - before People get fed up of rushing and start actually playing the battleground. Which will probably only take 1-3 weeks. 
---
After that it wouldn't be what it is now - if it wasn't the fastest way to farm honor. 
---
That is a big msitake and hopfeully fixed soon. I can't see AV being more efficient for premades than Warsong or even AB when it Comes out.
---
That is no state to exist in.
---
I think it has a bearing in this. 
---
The question is if AV epics are welfare. 
---
They are only welfare when MC epics also Count as welfare. 
---
But I agree with you that the current state is not optimal.
---
I personally don't care about it though since I never looked Forward to AV and didn't want the grind anyway. That maks it a lot better for me.
---
I Support you on changing it though. But only after I am exalted :D
---
Yet I don't like the honor Thing. I want to Play WSG!!
---
Did my first AV yesterday and it lasted about 30 minutes. We won as Horde.
---
A small group wanted to wipe the Alliance laggards as they passed Belinda (avoid the head-on zerg) so we ended up catching 5-6.
---
Then we moved to Iceblood graveyard after Alliance killed Galvander, and there were a handful trying to clear the elites and cap the graveyard. We nuked their healers keeping them up and wiped them up pretty easily.
---
Then moving back to Frostwolf graveyard there was only a couple there guarding it, that was an easy clean up and back cap.
---
Hardest part was moving back into the fortress to defend Drek. Alliance were pretty quick to slow and nuke you down but after a couple attempts using the back-entrance around West tower on an epic mount, I was able to get in and LoS.
---
Then we just baited in Alliance to try and kill us, until one of them steps too far and pulls the generals. We go out and help the generals wipe the Alliance and recap Relief Hut.
---
Our raid in the North was able to get the North and South bunkers plus Aid station, which was enough for them to kill Van. The Alliance we killed back-capped everything up to the bridge but were held off from there.
---
All in all it was a fun match up and the AV I completely remember. Yes zerging is a strategy that works well, but you need everyone to buy in immediately and stick with the pack. Otherwise you can pick of stragglers and slowly cull the herd, and those left at Drek is too few to handle what's going on.
---
Ahh I see, Herod here.
---
Buy some gear from the AH if your mana is low.  
---
When starting out you should have enough mana to cast 4 x Blizzard, 2 x Frost nova and a Blink as a bare minimum as that's roughly what it takes to get through a same level mobs health.
---
Don't get the frost spell damage stuff as it's not worth it at low levels, Int/Stam gear all the way.
---
Because they play to have fun and not minmax? Minmaxing tends to suck the fun out of everything. 
---
If a game looks fun then I'm going to play it regardless of genre. Once I stop having fun I quit playing; simple as that. I'm not going to restrict myself to a single type of game just because it *might* require a different type of play potentially dozens of hours into it.
---
My desktop is all tricked out. I love gaming on it and will always play in my office on raid night. But I’ve been leveling an alt lately and a laptop would be nice just to be able to hangout on the couch with the fiancé as I mindlessly do ZF gy runs lol. It’ll make her happier as well which is always a plus!
---
That's so nice you you guys. My mother died 3 weeks ago and I'm still in denial. Wish I had friends like you.
---
Yeah did 30-52 in heartseeker before p2 and even then it was hardly playable. Now my mage is sitting there with freezing band plus two other BoE epics and its on an unplayable server since everywhere I go I see dozens of alliance and horde pretty much quit
---
Flamelash.
---
We do get more rep this way. Not a lot more honor but I'm not actively ranking, as long as I get rank 3 and maybe the rank where you can buy superior pots on the cheap, I'm good. 
---
It is also a lot more fun.
---
I got in a game last night where some brave mages on 100% mounts stayed with the 60%ers and helped us clean up the 5-6 horde who came after us. We all survived, got back on our mounts, and had killed Drek within 5 min. All it takes is people sticking together.
---
When I finally get my epic mount, I will stay behind to help the 60%ers too :)
---
You can tank all pre-raid content without devoting any points in to Bear specific talents.
---
I'm a boomkin and I'm fuckin killing it with 90%+ parses and a 97 on majordomo I have staff of dominance robes of violatile power and I'm rank 8 in PvP (trying for R13) fuck the haters if you put in the effort you can do anything
---
There is no rule about using the AFK system to kick people either, its just "misuse of the report system" just like master looting is a misuse of the looting system. If we go by griefing rules stated as:
---
&gt;Harassment, “griefing,” **abusive behavior** or chat, **conduct intended to unreasonably undermine or disrupt the Game experiences of others**, deliberate inactivity or disconnecting, and/or any other activity which violates Blizzard’s Code of Conduct or In-Game Policies.
---
Then both are deemed punishable
---
The Calamitous Intent guild has always been trash. This doesn't surprise me one bit.
---
Yeah I found a post of it then it just... disappeared. I was looking for it myself! And in the comments was a wonderful explanation by a redditor of why it was so funny. Worked well to explain to non-warcrafters
---
Thanks man. Yeah this post attracted some real asshats. His girlfriend helped set this up, and was just sitting on the couch with her phone out when I came over. It was recorded to share with the rest of the guild. But we posted it here hoping it would make some people happy and to share his mother’s go fund me for her funeral arrangements.
---
I think I was in it as well? It was easily the most fun I had in AV in classic. If it was mine, I think
---
-	1h11m
---
-	~ 4500 honor
---
-	~ 2k rep
---
Was vs. full Russians. It was weird. As if they were multi boxing? They could not 1v3 people. I am not a good pvp player. Least of all on my new classes. But they did super random things and almost looked like bots. Like nova you as a mage and then start auto-attacking and lose a 3v1.
---
Bg chat was super weird. Every two minutes someone re-enacted the „this is fine“ meme. „It‘s good guys! We only need to wipe them here on the bridge now and the whole base is ours“
---
When he died i made 5 man grps for the remaining bunkers. Rolled a joint. Told people I‘m going AFK to smoke it. Sat on the chair in the bunker. People joined and had an all around „YEAH lets do it. Lokohar YEAH“ attitude and motherfucker was just idling in mid for 20 minutes swallowing Russians like a giant vacuum cleaner. I swear to god, we watched them engage him solo or duo at least 30 times.
---
I came back from the balcony. Was somehow dead. But the bunker was capped.
---
Went North. We were in Vanndar‘s base. Alliance was at bridge desperately trying to defend.
---
I put on my „reddit gear“ set and just started pulling marshalls. Some people freaked out when I did that. I think they had some attempts in them?
---
Tanking in AV is unnerving. You just survive for 15 seconds with consumables and HOPE someone manages to heal the ToT until then. But yeah I got a heal. Usually it’s enough to have one person with a brain split a marshal away from whirlwind range.
---
Died at Vanndar at 50% because too lazy to go full “reddit” with my gear set and ppl just start taunting if i don’t hold good enough threat. Got a combat rezz. Guess there are not many geared tanks. But the druids had this, I was not even able to build up enough rage to do a reasonable taunt.
---
I believe every number rolled has a decimal value as well, but they are hidden. So one 100 could be 100.07, and the other 100 could be 100.62
---
why the fuck do you think it's ok to ruin someone elses goals for no gain at all? av in this patch is a pve grind, if you want to pvp or don't want to grind go wsg or whatever
---
there is litterally no reason to ever be on the south half of the map as horde or the north half of the map as alliance except spawning back there and immediatly heading to the front
---
if both sides play correct we kill bal+lt's+com's then alli wins, it's perfect rep+honor/hour for everyone and people ruining this are just selfish assholes
---
Better before, because how rested xp works
---
What other fish are catchable in AV right now? I can't find any info on it.
---
The lowbies don't usually make it to Feel since they're on 60% mounts and get 1 shot by the warmaster cleaves if they do get that far.
---
how many AVs can you finish in an hour vs WSGs though?
---
I know its early but AV is insta queue right now and *feels* like 80-90% pugs I get go for a rush so the game ends in about 10 minutes.
---
WSG takes a while to pop
---
Raids
---
The rage on crit talent is nice tho. You can get 1 point without sacrificing anything major.
---
Or two points and skip the cat crit talents.
---
Why do people pretend to be stupid over this?
---
The game is 15 years old. You've been through everything here 50 times. 
---
I mean, do you play super Mario Bros and think "oh wow, these graphics!"? No.
---
leveling as feral is great - depending on what level you are - it may be better to get omen of clarity first, furor in resto is amazing as well - the cat talents for outside run speed are really great from 20-30 to keep you moving quickly
---
Organization is definitely an issue.  I've seen it done, but it isn't easy.
---
if you want to pvp go play fucking wsg and stop wasting everybodys time
---
Definitely, I remember leveling as priest to go spirit and not worry about +healing / spell till 60 so I figured same with mage just int over spell. Gonna check AH on lunch later and see what all I can outfit my mage with, thanks!
---
You did it except the coward rats from Flamelash.
---
I would honestly do a hybrid. Most of the talents overlap in feral anyways, so you can easily tank 5 mans and do good damage for pve solo questing.
---
Can always respecc end game to focus only on tanking if you want
---
The best times I have in AV are when I cap a bunker and defend it. You get little skirmishes as people try to re-cap it. Those small scale fights are great.
---
Feral threat WITH MCP is better than warriors once you start getting BWL/AQ gear, pretty undeniably. That's generating so much more rage and so much auto attack damage. But only with a bag full of MCPs to keep that attack speed buff up the whole fight. Not reasonable to expect anyone to farm that every week though.
---
Then why is every single premade going Galv?
---
I was in a 55 minute AV last night, it was super fun even though we lost!
---
I said so in battleground chat and someone called me a PvE'er lol
---
Alliance solo queuers are getting 900, a premade that kills lieutenants will get the same 3k.
---
Yeah so, this happened in an AV last night, people at drak were yelling at people to "hurry up" but we all had 60% mounts getting picked off mid. This actually made us actually PLAY AV to get closer to Drak, and we ended up with 3k honor instead of the 1k honor, and the game wasnt even that much longer (somewhere in the 20's).
---
I did watch though as people ditched the game the minute it took longer than 10 mins.
---
the AQ40 plate sets are completely off color for shoulders and helmets, and the warrior dungeon set helmet is off color as well
---
I've been crushing people on my hunter. Mage I can get into trouble with, but I can usually handle. Druid solo I'm dying all the time. 
---
I'll try to keep this in mind. Every warrior I've gone up against I get my face smashed in, which I'm not used to because they can't touch my mage.
---
The whole 'high and dry' thing makes it seem like your plan was to disapear without a trace.
---
I want a clean slate for the next time. Empty bags and completed repairs, too.
---
Because, killing galv gives horde time to delay everything. It always turns into a turtle at that point, and any rep gains per hour go down the tubes.
---
I'm all for pvp, but for the first week at least everyone wants rep. 45 min wins do not equal 6 min wins.
---
Don't use blink, at all, ever. It uses a lot of mana and that might be why you'll pool runs out before mobs die.
---
Do this
---
1) ALWAYS use Frost/Ice armour over Mage Armour, since the armour increase and slow is vital
---
2) make sure you are fully buffed up
---
3) Make any mana gems you can make
---
4) Ensure full mana
---
5) Pull the mobs you want to attack
---
6) Frost nova once together and ready
---
7) Run max distance that Blizzard allows to cast, you don't need to blink
---
8) Wait until Frost Nova is 2 or 3 seconds until breaking naturally and cast a blizzard with the furthest edge of the circle just touching them, so they have to walk through the entire blizzard range
---
9) Cast blizzard again using the same method (This should apply a slow to them, especially good if you have Imp Blizzard &amp; Permafrost)
---
10) When second blizzard ends they should be very close to you, this is when you cast Cone of Cold (May not get it til 26 or 28 if no CoC just follow from after this) kite them while they are slowed via chill from Blizzard until Nova comes off CD, it should only be a second or two, recast Nova, max range, repeat.
---
Alliance or Horde?
---
People will generally gravitate towards the path of least resistance. If killing boars in Durotar somehow gave 2% more honor than pvp, the majority would do that.
---
some good points
---
[Orcish] G o  tO r E tA i l
---
Yeah on tues both horde and ally were getting fast rewards, with 6-7 min games. Ally win with 1k honor, horde get ~2k
---
Now it seems like horde have 20 on defense trying to be a nuissance, and ally win anyway after 20-30 mins, each side gets 2-3k honor... If it wasn't for rep I'd stick with wsg premades
---
Ohhhhhh myyyyy....
---
Nice to hear you are doing well! What was your leveling experience, and did you have trouble collecting pre-raid gear at 60?
---
That doesn't matter, you'll get the same amount of rested experience with or without turning the quests in
---
Whiners will be whiners.
---
Nope, hunter only bug.  =)
---
I blinked always after my first nova starting around level 23. The impact on mana use was negligible imo once you start stacking intellect.
---
shekels
---
&gt; Tis a flesh wound
---
I wish I were this grossly incandescent...
---
My main is a level 48 Druid. Still trying to figure out my PvP, but for PvE grinding it's amazing. The damage plus self heals can keep me out in the world for a long, long time. When the P2 gank fest was going on, I could escape any situation relatively easily. I could also bring it 1v1 with players on the same level. Love it, fun character.
---
There are alliance players making as much as horde. The difference is that there is a much larger gap within alliance premade/nonpremade now
---
Druid druid
---
I keep clicking F for target of target - now I have it bound to certain abilities and keep mis-clicking them.
---
A "parse" in this context means a top performance on a specific boss encounter, relative to other players of your class.
---
"I got a 98% parse on Rag tonight" means that out of all the recorded Rag fights uploaded to the logging website, you outperformed 97% of all players in your class.
---
In wow go to system&gt;advanced look for a dropdown list labeled graphics card.  Its probably set to auto detect, you need to select your GPU from that list.
---
Thanks will try this! I think an issue I was having was in kiting there was a bunch of stealthies so if I kited over a big distance I would run into them. I will test this out on a different area and possibly go to hillsbrad after a bit and see how it fares from there. Appreciate the breakdown!
---
As a horde I won 3 and lost 2 so far.
---
0/30/21 HotW/NS spec here.
---
I am dinging 60 tonight (only 1 bar left!) and was seeing if my setup could heal in MC? I have about +169 healing power in my healing gear with around 4600 mana unbuffed. I feel confident in my healing but wanted to make sure I would be viable.
---
I feel exactly the same way. I miss the opposite faction.
---
Here we go boys, new whine topic.
---
Those are two radically different situations
---
I get it every day.
---
almost every single video game (or game in general) can be dumbed down to pure math. I have yet to see an rpg where you don't end up min/maxing if you are used to doing so. MinMax mindset is hard to get rid of. 
---
On the one hand I want to play DnD and Single Player games just for the fun, but you also kinda want to be efficient and as good as possible to have more fun with a power fantasy. So you look up good build ideas... AAAAND you are minmaxing again.
---
Ah, thanks
---
You can always just look at his resource bar
---
Only blink if dazed and always used rank1 frost nova, nothing else is important
---
You can see that he’s a bear and his main damage is from maul right?
---
After second blizzard, I usually finish them off with Arcane explosion
---
This will likely work, fixed the same issue for me
---
Haha that actually made me laugh, ggwp
---
You'll have to stick around for late AQ40 and Naxx if you want difficulty.
---
Who said (gnome)warrior is useless in solo WPVP?
---
You can absolutely do DME Lasher farming in raid  spec with dungeon gear or of the eagle greens. Just drop tailoring for herbalist and be on your merry way. You can pick tailoring back up in P4 for bloodvine after making insane amounts of gold. Respeccing should be saved for competitive pvping.
---
Pvp server. There was some camping/ganking but it’s a lower pop server with close to 50/50 ratio. BRM was a pain in the ass to get to but now it’s fine. Wasn’t enough to ruin the game.
---
unfortunately you use it for a long time, until aq i think as melee? pls someone correct me if im wrong, anyway my point is you need it tbh
---
Alright thanks!
---
Also, the large difference in skill caps between games is a factor.
---
Once you reach the limit of your skills, the only way to get more powerful is to grind for items. In WoW, you can get very close to that point fairly easily, while you will still see ways to improve your play in Dark Souls after 100s of hours.
---
&gt; I want to be a Bear mainspec later on. Is that a good idea for leveling or is Cat still the way to go? 
---
Cat is the way to go if your going to solo, if your going to duo or more Bear is better. (although I would put 2 points into feline swiftness at 21 for leveling.
---
&gt; How big of an impact do Bear-only Talents have while tanking dungeons (all level ranges)? 
---
The bear only talents increase your rage, your damage/threat, and your armor.  Pug Dungeons are  challenging. Healers are usually spec'd dps and healing anyway, tanks are usually spec'd dps and tanking anyway, and DPS are glass cannons, who can only see their damage meter.   Having actual tank talents will get you compliments all the way up that you are the best tank/ easiest to heal tank/ they have ever had.
---
Sometimes you will get a group without insane dps party member and a healer that is actually spec'd heals, those groups, the healers mana is going to stay full and you'll be able to chain pull the entire dungeon, only stopping to rest after buffs.
---
Double Druid. Among the stronger levelers, solid at PvP both solo and in groups, and both of you can play any role in an endgame dungeon group. Only downside is if you roll healer/tank you don’t have a true rez, but the pros outweigh that.
---
The main issue is that engineering is required to solo pvp on a warrior. Not to mention all the FAPs and being a gnome certainly helps against mages. With everyone and their mother being engineers I would have to as well meaning countless hours of farming to make a shit ton of nades to eat up in a single week
---
That ram is the twinkle in my eye so you better watch yourself buster brown.
---
Tab targeting
---
Mograine-PVP is very good. Very even 50/50 alliance/horde split, very active server.
---
Some minor que times on Sat/Sun raid times, and when the patch comes out ques up to about half hour but that's it really. Price worth paying for an active server IMO
---
Because a premade can communicate and move quickly enough for it to work. If you've got at least half the raid at Drek at 6-7 minutes you've won. PUGs have 5 people there after 10 minutes because people get spread out and die when going for Galv.
---
Earthfury
---
I know I remember being totally engrossed in Dungeon Siege back in the day, and Zelda games.
---
Now I barely can do it because the worlds feel so dead.
---
Report system is the new gamemasters.
---
They cant do anything if report system says other.
---
What if I told you that we enjoy rushing.
---
Everyone? Given the number of people on here who keep posting about how glad they were to summon a rocky boi I think there may be dozens of us. We're gonna keep pvping in the battleground, hope you have fun at Van!
---
Getting all the honor plus triple rep is a waste? Every game I've defended i end up winning with less time invested than just losing 3 games for same amount of rep and honor.
---
Haven't been an issue at all but I upvote every Office Space-meme.
---
If you got next lvl after turn ins rested will give you more bonus experience.
---
If you're level 36 now and mostly looking to PvP o n your drood, you might try getting to 39 and then just living in WSG as they greatest flag carrier in existence. At that bracket where no one has mounts yet you're godly. Maybe play there for awhile,  get a feel for druid PvP (get used to utilizing your WHOLE kit), and see how you feel about the class after that.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e9779b/everybody_needing_on_trash_green_drops_in_av/
---
It's the best available one, yes. It's far from perfect. Some effects are not weighted, and it's missing moonkin entirely.
---
Horde adapted after 1 day. Alliance is just dumb I dunno.
---
Ill reroll then. Fuck i love feral but i cant kill shit sadly. Ill go hunter :) thanks
---
You can bind them in keybindings.
---
You an also use a macro and do it on mouse over so you don’t have to change targets which can be really nice:
---
/script SetRaidTarget(“mosueover”, n)
---
Replace n with 8 for skull, 7 for cross, 5 for moon.
---
If the grind of high end pve/pvp isnt fun for ya then just twink it up. Some of the brackets might dry up and que times might become long/nonexistant but who knows really. I do think a decent amount of people will try twinking. I did it back in vanilla and it was pretty fun. The 19 rogue twink sword on my server already goes for 200-400 gold.
---
I would recommend a lvl 60 char to farm gold/mats on. That is only if you wanna really min/max. Crusader enchants and Eng bombs arent cheap.
---
I play d2 during queue times.
---
I have the same problem, my addons all outdated
---
When i do what you suggest Twitch says i have no addon installed. Then again I didnt download them all from twitch (im sure i did  some of the though). 
---
Any idea what I should do then? :)
---
[don't be jealous of us](https://i.redd.it/qjabqsfupdq11.jpg)
---
In my original post I discuss how this did happen in vanilla but not to the extent it happens on Classic....
---
I meant thorns :D yo night elf spins are op man, also furblog form :D
---
No I wait aprox. 4-8 minutes for an AV invite and an additional 2 minutes for it to start. I earn aprox 350-450 rep without the turtle and 800-1000 rep with the turtle + giving in my marks.
---
A game taking 30-40 instead of 7-10 minutes for 2-3 times the honor is better than me finishing 1 game every 15-17 minutes. If we were to exlude waiting times, yes my rep per hour in the first option is better. But there are waiting times and all that shit which makes the rep gain better on turtle matches that I win.
---
Facts
---
Imagine bragging about parses when they compare to other boomkins 💀
---
hope you get report-abused out of every av you join
---
hey OP
---
just wanted to ask how it worked out for you with CHT in MH both for PvE but also PvP 
---
I only have CHT as I come from preraid BiS with rends swords but want to swap over to dagger (combat for pve and the typical sprint / prep build for pvp) with whatever good offhand dagger I can find (think I'll get scarlet kris or maybe distracting dagger from DM:W) 
---
i will grind the lobo from AV but till then I'd like to MH CHT so all learnings from you are appreciated
---
It’s less rep for a loss dude. 350 per win.  No objectives make up for that.
---
Very close for horde PVE now. Def better for horde once ZG comes out if you get ZG buff. https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=24425/spirit-of-zandalar    
---
Already better for alliance PVE with kings.     
---
Already better for PVP for both factions.
---
To be fair,  the entire barrens story is “go hunt ________” while the alliance has the defies brotherhood stuff from start through stockades,
---
&gt;The interesting thing is that I don't see the Horde getting more rep or honor
---
We actually get more honor and more Rep this way.
---
So instead of making a change that is healthy for the game people should just quit and go to retail. Will do....
---
Wpvp for honor is gone for good. Wpvp for resources or just to mess with the other faction will exist, and also existed when flying mounts were around. Flying mounts didn't kill wpvp bgs killed it in vanilla, and they did again in classic.
---
Yeah DS is strong for sure, with the current speed clearing meta, working in an imp summon would be tricky though
---
We do when we win.
---
Thank you
---
&gt;I see you can't count.
---
One link lists nine servers. The other lists an additional three. 
---
Enough servers or not, saying "Blizzard REFUSED to add any" is wrong, as is "4 extra servers on launch".
---
Gg, now you can go out into the open world and camp quest locations for revenge.
---
I like Luna Raid Frames. It puts a nicely visible border around the frame when there's something I can dispell. For example, as a druid, if someone gets poisoned, they get a green border.
---
It also works with an addon called Clique, which lets you bind spells (or macros) to different keyboard/click combinations. For example, if I shift-click someone's raid frame, I cast a downranked healing touch on them. If I ctrl+right-click, I cast regrowth. Etc etc, all my heals and dispells are bound to different clicks, so I never have to target people in my raid.
---
Great strat. I've been frost traping alli at midway point and then falling back to defend this spot.
---
10 mc clears,  never seen it
---
Cloak of Warding is better, IMO. Granted, that depends on the weights one gives to stamina vs armor. 
---
It is also common for weighting to ignore unusual effects. Naglering, while generally ranked highly for its other properties, typically doesn't include the value of the thorns effect, which is actually pretty nice for tanking. 
---
I also often see Mark of the Chosen omitted from tanking gear. Given it's a 2% proc on hit, and it lasts a minute, it's basically constantly up while tanking. +25 to all stats is not at all bad. 
---
+9% hit is unfortunately not realistic without unreasonable tradeoffs. Crit cap is also largely irrelevant at this stage, because none of the cap numbers are vaguely hittable. Hit is better than crit, if you're trading evenly, but not obscenely so. There's a mask found on a boss in strat live that gives 2% hit, and is very good for tanking in general. Devilsaur, while not amazing for mitigation, is also a good early way to pump up +hit.
---
&gt;I want to be a Bear mainspec later on. Is that a good idea for leveling or is Cat still the way to go?
---
Bear is quite potent as a leveling spec. Up until  32 bear is Best!
---
After that cat becomes faster and faster compared to bear, while they both can kill the same size packs. Especially when you get wolfshead helm and have the talents Fearie Fire Feral, Savage Fury and Furor after 40 cat is just faster. 
---
At 40 you also get dire Bear form so bear stays "competitive" through sheer tankyness. You also become a very good dungeon tank for free.
---
&gt;How big of an impact do Bear-only Talents have while tanking dungeons (all level ranges)?
---
In dungeons, talents have a high impact, but are far from mandetory... all level ranges.. I sometimes tank as full resto+balance in max level dungeons. I might struggle a bit with threat, but it is not bad.
---

---
*  [Thick Hide](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=16933/thick-hide)  , Feral: Not important, but is good to know about that it actually scales multiplicativly with dire bear form... makes it good for mitigation in raids. unimportant in dungeons

---
Well that too. The stoner in me will accept this nick name.
---
Correct answer.  To properly AoE you need keep your gear up to par as you level also.  Most players still have a couple grays in there set at 23 and that won't work.
---
The big 3 issues mages run into AoE'ing
---
1. Mobs too high a level
---
2. Not enough INT (you need better gear)
---
3. Not spec'd properly
---
Honestly that's just a stupid check. 
---
If anyone falls for that once, it sucks but they learned a lesson. 
---
If anyone falls for it twice...God help them.
---
Am i so out of touch? ...no its the children who are wrong
---
nah
---
Litteraly unplayable
---
Macroing /startattack into your sinister strike button is useful, it will start your auto attack even if you don't have the energy to cast sinister strike
---
&gt; I assume it gets better at ZG because at that point you hit a certain Agility threshold where getting Lightning Reflexes from Survival becomes better for your DPS, and so stacking high agi items like Cloak of Shrouded Mist becomes BiS.
---
It also gets better at ZG for sure because of https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=24425/spirit-of-zandalar. What you said is prob true too once gear is super stacked, but that buff makes Shrouded Mist better even for MM Hunters right away
---
We get basically double the honor overall when compared to an Ally win if we kill her though.
---
I mean, the people who have fun doing that are the same people that have fun going to a low level zone and corpse camp a low level player.
---
About to play AV for the first time as horde. I'm a mage. I also suck at pvp. What should I be doing to cause the least amount of drag on the rest of the group?
---
I won't lie, right now I want to be Exalted as quickly as possible, because the off hand is ridiculous for me and I'm next in line for the Mageblade.  You won't find me talking in chat demanding others do the same, I hate those toxic guys, but you will find me part of the 100% mount zerg charging in trying to get as many wins as possible in the couple hours I have to play.
---
That said, in a week or two (I hear it can be done in a day!?!?) when I'm finally there, I will happily join team turtle because for me killing the enemy is way more fun than technically winning.
---
I expect many others feel similar, or at the very least, once everyone's exalted they'll stop queuing for it and you can enjoy proper games :)
---
How FUN is it tanking mostly dungeons with a druid? I'm thinking of starting on another server where a friend plays and mostly just dungeon tank on rested exp
---
And T
---
It's good because you get honor and rep without having to participate. However, the majority of your AV team will likely disagree with this.
---
Awesome, Thanks!!!!
---
This is no different than vanilla. We would Zerg av and win in 11-12 mins.
---
And this is allowed, right? Someone in my AV group said to report the miners, but people are obviously allowed to go claim the mines and mine all  the nodes they find. It's an objective of AV, not an important one, but it is a legit objective, so Blizzard won't do any action against those. Does the same apply to fishers?
---
Make a sinister strike macro that's like 
---
#showtoolip Sinister Stike
---
/cast Sinister Strike(rannk 5) or w/e the highest rank is
---
/startautoattack
---
Reminds me of the [old flash animation](https://youtu.be/1J4FXUMOw8k) from Newgrounds.
---
Bracket ends at 59 though right? PvP isn’t PvE mechanics btw.
---
Wsg is way more fun and I would rather play that 8 hours than AV.
---
At this point I am friendly to the lvl 60's giving me advice, but I don't follow it. They just tell you to go wherever the gear bot or whatever fandangled contraption you kids are using these days to tell you where the best loot is, tells them to tell you to go. ''You should download questie and grearie to tell you what quests to do and gear to get, that's how you have fun.''
---
Eh, no. No no no no no. Noooooooooo.
---
Thicc Pally, best Pally.
---
I made a Human by mistake : /
---
And you live in a bubble and are naive.
---
Questie is very helpful atlasloot is great for dungeons and having one for vendor price and one to get an auction house price is great. I think they are call bettervendor and auctioneer. Some will depend on class and what type of UI you want
---
I have the same experience as you. Semihardcore grinding will get you exalted in 1-2 days, and more casual gameplay will still get you to exalted within one week (if you use your little playtime you have inside AV, that is)
---
Has anybody ran the old &lt;World of Roguecraft&gt; Combat Swords spec for PVP? If so what's the pro's &amp; con's VS. Hemo?
---
Me (healer) and a buddy (tank) decided we needed a BG break last night and wanted to do an orb run. Our usual pals weren't available, so he put out "LF3 DPS Live Strat!"
---
We filled in 5 seconds. We didn't finish though because our DPS was crap, the rogue kept pulling extra mobs, and the 2 of us got bored and were dead tired. After another wipe thanks to the rogue in the hallway of death towards the end, we called it quits.
---
I'm gonna tell our mage today how much we love and miss him.
---
\^ This
---
Bad at wow? just get 14 years of experience on pservers
---
An ideal group will get galv n drek.. So unless your a 30 man + premade do not do it. Straight Drek is the best pug strat.
---
It's percentage based and time based, the rested experience would carry into next level. If you woke up turned in your quests and dinged your rested experience would be the same as if you turned in before logging out
---
As Alliance on Heartseeker, no one likes their damn asses. They are literally terrible and play like douches.
---
That's basically why I quit Elder Scrolls Online in favor of the singleplayer ES games. I've never understood why people play games just to see higher numbers on the screen.
---
wow totally forgot about this buff, yeah stacking Lightning Reflexes with that shit must get pretty bonkers
---
Didn't happen yet and they removed the autokick so I think i'll be fine. See you in AV friend!
---
In game... take your pre-formulated opinion somewhere else.
---
Im cutecaf and send nudes
---
If you like tanking.. it is fun :) Hard to give you a better answer :)
---
All I want to do is DM Tribute :(
---
Probably not, no.
---
But I can say that I'm having a great time in AV despite reddit rhetoric.
---
Defend the flag room in wsg. Same experience and a way better bg.
---
Don't let tanking seem intimidating - especially in the levelling dungeons,  and ESPECIALLY if you're already familiar with the runs. Just mark a skull and X, save your taunt to pull mobs off your healer if needed,  swipe if there's more than 2 mobs, and otherwise maul. Keep demo shout up and faerie fire on the primary target and you'll be golden :)
---
what. When were we talking about retail lol
---
Really? I swear there were guild groups running around doing objectives. I have a very clear memory of that. I suppose it is possible that they just managed to get in the same one together without a group queue somehow.
---
i want to lvl a twink, is druid good for the lvl 29 bracket?
---
Y'all getting these puprle BoEs in AV, I'm not getting them anywhere :(  I'm just a poor boy, I need a mount.
---
That happens in like 1/10 games for me yet I spam it in raids chat. They just run past the commanders/lieutanants and then they die to defending horde.
---
What do you want 10 "We did it, Reddit!" threads?
---
Whiners have already moved on to the next topic.
---
The spreadsheet download link is giving me an error? Is there an updated one or is it still working for other people?
---
WoW was obviously in a much more nubile state back in those days. You could probably run 0 spec at all and, if you were good, succeed wonderfully.
---
Given what people know today, and how they play (even though the average player is still really bad imo), this is a terrible terrible spec.
---
God you people are so stupid. Blizzard wouldn’t invest any money or staff into something that they “want to fail”. Give me a break.
---
DOWN RANK - currently been raid healing as moonglow spec for last 3 weeks and i am basically spamming rank 4 h-touc (most mana efficient and receives full bonus from +healing i believe) - i also mix in rank 7 or 8 and max rank - i've found i can literally spam rank 4 htouch for an entire boss fight on a tank if needed and with my gear it is roughly 750-850 non crit heal per
---
So you just came to the druid thread to shit on People trying to help out other druids? :O
---
You must have a lot going on in your life
---
Say what you want man but I'm doing better then you are obviously
---
Idk getting 2k rep from a 30 min game not too shabby, especially if it means you guys lose and get shit honor while doing so lololol nice drek rush here's 2 mages
---
The horde are often letting them win.
---
Like winning?
---
Now it is, yeah. Back then they couldn't really detect it.
---
And what matters oposite faction honorgain to you? Nothing. You loose, you loose big time. You are loosing honor/h. Look if BG is 30 mins you get 3k honor and maybe if win good rep. If BG is 6 min you get 900 honor. You choose...
---
You wat mate, people complain about zerging in game all the time too. Get off your high horse
---
Ok so a ton of the stuff from retail is in classic too, cool.
---
I might go for Tukui/Elvui down the road. Enjoying the UI right now but I know I'll want they greater degree of customization, got real used to it in Legion lol. Thank you!
---
Well it is high atm but not what it can be if people finish the rep grind and go back to dungeons.
---
Then the PvP players take over the majority and suddenly there are players that know what to do again and you get more stalemates and battles in AV again. Pretty confident that you wont be able to just stomp like it is atm.
---
Honor will still be pretty high though since you have 40v40 all the time in addition to the basic stuff.
---
Shaman would be faster and overall better for sure but as someone who had a priest healbot most of the leveling process it doesnt matter what healer you have. Youre literally going to mow everything down with no downtime.
---
Are you on crack ? 80% of the european servers are pvp
---
Idk man I usually pull 300-320 dps on a good RNG boss fight which isnt bad for a low tier spec.
---
Not bragging about how i was good , but how THE GAME was good.
---
Happy not to play with ppl like you
---
You're a tool bag FYI
---
What?
---
That's just, like, your opinion, man.
---
depends on server lul
---
A coordinated fishing-only AV would be pretty sweet. Could go on forever theoretically.
---
Thanks for the excerpt, John!
---
How can either side really win or lose if neither is actually playing the game.
---
Cool, thank you for the help!
---
In that specific Situation he compared himself to other boomkins so OP knows that if he has questions - there is a quite decent boomkin to ask in here.
---
The amount of Druids that don't even appear to realize they can shapeshift out of Polymorph is amazing.  I don't think I've seen a single one do it yet.
---
Rofl doing av without an epic is detrimental to your tean
---
It's 12/13/2019 here Mr Intolerant jerk.
---
Yours Truly,
---
The rest of the civilized world.
---
That’s a bingo
---
But blizzard can 👍
---
As in "I need that cheddah!"
---
yes I too have a dog-brain and only see things in black and white.
---
For optimized smite spec, you need more disc to get Force of Will. Sadly, it runs oom way too quickly and has some serious spell hit and resist issues in raid. It's really fun if you have a ret paladin in your raid though; sanctity aura for 10% more holy damage and their +140 holy damage debuff really amps up the damage.
---
I hate how entitled and toxic gamers have become. Imagine being that antisocial.
---
I think skeram is like 90/10 horde lol
---
it's up to you to use it. The existence of this button doesn't make you less of an asshole for using it.
---
The game make ninja looting possible. Doesn't change that if you ninja loot, YOU are the asshole. Not the devs.
---
Because i used to love so much vanilla
---
Time for another thread full of passive aggressiveness
---
You are correct here: druid tanks are much better for any 5-10 man content than similarly geared warriors. However even a fury warrior with leather pieces is able to tank any 5/10-man dungeon without breaking a sweat. And there is not a single boss in whole Classic which appropriately geared and specced prot warr couldn't tank, unlike bear tank.
---
Don't why the down vote, but I had 14.7k which is about 2.5k honor a game (even with the long game) and about 8.4k per hour. WSG only.
---
Play games for fun and challenge? GTFO of here with that garbage!   
---
who*
---
I don’t right now I’m driving back north with my gf to visit her family so I have time for shit talking, and I’m not shitting on druids, just dudes who brag about irrelevant parses
---
Default RaidFrames + mouseover macros
---
Great advice! I was going for the more chill lols experience and I’ll be using gold from my main. Is alchemy mostly for mana pots?
---
Yeah I find myself alone near the rear while everyone chases down kills, then some rogue stunlocks KO's me or a warrior smashes my face in.
---
I'm bored as dick at the moment. Don't care for alts, farming or PvP. I only log on to raid or if someone pokes me on Discord to heal something. Game isn't nearly as complex or interesting as I remember. Still fun, but idk. Feels like I have more fun with other games right now.
---
yes, WSG is the primary BG for twinking and druids are AMAZING flag carriers in that battleground. 
---
Make a bear centric build to make sure you survive all the rogues in the 29 bracket. You can also turn into a cat and do neat cat things, like Prowl and run really fast.  Also, as with all Druid Forms you break and are protected from Polymorph effects. 
---
This is really great at this bracket! [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-500252130002](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-500252130002)
---
Yeah bro what he really should have done is do an AV, then stand around for 2 hours then do another. That way the boring shit could be dragged out and he could pretend to be fulfilled and thrilled for months. Because how DARE THAT MOTHERFUCKER play the game in a way you didn't approve, oh god of ego.
---
So they are viable for speedruns I have been told.
---
The extra 3% crit is nice for other casters and since the fights are very short anyway. They don't have to Dance at the end of the fight :P
---
How so by getting parses that mean literally nothing?
---
Its not?
---
People are constantly asking for premade vs premade only BGs in retail as well.
---
No one looks at overall parses, you always compare yourself to your class...
---
Can you please NOT call other's names?  You could have made your point without calling him an idiot.  The fact that this is being upvoted is even more concerning to me as to goes to show how toxic this community can be.
---
It's seriously shocking how stupid alliance are in those situations. Legit seen 10 horde kill 20+ alliance because they won't dismount to just blow the fuckers away in 5 seconds. People just dying on their mounts lmao.
---
You need “of the eagle” gear.
---
Funny thing is I made a hunter to min max exploration with the !cast eagle eye macro
---
Y'all def overreacted, apart from like Herod and faerlina the game was perfectly fine. You aren't supposed to be out questing at lvl 50+ anyway as it's shit xp.
---
well, you don’t have to. it’s a game and you should do what you like. 
---
i think tanking is the most fun role, so i would encourage you to at least try it out. you might like it? and druids are good at tanking. not so great at dps. often it’s more fun to do something you’re good at. 
---
35-40ish is a great time to try it out, because the SM is a great dungeon. they’re short, the pull order is pretty easy, you are less likely to get lost, etc. it would be harder to learn at 60 because the dungeons are more complicated and expectations are higher. 
---
if you want to try it ... for the talents... see if you can find a point or two somewhere to get the bonus rage on crits (analogous to the double CP one for cat form). without that you’ll probably be fine too, but it made me feel less rage-starved. (i also like the threat/stealth over ferocious bite, but i bet you don’t need it). 
---
in the open world i often wind up using bear form anyway? eg if i pull too many. 
---
i don’t know — just my opinion. good luck!
---
The real minmax
---
Hearing nothing but hate for the current AV but I love it as a horde
---
you arent *in* traffic, you *are* traffic.
---
Point is when the class is trash at DPS a 90% parse is irrelevant.
---
Favorite game last night turned into a turtle we narrowly lose. There were two vocal flamers throughout, one of whom left when there were roughly 10 mins left, the other stayed the whole time... bitching the whole time lol. In the end he did get what he felt was his "I told you so moment," so good for him?
---
Lightning Reflexes is near the bottom of the Survival tree, maybe that's not the name?
---
It increases maximum agility by 15% at 5/5
---
For now, keep using Black Baron, then at a certain Agi threshold using that talent, Shrouded Mists becomes better I assume. Not hunter so I can't really get specific as to how much agi you need for that, you'll have to look it up.
---
Damn if your this soft, do it lol I was just clarifying it for you.
---
&gt; Not sure where all the hate is coming from
---
People who are slaves to their jobs and have to finish everything 8 months behind everyone else being jealous and hiding it behind thinly veiled aggression. Happens basically every time someone does anything and posts it on this board.
---
How do they mean nothing?! It means I'm doint better then most other boomkins. It means my guilds clearing faster then most others. It means my dps is in top 40% for all classes etc. It means alot dude go be a casual somewhere else.
---
Where were you farming then? The drop rate of clams scales with the level of the enemy. If you're farming 20's in Ashenvale, it will be a lot more rare of a drop.
---
I typed out this reply with math to prove my point before realizing that you are right. It does not matter if you turn your quests in before or after you stop for the night.
---
I am of the \*probably\* unpopular opinion that none of the PVP in Classic is really all that good, well-designed, or fun. With the \*slight\* exception of WSG premade vs. premade matches. Even then, though, it gets pretty old pretty quick.
---
Look for a wand once your around level 5. Its the first one Enchanters can make so usually they put them on the ah cheap. It will drastically make your soloing faster.
---
Honestly whenever I see someone get big mad it’s always those two servers.
---
Go outside.
---
There is no fix? I tried to disable most of addons and update them all
---
This is one of the first things I want to see happen if they go classic+ 
---
But, they will have to increase difficulty to compensate. No debuff limits will mean bosses will hit less, deal less damage, take more damage, etc. They will likely have to adjust their health pools, armor, and damage to maintain a similar difficulty.
---
Ferals would have even better dps. As it is, they do decent dps (Out dps hunters if they use the right 'rotation'). But letting them keep up bleeds, damage would be much better.
---
I wonder how it would affect balance dps, letting them keep moonfire up... Im pretty sure it still wont make them competitive though. Insecswarms reduce hit will help the tanks damage taken slightly (theoretically), which might help healers mana? Im still pretty sure they wont be competitive dps without some gear changes.
---
But still not more fun
---
I died like 8 times before learning how to set it up perfectly. 
---
Now I only die 7 times.
---
That is impossible I was assured by this subreddit that none of the changes implemented by Blizzard our benevolent overlords^T^M would affect gameplay. It was all just QoL fixes with no unforeseen consequences whatsoever.
---
Every game ive played, 70-90% of people on both sides fight in middle at the start.  If I manage to get the Flag to the half way mark, I generally get lots of backup. Before that I'll be lucky to have one or two people with me so you play like your alone.
---
General tactic for wsg at the moment is to try and avoid the mass carnage in the middle whilst getting enemy flag and hoping your team win the battle in mid so they can get your flag back. 
---
Main priority is having fun though. If you just want to win, then premade is the way to go. That is where you will need proper tactics and coordination which is hard to get in random groups.
---
With hemo you get CP stackers, plus Energy gains in assassination. But it’s not all that bad. I’ve tested it and it works well in WSG and against some classes 1v1 duels. It’s not as bad as people think it runs. Like the other guy said you could run 0/0/0 and still win if you know what you’re doing. If you want prep because you wanna use all your CDs x2 then prep would work for them. But this spec was for HWL rogues back in 2004-2006 and it slayed. Yes, people take this game way to seriously now know what they’re doing but it’s really not that bad as people portray it to be imo
---
I have two shamans. A level 60 and level 48. For my third character I am wondering if I should make a druid. How do they compare to a Shaman?
---
I can't remember his name/server. I just saw some twitch clips and post about it on discord/reddit. It was hilarious at first, but turns out to be really shitty for that person. Also speaks to the community on that server. This is no longer just toxic kids. This is mobbing.
---
Didn't debuff slots get unlocked at some point during vanilla?
---
How do you get this??
---
I can see the confusion though because it's percentage based, just doing my part to clear confusion
---
That ship sailed. Better if we all get over it and let them improve the game experience.
---
that's not how speech bubbles work
---
Where is this parse irrelevant?
---
When OP is looking for a boomkin to ask questions how would a parse compared to mages help him out at all? 
---
He would see that mages are stronger.
---
A parse compared to Boomkins at least lets him know that he is talking to a decent boomkin right now and can then ask for parses compared to other classes.
---
Otherwise OP would never know if he was actually talking to a boomkin that knows what he is doing or if it is a boomkin that has literally no clue.
---
Just because that parse wasn't what you wanted or expected that doesn't mean that it is irrelevant.
---
"I don't right now" would have been enough 
---
&gt;I’m driving back north with my gf to visit her family 
---
was actually irrelevant...
---
Right because normally you're comparing viable classes, if you replaced every auxiliary dps in your raid with 90% parsing meme specs your damage and kill speed would nose dive
---
It's more like half run in to murder Balinda and the other half stay behind her building and try to dismount people. This guarantees they're going to respawn north of Balinda. It is 100% forcing an alliance turtle because now those same people have to somehow get south of 40ish horde again which isn't going to happen. Hence forcing an ally turtle.
---
I don't think your gonna have a good time in pvp with this build, might be okay for AV since its mostly pve
---
tanking the drek part of av without a healer buddy in game with you is just really crap, die die die
---
They used to safespot and Gank in horde, so it's nice to see im not the only one hating their guts
---
Man I miss getting ganked by you on the Org rooftops!
---
This doesn't make sense to me.  I distinctly remember Druids being able to shift out of polymorph in vanilla.  In fact, I Just found it in the [patch notes for 1.4](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.4.0):
---
&gt; Charm and  [Polymorph] mechanics can now be reactively countered by spells and abilities (e.g. Druid Shapeshifting will now cancel Polymorph effects).
---
If Druids can't shift out of Polymorph, then this appears to be a bug/oversight.  Unless they reversed this at some point during vanilla and I just don't remember.
---
See that explanation makes sense to me, but probably not for the reason you think.
---
Realistically, other people levelling faster than you doesn't really affect your game if you enjoy the slower pace of questing.
---
But the fact that you're more interested in competing with people in leveling than you are with focusing on your own questing experience is something I understand because questing just isn't that great.
---
Why does the amount of people and what server they are on make a difference? If someone needed that boe you should pass on it right?
---
Or you can log in and verify that there in fact are no weekend NPCs.
---
Fun fact: killing the right enemies and then lose fast gives you more honor and rep than winning. On horde side we literally have ppl spamming which bosses to kill and how to lose fast. 3k honor and 600-700rep per game. I wish winning wozld be more effective than losing in purpose.
---
&gt;constructive critique
---
Anecdotal rant*
---
Need to be equipped.
---
Work just like a resurrection spell so can be used after release.
---
They don't always work.
---
Nah, it's not the best. Second best for sure.
---
You can't beat the survivability of the real flag carry spec with swiftmend.
---
Worldpvp is nothing like it used to be though.
---
Fury prot is the new meta for a reason. 145% threat mod on literally everything they do, heroic strike has a flat threat mod on top of the damage, and druids can’t equip tf. Warriors are simply better for holding threat in a raid environment.
---
Op asked about boomkins in raids, if you want to give him a more truthful look of how they are you compare them to all other DPS classes to which they don’t compete. And idc if my little fun road trip story was irrelevant I got time to type it 🤷🏻‍♂️ not nearly as irrelevant as a boomkin parse against other boomkins.
---
😉
---
You got exalted already? Didn’t AV come out Tuesday?
---
I’ve been in one that took only 8 minutes, but it is by no means the average (probably 15-20)
---
Now that the players who understand that farming drek for rep is the quickest for honor as well are finished the horde are back to winning most of the games.
---
Please understand majority of players are now adults with responsibilities that do not have the time to invest in WoW like they used it. 
---
Their enjoyment is being efficient with their limited play time. Why is that such a bad thing to do?
---
Guild would clear a lot faster if they had a mage or warrior instead of boomkin🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Thats kind of how I played BFA. Retail wow is actually really friendly towards single player style
---
Less fun as a priest tbh. I can be extremely useful and those times are fun, but 99% I'm just silenced and exploded. Alliance, fear does absolutely nothing against all the warriors and undead.
---
PvP is still in pugs every once in a while, but I'm mostly in classic for the raids that I never got to do when I was younger.
---
I like the zone. I like that, when it's played for objectives, you have some battles in given points that can move up and down the map, there can be a push pull because of the design that doesn't exist in WSG or AB. Plus, if you have folks gathering items, it can lead to some surprises there, adding a little more dynamic. Basically, it's a WoW PvP/PvE tug of war. 
---
It's just a different form of instanced PvP that's nice to play sometimes, I mean, when it's actually played. I'm not even saying that to be a dick, there are just enough people right now with different intent that the push-pull dynamic is rare. Even some horde turtles fail because the alliance just spread out/avoid the turtles and eventually regroup past them anyways. 
---
It's not super complex. But then, especially right now, what is? This game is fun, sure, but the early content isn't exactly super challenging.
---
I played like 3 matches yesterday and fought mid with a few allies while the rest rushes npc’s. It wasn’t that bad imo.
---
what class does she play?
---
Why would the dwarf racial matter? grinding high pvp ranks is pve (AV).  So human would be better
---
I mean the term minmax comes from DnD-- it's an age old struggle that predates computer games.
---
Some people want to get lost in the immersion of a fantasy world, and some people enjoy cheesing the system to make a more powerful character.
---
Both are valid ways to play the game, but they are very much in opposition to each other.
---
Fury prot is plenty tanky, the only issue that may arise is a chain of crits/crushing but it’s all easily healable. I’m able to solo heal our fury prot tanks on basically every boss in mc except rag and I bet I could do that too if I wasn’t at risk of getting punted and letting the tank die.
---
Make a pre made.
---
Also the onset of welfare epics, although most right now feel as though theyve "earned" their rep rewards.
---
Once everyone and their grandma is running around with Lei's, Lobotomizer's and Don Julio's then it will become more apparent.
---
There's an entire dozen of us mages who still enjoy questing.
---
I mean, let people enjoy what they want. If people love playing a video game that makes them feel good then let them continue doing it. 
---
As for people trying to be the best, let them keep dreaming and trying to be the best. There are millions of kids dreaming and practicing to be the best at a sport so they can someday play in the big leagues. SAME concept applies to video games. If you want to be great at something you must be willing to sacrifice. how much you sacrifice is entirely up to you. 
---
On a personal experience I enjoy being one of the best druid tanks/pvper on my server. I still have my engineering job and girlfriend and workout. I can still be playing that hardcore level and in a hardcore guild without sacrificing other things I love. 
---
Balance is everything. Somethings like R14 arent worth it to me. But remaining a good player always is. Accomplishments in games are almost as satisfying as getting that recent raise or promotion.
---
If 1 mob resists your nova it shouldn’t break ur barrier before it is time to nova again.
---
it's almost like people have different subjective opinions
---
If you dont wanna tank man its cool. Not gonna waste my gold on that bullshit. Yeah people need gold, thats what farming is dude. Id rather wait like 10-15 extra minutes for a guildie to come along.
---
Probably not. I pull enough damage alone to compensate a pre bis mage. Then I ha e +3% crit for 4 other mages that is alot then I have brez buffs I decurse I heal when needed I dont think you're seeing the point here. If I may ask what class/spec do you play?
---
The nice thing about ffxiv is that it embraces this model. Join when new patch is out, enjoy the story, catch up with friends then call it a day for a couple of .months. none of this endless grind towards efficiency. Hopefully of we get more big mmos (big if it feels) they're more like that or something way out there. We dont need more wows.
---
Killing hunter pets is my calling card(UD Rogue)
---
If 5 people report you got instakick. So a group of friends could kick anyone.
---
That's correct, just mostly stating that just because this happened that there is still toxicity, it's delusional to think otherwise. As it would also be delusional to think there is no kindness because of toxic encounters.
---
I mean that's the nice thing about this av. You don't actually have be there while you're doing it. You can do a lot of other stuff in home while afk in AV. Just come every few minutes and hit the keyboard.
---
What realm are you on?? I don’t think I’ve had a single Druid NOT shapeshift out and I’m
---
rank 8
---
Looks like a generic playlist not specifically for wow
---
when you are around lvl 25, go to blackfathom deeps. There is a VERY powerful wand in there, which will basically make more damage than if you used spells, that you will keep until level 45 if not 50, and which will make your 25-40 leveling a complete joke
---
Or under geared, a lot of guilds feed onslaughts/perds/trueflight etc to dps and wonder why their tanks struggle to hold the boss in place.
---
EU stands for Europe, I am guessing OP is looking for a EU server....
---
This is 100% wrong
---
/s ?
---
They can shift out
---
You literally just proved my point by the second sentence my man
---
Are you ok ?
---
What difference does it make when Hordes receive more honors than Alliance do? You’re not in direct competition for rank.
---
People that are serving Drek right now just want reps. For those that want honors, go play Wsg it’s much more efficient for honors.
---
Hah, well it appears we found one in the wild here.  :P
---
This is fukcing great gratz dude have fun in there and on 58 lvl 60 fukcing sucks if u just wanna have fun
---
Imagine having to wait for Q times
---
It will if you have crap for armor stat
---
Should have run with me. I was spamming for SGC once and saw that belt drop three times in a row.
---
To this day, I am unconvinced the dervish is real. I have never seen it spawn.
---
RNG’s a bitch.
---
500 per win, which was more common the first couple days it feels like
---
My weekly trek to Ony actually feels like a chore sometimes now. "Oh wow I actually have to go to Org now fml"
---
Honor compared to Ally means shit-all.  The factions do not compete for honor!  You compete *within* your faction for honor.
---
For solo players the average is indeed higher now.
---
Oh okay , that makes sense . Thank you.
---
Just be happy we dont have 1-2 hr queues, cross-server BG's is a blessing and you think you don't want them but you do.
---
Amazing how few people consider this to be a team game and get bored enough to quit once they’ve mostly filled out their gear. Terribly selfish. I understand getting burned out but to continue to take gear when you know you feel the burnout is really sleezy.
---
I ran MC with the boys and girls from the guild last night. One of the Rogues was drunk out of his mind and wanted to roll.  I ended up clearing him out for +/- 350g. Enough to get me my 100% mount. Best run of my life
---
More like: You mean I can actually quest again? Holy shit... I can progress. I have got more exp in the last 2 days than I did in the last 3 weeks.
---
To each their own, but why not a "I know these paths, but it's still nice to walk them" feeling?
---
Bear tanks are great because they have close to the tankiness of a shielded warrior, while having close to the threat of a 2h/DW warrior tank. Just makes for smooth dungeon runs comparatively because it's more balanced.
---
Yes
---
All of them
---
\- Yeah, I use single talent in Nature's Grasp myself. 
---
\- Furor +  Feral Charge "combo" is quintessential to druid flag carrying in 60 premades. Hence, it is also technically optimal. Especially if you are looking to do honor/hour.
---
\- Thing is though.. you are twinking :P You are here to get kills and be OP xD Nothing fucks the rogues harder than when you have tons of armor, health and crit them hard and often :D
---
Everyone who rerolled or made a sob story about quitting must feel really dumb now.
---
The world is more peaceful than ever.
---
Wonder what's being missed. Towers going down I suspect.
---
The reason people are rushing Drek is there's a bunch of incompetent players spamming to rush Drek in the lobby that have tried to make that the meta. First, Horde have very easily adapted to groups rushing Drek, and can just send a few members to wipe pugs at the warmasters because they will always pull before they have relief hut capped. Second, going Galv together as one group means people don't get spread out and will stay together moving down. It doesn't require some sort of elite level communication.
---
There is a talent that gives 5 rage when you crit as bear. More rage means more attacks means more chances to crit means more rage.
---
you know, there is something that may be crazy to you.
---
But maybe,
---
MAYBE
---
The ones complaining about people going afk aren't the same ones that upvote fishing in AV.
---
I know, it can be absolutely incredible and even avant-gardiste to think that a subreddit with more than 400 000 members (and several thousand connected at the same moment) can have various communities with different advice about things.
---
But try to think about it, really
---
Having this problem now ;/
---
Wow, that's super refreshing. Kind of inspiring actually
---
And bears have a 175%, which means our dps matters less. Not sure what your point is.
---
DPS has no other alternative, so fuck off
---
Figured it might be better chance by doing balinda/commanders rather than what I'm doing by rushing Stormpike GY?
---
This is amazing! 🙉
---
Yea theres no battlegroups, all u.s. servers are crossrealm
---
Is this a confirm or deny? Or is this your own buried anger coming out because you know this is what you're gonna do? Hypocrite!
---
Big math brain
---
When doing Battlemaster to get the wins (it was during the rush meta) I'd encourage people to defend Galv and work on retagging the towers as they run past. 
---
Similar tactics seem to work now, although I am resto now not a warlock, i'll have ot find friends.
---
Haha thanks man! I feel you on this. I’m in my fourth year of university, have a girlfriend that I’ve been dating for ages and live with, and going to be starting my career soon. 
---
I’m already playing very casually so the likelihood of me being able to do anything but pug raids is extremely unlikely if I even am able to ding 60 and get all my pre BiS together. 
---
I wish you the best in life, it’s really good that you’re able to recognize this and prioritize these things; many people who play this game do not haha.
---
Ya... except you look like a pear in pally gear.
---
Which they should have done anyway.
---
You're horde we did not expect you to!
---
Why would a pug not be able to get Galv, kill lieutenants at IB Gy then move down together towards Drek? The only reason people are rushing Drek is because it's been reinforced as the strat to use, but it's one of the easiest for horde to counter because you're pulling a shit ton of warmasters without a graveyard capped.
---
if you want to fish, there are plenty other places than a pvp battleground with limited spots.
---
Ran an dungeon recently where one of the guys in my group paid for this guy to tank. Not gonna say his name cuz thats shitty. This dude was a t1 geared warrior and also the shittiest tank I have ever witnessed. Pulled entire rooms, didnt wait for mana for anyone, wiping then blaming everyone else and calling everyone idiots. After like the 3rd wipe we called him out and he just bounces. Fuck even the possibility of that happening. People running dungeons probably need gold just as much if not more than raid geared players.
---
Just learn how to pvp. Keybind everything, learn some combos, practice, and dont be afraid to suck. AV is the perfect place to learn.
---
Netflix Windows 10 app has picture in picture my dude.
---
it shouldn't unless you change it back to defensive again.
---
Nostalgia gogles will fall off once content stops and they are stuck in the rut of never seeing nax, grinding for 8+hrs for raid(12 if you are a warlock), Vanilla was fun when i was younger( when i was 12 it released) and had no obligations but now? nah ill pass.  
---
Plus raid mechanics pitifully easy, only "chalenging" "mechanics"in all of vanilla are the gear checks .
---
The same thing happened to me and I couldn’t figure it out, I am stoked to go home and try this now.
---
I just hit 51 yesterday on my Elemental Shaman. Is it viable to continue questing to 60 or does there start to be a lack of quests? I was in the hinterlands and only managed a little over 1 level off every quest available.
---
Is it just best for me to switch to resto and grind through the higher level dungeons like BRD?
---
Eh there’s a big difference between min/maxing and just wanting the best stuff in BWL for Warlocks. The latter is just a goal. The former is an entire style of gameplay.
---
reducing enemy power and more dmg for your cat finisher move, that's really solid, also demoralizing roar is sooooo good in dungeons man or against warriors/rogue, you basically reduce dmg from all mobs by like 20-30%, less against 60s afcors but so good
---
&gt;I’m currently in the barrens and fighting things my level. 
---
I think mages are supposed to AOE farm green level mobs, can someone confirm?
---
It isn’t breaking my barrier, they’re just straight up hitting me through it even though it’s still up
---
That's not what I've been experiencing at all. About 20 horde go on defense and try to wipe the ally push and take the graveyards so we get sent back to the beginning creating a turtle. If that happens I'm pretty sure horde win eventually, but I afk out
---
The list of BG instances is listed in order of oldest to newest. If you were to click one at the top, you likely will enter a turtle. Join from the bottom, 999/1000 you join a brand new instance. 
---
What this means (for group sizes less than 10) 
---
Be in discord with group.
---
Have everyone talk to battle master and scroll to the bottom.
---
Your scroll placement stays at the bottom.
---
Do your countdown, with one person clicking to view the list at “1” instead of “click/go.”
---
That person announces the BG number at the very bottom of the list, everyone that clicked on “click/go” would see the one he announced as being the last, or a few above their last, you all que to his number. 
---
Don’t go in, but leave the “enter BG” dialogue box up until everyone get the pop. 
---
If after ~30s most aren’t in, someone else is likely doing a premade in that group, and you try again. 
---
There is a script to select the last instance in a list from there, similar to how you would make a script for leveling enchanting by selecting the enchant ID from the list window for example, but that gets testy with TOS, so I’m not going to go out of my way to promote it.
---
Get 1-2 annihilators for more armor pen, and a nightfall once it is available.
---
This is something wow has always done in every expansion. As time progresses gear catch-up methods are put in place.
---
Amplified Agony is on a 3 minute CD and won’t help on multiple targets.  Imp Agony is more than cancelled out between the extra 5% on DS vs SM and the fact DS buffs after spell damage.  Siphon is a debatable use of a GCD.  It sucks to accept but most of affliction is just bad at buffing DOT damage.  DS/Ruin ends up being the better dotting spec.  SM/Ruin just has some nice QOL stuff like Grim Reach and utility from being able to use imp.
---
Yes, I slowly remembered most of my binds and have stayed consistent.  Kinda cool when I started to remember.
---
Well except you were theorycrafting back then. Now there is no theorycrafting because it’s solved.
---
Theorycrafting was part of the discovery that this comic laments.
---
Anyone lower level than me is a noob. Anyone higher level has no life.
---
What? I absolutely bought both a skill and a mount on my Rogue.
---
Reroll alliance for instant ques
---
I’ve sent it in on passive and wasn’t able to call it back before it started attacking the enemy.
---
Yeah, we should balance the game around a ridiculously small minority of players voluntarily doing something mind numbingly time consuming and boring.
---
And it will cost you 10g to remake one each time and cost me 30s to reload one.
---
Okay I’ll try it out, thank you!
---
I'm SM/DS specced for farming DM East at the moment and I'm loving AV. SM + Succ Sacc DS give my DoTs mega damage. So fun to just DoT up stragglers and watch them run off dead.
---
Bruh I’ve never used pet follow always call pet. I’ll have to try this.
---
This is an example of what I've been saying ever since Nostalrius got shut down and pro-vanilla people flooded every WoW discussion. Nothing is 0% nostalgia and nothing is 100% nostalgia. I'm pissed equally at the crowd saying "Classic is just pure nostalgia and rose-tinted glasses" as well as pissed at the people claiming that "there's no nostalgia, just look at private servers".  
---
Nostalgia is a factor for everyone of us in everything we do (unless we do it for the first time). For some people Classic is 90% nostalgia and the game cannot run on nostalgia. For others it's just 10% nostalgia and they enjoy it. For some 50% nostalgia is enough to bring them to the game and keep them there. For others 50% nostalgia is just too little reason to keep playing the game. For some this amount of nostalgia isn't even worth comming back. And some people are aware of their nostalgia and are able to look past it.  
---
The effect of nostalgia isn't the same for everyone so there are not general statements that can describe it or deny it. Only subjective experiences. It's really great when someone says that he and all his friends came back to WoW and keep playing it when there are also as many statements that the game has let the people down.
---
Yes that only applies to what *I* said. Not what *you* said of course.
---
Wow Classic is my first time ever playing the game. I absolutely love it and find all aspects to be fun and interesting. Joining a PvP server is a bit of a challenge but that’s how it should be. I’ve noticed so many aggressive players out there who just seem like they aren’t getting any enjoyment out of the game. It is just a habit or chore for some or seems. :(
---
Theorycrafting and research is different than min/maxing. 
---
Actually finding the information as a kid was hard. There weren’t central repositories and calculators. 
---
Don’t says Thottbot because it wasn’t even close. It was mostly just people saying “I think this dude is here or around here.”
---
Little stuff like this would bring a whole new meta to the game. All your paladins would be able to judge, you could use all the niche items that apply debuffs, etc.
---
I agree; more unsurprised at the effort
---
It's on a 1 min cooldown in Classic. Which is *amazing*. There's a reason any serious Alliance PvP player will go gnome if possible.
---
I'm on faerlina because my friends rolled there. I don't think I fall in to any of those categories.
---
Yeah they're never very far apart tbh, but peoples spreadsheets show the slight increase to crit doing more than the 4 or 5 more AP from Baron. TBH if I had Shrouded Mist on either faction I'd use it for the stam just in case
---
Especially since a perk of AV is a cheaper mount.
---
You need to get the DBM PvP addon
---
Thank you all SO MUCH for your advice!! Going through all of it. I think I just need to cut time out of my week to farm consistently and suck up the respec cost. I don’t think I’m good enough of an aoe grinder to pull off not going full aoe spec. Keep getting my face smashed.
---
if you have the pet on passive already and is attacking, you need to use the pet follow button instead.
---
I don't tell anyone how to enjoy their game time. If you prefer a zerg, then you need to evaluate whether you could get a match after deserter buff before the one you're in would finish. 
---
Personally, Im fine with either version of AV.

I omitted mag since I already compared the numbers. A quick glance at the world best tanks from each respective class shows me without a doubt that warrior tps is going to blow druids out of the water.
---
Which was my entire point. It's not a great cloak for /anyone/. It only has a very minor upgrade for casters and healers, whereas dps do have access to better easily available cloaks. Completely locking out healers out of the cloak does not make sense, unless you are purely gearing for PVP with your raid.
---
or he could do it here too.
---
No, they were chastised as well...
---
This is the kind of person that has to interpret everything he reads literally and then criticize whatever they read based on that literal interpretation.
---
Don't be like this, folks.
---
This is exactly what I was looking for, I want to grind out a level or two, chill and make some good while watching a podcast I’ve been saving.
---
I’ve been selling basic healing pots from the herbs there too for 20s a piece, I’m about to make baaaaank tonight!
---
Thanks!!
---
I think you're a little too sensitive dude. Maybe get a job? :P
---
You do now, guilty by association.
---
Named my only female dwarf character Mombod and no the wife isn’t aware of it.
---
Yes, games should generally be balanced around the competitive communities on the highest levels. Certainly not around random plebs just daddeling alone, barely paying attention.
---
&gt;"They have to reduce the honor" just for the sake of it
---
No, it's so that you're getting honor through actual pvp, and not zerging npcs.
---
Obviously that would be the ideal lol. Wish we all had guilds that were so generous!
---
He identified a problem and proposed a possible solution. That’s the exact definition of constructive criticism. If he’s “hard done” or not is irrelevant.
---
We can shift out of poly morph...It can be mana intensive to do so, but we can.  I've seen mages that act surprised when I do.
---
#1 speedrun in the world uses moonkin
---
where's your god now, atheists? checkmate arnold einstein
---
I feel on you this. Rolled a troll because I’ve never played horde, and even though I’m sticking with it and it’s fun to see things from the other side, I find myself missing playing alliance. It does just feel like there’s more depth and personality to the Alliance factions.
---
Hey, sometimes I need to refresh my corruption and life tap too.
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/activity Gives you a general idea, it's not 100% right but it gives you an idea of what some servers look like.
---
Exalted with Frostwolf Clan
---
Imagine being a dps in a guild and they let healers have this cloak.
---
We can....try it.
---
someone was catching nightfin this morning. if you can get the 33% rate then you can make 20-40 gph while getting rep.
---
But I wanna be tiny always. Also pink. A tiny pink kitty with pigtails

Stalagg represent
---
With most fights being as short as they are, Cds could potentially be a big deal. Nobody is all that concerned with trash so it would be up for nearly half of every fight in mc
---
I watched a speedrun vid a while ago and they had a boomkin because he was the only druid. Get gotw, brez and innervate without having to bring a resto druid. Probably would have been better to bring a feral tho
---
Yep, pet follow works. 
---
Goddamit I need to look at my bars before making reddit post. 
---
Thanks for the help!
---
At least you have your switch with you.
---
Did you make this post because you didn’t get the cloak or something? 
---
DPS has limited options in this early part of the game. Healers don’t. 
---
Deal with it and go get someone to craft the BOE for you.
---
Then you must have played late into Vanilla.
---
WoW killed mmos for me. Once I was down with retail during cata, I couldn't find anything else. Eventually stopped mmos entirely for 5 years before classic came out again.
---
Right now 1% crit is "worth" the same as about 30ap (depending on your gear of course)
---
This and to an extent Firemaw. I regularly check [here](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/overview?lastSeen=7&amp;minLevel=48) (last 7 days lvl. 48-60) to roll a comfy alliance alt . Playing horde on ZT atm.
---
No because I’m discussing the absurdity of those that *claim* to not care about the game. 
---
But then care enough to try to *brag* about their performance in the game on a fucking subreddit devoted to said game. 
---
There’s legitimately nothing remotely *casual* about the latter. If you’re a legit casual you aren’t even running meters ffs. The reality is that most Classic players aren’t remotely casual as this is their second or third MMO. You stop being casual at that point. 
---
Casual is the guy that subs for 3 months, plays 2 hours a week then moves on. Not people who post here.
---
You only need 1 spriest to have max shadow weaving stacks. More VEs in raid would be nice though.
---
Wait what?? There is rich thorium in the Av mines??
---
I get what you're saying, but the spirit won't be too far off. I'd imagine the alli will just start doing something similar to what the horde are doing right now, right? Rush Bal/Galv, then try to pick off towers/Van/Drek before the other.
---
Not a very big problem in raiding, but in pvp it's huge. Clicking isn't that problematic when you don't need to turn camera.
---
Thank you for the reply. 
---
Man did I vastly overshoot the XP needed. I knew of the time gate but suppose it threw me for a loop since I was out pacing it since I was level 10. Feel as if my hunter reached 20 before he got to loyalty 6. (And I did keep him fed with my unlimited supply of fish from the main.)
---
So maybe I will look into getting broken tooth. Though the tiger does look so much better, IMO, and shouldn't be too much worse with its 1.3 attack speed. I did camp around for quite a while looking for "the rake" but gave up.
---
Yuck.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/humblebrag/
---
Just like fifteen years ago!
---
It's not like people are doing AV because it's so fun to play, blame Blizzard for making the dumb PvE "Battleground" 3x as efficient as WSG for honor grinding.
---
Imagine getting this and then still NEEDING endless AV every week to not de-rank.
---
Real boomer shit here
---
I'm not downvoting you lmao. but looking at how much fury prot warriors in dps gear can do is absolutely meaningless since they won't be doing it for harder bosses.
---
Thats twice as long as literal wintraders got banned for
---
I'm okay with this. Don't get me wrong, a good rush is fine, but I don't drop when a game goes long. Time to do quests and goof off a bit. I'm on track to hit exalted on the weekend regardless, it's not as if AV rep is hard to get. A bit of variety is fun.
---
&gt; I drop dps when a big ball of mobs are clumped up together

Sinister Strike -&gt; Slice and Dice -&gt; Blade Flurry -&gt; Adrenaline Rush -&gt; Sinister Strike x5 -&gt; Eviscerate (while Blade Flurry is still up) -&gt; Sinister Strike -&gt; Slice and Dice
---
&gt; I have trouble right clicking the correct one.
---
If the tank in your group is marking targets, always start with the mob marked with a skull, then the one marked with an X. Also, create an assist macro that you can use when the tank isn't marking targets and put it on your hotbars. All you need in the macro is '/assist &lt;tank's name&gt;' (without the &lt;&gt;) and pressing the button will target the mob the tank is fighting. You'll have to edit the macro every time you're in a group with a different tank.
---
That's insane bro. I didn't even play Tuesday because I was too busy getting drunk. Can't wait to get this though and the lobotomizer because I still have blue daggers, but I have a mix of t1/t2 gear lol guild just hasn't downed rag yet.
---
Yeah WoW’s bosses definitely have a floor that people need to be at before they can even damage the bosses. 
---
Dark souls lets you run through with a broken short sword in your undies challenging every single boss the same way someone in full Havels would.
---
If you use Win10 use the Netflix app, not your browser.
---
Then you just click the miniplayer button and it will overlay over WoW.
---
I do this to watch Top Boy while I fish.
---
Fury on Fairbanks does this.
---
SKARMtank if you read this,  fuck you. World boss collusion, honor trading, and now afk kicking any rivals out of AV. I hope your channel dies.
---
You can express it. But realize it's just whining so people will lambaste you for it...
---
Apologies if this response feels long-winded. I'm trying to be as clear as possible. 
---
There are several problems with your calculations.
---
Primarily, each of these procs are unique dice rolls. This is not like stacking crit, where you increase your chance for a specific function. Each of these rolls have different effects. Think of it like rolling 3 dice with different "success" values, rather than rolling one for crit.
---
Secondly, and this is still very important, two of your rolls locked to different weapons. So they don't even apply to all your attacks.
---
Basically all this should just be taken at face value. Your thrash blade will proc 4% and your flurry axe will proc 5%, and then then 2% of all your attacks will proc HoJ. And unless there is a condition (this is important) in which those weapons extra hit procs cannot proc HoJ, you should see that 2% of your weapon procs will also proc HoJ. So 2% of 4% of your thrash blade swings will proc two extra hits, as your thrash blade procs an extra swing and the HoJ procs off that extra swing. This is not something that could happen if you were only rolling one die for a stackable value like crit.
---
Same! I am rank 6.8 and plan on doing AV in the most fun way I can till rank 8 (for my 4 piece bonus). I've found this is the most fun way to do BGs at the moment.
---
Yeah I'm currently rockin devilsaur. Done strat live countless times but lost all the rolls cause the mask is extremely popular among rogues and dps warriors as well. I was thinking of going for slaghide gauntlets and warstrife leggings once I have like 5% hit without devilsaur. (Obviously keep the devilsaur for my dps set, not that I'll ever use that, but hey)
---
Thanks for the advice anyway. It's always hard to figure out what's best. Though it probably doesn't necessarily matter. For some things I'm happy with "good enough" rather than "the best". (No way I'm gonna get the warden staff if the mace from dm north is only slightly worse and waaay easier to get)
---
Keybind pet attack to mouse wheel forward, and pet follow to mouse wheel backward and you will never have issues.
---
Agony is still only 16% of your single target in an ideal situation.  Buffing maybe 1/3 agonies if we assume a 1 minute fight by 30% will get crushed by the difference between DS and SM.
---
Multi target degrades the benefit of amplify in a similar way.
---
Nah I’m just quitting trying to get honor. I’ll wsg for fun. My dream of rank 12 and getting some epics died though. This coming from someone who was standing 16 last week.
---
You can't play like the Horde. Galv is bugged and doesn't even give Alliance honor. That's why Alliance stopped doing anything but rushing Drek.
---
Of course it's a bug that affects Alliance and not Horde so it'll take forever to fix. If Horde didn't get honor from Balinda, Blizzard would have taken down all realms asap.
---
Dear god no...
---
Imagine being a DPS in a guild and wanting this cloak over a Frozen/Shadow Wrath cloak.
---
&gt; It'S PuRpLe!!!1!
---
That's what pummelers are for. 50% attack speed making it 1.25 swing timer.
---
Zug zug
---
yeah i had this happen to me too once, no idea what causes it.
---
Is pretty ironic that the "ClassiCast" guys like StaySafe who were so adamant before launch that right click reporting would be abused and needed to be removed to protects players (like them)... are the ones that used it to grief other people on their own realm so they can grind Rank 14 faster.
---
At least spriests are mana batteries in tbc.
---
OSRS is honestly the best mmo out there tbh, interesting content updates while the old content is still viable.

Honestly no one will pay attention to what you are individually doing (except if you cap the Snowfall graveyard, then you will probably get flamed). Just follow the pack best you can, watch what other mages do and learn from your mistakes. AV is incredibly forgiving on the individual given the large number of participants, relatively low stakes, and simple mechanics.
---
Lol. God forbid people play their game the way they want to play it and not the way others want you to play right?
---
On NA servers maybe.
---
I have heard people claim that it is better than that though it seems about right to me.
---
Heartseeker alliance, yes. Scummy
---
The cloak is BiS (pvp) for healers. Not really sure if you're dumb or trolling
---
Serpent. Sting.
---
Projecting much? :P
---
I'm a student and probably have less time to play than you do, I'm only honored and have literally done nothing else than AV when I log in.
---
What has this to do with the fact that OP had a day of two of leisure time and decided to hit the BGs hard? It's not like he had to no life for months on end like during a high warlord grind, it's literally two days of playing efficiently, and yet you already are insulting him for not playing the way you are.
---
I thought this subreddit was all about experiencing vanilla wow the way you wanted.
---
I think his point is that everyone has better options than Sapphiron's Drape, so it makes no sense to reserve it to anyone on the erroneous belief that it is BiS for them, since it is not BiS for anyone.
---
This is like giving the mc spelldmg neck to healers when rammstein in strat ud drops a equal one for healers. Yes its ok for healers, its just way better for others...
---
You articulated your criticisms very well but what motivated you to keep playing your druid for 150 days? What did you enjoy about the class?
---
I’ll be able to raid end game content as soon as i hit max level, try doing that in retail.
---
From camping org 24/7 to mass quitting BGs, Zackthetank and friends are at it again!
---
Not true though - it doesn’t happen nearly as much in Classic as it did in Vanilla because everyone is doing AV in Classic. Vanilla AV queues took hours to even get into a game, Classic currently has instant AV queues.
---
You'll see a big jump in flask/elixir demand as soon as BWL releases because guilds will have new content to run and learn.  Right now the market had evened out since many guilds don't need many consumables to keep farming MC/Ony
---
How is it at 93% votes then? You'd think it'd controversial then with those groups voting the opposite way.
---
200 AP from diremaul unfortunately is melee only. Rip.
---
Putting them roughly on par with warriors. Then you're still missing out on the bloodthirst threat.
---
So then why didnt you lead with that? I am looking for his thumb, not Thumbnail.
---
Thanks for input. Would you guys forego the might 5 set bonus to wear Lionheart Helm as Prot Tank, or stick w helm of might?
---
“Paper” dps is literally just your average damage with a swing, which is not a metric at all for **actual** dps.
---
You shouldn’t ever even be looking at that number.
---
It's crazy how much I forgot about add-ons when I stopped playing Legion, because half of these are the same I feel. Guessing there's no distinction between vanilla and retail add ons? Thanks for the response :)
---
With Rhok you should be running a clipped rotation due it’s speed. You would really only wait on an auto shot if it’s just about to cast in like .2 seconds. 
---
What’s your spec? Are you hit capped? Hunters are usually top dps for Ony due to our ability to drop agro.
---
Slightly embarrassed that I thought those were speech bubbles....
---
The 200ap does not apply to ranged sadly.
---
Yeah I stopped playing after release because of work but the past week I have started again on a new server and it is such a blast. I haven't been "addicted" to WoW since wrath and I finally have that feeling again and can happily spend my evenings grinding. Life is good, but this subreddit makes it seem like Classic is a dying heap of trash. It's amazing.
---
Sounds a lot like world quests
---
Part of me wishes we woulda got a "dad has left raid group" after
---
You can stack mongoose and greater agility elixirs.  You run a clipped rotation with Rhok. (Aimed on CD)
---
Not being sarcastic at all. I just genuinely dont know why people get all bent out of shape when people need expensive boes in dungeons but somehow it's okay in alterac valley.
---
DM buff is melee AP only.
---
I like how you ignored the "its more fun" part.
---
Alliance pugs are eternally fucked. They have been ganked for a month and now they are suffering through a mindless rush to drek for 1k honor while competing against AV/WSG premades of their own faction which completely devalue their effort.
---
I see horde pugs regularly win AV by wiping ally at drek once which earns them 3,8k, better rep and is actually fun...
---
The only people that dislike this horde side are rankers that cant stomach the occasional turtlefest.
---
Warriors pop deathwish/recklessness and duelwiled because they are heavily overgeared for MC. People walking into MC in blues/greens were not deathwish duelwield tanking lol. Like I said we can easily see if you're right when bwl comes out.
---
Yeah nice suggestion, im sure Blizz never thought of that
---
The way I see it, if it's an even number of people doing it (say 2 on each side) then it doesn't matter
---
Where are the downvotes from the people complaining about afking then? This thread is almost exclusively upvoted.
---
Great explanation to the casual player
---
Sure, if that's what you're primarily seeking. I do enjoy the good battle once in a while though so it wasn't a waste of time for me. Fun is never a waste of time imo
---
rrreeeee
---
do you know how much honor was gained in this ?
---
Jeez relax.. You sound really bent out of shape. Maybe try exercising for once, or getting a job? Maybe talk to the opposite sex for once in your life, all they can say is no after all! ;) :P :D
---
bear is 145% and maul is 175%. Is the maul TPS already factoring in bear or does that give maul approx 250% TPS?
---
Seriously though, for tanking non-raid content I think druids are vastly superior over warrior tanks.
---
Players too dumb so they need to be hand holded by Blizzard.
---
that neck took me forever to farm...it almost never drops. the mc one is technically better BUT it ain’t a healer item when there’s casters in the group that still don’t have it
---
He is clearly not even 20 yet
---
Last I was playing alliance on Incendious with a couple people but I wasn't too big on that server and made it to about 50. I was on horde when all this happened but I ditched my old guilds server for a few reasons. We were a few weeks into MC/Ony farm already too wasn't an easy decision since I had a little gear lol. 
---
But thanks for the kind words I do appreciate it. Lately been hard to find the energy to wanna delve back into it like I was before. I put my heart into it and lost it all to people I thought cared about me. I hope maybe Classic will turn around for me at some point and I'll wanna play again but idk.
---
I just follow whatever our lord and savior shadowpanther lists. I keep a lot of the items in my bank though that way if I notice a decrease in my dps, I can revert back to what I was wearing before.
---
No, I am just explaining how most guilds on Gehennas deals with pvp gear. Especially the guilds with mage guildmasters.
---
Crushed is a pretty strong word considering the difference is 5% shadow damage between specs which would be further reduced by Nightfall and imp agony
---
Same except for AH. I try to time my auctions when I know the server will be busy. If I’m playing late and using an 8 hour auction window I dont get as many sales.   24hr auctions are pricier too so I don’t tend to use them.
---
I have always mained a bear druid.
---
Hello , does anyone know when the BG Weekends start ?
---
Nope. Still wrong my guy. It's the cooldowns. Bears lack cooldowns.
---
Pve rushing is boring, if im in a bg im there to kill players not npcs.
---
There definitely was.  The biggest drop I saw in AV was a Destiny I believe
---
Honestly, you might as well just stay combat pve, the one advantage combat spec has over sub specs is that a combat rogue can be a force to reckon with if they have a pocket healer backing them. Other than these scenarios sub is better in almost every regard for pvp.
---
They are separate.
---
How do I fix this???
---
oh yeah no doubt; tbc spriest is probably my favorite version of the spec.  there were multiple in world first kills back in the day and are extremely valuable to any raid even though they are probably the worst spec in the game from a pure dps provided standpoint.  that's why i love the unique spec utility design model of tbc
---
It doesn't; the associated int stat will give 1% crit per 60 int. Either the person you're replying to is cutting corners on their explanation, or doesn't know what they're talking about.
---
Hypothetically, in a boss fight with no special mechanics, the perfect zerg gearing ensures you have just enough mana (i.e. int + mana consumables) to go OOM just as the boss dies. The more the entire raid devotes their itemization to the business of killing, the less everyone has to worry about sustain.
---
Find a tank and dps in your guild/server with the same problem and do DM East jumpruns as healer. Way better gold than respeccing and solofarming.
---
You're being very presumptuous to speak for the entire player base
---
I was curious, that makes a lot of sense.
---
There are no guilds on alliance hs that I know of that have a reputation except maybe 1 for their raids. Really feels like most guilds are indifferent towards each other.
---
Maybe I'm just not seeing server drama though
---
https://media.tenor.com/images/0a65659ef48116bf9a3c74e4be96e475/tenor.gif
---
What was it like?
---
Top end dmg on Vis’Kag is still higher
---
It's decent farming down there. But when we had multiple layers it was a damn gold mine, especially in the am could get 9 rich thorium nodes in a half an hour. Paid for my epic mount, strong holds, and lion heart.  And i have 20 bars in the bank just in case i decide to go titanics when they come out
---
To reach rank 14 you have to be your factions top 0.1% 12 weeks in a row.
---
Each week skipped means at the very least a week of more and that is assuming that nobody ever overtakes you.
---
You dont need exalted to buy it.
---
HWLs had a premade and multiple pocket healers behind them.
---
to be fair, this is in classic also. People are shouting #nochanges from the top of their lungs, yet they use questie and other addons that make it similar to retail.
---
If that's still the case then it has nothing to do with clipping autos, it's because they're weaving.
---
I would argue that demand goes up as difficulty goes up. If you are struggling to clear MC, it makes sense to pop consumables to clear the content. Consumables, when not overly expensive, make up for the lack of gear/stats you have. When BWL releases, everybody will be with a lot of Tier 1 and might want an extra boost to get Nef down first week. Consumables will fill the gap in their (now) non-overpowered gear. 
---
If I was a betting man, Lotuses and flasks are going up. Dreamfoil is going up. Purple Lotus going way up. Mana potion, Mongoose, spellpower, all up.
---
This was indeed my point. It is such a minor upgrade for anyone, and not BiS for healers OR DPS.
---
Yeah, this is kind of why I didn't get the "I can't wait to play classic for the exploration". Especially from the people that've played retail. There's just, like, nothing there. Bunch of empty copy-paste structures/caves.
---
We created a system where people donated the mats for minimal dkp so we could gear our healers. Also you could auction off ony bag for gold to buy it for your healers
---
If you're gonna go this deep into combat, you might as well make it mace spec and meme it up.
---
5% and the fact DS applies as a buff so it buffs damage after spell damage.  SM only applies to base damage.  That is the whole reason DS/Ruin exists.  It scales way better.
---
The top panel is me when I play ff14. Bottom panel is wow. Gw2 is living story only.
---
Horde were back to camping BRM again on Stalagg yesterday
---
Do they have a chance to break in Classic?
---
Who cares, he had fun which is much more important than rep or honor
---
Thanks for the info. Never played vanilla and alchemy has been a big source of my gold thus far. Gotta keep the train moving!
---
Ret
---
This is the only correct way to do it.
---
I just did the exalted grind. I've farmed it a lot. I promise you, you are worrying too much. It's the perfect bg for someone progressing to battlegrounds. You are effectively racing to kill certain enemies to gain honor, then kill the enemies leader to win (alliance typically has an easier time reaching the leader, so horde tries to make their time more efficient, rather than winning). There are turbo nerds in there who want to tell you what to do. Just ask them to mark someone they should be following. What's honestly more important is learning how to gear for pvp. Pretty much for pve the stats are
---
PvE: hit &gt; spell power &gt; crit &gt; int &gt; spirit &gt; stam
---
PvP: stam &gt; int &gt; hit (3%) &gt; crit &gt; spell power &gt; spirit
---
Being in PvP spec also helps a lot, here is the basic deep frost spec (which I've made a little bit tankier for you). 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/20500520102--25053230112051301
---
Let me know if you have any questions.
---
Its people like you that make the Drek zergs fail lol. If people listened in battlegrounds and did just rush Drek you'd win 90% of the time, or even lose with a lot of honor. 
---
The normal path for alliance should be Galv &gt; Lts &gt; RH &gt; WM &gt; Drek. You still clear the zone in about 10 minutes, you get \~3000 honor and you're in and out. 
---
The problem is people like you and that's why those strategies DONT work in 100% pugs. People like you think the rush strategies dont work but they DO. The group just need YOU to help. 
---
As far as you getting more honor defending... You probably get about 3-5k a game sitting back defending for 30 minutes. Well if you do the zerg strat and get 3k honor per 10 minute game, you get 9k honor in 30 minutes. People become worth less and less honor as you're killing them over and over again and after about 30 minutes you start seeing +0 honor.
---
To be fair there's a shit load of Herod players so we're bound to have the most shitbags
---
I think a feral crit would make more sense but I guess. Also you really only need 8 heals
---
Dude is that your normal accent?
---
Isn't singing with an accent one of the hardest things to do as a voice actor?
---
Regardless, super impressive!
---
Same. But if I'm reading this right, you, like me, are currently playing classic wow right?
---
Who said anything about being bored?
---
what SHOULD i be looking at?  is there an external resource somewhere i can access?
---
What?.... you know they do in naxx but you doubt they will in bwl?.... what?!?
---
People rush for seek to get the kill first. If you stay around pvping and horde get Balinda first then galv is useless
---
I been feeding and spending time with it for 2 weeks it still hasn't went up in loyalty so apparently I'm missing something
---
Yeah I could see the extra staff damage + omen being good for lvling
---
Were people just slaughtering each other or was it just really tense?
---
We POOPED in our SOCKS and DRANK from a GARDEN HOSE and SEATBELTS were COMMMUNIST and we ALL smoke CIGARETTES without FILTERS because the RUSSIANS were LIVING in the WALLS of our HOMES
---
They are extremely different situations.
---
/bg
---
I got to level 25, so exactly what I did when I was 12.
---
27 now, guess its a character flaw lol
---
well it's friday for starters and second I think that's going to be implemented with arathi basin in phase 4?
---
Imagine wanting stats as well.
---
Just get Hide of the Wild, dude. It's not that hard.
---
Accorsing to 1 min googling a 132 read error is updating your Nvidia drivers.
---
He is right; this subreddit pretends they play and people are you are one of them
---
I went 30/21/0, I heal raids fine since holy shock is useless imo, just make sure to grab improved righteous fury in prot. Between improved RF, blessing of sanc, and consecration tanking 5 mans is pretty easy, just get yourself a tanking set. I don't really even use real tanking gear, as of right now I'm just using 1/8 T2 and 5/8 T1 with 2 other random plate pieces to fill those slots. You don't get any defense or anything like that but you get great raw stats and high armor.
---
No, i don't.
---
This is good build overall. I have 0 in winter chill but imp CoC and 2/2 on CoC radius as I do DM:e lashers and satyrs farm. We have 1 mage with winter's chill so we set for raid. It's like you said good for everything, not great tho. I do respec for raids often when I have farmed enough money.
---
&gt; I also think people overestimate the difficulty of BWL even for casual guilds and everyone will farm BWL in 2-3 weeks.
---
While the rest of you said is bang on IMO, I would argue that the average PUG is worse than you are giving them credit for.
---
haha i still play like that top one
---
Big if true. Can someone else confirm? I've always understood that they don't stack.
---
Hypothetically, in a boss fight with no special mechanics, the perfect zerg gearing ensures you have just enough mana (i.e. int + mana consumables) to go OOM just as the boss dies. The more the entire raid devotes their itemization to the business of killing, the less everyone has to worry about sustain. Step 1 is surviving, so boss mechanics and gear level will complicate that choice, but once you're on farm status (and in patch 1.12, MC in pre-bis essentially starts on farm status), the goal is to pound it home until you both finish together. If you can't do that with max rank spellcasts, rather than increase your mana regen, you can increase your mana efficiency with the combination of spellpower and downranking your spells to increase damage per mana ratios (downranking incurs extra penalties for spells below level 20, so most mana efficient is usually the lowest rank at or above level 20, and from there ranking up increases DPS at a cost of DPM. So basically figure out how fast bosses are dying, eg. 1 minute 30 seconds, then figure out which spell rank you can spam for that long (while going ham for kill phases, etc.).
---
Limits of physical exhaustion. God i love that quest line
---
What is ESL?
---
It's actually disgusting. Like 50% of games no one caps frostwolf gy or defends it they just rush straight into drek, get wiped and then sit around until horde wins.
---
Touche, I only played on NA servers.
---
Both.
---
&gt;They aren't competing against anyone for rank as they'll never make it to merely a complete blue set.
---
Who's they?
---
&gt; this subreddit pretends they play and people are you are one of them
---
Say what now..?
---
There is no point in arguing with someone who makes up situations that don't actually exist.
---
doesn't change the fact that every fury prot will liberally use Death Wish at the beginning of each pull without issue
---
It's almost like they have different gear by the time they are in naxx.
---
^ this
---
Although druids have tons of good support/healing CDs they don't have any mitigation/survival CDs that're useable in bear form.
---
There are various fights that bears just can't handle, whether due to lack of CDs or due to unique gimmicks (most notably, nefarian's druid class call is instant death for a main tank while warrior's is just dangerous)
---
End result is that Druids aren't suited for being the core, main tank of a raid group but're *the* best to have as off-tanks that take the first add to be killed &amp; use them as the main tank only for DPS-check fights like vael/patchwerk/etc
---
The fact that they bring amazing raid utility, increase the DPS of other melees, and don't compete for loot with your warriors and rogues is all further icing on the cake that solidifies them as great off-tanks.
---
There are pvp experiences that you can only get in AV. I get that you like to spam WSG premades and rarely have any challenging pvp, but I like to put myself in positions where I have unique battles I can't get anywhere else.
---
I've had some damn fun AVs.
---
Not everyone cares about getting AV items that increase your dps by 1.2% so you can clear MC 3 minutes faster
---
Same. Even in retail I would play this way basically until I would attempt to be in a Mythic raiding guild and then I would do this for just the raiding portion. 
---
I've been playing ArcheAge:Unchained recently and it's pretty refreshing because the wiki has like, NO information for people, so people are asking in chat how to do things and I'm discovering new shit on my own every day.
---
Yeah was just about to say???
---
&gt; Keeping SnD up as close to 100% as possible is very beneficial to your overall damage output.
---
This cannot be stated enough. Most of our damage as a sword rogue comes from autoattacks, so we don't want Slice and Dice to fall off at any point during a fight. I recommend using an add-on to monitor Slice and Dice duration so that you can easily tell when it needs to be refreshed. I use WeakAuras myself.
---
What crack are you smoking? Every horde win is minimum 4K honor. We literally cap everything. And on the chance we wipe alliance at drek or they are dumb and wipe themselves. We also get the win
---
That was good stuff. I'm partial to this one, as well:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgvYbl4OzEI
---
The authentic WoW melee combat experience.
---
It's called TBC. Can't wait.
---
Yes but the real continious grind comes when you reach rank 11+ because then the decay becomes sizeable enough that a week lost is similar to two weeks extra. Increasing with more ranks. This is because you start to decay enough that you lose several thousand rank points per week. On the current max you lose 6-8k rank points per week. If you continiously ranked top (13k points) you will lose 1 week for every week of ban. This is because you can earn 5-7k ranl points per week after decay. 
---
Now if you were rank 12+ you'd lose 10k rank points per week which will take 4 weeks of constant 13k rank point gain to get back to where you were. This is however not possible as of now because the time that honor existed.
---
It’s harder, and you might need a mana pot but you can do it for sure. Hopefully you get some gear out of the lower level ones to make for an easier transition into hitting scholomance or the other level 60 ones but since you’re elemental your gear should be strong enough unless you got pretty unlucky on the way up.
---
Isnt it just a visual bug on the Map?
---
Sad times. The MMO magic is gone.
---
Um lmfao healers can make a way better back piece from crafting.
---
People are stockpiling/hoarding now while prices appear reasonable. 
---
What happens when BWL releases is anyone’s guess. 
---
No one has played non-pserver non-retail BWL in 13 years so not sure what to expect.
---
&gt; good to see dad out here grinding
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
im goin for 13,
---
but i can play from my office PC so...... ya
---
I got about 13-15 hours a day if i really want
---
Also i lot of people are getting the system consfused with pre 1.8 amounts
---
after 1.8 they opened up a larger percentage for 11-12-13-14,
---
12 shouldnt be too insane if you have 4-5 hours a day
---
As a rogue, I quite enjoy this meta. Warriors in leather, shamans and druids in cloth. It's quite lovely.
---
Firemaw is quite balanced
---
Okay but why do you play on a PvP server if you want it to be or are glad when its like a PvE server?
---
Yah was thinking I'd have heard about this sooner
---
I am hitcapped. With BG's out I'm running a 0/31/20 build but the only damage talent I lost is the aspect of the hawk buff and the pet damage talents so I should not see a huge damage dropoff. I had this issue even prior to respeccing for PvP.
---
Nightfin Snapper (only at night), sunscale salmon (during the day), whitescale salmon (AQ war effort turn-in), lightning eel (argent dawn turn-in for scourge invasion), plated armorfish (argent dawn turn-in for scourge invasion), redgill
---
im in the same boat
---
we are playing a clever little emulation of "Vanilla" at this point, 
---
changes happened the second they decided on layering and server population caps..
---
1.5 AV would be awesome in my opinion, in others not so much though i guess
---
It depends on your class as well though
---
Shaman and paladin get different benefits from +heal and +spirit as other classes.  Paladin especially just spam Flash for max efficiency and +heal has a very small impact on Flash- so they are much more into int, mana/5, and spell crit even instead of just raw +heal, though ofc they will get plenty of +heal as they progress into MC. 
---
Shaman don't get any spirit regen while casting, so spirit is not as useful for them either and they prefer mana/5 or int.  Shaman often cast either chain heal or downranked healing wave, both of which benefit pretty well from +heal. 
---
Druids basically spam healing touch which benefits a TON from +heal.  And they get spirit mana regen, so they tend to like gear that has both spi and +heal. 
---
Think of it this way.  10 int is 150 mana.  10 spirit is about 5 mana/5 when not casting.  Approximately, this is 1 mana/5 while casting. 
---
So in a two minute fight (lots of boss fights go almost 2 minutes or so during progression) you will get about 30 mana from 10 spirit (passive regen while casting) or closer to 150 or more if you get a few 5 second rule mana ticks (which most healers will be able to do).  Spirit tends to pull ahead of int for mana classes, and it also reduces the need to drink during trash pulls and lets the raid move a little quicker. 
---
You will get a little bit of everything as you progress as well, so bear that in mind.  Most epic heal gear has 3 or 4 of the stat types that you want, instead of having to pick and choose when you are doing preraid gearing and you very rarely if ever will get all stats you want on one piece.
---
Money helps them get over being wrong real fast.
---
Hahahha implying anyone does 500 consistent dps in this phase besides the top 0.1% elite players
---
Yo, that go left strat three me for a loop! Whole side of the map I’ve never seen before. Like a whole new game
---
Eh. I'll never get R14, and I'll never drink a Flask of the Titans, but it's still perfectly possible to complete every all the content in the game, just at a slower pace than the people who are able to farm their way to Honor gear or monopolize black lotuses.
---
Each faction on my realm organizes WB tags and loot as a collective effort between its major guilds. I'm surprised that this isn't standard on all the larger realms. Feel like the first faction to form a cartel like this would dominate the other until they did the same.
---
I don't understand what this is supposed to show - your raid dps is about in the range of what a decent PUG will do - quite manageable with deep prot builds, and that isn't exactly the highest threat warrior tank build.
---
The tanking itself is simpler than warrior tanking,  but what warriors don't have is the huge amount of utility with bres, innervate, heals,  etc. So a druid tank,  in some cases,  can save an entire group from a wipe if they use their whole kit
---
And bis for many healers in pvp aswell
---
&gt; WSG takes a while to pop
---
Does it for allies? It's 15+ queue horde side so it should be instapops for ally.
---
Yes I know
---
YYYY-MM-DD or gtfo
---
christ this subreddit is smug.  yeah, i had fun stumbling through the game with a sense of wonderment when i was 15, but i'm also having fun now.  
---
getting lost in a dungeon for hours that doesn't drop anything i need was fun back then.  it isn't now.  i don't have all the time in the world to waste now.  i like leveling efficiently, i like figuring out what MC drops i should prioritize.
---
i buy into the meta, but i don't joylessly adhere to it.  i'm having fun.
---
TY for the reply, but that's not what I'm looking for. For party frames I have the deficit in health showing on the side and I like seeing that especially if I'm in WSG grouped with the flag carrier and what not. I can also see more debuffs/bigger debuffs then if it is in the little raid window. It's just annoying me because I was able to have both party frames and raid frames in vanilla, and can't figure it out in classic.
---
I felt the same way.. I started playing D&amp;D 5e about 2 years ago and it's completely changed the way I view games. I get that feeling I used to when playing a MMO.. still playing with others.. but it's also more real. But also, when I go back and play a MMO I get more involved with it and it doesn't feel like just a grindfest. It's made me love my characters again.
---
640G???
---
but then you no longer need winter's chill
---
Oh god thank you, these fucking people. Classic is an objectively better game and can continue it's playerbase with small changes. People reee'ing about how Blizzard was right knowing damn well they weren't expecting classic to be as massively popular as it is. Blizzard doesn't know shit.
---
This aspect diminishes at level 60 meta, but is still there.  If you find a quiet spot to farm something valuable you can go on for days with no breaks.  Rotating your innervate cooldown, using heal mana efficiently (healing touch whenever possible between fights) and not going too crazy will pulling will get you in great shape.
---
it takes one to find one?
---
Yes, you should be doing research to understand your class better if you're trying to optimize your dps.
---
Leaving for a world boss is perfectly reasonable
---
Just tried this no luck it’s still not working :( but thank you anyway!
---
It's really not though, your potential experience doesn't translate to 300 other av's going on at the same time
---
Again, that identifies that the reporter was WRONG not that the reporter was abusing the system. Bans should be saved for deterministic rule violations, we don't need World of Warcraft: Police State
---
our server ran on what might be called a PUG premade back in vanilla
---
But.... after the first day we grouped (And did really well) we are friendlisted up and began running regularly)
---
this normalized the way we did it for our server i guess, as the top3-4 guilds on our faction all began rotating in and out of that team to get ranks
---
as not every guild had 10+ pvpers during that time, but the ones who did have 2-3 ended up teaming up with other guilds pvpers 
---
Was pretty cool
---
They have a cloak twice as good from crafting dps do bot have this option. Healers getting DPS items is dumb next you will be giving paladins priority on mageblade b.c yolo.
---
Bwl gear basically just gives more plate dps options which makes the build that much stronger. Idk what experience you had with bwl back in the day but my guilds gear blows my vanilla guilds gear out of the water and were only like 22 mc clears deep. We have access to a loot table that wasnt available until the bwl release as well as split raids with alts filling spots to help funnel gear to main raiders. Not sure why you’d think Mc gear is shit compared to bwl, in a lot of cases it’s entirely comparable. In others it’s a raid tier step up in gear quality.
---
Hi,
---
if you google "hunter damage cycles breakdown", you will find a very important post about the ideal rotation. I see you are using it already, however the damage difference betweek rhok and these crossbows is not huge, mainly due to its quite fast speed..
---
Some advice I can give is: when a mob comes in melee range for you, hit it with a raptor strike! You might get another 1k damage if you get a crit.
---
If you want, get the 10 agility food buff (grilled squid).
---
Use your cooldowns on cooldown! Use rapid fire (and berserking if troll) on trash mobs!
---
Mind your pet, take it back when on low health so it does not die. 
---
Good luck!
---
Not sure what server you’re on with it’s watered down economy, but the high end “of x wrath” items on my server are NOT only worth 30g (significantly more) and sell near instantly. They also have a range of how much spell power they can offer, unlike the archivist.
---
Crit is on average a 1% increase to your damage as 1% of the time you do double damage.  This means the more attack power you already have the more valuable each crit% is.  So it's a sliding scale.  I do find however for pvp crit is more valuable as each individual fight matters not the overtime dps.  Therefore a single crit in a fight is much more valuable.
---
and yet during P2 you couldn't get into BRM without deathwalking as horde at least a few days a week, could never get to DM without running into a gank squad of alliance, kargath path to raids was a deathtrap.  It doesn't take a lot of alliance if they are coordinated
---
The circle of wow life
---
Yea I'm Skeram Alli and I gotta be honest I get some schadenfreude from this.
---
I start respec every week when my guild decided to be serious and clear mc in one night. Use aoe build on ony as double shield can be beneficial and you don't have to be top dps on her
---
My guild cared about debuff slots the first couple months, but it's so easy now they're letting us be arms or whatever until BWL
---
Lmao how can one man be so misinformed
---
Galv gives no honor or rep if you kill him after horde kills Balinda
---
I mean no, technically dec is mostly fall.  Irrelevant to catching winter squid of course but still.
---
Probably depends on the server. I played on EU magtheridon. The best server in the world and we raced to get aq open first. At the opening when kungen from nihilum was gonna open it people didn't fight but there were just too many people there so it lagged haaard so you really couldn't
---
English as a Second Language
---
That's about a 5.7% chance of happening, for what it's worth (4 100 rolls in a 40 man group)
---
[This](https://www.malediction.net/mobile/forum/viewthread/m/52136443/id/32850072-debuff-prioritization-optimal-debuffs-for-raids) is the best list i could find. From what i hear and read, improved shadowbolt is a medium tier debuff (like shadow weaving and winter's chill) and is susceptible to getting knocked off, just like winter's chill is. However, it shouldn't be getting knocked off by low/trash tier debuffs (bleeds, pure dots, poisons, weapon procs). Make sure your warlocks are not using shadowburn mid fight (shadowburn consumes imp shadowbolt while not contributing to it, leave a medium(?) tier debuff and lowers overall raid dps), and arms warriors should preferably not be using mortal strike (useless medium tier debuff). Take this all with a grain of salt because i'm quite sure there is no 'official' list on debuff tiers.
---
25/26/0 works really well also.  You can tank dungeons when needed, whip out a 2h for reckoning in pvp, still have imp wis and heal just fine.  My wife's running this and is our top healer on every fight.  You won't have imp might like the pure pve raid spec, but you'll have imp wis, bosanc, and kings...someone else shoudl be able to bring might.
---
That's so awesome! Thanks for sharing, I look forward to reading more of this!
---
I can tell you that mongoose ate my agility scroll when I tried it.
---
Damn I need to show this to my husband. I wanna play the first way but we play together and he's the second type. Makes it lame :( 
---
Me: Ooh what's that grave do?! 
---
Him: Leave it alone it'll spawn a huge creature that will kill you. 
---
Me: Ooh I can sell this for good money!
---
Him: no you need to disenchantment it and make our team good equipment later, I'll just give you money.
---
Me: Ooh I can finish this quest real quick
---
Him: No abandon it. It's useless now 
---
Meh... I wanna get killed having fun
---
I like it cause you can cause a lot of damage with a 5 man - make those games last an hour!
---
The moonkins job is to keep FF up on everything at all times, decurse and innervate.  Reason they don't use a resto druid is because HOTs aren't allowed due to the buff cap and 3% crit is more helpful than a Healing Touch spam bot
---
Not wrong I just don’t know why my server gettin all this hate were nice people :(
---
I would argue Thick Hide is required for good Bear play.  As druids have no parry or block,  our only real motivation comes from armor and a bit of dodge,  this maxing out our armor is of upmost importance.
---
Good tip on the wolf, I have a level 25 wolf from SFK with the faster attack speed that I was going to level but I may just skip that and grab a wolf from LBRS. 
---
I use an attack timer.
---
Could you post a talent tree please?
---
I'm alliance so the troll stuff does not apply, I'm missing the shoulder and leg enchants but I have everything else.
---
When you say cooldowns, I presume you mean rapid fire? I am not using it for trash but will consider where it is possible to do so.\]
---
Again, alliance so the shaman buffs do not apply. I don't think they're using any buffs that I'm not, except one try-hard who brings squid.
---
Absolutely not. The asmongold post being front page on launch proved this sub is far from that. It's more "play the game exactly as I want you to"
---
The prices will likely go up to some extend. We dont know how much is hoarded right now. I believe the current main driver is just people stockpiling potions and materials. 
---
I can tell you that with P5 prices should make quite a jump. At least some time into P5.
---
That's BS... I'm not hardened or made better by staying on pvp server, because the few horde encounters I survived (or didn't xD) on my &lt;40 alt made no difference... I raided through the phase 2, I got a few more pre-bis items on my main and yes I spent a lot of time ingame throughout the phase 2... still I did never feel like quitting or worse realm transfering, because of some fighting.
---
That being said, I get why exping 48-60 was a pain in the butt... and I also must say that maybe my server is not that imbalanced - I have no hard or reliable data on that  but a lot of people cried in the chat all day long, so who knows.
---
I don't think it's people being triggered, I think you're just coming off as an ass.
---
I mortal strike everything except rag.
---
As healers we heal less, have less types of heals, hots are not that good. We do bring strong utility, faerie fire, combat ress, innervate, capabilities of offtanking should need arise.
---
As ranged DPS I'd say both are sort of close.
---
As melee DPS we beat out shamans.
---
As tanks we beat out shamans.
---
I'm going to sound like a crazy person for a second but fuck using a blizzard spec for zf aoe gold farm. Seriously. I tried that for a while and just kept dying and dying because, between mobs resisting nova, mobs for some reason not getting hit/slowed by blizzard ticks (or running 90% of the way through the area before getting slowed), and blizzard getting cancelled through ice barrier, its just nowhere near consistent enough to be 100% reliable. Which is what you need if you're trying to grind for a couple hours. If you're dying more than 'rarely', you might as well just do dungeons because you're not getting anywhere near that sweet 60+ g/hr that you are looking for.
---
Changed my mindset and now I farm it easy in a deep frost build with key talents permafrost, arctic reach, shatter, block, barrier and then ignite/imp flamestrike/master of elements from the fire tree. 
---
Ice barrier, pull a side of graves, iceblock to group them, break your block, nova, step out of melee range, flamestrike -&gt; CoC to double dip the shatter (master of elements refunds 30% mana on crits). Then you BACKPEDAL A BIT to cancel out the melee leeway mechanic bullshit while spamming a couple arcane explosions, you wrap around the pack outside melee range while they are super slowed from CoC (still hitting them with an arcane explosion or two) to bunch them up just in time for CoC to be back up, slow them again, wrap around again, nova will be back up now, flamestrike -&gt; coc again for the massive crit. At this point they are usually dead or almost dead for me in mostly pre-bis gear (I bought a cloak and ring of the eagle off the ah for a bit of extra hp and mana). Couple more arcane explosions to finish off the last couple stragglers. Eat a mana ruby if you get too low. 
---
If one resists your nova, you've generally still got your ice barrier on (because you are barely getting hit ever if you do this right) and, since you are supposed to stay fairly close to them anyway, you can still tank 2 or 3 hits with your barrier to keep the straggler in the flamestrike/coc area.
---
The one downside is this build is not exactly optimal for raiding or or pvp so it makes your mage a farming-only character. It's strong in a 5 man if oyu have a very geared and skilled tank (because you are going to explode packs with aoe damage).
---
It´s like seeing a mage jump from a height and slow fall himself (because he doesnt know that he can blink before touching the ground and not get fall damage :D)
---
Wow, thanks! I'll pay you 1 silver that you can shove firmly up yr ass. Never had to wait an hour fr a group. Thats ridiculous. If it takes you an hour to find a group theres probably a very good reason for that
---
ive played over 100 AVs and ~98/100 we've done just that
---
Your pet does like 30% of your damage. This is where you are losing DPS, those survival talents add LITERALLY NOTHING to your DPS (except maybe the 3% hit arguably if you DO need the hit rating)
---
PvE Raid spec is 20/31/0 if you have 9% hit
---
Usually 2/31/18 if you don't
---
You would be better using a wolf with furious howl so you can also buff your melee DPS like rogues and warrriors as well as yourself
---
A priest buddy and I just used lesser invis pots and the window jump to skip all the trash. We’d kill the fire mobs for drops and do arena as well to avoid lockout.
---
You will probably have some overlap for a period but eventually yes, all mages will be fire
---
Read your mailbox, i sent you a message.
---
You pop the mongoose first then grater agi. Thank me later. :)
---
The scoreboard shows they get more honor, sure, but they're getting way less rep
---
&gt; Dps casters don’t have a better option than this you guys don’t have any idea what ur talking about lmao
---
Yes they do, they're even mentioned in the link OP provided.
---
&gt; it’s the only cape with a good amount of stam
---
What's your stat weight for Stamina, as a DPS caster in PvE?! Because mine is 0.
---
Complete the quest but no hand in. Sell repair and get to Inn. Log out obtain as much rested as possible, then hand in and sell etc. 
---
Rested XP is not consumed by quest hand ins from what I've been told, only by Mob kills
---
Nope. The easier it is to gain honor, the more honor other people are going to gain, so you also need to get more honor to compete with them.
---
That is for spells I believe
---
Is it just me or does rapid fire really mess up your rotation. Your auto shot speeds up but not your aimed.
---
Not directly, you need specific levels for higher ranks. Like I believe level 19 cant go above rank 3 and 49 cant go above rank 7 or 8.
---
Horde "letting" alliance win in AV is like someone saying "You can't fire me, I quit!" after being fired.
---
You should work on a heal set before level 45, I think I started around level 25 or 30 just getting +int or +spi pieces.  You will OOM *VERY* quickly unless you're wearing at least a few +int pieces.
---
No one ever said anything about passing.
---
Same, I leveled my main to max in Cata then said fuck it. All i did was play some level 70 twinks. That bracket was so active back then, super fun.  Had a 70 prot pally that was almost unkillable and did so much damage lol.
---
How can you be so sure? Plenty of horde have high leveled alts.
---
You might wanna check in game before commenting. Mongoose then greater agility elixir.
---
Lmao you are still missing the whole point of why i brought it up. I never said it was a big deal or anything i’m just saying there’s a difference between waiting 30 seconds and waiting 15 minutes jesus dude we get it you are a strong cool guy who doesnt get mad when he has to kill 15 minutes. V proud of you
---
I downloaded the dbm pvp addon and it didn’t put the bars for av in there. Tried looking in the settings and couldn’t find an option for it.
---
Eh, I have way too much down time at work this month and peruse this subreddit more than I probably should.
---
It's about 50/50 both sides yelling at each other that the other side plays the wrong way.
---
maybe it makes you sad. but if it makes him happy why do you care?
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/899shEF.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/899shEF.jpg)
---
Imagine thinking I'm serious and getting butthurt lmao.
---
Yea absolutely, I’m on board with that.
---
Enh here, dungeon quests give a lot of XP as well. I think BRD alone has between 17 and 19 total. Low 50s-60 I polished off Ungoro, Felwood, and Azshara and with BRD quests completely skipped EPL/WPL/Winterspring until I hit 60.
---
This is my favorite comment on reddit today.
---
they've already said they're not changing that. AQ is gonna open day 1 lol
---
I bet my dad can beat up your dad
---
You look like a Russian nesting doll had a baby with a butt plug
---
I was more looking for a list for raiding today, but thanks, I'll keep them in mind for the future.
---
Because it over inflated the amount of people waiting at every fp and chokepoint to kill people, and absolutely destroys any type of similar economy to vanilla. Imagine how bad it’s going to be when triple the people are farming black lotus because people actually need them in the future. Nobody is going to be able to afford flasks with populations this huge.
---
You just trade gold from your retail toon to another persons retail toon, and they give you classic gold in exchange. This also means you can buy people game time tokens and trade them for classic gold. It’s paying real money for gold with extra steps and zero chance of ban. I know 2 people who got their epic mounts this way.
---
Honor before bgs with the current population was awful, and I agree the faction imbalance was a bigger issue, but there isn’t much blizz could have done there without immediate backlash, where as people would have likely been fine with similar sever sizes.
---
imagine being this much of a cunt
---
Shoulda done RR after the reserved one.
---
I can finish an AV in the time it takes a horde one to pop. AV is 6-8 minutes and queues are instant. It feels good.
---
Depends on what you're doing... Going for a zerg to the end ASAP? yes it's a detriment. I'm horde, so if our 60%ers (like 1/4th the squad) went and defended, they're slow speed wouldn't matter and they could set up and wipe the alliance. They get sent to stonehearth, giving the 100%ers enough time to kill Van. EZ horde win for only an extra 4 min of fighting.
---
Alliance are pretty dumb so it takes like 3-4 Horde in Drek's room to completely confuse the rush, particularly if the Horde target healers or bait Alliance into pulling multiple WM's.
---
Alliance also doesn't defend the towers or the FW relief hut 9 times out of 10 they're a super easy backcap.
---
Premades reporting people is definitely a mechanic getting abused in the name of rushing Drek. I once had a friend in my AV get kicked because he didn't immediately pass raid leader to someone else who had a bunch of friends in our instance. Never mind that we had our own premade in there.
---
There's also plenty of trolling to force people to drop before the game starts, from the classic "you have been reported afk, type /afk" gag to mages dropping portals and asking people to click the summon.
---
People are just generally being awful to each other in many AV instances. There is rarely any camaraderie. Allies watch as their teammates get picked off because they can't be bothered to dismount on their mad dash south even if it means losing half the raid including all the healers along the way.
---
We need to do better.
---
I mean we are in the classic wow subreddit
---
I felt the same way, then I bought Skyrim
---
Took me roughly 16 hours total over 2 days, 8 hours each day.
---
100+ is hardly enough for a 40man raid. 
---
As dot bots like locks can use allot of slots.  
---
A lock could use the following debuf slot.  
---
Curse (shadow, elements, weakness, Toung, rest agony) 
---
Corruption 
---
Fire dot from Imolate (none fire immune bosses)
---
The drain from affiction tree.  
---
Bosses would die so much faster tho everyone toss a dot on boss and leanback.
---
Anything in Event Viewer &gt; admin events or Event Viewer &gt; Applications? Are you overclocking ur RAM at all? Any changes to ur software since the last time it worked?
---
The cheapest one would be exalted with stormspike and rank 3+ pvp. That way you'd get it for 640g.
---
&gt; If alliance goes for other objectives they'd make the same honor as horde.
---
Except that Galv is bugged and does not give honor, so... no they don't.
---
I need to buy my epic mount but all the flask and greater recipes I don’t have are calling my name....
---
Gotta keep it spicy! I can’t wait to warlock tank onyxia tonight! Because why not lol
---
loool
---
my poor dwarf has been insulted many times over the years but that has to be one of the best
---
In a raid of 5 druids (how did that even happen) I'm the only one ever using faerie fire... I like telling myself it's because I'm so dependable.
---
Wsg was always my favorite.
---
AV is just for loot, WSG is for fun
---
Is it knowledge who's being cast as Kynes in the dune movie?
---
I was so excited to play AV with my buddies. Forgot it was solo queue only :/
---
So I’ve *finally* convinced my wife to play and will be rerolling with her as Alliance. As I’ve been playing horde up until now it’s a fresh start. I’ve never played a tank, so I want to do that. I know this is a druid specific thread, but I’m looking for reasons why I should (or shouldn’t) pick a druid over a warrior. It’s doubtful my wife will want to play for hours a day everyday, so chances are it will be a long time before we reach 60. Because of that, druids being less gear dependent is a plus. However, my main is a shaman so I don’t really want to play another healer. So druids only really being healers at end game is not so appealing.
---
I know druids are great solo levelers and warriors are one of the worst, but I’ll have my wife with me the whole time (she hasn’t decided on class yet though, likely a hunter or a healer of some kind) so this shouldn’t be a disadvantage if I do choose warrior.
---
This being a druid thread I’m sure the answers will be biased, but I’d like to hear what aspects of being a druid is most fun *and* least fun?
---
I don’t care about pve lmao
---
Because Galv is bugged and sometimes doesn't give honor.
---
I agree. If they release BC and Wotlk they should just rename it from wow Classic to Wow Again
---
With Herblore you can just farm briarthorn for swiftthistle. They go for 70s each.
---
We will eventually remember what made AV magical was actually the long fought stalemates and not the zero rushing...
---
One day...
---
I would go with arthas and annihilator/ghudbashur. You could also open up some slots since I dont think Tclap works on bosses (could be wrong) and a random corruption doesnt do anything for the raid.
---
Alchemy can make money in several ways
---
Arcanite transmute every 48 hours means that you can buy materials and make an easy 5g-10g profit by reselling the arcanite bar on the AH.  Or you can make good friends with your guild and provide the transmute free to help people stockpile their arc bars for various weapons or gear pieces. 
---
You can focus on a few specific potions and buy a ton of the herbs, then resell them.  I do this buy buying up herbs to make "Major Healing Potions" (best hp potion) and I make 50-100 or so, then sell in Org or via mail COD for a slightly discounted AH price.  You save yourself the 5% cut from the AH, and you odn't have to worry about losing the deposit if it doesn't sell.  
---
You can also do this with popular raid consumables (major or superior mana pots, elixir of mongoose, elixir of agility, stoneshield potion, arcane elixir, elixir of shadow power, etc) and post them for sale around 4pm server time.  You'll be SHOCKED how hot the market gets for raid consumables between like, 4pm and 8pm server time cuz a lot of people log in and just have to buy consumes for their raid. 
---
There's also lower level pots that are profitable too like swiftness potion, free action potion, or invisibility potion that are helpful in PVP and sell well. 
---
Generally the potion itself will always sell for a modest profit (maybe 10s-30s per potion) compared to the cost of raw materials.  So if you invest a lot of gold, stay disciplined, and know the market that you'll be able to sell at a good point you can make pretty easy but modest profits. 
---
I make perhaps 10g to 20g profit off of investing 100g or so to make consumes, and if I spend a little more time trying to hawk my wares it might be more like 20-30g.  Of course you can also just farm the herbs yourself which is much more profitable, instead of paying for hte herbs you're just investing your own time into it.
---
Thanks, pal. Yeah, there's a lot in it that's surprising. I appreciate the positive words! Thanks.
---
Well someone needs to press Innervate
---
Ah ok. So all "trinkets" needs to be equipped to use, so its only "items" that you can just put on your action bar to use?
---
Awful content. I hate this shit so much but so can’t stop coming back in the hope there might actually be news or something.
---
Hey Soupa, wassup? ;)
---
Does it though? Upon reviewing our logs, it looks closer to 10%. Sometimes lower - the other higher performing hunters in my raid fall in a similar range. 
---
Also, pets tend to die a lot due to boss mechanics, I'll look into this some more but I find it hard to believe that this is the cause of my dropoff, also this issue predates my pvp respec, I was running a 20/31/0 build just a few weeks ago and I was having the same issue.
---
Yeah definitely, it's not the most straight forward system to explain to people because their preconceptions of how it works are guaranteed to be completely wrong.
---
600kb/s is easily enough. It worked for me on 300kb/s well enough.
---
You should start in the rogue classic [discord](https://discord.gg/mkfKCBB) 
---
Check out the spreadsheets available. You should be able to plug your gear in and get a good idea of whether it’s a dps increase or not.
---
One of the worst things about this broken version of AV &amp; xrealm queues  is that it has removed literally all social elements from pvp. This is nothing remotely like my vanilla PvP experience
---
You can totally put trinkets on your action bar. You just have to equip them in order for that action bar button to work.
---
Wait until better player get exalted and AV turns into turtle-fests. WSG with premades will be superior honor, especially against a group of randoms with gy camping.
---
Arcane/Frost is just straight up more damage than deep frost. But I'm in the same boat, I love deep frost. I respec for a few hours for raids and then go straight back to deep frost.
---
Its not like this is a bad place to discuss this stuff, its just that the information and the people that knows the math are all gathered on that discord.
---
They have, it’s just that it’s a collective effort between both horde and alliance guilds. Iirc they just trade tags between boss spawns.
---
Aren’t in those guilds? Get wiped by opposite faction guild.
---
This comment almost made me cry. If only it were true.
---
Aw dont say stuff like this out loud. Let em keep being stupid.
---
Best tabard is still ab exalted HORDE!
---
I'm a simple man, I see a petty comment on a post where someone worked hard to achieve something, I downvote
---
Yes better gear allows you to different things that were not possible before.
---
You have some...less than optimal mages then
---
You have no idea what you're talking about. Top Ally rankers on every server are all in AV queueing with 80+ people to try and get a large amount in one group. All alliance are NOT giving up 100k honor, just the dumb Drek rushers that can't be bothered to learn how to do a couple of things on their way down to Drek to easily grab it.
---
Thorium node fighting.
---
Open those slots up for what? Pre Annihilator that is.
---
Playing a sport actually goes on a CV much better than a video game just an FYI
---
Source: I am employer
---
Good advice in general, but I'd argue that AV is a bit closer to PvE, stat-wise. I'm most of the way through my AV grind and I've engaged in relatively few 1v1 fights. I tend to stay with large groups and fight from the back, using LoS as best I can and barrier/block to survive the rare occasions when I get focused. I'm usually one of the later ones to die, and by the time the battle gets to that point some extra int/stam doesn't help. I'm no AV expert by any means, but I've found the most success by stacking PvE stats.
---
I think this is an important thing to have in prot/ret pals, moonkins/ferals, etc. Just because your main spec isnt heals, you still are capable of it and should be ready to if needed. The whole point of bringing a hybrid is flexibility. If you are DPS and DPS alone, then why would a raid bring you over another pure DPS, who will pump out enough DPS that itll even outweight the contribution you make with auras and whatnot?
---
I meant someone with low health
---
Back when the implemented that, you could have full T3, if you didn’t take at least 1-2 towers, you would not win. The buffs were ridiculously strong,  +40% damage, +25% health/mana alone made the fights insane to beat. You could not ignore them when AV was done well
---
Would corruption be considered a pure dot? I did not see it listed on the listed.
---
AQ40 has like two hard encounters in it. If your guild cant clear aq40 its not because they have two non-optimal specced players in the raid. Its because youre bad.
---
That's hilarious.
---
My 35 dwarf hunter agrees wholly, play the way you want, don't be prodded into things you don't want.
---
In vanilla I queued AV with my GF at the time, we just hit the queue at the same time and joined if we popped for the same BG.  It was pretty easy since they were insta-queues, and the realm populations were much smaller.
---
You get full honor one time and then much less each kill, camping the GY is worthless.
---
Also AV wont turn into a turtle fest unless they change something.
---
This is exactly the point. These are the sorts of encounters that those of us who enjoy wpvp live for, not whatever was going on for the last few weeks. Organic random world pvp that happens for a variety of reasons and isn't some dumb grind. Flying absolutely had a huge effect on this kind of pvp.
---
And then they’re going to ruin the economy for those currently farming and saving up black lotus. Changing the spawn rate part way through classic would be a slap in the face to the people who worked so hard to get the few they have now.
---
They could stop it by saying it’s not allowed and taking action to stop it just like they do to people who purchase gold from third party sources. The economy is a massive part of wow, and classic in particular, so allowing people to exchange real money for gold is unacceptable.
---
Are you not on a pvp server? Were you not on reddit the last few weeks? It was an absolute disaster on pvp servers because there were so many people farming honor that every single spot where a 48+ player could be, was being camped by large groups of people. It’s not just because more people are trying to rank, it’s because there’s triple the amount of people in general.
---
Lvl 29 Hunter, get a lvl 60 to help you get the gun from the nesingwary hunting quest and put a +7 damage scope on it and you'll b unstoppable
---
yeah, I am a bit puzzled too by his post, so I searched around for logs of horde feral holding threat against ~900-1200 dps on magmadar.
---
found this one so far: https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/fmZ1Gtc74NPHFy9X#fight=3&amp;type=damage-done
---
based on frenzy uptime, it seems like boss is intentionally not being tranq'd prior to execute phase, I am not sure whether guilds with DW fury tanks do the same.
---
Piper perri?
---
I could have finish 3 games within that allotted time. Proving my point exactly
---
You need more hit rating on your gear
---
Been looking as well, sadly, itemracknos all we really have right now, theres lots of demand for outfitter though, so hopefully someone will make it soon
---
Why is it called a pug? Is it a acronym or something?
---
Yeah, and everyone else is getting that honor then we sure as shit want it as well
---
You are not in a raid group
---
After being called out, pretend to be sarcastic. 3D Chess moves right here.
---
this is soooo amazing, Cheers to yall for being ggreat people! Happy Hollidays!!
---
lmfao nice generalization. That's like saying being a smelly booze hound is a prerequisite for being homeless.
---
Figure out which addon is causing it and update it, or disable it until it's updated. I've heard Details!, DBM, ClassicCastBars, and NeatPlates blamed. FWIW I only have DBM enabled of those 4 currently but also haven't experienced this issue at all since the patch.
---
They used a moonkin because they couldn't use a resto druid, lol
---
Frostbolt,frostbolt,frostbolt,frostbolt
---
A question on rapid fire, do I aim shot during RF? or just enjoy my increased attack speed. Please elaborate on how to maximize my damage during this steroid.
---
Me and every other healer in the guild created/farmed the mats and bought the pearls. One guy got so good at farming, he sold three HoTWs already. Idk why you can't.
---
The point is HoTW is soooo good that giving a downgrade to a healer when it's a PvE/PvP upgrade for a caster dps is just dumb. There is no caster cloak that's even close to HoTW.
---
Hearing a lot of mixed answers, so I’ll try asking you lads;
---
What’s the easier class to play, Mage or Priest?
---
Easier in terms of survivability, amount of keybindings and macros and to do well with the least effort.
---
Everything is possible in classic, you can raid with boomkins if your heart desires.
---
It might be worth respecing so that you get Nature’s swiftness since that’s a great pick up for healing especially if you’re going to stay at 30/0/21 to PvP later.
---
Be mad there aren’t fresh 60 tanks that need to gear up, not at geared 60s who sometimes never want to step foot in those again.
---
MH CHT wasn't bad at all as far as numbers go, crit ambush/backstabs were barely noticeable! I wound up getting Gutgore Ripper and generally offhand Felstriker for pvp and OH CHT for pve.
---
Let's hope Perdition's drop next week :DDD
---
WPVP doesn't suck, I think people just had the wrong idea about what WPVP people actually enjoy. Giant zergs and gank squads aren't fun. Honor farming WPVP isn't fun. The fun WPVP are the organic random battles over a resource node or a quest mob that spring up on their own as you're out in the world grinding or leveling or farming mats. BGs don't kill this kind of WPVP because there are always people out leveling and grinding resources and going to run dungeons etc etc.
---
progression?! MC lol
---
you fuckers complain about everything
---
No, I think you’re just not reading his comments. Lol
---
Fun: No real down time, unless you're fighting elite/orange mobs. Probably not even that if you're duoing, and you can extend that your wife. Tanking is pretty straightforward, you get pretty good AoE threat without much difficulty. VERY nice mobility, both at 20 from feline swiftness and travel form. Stealth is really nice for some quests (probably not important if you're duoing with a non-stealth class). Moonglade teleport is great for cross-continent travel.
---
Not fun: 1-20 is kinda terrible, mana issues galore and subpar DPS from bear. Cat is good but doesn't quite feel as great as a geared rogue. Bag space issues if you try to hold a healing set with you. Leveling rotation as cat is pretty dull. Life at 60 is a lot less impressive.
---
Your reply introduces the judgement of sacrificing fun for effectiveness, even with your disclaimer, and as such misses what min-maxing actually is. It’s pushing for the optimal character, in a specific context (raiding, pvp, farming, etc), no more no less.
---
A lot of people who picked up the game can only play a half hour or hour per day, maybe a few days week. They have jobs, partners, kids. So in that context, the people who play even 4+ hours a day could be described as pathetic. Why are you spending so much time trying to progress in a video game when you have much further to progress in life? 
---
Or, what if we don't call anyone pathetic, and just let people play how they want to play?
---
?
---
It is but it actually feels rewarding doing so.
---
the only reason why some people stuck with pvp servers is because they were beat up by their parents during childhood and now they somehow connect abuse with love. it's an absolute perversion and ya'll need to see a therapist asap.
---
HotW/NS is one of the best specs for druids, hands down. That I would never refute. 
---
However, for flag running, the spec you linked is THE flag running spec. 
---
While I was leveling and getting gear from BRD/DM I was HotW/NS because of that flexibility to be able to tank or heal or dps as need be. 
---
But at this stage in the game I am essentially raid logging (not so much anymore now that BGs are here) but either way, I cant remember the last time I stepped foot in a 5 man dungeon. I just don't need to run them for gear, or gold, or anything really. 
---
So I don't really need the HotW/NS spec anymore because everything I need from that spec I get already from gear (+int, +stam). Sure my HP probably isn't going to be as high in bear form with the flag running spec, but you can still dish out damage as long as you throw on some +spell damage pieces and kite around. And your damage isn't that gimped in bearform anyway considering you shouldnt really be pvping in full feral gear anyway.
---
Nice, I was missing "Let me tell you how I think you should enjoy the game" from my WoW classic Reddit Bingo card.
---
Now I just need a "Thunderfury is a rogue weapon, and here's why" and I will have BINGO!!
---
I just don't know how people don't have 100%. Not like I'm shitting on them but I don't know how people did anything in phase 2 without it. Must have been brutal. It was the only thing I focused on when I hit 60 in phase 1.
---
I'll believe that if it continues to be true after everyone has finished their AV rep grind
---
Have had a few slow games. Would have enjoyed them, only the zerg meta kiddies started raging the moment their first zerg attempt got countered and failed. That's the problem with this zerg trend, many people doing it legit don't have a clue how AV actually works, so doing know what to do next when the zerg fails. No counter-play. No nothing. They just rage and go afk.
---
Here is my handle, here is my spout
---
Lmao I don't think the people defending causal players are going to be the neckbeards in this situation.
---
What's your server?
---
Quite literally said “it’s doing what’s completely optimal above all else”.  Not sure how you’ve apparently missed that.
---
If your purpose is to be the best you probably are approaching this game wrong. It takes a lot of time and effort to be the top anything in this game. Most people won't find that effort to be worth it. The aspect that not everybody gets to be the top winner is part of what gives weight to accomplishments. 
---
If you need to accomplish all of the goals then understand this game is not broken, it is just likely not the game for you.
---
Run with the herd until you get in a game where the initial rushes fail. Once you've been in a game for 10+ minutes, people are spread all over the place and everyone's leaving the game left and right, you can run around and do quests without hurting your team much. You'll have plenty of those on your path to exalted, so just focus on winning the games you can and save your chores for lost causes.
---
Not really, most of them just want honor. There's a few douchebags out there who just want to piss in your cereal but most of the bad behavior was motivated by the honor grind.
---
Given that the current meta is just to lose as Horde, nothing really. People complain about AFK, but the objectives the Horde actually take only takes like 15 peoplenin the time given.
---
Anyways, after that rant, you should be able to learn AV pretty easily and get some PvP practice in where no one will really notice
---
Just hit 60 on my mage. I'm mostly a raider and not a BG player. I'm working on my pre-bis gear still. Should I spec the AP build for dungeons or stick with deep frost?
---
Do you get to keep it if/when you derank?
---
Shamans tanking MC, locks tanking Onyxia. Who's the real hero here? The healers.
---
I'm glad you know Int gives crit. 
---
Perhaps it will also help to know that SP means spell power, not spirit.
---
Was 5 - 10 mins yesterday.
---
I'll have to keep that in mind. Thank you.
---
Pick Up Group
---
What’s ur hit without lionheart? Max out ur hit first.
---
Mageblades should be caster prio, as more dps in raid essentially buffs all the healers because boss  doesn’t take as long to down.
---
I only have details and dbm from that list and I have it so my guess is details, but more specifically I've heard the tiny threat plugin for details being blamed.
---
Your stun locks were performed well. The first Rogue got unlucky and missed his initial hit on you when he finally got a chance to. You got a major crit on the second Rogue. Both Rogues were not at full HP on the engagement.
---
All in all, great fight and HK!
---
Gotta say it's pretty damn interesting watching people like you have no idea how this shit was being abused.
---
Because of idiots like you that think healers should be able to roll on sapphiron drape lol
---
&gt; So you look up good build ideas
---
Thats really the only part you should change. Work off your own ideas even if you do min/max and it will be a lot more rewarding. I havent researched MTG deck builds in like 10 years and I have so much more fun playing the game now with my own builds.
---
Our raid is a little lacking with healers that are consistently showing up.
---
But when we do have enough healers I also am allowed to go boomie, because why not. We also have like... 5 druids in our group cause, like I said, we're really hurting for constant healers showing up.
---
Since we have so many druids and our usual healers are already so geared, I get all the innervates! (maybe not all, but some!)
---
Skyrim is the only single player game that I find to rivals WoW in how addictive it is. There is always something more to do, always that next little step to take and it makes it really hard to put down once you're invested.
---
Priest. Self healing is huge, and your rotation is Pain -&gt; wand, maybe throwing in mind blast or mind flay if you have excess mana. Plus psychic scream is a nice "oh shit" button. Mage isn't that hard either, though.
---
My guilds been able to get plenty of people in the same AV. Just do a count down and que at the same time. Might take a few tries but it should work just fine for a few buddies.
---
I guess everyone youve fought against just forgot that blessing of freedom exists
---
They're. . not even close my guy
---
I still pve for gear u lol I just care way more about bettering my pvp set not my pve set
---
The pattern is actually only like 7G on my server
---
I'm alliance this time round so can't get it. But yes, the wolf is probably my favourite mount as well! :-)
---
1 hour 55 mins. I guess you could round that down.
---
Not even refering to raid tanks - Lots of raid tanks dont know shit about dungeon tanking anyway. But those guys that couldt get a raid spot, but are geared to the teeth with everything they can get from dungeons. Lots of tanks out there that fit that category - hard to blame them for being unwilling to keep equiping DPS for raids while they are left behind.
---
The only downside to Feral at 29 is you really only have 7 points to play with, as 13 are pretty much required to get Feral Charge and Feline Swiftness.  What you do with those 7 points can definitely change depending on the different builds and roles you find yourself most in, but I thought you answered OP's question great as 29 druids are great fun in that bracket!
---
Or they enjoy it because a long AV feels like an actual organic battleground
---
Theyre about the same, i use Shrouded Mists because its got the stam and idt can make the difference sometimes.
---
The reasoning your asking for is because Agi benefits from the ZG buff and kings, while the AP doesnt. Survival build is based on the Lightening Reflexes talent giving you 15% binus agility, so you need to stack agility with that build.
---
This is a good take on it. The niche for my warrior is stuff like the 45 minute baron run where the warrior is pulling 600 dps the whole time in addition to “tanking”. (you just have to put your 2H away for that baroness so that she doesn’t wipe the party when she possesses you...)
---
I mean you can insert literally any hobby instead of playing wow and nothing about the statement changes. If you're enjoying what you do, go on.
---
Hand of rag is made for druids.
---
Horde on Herod here, 52 main playing since about 2 weeks after Classic launched. 0 alts. The other day a night elf hunter and I killed the 3 captains outside booty bay together helping each other the whole way. Plz don't hurt me.
---
Honestly, this is so stupid man. I'm sorry. People spewing this just have no idea.
---
MC is faceroll easy. It isn't hard. And my guild has been clearing it for so long now most people are insanely geared.
---
Sure, maybe at the beginning of mc release it wouldn't be as viable because people just don't have the epics they have now, but at this stage in the game, boomkin is more than viable and mages and warlocks will love you for that crit.
---
Please stop spewing this misguided rhetoric because you obviously have no idea what you're talking abou.
---
Bring a few mana pots, a few demonic runes and you're good to go. No MC fight lasts long enough for a boomkin to go oom unless they are so undergeared it isnt funny.
---
Make sure your pet is properly specced. Health/armor is useless for a raiding pet - you want resistances and focus dumps. Cat is fine for DPS.
---
Make sure you are at 9% hit, missed shots kill your DPS.
---
Proper use of Feign Death is a must to compete. If you wait to DPS like other damage dealers, you're already too late. Feign Death also triggers your autoshot cooldown so try and time it right after an auto to maximize DPS.
---
Know if you should run a clipped vs full rotation - rhok is a clipped rotation always (used aimed shot on cooldown).
---
Bitch and moan til you're placed in the feral druid's group for the extra 3% crit. Use consumables.
---
Learn to pad damage meters on certain fights.
---
The honor per hour will still be better than roaming world pvp. It's going to stay like this.
---
If you're playing this character with your wife on the schedule you described, then endgame for it would probably be dungeons, not 40-man content. Druids are perfectly capable of filling any role in those. You get the flexibility as feral of covering any of those as long as you keep a set of gear for it.
---
Group needs a tank (as is most likely), you've got it covered.
---
The happen to have a tank and a healer already, most of your tanking gear is probably also your DPS gear for quite some time.
---
Group has a tank but no healer, well that's more rough but if you keep an updated set of healing gear around you can do it too. Don't spam Regrowth. Keep a few ranks of Healing Touch on your bars for different sized heals, wait as long as is comfortable, then use them. Then wait until it is necessary to heal again to allow your mana to regenerate. Innervate as needed, drink often.
---
Is it plugged in?
---
I have alot of mixed feelings about tbc. There's so much I don't like,  but there's so much I love.
---
Wow amazing to see this kind of kindness in our community, even better to find out it’s from my home server! I have so much love for this community.
---
No the Boomy is better because he mainly there for decurse.
---
How old/sad are you?
---
pvp or pve? Mage is simple for PVE, but more complicated for pvp. Whereas priest is similarly complicated for pve and pvp.
---
Well Im a holy priest in a casual raid guild with limited personal farm ability. Truefaith, leveling enchanting and enchanting my stuff, buying an eye of shadow, mats for hide of the wild, enchanting guildies gear for them, the mana pots and other consumables I guzzle in raids... theres plenty of stuff more important then a slightly faster mount. I got my rogue into its 40s now and its doing some farming for me so my gold shortage is easing up a little. Be better when it hits 60. Still Im poor as dirt and have been since I hit 60.
---
Clearly you have the wrong definition of "fun".
---
^^^/s
---
See!? Even horde prefer Iron Forge to their own mud-huts.
---
I like it too
---
You don't have to, but as a mage you at least *get* to. It's great xp and legitimately fun to do, so you may as well mix it up every once in a while when you're burnt out on grinding.
---
Because it's usually indexed as thumbs... but whatever, my bad. Should've been more clear.
---
This worked! Thank you
---
It’s cross realm what the fuck do you expect? Also because you are pissed off at what other realms are doing, you are going to take your anger out on innocent people in your realm. You have to realize AV is not a dungeon, the same loot rules that apply in dungeons DO NOT apply in a battleground.
---
Damn that’s rough.
---
Awesome didn't know there were young teenagers interested in Classic. Cause no one else could possibly think that was a good gotcha.
---
Ah, giving a new player that “sense of community” now are we? Is it *really* that hard to stop being a dick for five minutes? Or is it such a debilitating character flaw that you just play WoW full time?
---
Figuring out you got trolled, pretend I was serious. 3D fingerpainting right there.
---
Wow, okay maybe the prices people listed online are only applicable to 15 years ago. lol. Either way, they wasted over an hour to attempt to help me out, which I totally didn't expect from a stranger!
---
Addons ruined the game
---
Plus Dunning Kruger effect can go both ways, where someone who IS good at something can't properly reflect and figures they're worse than they really are.
---
Idk about that ally winning part.
---
I went from ~25% win rate as horde on the 7min losses.
---
Now horde seems to be winning atleast 65% of the time.
---
I got that message too. My recount and classic cast bar addons are also screwed up, i had disable them otherwise i got a error and couldn’t enter av.
---
you're assuming 100% of people vote either up or down. Some vote up if agree but ignore if disagree.
---
Original was a troll but I wanted a Tauren.
---
True as we can see here in pvp he would need two keybinds one for the fishing skill and one for the mount so he can get back to the fishing pool
---
Been there, new games don't give you losses for games in progress now
---
you are wrong get hide of the wild you cheap fuck. your math does not factor in availability of DPS cloaks. i am a priest healer btw
---
My guild does lots of WSG premades. We just enjoy winning.
---
The specific and repeated references to optimizing instead of having fun introduce a wrong and biased judgement that ruins your point, which is further driven home by the better answers available in this thread.
---
Yes we did, nobody played those hour long AVs. Blizzard had to change AV to be played because it was effectively a dead game mode.
---
what you mean mixmax? This is totally blizzards fault. They removed any incentive to do any of the quests in AV. The way to win the game in this AV version is to rush the boss, not to turtle the opposite side and wait for raid bosses to win the game for you. The way to actually win is to rush and kill the boss because you're allowed to.
---
you sound like an absolutely lovely person mate
---
Wow. Pathetic.
---
Fuck Heartseeker Alliance
---
-Stalagg Alliance
---
I have a guy in my guild whose been mid-30s for like 2 months now. But hes on all the time. No clue what hes up to, but he seems to be having a good time.
---
&gt; I think you're a little too sensitive dude. Maybe get a job? :P
---
Epic troll mate, really not grasping at straws right here. Can't you just admit that you were wrong and we can all move on?
---
Use the CoC + flamestrike spec. It's super good in ZF.
---
Make the map bigger, add Korrak, buff the guards, add the land mines, basically everything in the patch notes.
---
It's not just about smelling the roses.  It's about engaging gameplay might as well just push a button and get an assload of honor 10 minutes later.
---
It's a pretty short trip from TM &gt; AV / SS &gt; AV.  The rest is all flight paths.
---
How much honor do I need for pvp armor?
---
Please read my other comments before you comment yourself. Thank you :)
---
The horde meta has evolved and i feel like a lot of the complaints (atleast from myself) was the point on tuesday night/Wednesday where the Meta was to kill balinda, the lieutenants, then roll over and afk till alliance win. It was incredibly frustrating to be a part of. Now horde have evolved slightly to kill the Zerg and have a few drop back to wipe them again at drek. Turning games a little longer but more fun
---
I love you dude I been trying to tell half these kids for hours now. I couldnt have said it better Tbh
---
I legitimately hope this becomes the norm. Cause this non-pvp BS is driving me bonkers.
---
Easier probably isn’t the right word, but it’s definitely more obvious or straight forward to the average player. Warrior tanks get their tier, which they don’t really need all 8 pieces of.
---
Humans and orcs especially have a lot of flexibility in how they gear and get hit capped. To me, feral tanks require a better understanding of what trade-offs to make and have a harder time getting hit capped.
---
You are welcome!
---
Visual fixes seem to be at the extreme bottom priority, I remember in launch week everyone was talking about the Hunters wielding Quivers when they switched to melee, and that still happens today! 3 months later!
---
It was them and I’d say if you’re leaving right after you wipe on Drek it ain’t because of a world boss.
---
Well the mage can tip me for heals then. Not that I have problems squeezing water out of mages; if they don't cough up when asked nicely at the start of AV the whole class gets no heals.
---
Dwarven appreciation in the community is way too low.
---
I use modifiers (shift, Ctrl) to cast different ranks of FoL it's really nice
---
Stormstrike and flame shock would take them from "lolwhy" to about the same low dps as elemental.
---
HELL YEAH BABY
---
You get the potions at rank 6, when you can enter the pvp chamber
---
Fun isn’t a waste of time
---
Just found out you can Fish too!
---
What is interesting to me is the underwhelmed reaction.  I too had that at my first job designing printers.  Some guy came up to with a paper that had ink drops on it, nothing really discernible, kind of like a mistake and he was ecstatic!  He had just gotten ink to fire from a new print engine/system.  
---
Later someone showed me an image of pasta that was horrible quality, but they too were celebrating and proud.  
---
3 months later, the new printer was printing (at the time) super high quality images.  
---
I guess the point of this, there is a lot of hard work and ugly but wonderful and exciting wins that happen in development.  Early development versus end product are so different.  It's amazing how great an end product can be when you remember the early days of development.
---
It’s fun to actually play the game...
---
The casual guilds I've pugged with are not clearing MC in 2 hours. I think you're over estimating "casual" guilds.
---
Deep frost for sure. Damage output will almost never be the difference between success and failure in a 5 man, but survivability definitely can be. Preventing wipes saves a lot more time than killing every other pack slightly faster. Personally I spec AP for raid days, then spend the rest of the week in a 0/20/31 farming/dungeon spec.
---
I'd love to have the free time to sit down and play WoW all day.  I mean yeah one person's acceptable amount of time to play a video game is another's nolife grinding.
---
Hahaha that’s awesome! What’s the addon to make your keybinds have that dark border? Looks great!
---
Yeah I’m not surprised. They got a few good players like Endlessrage, but many are subpar and cocky as hell.
---
What if you like the pvp set gear?
---
Don't most bosses in MC have roughly sub 500 armor with 5 sunders + faerie fire?
---
An Alliance human did it in 14 hours.
---
As horde with a 5 minute queue time, I am getting about 2k rep/hr.  Since I need 42k rep, it's about 21 hours of play time.
---
You could just type "hey im a prick" and save yourself a lot of time.
---
Oh yeah man I totally get not being able to afford it. I just think I wouldn't have stuck out the wpvp without it.
---
&gt;Whats the point of this?
---
Did you have fun grinding to exalted?
---
Yeah. Basically you convert every stat into ap to compare.
---
1 crit = 29ap
---
1hit = 26 ap (above hit cap)
---
1 agi= 1 ap + (1/29)ap (this is for the 1 ap you get, plus 1/29th of crit chance)
---
1str = 1 ap.
---
Nightslayer wins by a mile.
---
Hey that’s me!
---
You Havnt read my original comment either. You are trying to apply dungeon loot rules into a battleground... you’re like the kid who mashes a circle toy into a triangle slot and cries because it’s not working.
---
Eh he’s probably just a kid. I used to think I was badass too when I’d reference /b/ memes in 2006.
---
But what about the 8 hours of maintenance they did....was that just to get us to login to retail? 🧐 Couldn't be....
---
This is your logic on the topic im not going to debate who is wrong.  I personally think that if it wasn't 1 full mana bar for 1 person's food needs I'd have no problem sharing it with everyone but it takes too much time to stack up on that water.  When I made it in advance I share but when I just logged in and have couple stacks on me, sorry but no can do.
---
i did read your comment, it has nothing to do with my thread, which you would know had you read it
---
How? It's not like you as an individual player can have that much effect on a 40v40 bg, there really aren't any "plays" or challenges that would make winning rewarding.
---
In the best of cases AV is just a zergfest where poor players who don't actually like PvP can "have fun" tab targeting people in the opposite zerg together with 20 others to see damage numbers and HKs pop up on screen. It's awful.
---
real tryhard alliance hit exalted and started doing premade wsg
---
The botting? 'cause noone is in the green chair and it is still being played....
---
Ohhhh! You mean this shit-spray? Nah, don't worry about that lil guy
---
I'm going to level on a pve server and turn off mods, do my own thing
---
I’ve read it multiple times you are just a salty noob who can’t stop crying. Maybe your mommy will make you feel better
---
Is that the elemental spec? How's it perform compared to deep frost or AoE?
---
Dude I remember your name, you gave my friends and I such a laugh when I was running through Fields of Strife on my 60%er and they yell at me to look behind me and I just see this troll sprinting at me behind my back and *gaining* on me.
---
Instant. At no point Wednesday/Thursday nights were they anything other than instant. Don't know about any other timeframes though.
---
Much better for dps stop crying and go craft hotw

No the true loading screen is to finally get to silithus only to be shown a loading screen and sent back ironforge or [This](http://www.darklegacycomics.com/23).

Pretty sure dps warriors are way above any other melee dps by endgame. For ranged I assume mages take the cake?

This post is being massively downvoted by everyone that used the server transfer option 🤭
---
I don't know how to explain it. I just really enjoy winning.
---
Any game I consistently win is more likely to get me to return.
---
Axe of the Deep Woods dropped. I was the last one to roll and won with a 98.
---
Set it to ctrl+wheel.
---
You better respect what OP is telling you or he will TYPE ANGRY WORDS at you!
---
For certain circumstances.... Way to be specific
---
And it still works for you?? What the hell
---
Well maybe at some point we will get another decent western MMO. Until such a time WEEEEEEE!
---
depending on what class you are, you’re probably gonna want one of the exalted item rewards anyways so it’s probably worth it.. you can get exalted in just a few days, i’m halfway thru revered already playing an average of 4-5hrs the last 3 nights
---
How about now?
---
There is no 100% riding skill for either the regular epic mounts or the AV mounts. Grinding to exalted will save you 160g, so it's up to you whether that would be worth it.
---
What's obnoxious about this video? It's basically just informative.
---
I personally bind zoom in/out to my page up/down keys, its rarely used anyways.. much better off utilizing mwheelup/down with spells/macros
---
You can solo farm ZF graveyard purely using CoC from 44-54 (technically doable at 42 but very difficult) and it's an absolutely incredible source of xp and gold. By far the most efficient thing you can be doing as a mage for those levels.
---
This is caused by a free third party addon, not by blizzard
---
You can easily be a sub/stand in
---
There are many days 1-2 members of a pvp group cant log in at times, and its better to take someone who may not always be with the group, but knows the strats of the group and has played with them before, then just some brand new person
---
Haha oh well, maybe it's a threat meter thing then? Or blizzard gremlins. That's what I'm going with now
---
Hahah i remember you! funny seeing you on here
---
I'm 34 and I may have slowed down a little bit but I still have my fair share of energy.
---
you also get marks when you lose btw.
---
I just think it's low quality humblebragging, and this sub gets clogged enough as it is.
---
idk man, i had 21k honor one night of WSG at level 49 (where i only get ~50% of full honor)
---
I get stuck in a loop and 5 minutes becomes another 35.
---
there is a spreadsheet on the classic rogue discord you can use to show you what is and is not an upgrade, if you are interested in that stuff.
---
It's just my experience. If not many are being harassed by your servers players that's a good thing. I should of mentioned I'm alliance.
---
How the fuck are you guys getting into AV together?  Me and some buds tried to time our queues and it took 5 tries before only two of us got the same pop.  I'm jealous
---

at level 49 you get 50% of full honor
---
Personally, I'm not gonna beat the best warriors/rogues, that's a given. But my current logs absolutely beat out the average warrior, and since I'm playing the "meme spec" I generally take that as a win. :') I'm mostly comparing myself to the other ferals on the server, who are absolutely crazy! One day I'll be able to get up there, but first I need to get to Golemagg with world buffs, lmfao.
---
Lol nice observation.
---
oh god
---
Personally I would go warrior. I main a holy pally, and while you don't need to heal at 60 as a druid, I'd much prefer having a class that is much better at the roles that I actually want to do, aka dps/tank and not be forced into healing on your alt as well as your main. Once your 60 it's not like you have to play that character with your wife, you can use your alt or your shaman so that doesn't really matter all that much. Plus if you ever want a druid, they level solo plenty quick, but I assume (I haven't personally leveled a warrior) that leveling your warrior with your wife as a healer/hunter will be a much more pleasant experience.
---
I felt guilty playing until I called it a hobby, alot of my time in game is also spent socialising. Yet, when it gets compared to artistic or physical activity hobbies, it gets looked down on.
---
No idea where society got this mind set from
---
Sure, there are many arguments to justify giving this to a DPS over a healer, but claiming that it's because it's BiS isn't one of them.
---
I ain’t dictating shit, I’m just suggesting other people try other ways to play instead of coming on here to bitch. Sorry I triggered you
---
Do you have a job?
---
I am sure they are responsible for planting this impression in my head more than decade ago.
---
The irony is delicious.  As someone who doesn't care about honor points and is in no rush for the rep, I like to start out on defense as Horde in AV because I go to BGs to PvP somewhere that won't just get facerolled by the side that showed up with more people in the zone.  I get that the efficient way to grind honor/rep is to ignore PvP in BGs, and I hate playing with people on either side that do that.  It's great that it just takes a few of us to defect and decide to PvP after all to ruin people's efficiency runs.
---
Nah, high and dry meaning they've already lost 3-4 tanks over the last few weeks, perhaps I should have said to add insult to injury instead
---
That I cant confirm. This was maybe a month ago.
---
Looks like you're holding a briefcase and heading into the office
---
Then you are lucky and your server has enough tanks.
---
I can easily sell my tanking work at mine
---
It's about willpower. I dont sit around and go, "oh, i'm so tired, oh i cant work if i'm sleepy." I just ignore the shit and go on with my life. If I'm tired, oh well. If I'm sick, oh well. Unless I'm fucking debilitated I dont let my fee fee's get in the way of my life.
---
1. What are you saying?
---
2. Not only is it not a screenshot, its a blurry camera photo.
---
3. Why would a hunter need on that?
---
I agree, but not because it's BiS, it's not.
---
Agree with this. Def a good idea to progress your rank now on av for a little. And then you can move on to WSG when friends and guildies are done with AV or when they want a break from it.
---
Yea honestly I don't give a shit about the people "looking down" on it or anything like that. It's my hobby. And it's 2019, we're not watching if videogames establish themselves anymore. More importantly, I have the same level of standards for video games that I have for movies, shows, music, books, literally any Form of consumable media. Because that's what it is, consumable media.
---
I think everyone was having mostly good experiences u til BGs drooped and since their cross realm everyone was immediately more willing to be toxic tbh lol. Literally in my first AV a dude was flaming all the heartseeker players saying grobbulus was 10x better than heartseeker and that he was a REAL pvper unlike us lmao. And here I thought the rp server kids would be nice... 😂
---
How incredibly original.
---
BDO revived that spark for me, making grinding actually quite fun through an intricate combat system. 
---
Sadly the game got p2winned to death after a few good years.
---
Your approach to AV disgusts me. The Zerg mentality has reduced the PLAYER VERSUS PLAYER BATTLEGROUND to a PVE race.  To add insult to injury, I can’t even queue with like-minded friends,
---
I like some of it
---
I'm sure there are times that it changed the course of battle, but I found that when I had it, people run away from me so that I can't heal them anyway. Also, sometimes you get chained polyed so that you're the last to die, so SoR isn't helping there either.
---
I did play with it for a while in Vanilla, when I was PvPing with a raiding spec.  I eventually cut that talent out of my spec, because its a talent that relies on you dying.
---
Oh, didn't know that. Then again, I don't really do my fishing in BG's :p
---
typical hunter
---
PRINT SCREEN
---
He doesn't give honor if you don't kill him before Balinda, it's not a bug.
---
I had one game like that where we get 3.8k and alliance got 200 honor....that was brutal lol.
---
All q same time and report afk til you get everyone in
---
Standing in ashenvale for an hour waiting for WSG was great. It was such a bad decision to add battlemasters. /s
---
I do not have any experience playing as a 19 priest, but I find it difficult to argue for skipping blackout. In a bracket that is very limited on stuns, while not always guaranteed, will always have great significance. Unfortunately this does mean your locked to only 5 points elsewhere and stuck on the first tier too. I’d probably just find myself 5/5 blackout and wand specialization but that’s just me.
---
what, so they waste a few mins of your time removing you from queue and 2 load screens and you don't even get any credit for the game at all?
---
That's not fun for a lot of folks,  a massive turtle fest.
---
My understanding is most bosses are around 3700 armor (with a few exceptions like casters and Magmadar). With FF and sunder, you get 2700 reduction, leaving them with approx 1000 armor, which I believe is about 15% reduction.
---
Yes. I don't see why people think this is strange. I had a Freezing Band drop one run in BRD with my friend and we had a mage who wanted it but he totally understood why we would all roll on such an expensive item. He won it anyway, but still. Epic BOEs in pugs have always been free roll because they're so rare and so expensive sometimes. No one in their right mind is going to pass up 1k gold because some guy swears he'll equip it if he wins 
---
Like, you're putting your trust into a stranger hoping he'll equip it if he promises you he'll use it and won't just drop group immediately to go sell it when if you all rolled and won you all could have sold it.
---
Have you turned it off and on again?
---
What I do is full pve combat, BUT with engineering. If I want a fool dead, he will die whatever happens
---
My biggest complaint about cross-realm BGs is being exposed to Faerlina players in raid chat. I don't even cut slack anymore. First thing any of them says that's racist/phobic/elitist or otherwise toxic, they go straight to ignore. In a way, it's sad/funny listening to half conversations of people from other servers trying to reason with them.
---
Ah shit, Here we go again!
---
I literally wrote a program to automatically press spacebar for me every 2 minutes and I called it "AVK" lol, I will never forget that name
---
You don't need any timers for AV.  Alliance should kill Drekk before your faction can capture anything.  If they haven't done this then AV will last for 30min-1hr and you will win.
---
You should read up on how the PvP system works. There isnt an answer to this question because honor doesnt solely determine your rank.
---
I'd say I've seen less man-childish behaviour in osrs than other mmos
---
[https://i.imgur.com/EOyYShb.png](https://i.imgur.com/EOyYShb.png)
---
Very aware, very much wanted exalted and didn't want to work for it though.
---
If you limit bgs within a server, whichever side has more population would have to wait forever to join bgs. That’s not fair.
---
We can talk now if you want, you can ez sneak boomkin even in AQ or Naxx if you want. It's not rocket science.
---
Galv/Balinda is 200 honor, the bulk is from lieutenants and commanders, but okay
---
Public Group
---
He said skilled bear. Gotta find someone that can hit that Maul button better.
---
You rather have a grind that doesn't feel rewarding?

it existed back then as well lol... which I also shamelessly used. could even detect people staring at you in case someone was observing the fact that you were botting and auto log for safety.
---
Organise a speed run of MC.
---
It's stealth. Invisibility detection detects invisibility. ^^
---
Hunters fall off after BWL, yes.
---
Mages and locks both scale really well, but warlocks do scale slightly better for those who absolutely have to min max to the extreme
---
Hooman isn’t a bad choice either if you like a purdy toon, but you’re horde so I’m surprised you care what your character looks like.  
---
It's not the optimization I dislike, it's when everything becomes a number.

locks tanking ony no joke is good practice for lock for twin emps and healers in general
---
oh yeah, there'd be like 30 people afk in the cave cause there wasn't a reason to play
---
Me and my best friend play a hunter/Druid combo and it’s a pretty awesome matchup. The pet tanks , he dps, and I either dps too or heal us when we need it. When shit goes south I can go into bear and break up an over pull , and we are pretty hard to kill in PvP too between the two of us. I recommend the combo for sure.
---
The issue is that honor only matters relative to the other people on your server and faction. So if horde is always getting 3k honor per AV and alliance is always getting 1k, then honor is just 3x less valuable on horde than alliance. So it's not like horde were happy with this "tradeoff" of getting less rep but more honor than the alliance for a quick loss.
---
I (horde) was however fine with quick 6 minute losses for 300 rep when the queue was 2-3 minutes on tuesday. I was not cool with quick 6 minute losses yesterday when the queue was 8 minutes per game plus an additional 2 minute prep phase before the BG starts. I don't want to spend more than half of my time sitting in queue, I'd rather turtle and fight. It's much much more rep/hour for horde in a 25 minute game right now.
---
Drop Demo shout and Tclap. Gift of arthas and  Annihilator is good. Before we had our Axes crafted we gave extra slots to our warlocks so multiple of them could get corruptions out.
---
I so agree with your keybinds comment! But once you eventually get it down, it's how you call it, cheeseeeee :)
---
Kinda sad AV has been rushed since the first day. I was hoping maybe a week it would be "normal". I played one game and probably my last one.
---
Well I’m still not 100% sure. I’m currently fishing 4:1 sunscale and nightfin, so maybe it really is the time of the BG server. I mighty try and fish in a few hours again to test this, but I probably won’t have time
---
Press V to turn on name plates. It'll put the health bar above an enemies head if you are close enough to them. The nameplates are easier to click on than the enemy character model.
---
Like others have mentioned, using TAB to target is another option.
---
this. so. much. this. epic!
---
It will show both buffs on your bar but not give you both, watch your agility when you do this.
---
This mother right here.
---
I've had no issues so far raiding as a resto Druid. Was able to quickly find a guild that would take me as a backup, and now I'm on the roster full time with 2 other Druids.
---
It seems druids and warlocks are the least played and most in demand for raids, at least on my server.
---
You could always try and get a raid spot as a bear OT as well, but I haven't tried that yet.
---
In raids I'm not able to beat the priests and pallies on healing meters, but we bring other utility and buffs that will always be required. 
---
I mained holy priest and warrior in vanilla, so I was pretty worried being a hybrid that isn't the best at my role. But with good gear you can keep up and the versatility is amazing.
---
I'm HotW/NS spec right now so I can heal raids, heal or tank dungeons, and PvP has been really fun so far.
---
The only challenge with healing dungeons is not having a rez but every 30 minutes. I actually enjoy the challenge though and haven't had my problems. Tanking is the easier choice though but it is easier to get your healing gear while healing obviously. Anyway hope that info helps some.
---
Well, you need 8x Geared tanks for four Horseman, so Prot warriors come to mind there. William Pizza also makes a good point about their DPS.
---
I imagine the Healer Demand should also stay high.
---
Yes on Stalagg it is this way too, you roll need on every purple BoE because that boe can be sold for gold for any BoE you actually need.
---
Of course it can be done. Doesn't mean it should.
---
If it's clear, it's actually quite possible for anyone good at kiting to start pulling individual lieutenants and solo them down. Takes me a while as a druid, but one more person in the zerg is usually inconsequential anyways. Fulfilling side objectives is great.
---
That’s what AV is designed for though
---
In call of duty and overwatch they prevent loss stats for games in progress. 1 second loss is my record so far.
---
super cringe bro, take a step back.
---
more proof 
---
https://ibb.co/TP3nvRb
---
Well your brother is an asshat.
---
Nothing special as far as I know.
---
lol i get that, people say people is all powerful because its the only way to increase the actual damage of your spells
---
If you’re 1000 dps away it’s because you have a bunch of average/slightly below average players on the premium dps classes
---
kinda....siphon life isn't worth it for mana/dps and i doubt immol is either
---
i guess all locks would be able to use corruption? i dunno, ive never raided with more than 3 or 4 locks so the whole debuff thing for us was never an issue lol. i doubt we would see any major dps increase or anything.
---
Holy shit the boat in stonetalon is incredible
---
We do have some information on the world bosses though. Namely that they used to spawn weekly but in Classic it seems to be ~3/4 days.
---
Do we know roughly what the spawn rate is? Do they cycle through 1 after the other or all have independent timers? Can more than 1 be up at once?
---
Paranoia is the felhunter ability that increases stealth detection. Detect Invisibility is the buff warlocks give that does exactly what the name implies.
---
1. it was loot free for all, loot master forget to change that.

2. https://ibb.co/TP3nvRb

3. y not
---
I mostly see "enjoy the game" comments. I am enjoying the game by optimizing my goals. Epics are for closers only.

Ditto. See below for a picture of how Alliance feel about BG Queues

---
threat shouldn't be an issue for locks unless you're talking about ony
---
if threat is an issue you need to talk to your tanks about their spec/playstyle/skill and get them threat gen gear
---
Chill out dude. He made this post a long time ago. Things were different back then.
---
Bummer about the dwarf female though. Better luck next roll I guess.
---
Well, yeah, we had our MT and one healer alive, and the healer managed to pull through with mana.
---
Retail can kiss my grits.
---
Bruh Patchwerk, the DPS check of Naxx, requires like 500dps per to beat the enrage. Having a boomkin or a ret pally isn't why you're wiping in AQ40 lmao
---
Mate you can only have that if you had never played the game before. You miss nostalgia, not the actual game.
---
you can NEVER relive that feeling.
---
No. Pick up group.
---
Rather be alone than be in bad company
---
yeah true. But this guy man. I never called him bad or anything like that. Just had a different tactic and he is going all in. And it had not anything to do with Rep-Farming
---
No one could even move let alone attack each other.  I gave up trying to play and just watched the opening at one frame per 10 seconds... Not joking.
---
I don't think anyone is gonna hit exalted and stop caring about the honor grind. Rep is better in long games, but honor is worse.
---
I'd guess that as more people hit exalted, more people are going to care about only the honor grind, and games will probably get even shorter.
---
Just make sure you really don't want to llay ever again. When you chargeback, Blizzard permabans you (like most other companies).
---
Nah you’d still get way more raid DPS from CoE.
---
I guess that sucks, on Ally I've only had one queue that was more than 2 seconds
---
thx
---
It's something good that you can enjoy the game in many different ways. It's become a huge game over the years, sometimes I even think it's too extreme trying to please everyone. 
---
That said I wish there were more options to play the game on different server. Like a pristine server where players can play with different rules. Yes, it would split the playerbase, but Classic also split the player base and I don't have the feeling that this was a bad idea at all.
---
I was a human priest in vanilla and regretted not picking dwarf or just rolling horde. My friends played alliance so the second option was out. Dwarves are cool.
---
+1 most people wouldnt do a screenshot
---
Have you ever played on a harder difficulty on a game before? This is the same thing.
---
debatable, but it was funny.
---
Thanks for your response.
---
I like this tree, it helps me stay relevant in PvP. I'm running something similar except I had 5 in the health talent instead of improved aspect, I'll try respeccing into your build to get my improved aspect proc back.
---
About the pet attack speed - a lot of people say that damage is normalized but I still think higher attack speed is more damage purely on the fact that you get more crits. If you disagree please explain .
---
Also question on rapid fire in general, do I aim shot during RF? or just enjoy my increased attack speed and weave in Multishot/arcane shot to avoid clipping autos. Please elaborate on how to maximize my damage during this steroid.
---
Priest here, that's dumb. Farm the gold for Hotw or go shadow if you want to roll on it.
---
I'd rather have more to my game then  "99% grinding skill levels doing incredibly repetitive tasks?"
---
That's a piece of a game not a whole game.
---
nah not world chat, too much spam. I wouldn't say that's a repuation from ETS. I know first hand on frozen heart, which was the 1 I was referencing.
---
GYS and FSR having off-hours isn't what I would consider a reputation though... it's just knowing that there are guilds that raid outside of regular hours.
---
I meant reputation more like Joho and his pocket healers or he gets stomped despite having HoR. &lt;V O I D&gt; was camping EPL and using UD strat entrance to hop in/out of instances to avoid getting wiped.
---
Azuregos spawned.
---
95+ parse doesn't always mean "amazing" though, especially if its a spec that isn't that great/common for raiding, like boomkin or feral dps or ele sham. you wanna look at the dps and compare it to others. 
---
IE: an ele sham can get a 99 parse while only doing 280dps, while the rest of the caster dps on that fight was 300-600, and melee dps was 450-1.2k, all of them parsing lower because they are far more common specs with much more competition to parse against
---
Great now there will be no more posts anout how blizzard ruined your gaming experience.
---
I woulf suggest you wait until 26 to get cone of cold. Pre 26 my rotation was pull with flamestrike or wand, wait for them to stack then frost nova, blink away, then 2x blizzard and repeat till dead
---
Budget-battle Res is my hunter specialty. 
---
Feign Death and attempt defibrillation. (It even works in retail occasionally if you don't want to burn an actual battle res. Won't work on bosses, though.)
---
I mean if you aren’t competing for World Bosses now, you probably won’t be competing for them with increased spawn rates. You’ll just be gearing out the guild or two that farms them quicker
---
True, there's a great many things I could accomplish in that 0.5 seconds.
---
im just getting my off hand from AV then ill be in WSG! when AV is actually played its great but 8/10 times its just zerg
---
It's 8/12/31
---
no idea why this is downvoted, you can totally fish at level 150 if you bring lures
---
This is the reality sadly. Not classic related but in Legion I was pulling 90-95% parses on my spriest and still weren't close to our ww monk who was doing 75% on a good day.
---
I always played to win. I’m just better at it now.
---
Use a DBM pull timer to do a countdown for first available BG. Have a weak aura that shows what q everyone got. Repeat 5 or so times so everyone gets in the same game.
---
This is what we do to get 20+ people into the same game consistently.
---
What lol?
---
feral can do very high threat gen with pummelers however if your fury/prot tanks are good and geared they aren't gonna get out-threat gen'd by any feral dps. i've first hand experienced this with very geared fury/prot warr MT and bis with pummelers druid OT in MC
---
Why is it blizzards fault that the social element is not the same?
---
I didn’t realize this, I thought it was just auto attack speed, thanks!
---
I'm talking about groups of people at my level.
---
haha nah no pushups, i have one of these https://i.imgur.com/kviWlQw.jpg
---
Undead in cloth looks rad. Fight me!
---
i don't see how this would increase our dps by much at all. we don't have 45 different DoTs, and the extra ones we do have that typically aren't applied aren't all that great for dps due to high mana cost. at best some DS/ruin locks that normally don't throw up corruption would be able to. 
---
this would increase dps a bit for classes like hunters who aren't supposed to use serpent sting, any class like that that has a decent DoT they don't use that now could
---
wait i thought all alliance were trash quitters and real pvpers played horde anyways
---
Thank you mother
---
I will do that after i finish my av rep grind
---
Same question -- can you show me the specifics? Thanks!
---
I'd be embarrassed if I was that greedy for purples that I'd take an item that is completely useless for my class.
---
yep. they wanted classic, but are now asking for it to be given the same treatment as current wow in upgrading it. So in other words, not classic, the nostalgia goggles have fallen off.
---
You may be correct about that. I'm very geared and play very aggressively. I have 3300 health, 1700 armor, 282 spell power, and 12% crit from gear, with toep. I probably can get away with it a lot easier. My raid gear put me at 431 spell damage, before I got the ice tome, and it was a waste because I'd just RIP aggro of I actually used CD's.
---
Nice try at least
---
Then after 4 weeks they’d be all geared and it would be competing against the B tier guilds  aka easier to get the boss.
---
After he gets to 40% and summons imps, you jump from the tallest point on the usual jump rock to the left corner of the adjacent column. Then you gotta fiddle with LoS a bit until the mobs stop staring and you lose combat. After that, pop a lesser invis and run straight into the cave to mine. 
---
Got the technique from this vid, although I personally do hydrospawn still and take Zevrim to the pool cause you don't risk dying to sacrifice + melee if you keep Shadow Ward up: https://youtu.be/72A2afJ-oak
---
I just can't do this mount since the updated frostwolf mount in WoD was released, cause that one looks amazing and runs nicely.
---
I came here to post this exact comment. \^
---
i mean really only you can answer this for yourself. i grinded to friendly for the xmute recipe (which has become somewhat worthless now for other reasons) and it wasn’t really that bad? ymmv
---
Come on fellas he clearly said “                                                       “.
---
What about a spawn timer but CD on players who have tagged the boss/lockout on a kill for 24 hours?
---
depends. if RNG is with you, or you're just better skilled (assuming fairly equal gear) SM/ruin can and will out dps DS/ruin with nightfall procs
---
if the SM/ruin lock gets 0 or maybe just 1-2 nightfall procs a whole fight, then the DS/ruin lock has a better chance of doing slightly more dps
---
but at that point it literally just comes down to skill/RNG of who gets more sbolt crits
---
basically, both specs are fairly equal, but SM/ruin has a "luck" thing where if you get lots of nightfall procs you'll blow any other lock dps of either spec out of the water. if you don't get a ton, you aren't really gimping yourself a whole lot either.
---
Thank you-- enjoy leveling in phase 3!
---
You certainly can get in with a few friends. Bit of timing, or queue once they know what number they're in. It's harder than it was in vanilla, but not impossible. 
---
And sometimes you even get good teamwork with randoms you meet. Sometimes. Bit of a crap shoot there.
---
Chair smells like lasagne
---
Good question
---
Sure, like thinking up better come backs. Or planting an herb garden. Ya know, whatever.
---
No its like playing skyrim but your only weapon is a wooden spoon the entire game.
---
lol, who hurt you baby? why do you gotta be like this?   
---
Are your parents hitting you at home? Is your stepdad touching you? Did your gf leave you? Well according to your activity and post history I think you don't even have one. Just sad to see you have to dump all your rage into the only community that was ready to accept you.
---
Yes that's correct. It also doesnt stack with shaman's fire resist totem. Was like that in vanilla too.
---

I mean this is a sub about wow and the music has nothing to do with wow...
---
Are you dumb?
---
Don't you love seeing those traitorous fucks in BGs? If they would've suck sound we could've put up a fight in phase 2
---
You can get a 90g epic mount for rank 11?? Holy shit. Who do you trade to buy it from?
---
&gt; And this will work for MOST cases. Every system of punishment comes with false positives and this is no exception (in fact, it's a rather high threshold compared to more concrete determinations that don't involve guessing at motivations).
---
Agreed, although IMO it is beside the point. The point is not to stop every last instance of it ever happening again, the point is to create a detection and punishment for the heavy abusers. There will be very few outliers if we are only targeting heavy/regular abusers.  
---
&gt; The issue here is that the benefits to the punishment are so incredibly small in this case that it's not worth the smallish number of players who would be unjustly punished.  
---
Well I would say that doesn't matter at all in this case. There may be only a few abusers, but they are ruining the gameplay for a large number of others, up to 5-10 people per match it looks like. If matches are only taking 15min then that could be the abuse of hundreds of people per day. This is what warrants the heavy punishment in my eyes.  
---
&gt; The was no 'rule' that you couldn't report someone you believed would afk in the spawn, so punishing people based on that is extremely irresponsible.  
---
That is not at all what is happening here and to claim so is deceptive. At minimum they are submitting false reports that they know are false, that could be considered spamming. On another note they are technically taking advantage of a bug(afk debuff not working properly) to cause an effect that wasn't supposed to happen, that is exploiting plain and simple.
---
Yikes
---
Have you restarted the computer?
---
Lol life really must suck for people who have no free time to do the things they enjoy.
---
&gt; not
---
There is a decently long list of reasons why, but #1 is not being a piece of shit.
---
Whitemane is the comfy boomer server.
---
reported for report abusing
---
Maybe if youre a lazyass. Its cool and all that your geared, but ultimately what you are doing is taking gold from players who arent as geared as you. Those players usually are in the process of gearing and need that gold probably more than you.
---
Fast attacking pets crit more often, but for less damage, it all evens out and doesn't matter. You still aimed shot during rapid fire, it decreases the cast time so it doesn't affect clipping
---
You can, if you can achieve rank 11 which will take way more time than actually farming 900g.
---
Yeah the AV raid chat is the most toxic thing I've seen since playing Classic. I didn't get why people were complaining but now I understand it--and I'm coming from Netherwind PVP.
---
Bless your heart sweaty! Who hurt you??
---
I have none of these and instead get spammed "You are not in a party" (instead of raid).
---
He got the Troll part right when selecting a race....
---
completely wrong. It only stacks a single debuff up to 5. And you need to space out the raids dragonlings so that you can constantly keep up the debuff..
---
This also requires everyone in your raid to be able to use the dragonling, meaning everyone has 300 engineering and all the gold to make it. prolly wont happen honestly.
---
Typical horde
---

Good for everyone but sore losers and those trying to get their "Win AV" quest done.
---
Enjoy your day of stomping in WSG with 1.3k crits
---
Count me as the 7th worrier.
---
That's what I've got. Already got warstrife, but don't want to replace just the one piece, and yeah, the mask keeps eluding me as well. Using Ghostshroud until I get it, and honestly, that's not horrible. Not sweating too much about the perfect gearing is probably for the best anyways. A lot of it gets replaced as you go, so being a couple percent under "optimal" usually doesn't matter much. 
---
There's some virtue to subbing in DPS pieces for aggro on some fights, too. Often there's enough healing that a little extra mitigation largely doesn't matter.
---
I cried :’(
---
Well, you do the content you want to do while you gain experience for it. It's not repetitive if you know what to do. The repetitiveness only starts at a skill level of like 90
---
Out of the ones you have, I only have DBM, and I'm getting the spam. Maybe that's the culprit?
---
as someone who does some aoe strats for bosses like harbinger in MC, as SM/ruin, whos ran with DS/ruin locks of similar gear....the sac imp fire damage bonus isn't all that much for hellfire. IE, my hellfire ticks would do around 235-238 and the guy who was DS that sac'd imp and hellfired had ticks around 245-248. more, sure, but not a reason to go DS/ruin over SM/ruin
---
SM/ruin is actually better for MC imo. so many multidot fights that you can just fish for nightfalls and go absolutely HAM. i mean, it helps if your guild does strats like "MT tanking garr adds and OT tanking garr, burn down garr and then aoe adds with a slight stagger to kills" since you can have a few(3-4) corruptions up and nearly constantly nightfall. or like golemagg when you have both adds tanked next to the boss, can easily have 3 corruptions up with near 100% uptime and get tons of nightfalls
---
actually, my PR for dps/top caster dps that fight and raid was golemagg as SM/ruin at 706 dps, because i kept corruption up well and got decent nightfall procs.
---
There is a pool inside the entrance to ST that also does not obey the normal time schedule for nightfin.
---
Those are the moments healers live for
---
Before classic came out, people were saying similar shit about MC. People were saying how everyone would quit once they realized the amount of work it would take just to get ready for the first raid. Everyone who says stuff like this is looking at the game through how it was 15 years ago when there wasn't thousands of people min maxing. It's just dumb to talk like this at this point.
---
I’m curious as well, but your assumption is backward. Hordes don’t win in 7 mins, and alliance do not win in 17 mins.
---
Every single game that gets dragged out beyond 15 mins hordes will win 9/10. So yea, as alliance, it sucks when you just want it to be over so you can move on to the next game but we get people prolonging that.
---
That gold should be going to nightfalls and thunderfury
---
It’s been 15 years. You think a few more weeks and it will be made?
---
Or queue the last one on the list together at the same time. It should be a fresh av
---
I mean I get your point but I don’t think it would be anywhere close to 4 weeks. I’d guess 6+ months at a minimum. Maybe more if the “A” tier guild does WBs with more than raid. 
---
World bosses are pretty limited for now though. Hopefully it will be different in p3 (p4?) when weve got Kazzak, Azuregos, Emerald Dragons, and Silithus world bosses spawning regularly
---
I mean it’s far from debatable. There are greens more useful for hunters than an on hit axe, so yeah he’s actually an asshat.
---
This subreddit has a disproportionate amount of complaining. The game is great, it's been years and years since an online game held my attention like this.
---
You must have missed the threads where healers were trying to say they should get a crack at choker of the firelord. Far dumber than this.
---
It'll never be quite the same, but you can get somewhat of a fresh feeling by taking a break (I took some 10 years), then rerolling anew without addons, on an RP server for example. Can recommend.
---
World PVP can be a ton of fun and has created the most exhilarating WOW moments for me. That being said, landing at LHC and getting farmed isn't fun. There's way less of it now, and WPVP feels like it did before the honor drop. It's great
---
Nothing like facing edginess with edginess. What a bad ass! /s
---
Cross realm BGS and you can’t queue as even a small group for AV
---
SnD uptime is important, but it's inefficient to blow your first full load on it. 
---
1 combo point is 9 seconds and each additional point only gives you 3 extra seconds - meaning that 2x 1CP SnD is the same as 1x 4CP SnD duration wise. So you're losing out on 2 combo points that you could use on something else. 
---
Ideally you use your opener then SnD at 1 or 2 CP, then build up to a 5 point evis and restart - make sure you're specced 3/3 into the SnD talent. After your first evis, pop Adrenaline rush, and repeat the opening combo while its active.
---
After AR expires, your energy is more scarce and you may need to use a 2 or 3 CP SnD to ensure full uptime while you build the 5 point evis in subsequent combos.
---
the priest talent? what do you mean? locks should be getting that any way lmao unless your guild only has 1 lock or the locks are terrible or something.
---
we typically run 1 spriest a raid anyway and they do great dps because fights are short, so having their bonus shadow damage debuff is rarely an issue for locks
---
https://youtu.be/ZqaCEPwWGtc

"my brother"
---
"9/11/31 or something similar"
---
That is something similar mate
---
We knew for like 6 months BGs wernt going to be cross realm. 
---
And it’s AV. How social are you being with the enemy?
---
These are things you should have complained about months ago. Not after the release.
---
Anyone banned should have their honor rank reset to 0.  Shit like this would not happen as often.
---
What if players tagging a boss had a 16+ hour lockout
---
I wish, oh i wish, abandoning was much, much more brutal and punishing.
---
I don't care about christmas presents, that would just be better than any possible christmas present, a priceless change.
---
I was in an AV earlier with someone from heartseeker who was bragging about his realm being the alliance dominant faction like it was some sort of thing to be proud of and there were tons of people from various different realms all ripping on him and calling him a pve server player/coward. I love how the server culture is playing out. I'd honestly say it seems like people from heartseeker are stigmatized and ripped on even more so than faerlina.
---
I would just stay arms and never respec. Ez clap
---
Does this work?
---
Yup. As an alliance all I do is back cap and save all the towers and even with alliance winning horde end up with ~3500 honor because alliance doesn’t kill galv or the captains
---
I am excited for pantheon rise of the fallen, I also still play classic eq on the p99 blue server.
---
I’m aware yes, nonetheless it’s a good parse even if it’s not the most popular spec
---
For an asshole yeah it's reasonable.
---
How do you leave a battleground? I use /afk now but this cant be the only way.
---
When i click the minimap icon is see the list of players but there aint a leave button, so how do you leave it the proper way?
---
The second rogue definitely could have saved his friend. They had the cc and DPS to stop me from ever moving again, after that blind it should have been gg.
---
Thanks though!

Yup, I made friends and joined a guild in vanilla. I was level 40 or so and got invited to a guild by the guy who I ended up chain running SM with. This time my friends and I started a guild and they all now play 1-2 nights a week and do like 1 dungeon run per night. Half of them aren't 60 yet and I have no one to play with, so I just don't play much anymore.
---
Lock would actually be good, Feral would be playable.
---
I am having a problem after Phase 2.5 where cho rush dont get agroo from my pet
---
I don’t regret letting my sub lapse until BGs came out. It’s better now sure but I wasn’t dealing with the gankfest that happened right after Honor came out. I didn’t really miss out on much and didn’t miss the frustration of trying to do anything out in the world.
---
I remember the original opening when I played on Mannoroth. That shit was insane, could barely log in, if you got to Tanaris you were one of the lucky few. And when you got there, it was rofflestop.exe all day.
---
What is this warlock discord if you don't mind me asking
---
I dont get it
---
So what do you just like sit in IF/Org and spam chat until someones dumb/impatient enough to pay you to do something that other people will do for free. Also just because you're geared doesn't mean you're good. Worst tank I've ever seen was in almost full t1 gear. Dude sucked FAT ballsack and was a complete douche. Seems to be a common theme amongst these people who think they're so good that they deserve payment for being in a group.
---
Did the same thing.. It was not worth the time and frustrations to level in 50+ zones for a few weeks.. Now im level 56 grinding AV, and leveling up by doing all the quests
---
That’s a really good question and an awesome way to grab extra health and damage. Smart thinking. If no one knows, we could test it in AV because the bosses are immune. For some reason, I think that I’ve seen the icon show up on them or the masters.
---
Warriors parses are inflated because they rotate which bosses they pop reck on every week
---
How can I maximize rep gain? I don't really care about honor.
---
It’s only going to Get worse for horde since right now everyone and their mother on ally is doing av. 
---
The pop differences are skewed to horde by a bunch
---
Totally respect that viewpoint/strategy, and grats on being next in line for the Mageblade!
---
With the honored discount and the rank 3 discount it is 800g for epic mount, both give 10%, dunno what rank you have but maybe u already can afford it?
---
Unfortunately, I can't get to a calculator from work.   I'll do my best to remember when I get home tonight.
---
When I run instances as a lock, I'm very rarely able to loot corpses, are people running looting macros on the regular?  I'm far from the frontline so maybe they loot it before I get there.  Just wondering if I'm missing something.
---
I’m exalted and I work full time. Though I had Wednesday Thursday off and I no loved till my poop buckets were full.  But for real don’t recommend. I literally did nothing but play wow and sleep. For two days and it hurts my soul.
---
I'd be embarrassed if I was that greedy for purples that I'd take an item that is useless for me from others who legitimately need it.
---
Hes talking about solo farming zf gy
---
I totally get it. But a lot of the honor efficiency folks were also reporting people that wanted to play their own way and they continue to complain about actual fleshed out games instead of their quick 7 min wins or losses.
---
Doesn't need to use bags anymore?
---
Personally I prefer it the other way around, which is why I like Path of Exile so much. I could do everything at my own pace. In WoW, I’d like to run some dungeons over and over but it gets too hard to get a group going. Maybe that’s why I made a lock alt because he can solo DM East.
---
well that simply isn't true from my experience.
---
couple gys and bunkers are usually capped before drek goes down.

You seem angry. Perhaps come down a little bit? You assume quite much. I wish you a happy weekend

'Everyone wants to be most efficient. It's how humans are'. You act like everyone agrees on what efficiency is, and that our goals are all the same, and you contradict that in your reply to me.  This sounds pretty boring to me if it were true.  If my goal is to have fun in the game then the most efficient thing for me to do is ignore people who aren't having fun (including their decision to complain about people who aren't playing the game the way they think it should be played).  Admit that you aren't the only one playing the game who's opinions matter and then I will validate the rest of your comment.  Otherwise, I don't want to play with people like that, and will ignore your opinions in game and play the the way I want, as it's an MMORPG where both things can occur.  I've played your style and been at the forefront of most of the earliest content in the game 15+ yrs ago and I'm bored with that play style, and don't have the time or energy to maintain it.  You will be eventually also most likely.  You can't maintain 'most efficient' forever, and eventually will realize how draining and less rewarding that is than taking time to enjoy things that are enjoyable rather than having some medal of accomplishment that only allows a good feeling for so long, until everyone has it and you have some new unobtainium to conquer.  And in your process, towards the end, you will get bored *a lot* and other people's opinions that threaten yours will all of a sudden make you seem very hostile for no reason.  Sorry if you can't understand yet that this is possible.  Hope it makes sense eventually.
---
Is there a way to maximize rep gain while losing?
---
On our server, we have 1 guild that has about 8 raid teams and a coalition of others working together (usually about 2-3 raid worth assemble each world boss). They’d just rotate people out of the raid with the tag to open up more loot availability.
---
Granted, the world pvp over these bosses would increase and be fun, assuming the other side doesn’t just sit there and watch.
---
I'm not saying it's good that it's like this - IMO it'd be better game design to have the best pvp rewards in the game come from doing pvp content.
---
My statement was that from the perspective of rankers, AV is a win-win situation, as opposed to WSG where a premade v premade situation is always a loss that should be avoided. even if you win it's still shit honor.
---
8h a day of compulsively playing a game is barely a hobby but keep lying to yourself
---
Deviate Delight REP HARD!
---
I guess you could call it that, though I'm more frost heavy than most builds I've seen posted. I use [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/-055212000302-05250231102051301) spec right now. It's not ideal for many situations, but it's the best dungeon farming spec I'm aware of and still allows me to be successful in AV. I would not recommend it for small-group PvP or raiding, but it can do everything else very well.
---
Hey, BRD trash farm till 56. 3 mages holy pal and then I dual box my raid tank pull 5 packs drop group on him tag mobs with mages and then the exp isn’t filmed by my tank. All that exp split four ways
---
With respect, I disagree.  AV really isn't designed for individual or even small scale PVP.  It's not really designed for PVP at all unless you're a mage or warlock and can AOE 10 guys at once.
---
For pure PvP, give me Arathi Basin - it's the only one of the 3 original BGs that you literally can't win without being able to win individual or small-scale pvp battles.
---
Thank whatever guild is carrying your ass.

I finished my grind yesterday around 8pm. Got my wolf, and was so excited for my first epic mount I ran in circles outside the alterac tunnel for like 10 minutes straight lol. 
---
That grind was painful when you would hit a stretch of 10 losses and get like 3k rep in 3 hours. Then you'd win a couple, go up 2k in rep in less than an hour and feel like things were going forward finally lol. Then the losses start happening again. Feel like the horde finally started to figure out winning is good after about 48 hours of 90% losses...
---
&gt;  joined 10 days ago
---
&gt; ...I will get nothing
---
Dude, time for a wake up call.  Very little loot drops in classic raids for a huge 40 man size.  Very little.  It takes MONTHS to gear people up.  Even raids who started in the first two weeks of classic are very unlikely to be fully geared for BWL when it comes soon.  
---
You're not going to get anything your first raid to two in anything but a pug roll off, and that takes luck.  And it also places you in a bad spot if you want to move on to future content.  Once BWL comes out it won't be quite as easy to just join a rando PUG and full clear, you're better off in a guild with a closed raid with a group of regulars.  It will be even MORE important for later content when pugs are more or less untenable.
---
Then u so same thing with LBRS orcs until u get to ogres and then reset
---
&gt; Warriors get 145% modifier on everything they do plus heroic strike has a flat threat modifier.
---
Yes, that's why they fall behind.
---
Defensive stance is 145% threat, and heroic strike has a _flat_ threat modifier.
---
Bear form is 145% threat, and maul has a _scaling_ threat modifier (175%, combined multiplicatively with the 145%).
---
World PvP =/ griefing
---
Yeah pug’s are not that organized :b
---
lol, let us be honest people who do this shit usually not going to post this by themselves.
---
I've tried to tell people this but the response is always something like "60%ers GTFO, go farm a mount fucking noob"...
---
I'm glad I didn't post this from one of my moral baitposting accounts xD
---
You know that split second of stutter after you accept First available on the queue window? It’s up before that’s over.
---
Thank youuuuu
---
Yeah pretty much :b but even without trap puh people can be lured close enough in most cases
---
There was an addon for it at least as early as Burning Crusade. It wasn't 100% reliable (I'm not sure how it worked--maybe by simply timing the queue), but if the AV doesn't pop for all the players in your raid then you just drop queue and try again.
---
Making up for pre-BG phase 2.
---
you have no idea how true this statement is.
---
You want to fix AV afk? 
---
1) don't allow marshal / warlords to be kited out while drek and van reset. They should chain too.
---
2) bring back 1.5 buffs they give, so you are obligated to take towers and graveyards and engage in the content.
---
People will still AFK. At least the BG will go on long enough for them to be noticed and reported while others gain honor.
---
EZ PZ rekt git gud GG no re thx rito
---
It just requires exalted with Frostwolf. You don’t need any rank.
---
The tanks died at the end because you’re Druid heals tho
---
Yeah, almost every spec has an interrupt (except locks, unless they choose the felhunter pet), but most ranged have a 45-60 second cd on theirs. Dungeons are designed around everyone having a 15 second cd in order to kick all the important casts. Which means you pretty much have to either stick to easy keys or run triple melee. Ele is the only exception.
---
&gt;World PVP is entirely gank fests where people camp flight paths and dungeon entrances 40v1.
---
hol up, this was a problem because of megaservers (a change!).  the vanilla-sized realms in classic were the perfect game experience after day 1 wpvp.
---
That’s a genius way to get prio on loot. Just kidding. Having WoW around through hard times helps give the mind a break. Awesome move man
---
I'm sorry is there skill in zerg rushing pve mobs and losing without any sort of pushback? 
---
lol what
---
I hit exalted the second day so I don't care about rep but actually fighting the alliance and winning is way more fun than rushing a group of bosses who are just high hp mobs
---
Gold per hour is 30g at best if you factor in time to reset and occasional vanish failures.
---
You gotta kill both pyromancer and plugger.
---
I use Shift+ scroll up/down for zooming. Was a minimal transition. Also my scroll down is bound to pet passive instead of pet follow. Helps a lot for like dm n solo tributes
---
You can only loot a corpse when it's your turn to do so in a group. You don't get to loot every corpse.
---
I guarantee it will happen. Nothing is forcing the #nochangers to do c'thun or even twin emperors. They will just farm the rest of AQ until Naxx comes out.
---
&gt;	Your pet does like 30% of your damage
---
I tried 20/31/0 (max pet dmg) and it still only does ~13% with full uptime on MC bosses. It’s never been anywhere close to 15, let alone 30.
---
^ This is true, the only things separating one spec from another in tanking is how well they can mitigate damage and hold aggro.
---
Oh it,s one at a time, nice, I thought it was random.  Thanks!
---
I blame a lack of sleep for my inability to read, Spell Power is certainly not Spirit, thanks for catching that.   
---
I wasn't being defensive at all, you're reading into things too much.
---
Guess I'm a greedy bastard, I was under the impression my turn didn't come very often.
---
I have a solution for you.  Grind AV, get glacial blade/electrified dagger and then lobo.  Run a 16/12/23 dagger spec with imp. sprint/prep.  It has everything you need for both PVP and pickpocket runs.
---
Do hunters even get cheetah at that lvl? Can some on confirm?
---
I disagree. This happened because world PVP was released without BGs (just like in actual vanilla). The same thing would happen even if the servers were normal sized.
---
He probably was having a ruff day
---
Yeah I think I'll start looking for BRD groups etc and start gearing up while leveling so when I hit 60 I'm not so far behind in the gear department.
---
I always try and blow up a priest with cold blood as everyone is passing eachother on the field of strife 
---
seeing like 20 alliance dismount for little ol me is hilarious tho
---
I would rather just let the alliance win, get around 2400-3400 honor in 7-10 minutes. 5500 honor in 48 minutes? yikes
---
Perhaps you could blame your lack of sleep for sounding defensive when you don't mean to?
---
I started to understand the issue behind this mentality shift once I started playing D&amp;D.
---
MMO's give very little reward for enjoying the journey. In D&amp;D, you sometimes play the game without even knowing whether or not you will be there to see the ending. The hype in playing comes from the moment you are currently experiencing. 
---
Everything about MMO's is focused on getting to end game quicker, and even once you get to the end game, the grindfest never ceases to exist. There is always better level gear you can get or different playstyles that have been discovered to produce slightly more DPS than before. Unless you are at the forefront of theorycrafting different builds, you're just another machine reproducing someone else's work by hitting a series of keys on a keyboard slightly better than you did before. Finally, once you reach the summit of all the grinding, you find that the top of the mountain isn't any different than it's base.
---
Long post can be summed up with this:
---
Alliance Races for easy wins.
---
Horde starts with different strategies because they can't win a race.
---
Alliance has not tried to alter their basic plan other than which side of Belinda to race by.  
---
Horde adapts strategies further and is winning more.
---
Alliance still trying to race.
---
His post was also obsolete by the time he finished typing it out.  Horde are adapting yet again and soon the alliance will have to get off their mounts and actually pvp.
---
\&gt;Chills
---
Druid cat form 30%
---
Game over man, game the fuck over.
---
2 friends and I grouped with 4 or 5 other people to make a new guild september 10th at level 34. Our first raid was october 27th. We are on MC farm now with 35+ and a 20 geared core. I think getting leveling players and hosting pugs will get people to join if you're social and non toxic. Don't make it sweaty, make it chill. 
---
All of our core joined up as noobs who were almost 60 and our first raid was awful we didnt clear 1 boss but everyone stayed positive and we all learned together and we have come a long way. Progression guilds builds a strong tie to their fellow raiders.
---
Do not be afraid to teach a noob the ropes constructively. We have found these people to be extremely dedicated when you give them a chance to improve and show their potential.
---
Do not tolerate toxicity and keep the whole environment positive. Make sure your public image is good as well, it sounds stupid but it matters especially during recruitment.
---
They would have fel dom to insta summon and talents in the decreased overall summoning which once the fight is over they would have time to resummon and sac succubus
---
60% of the time .... works every time
---
Not that I know of yet. I’m hopeful of this adaption as I did enjoy the new Bladerunner this director did - the visuals and color palettes were absolutely next level. Maybe they’ll get the story closer than Lynch this time
---
Ah man I could never give up my scrolly zoom. Do you use a multi-button mouse? I just have pet attack/passive on my mouse buttons.
---
I encourage all alliance members to /spit on heartseeker alliance in bg's.
---
-Stalagg Alliance Player
---
Uhm... Okay :/
---
but then again any class can be good with a pocket healer.
---
You must be Alliance, because the Horde queues prevent us from playing with friends in AV.
---
Yeah, that's wpvp. Those numbers will increase after BG boredom.
---
More servers would lessen the severity of the problem simply by having players spread out. It would increase the chance of low pop servers with high horde:alliance ratios and vice versa which could be merged together to even out the difference. Instead, what you have now is a handful of servers with MASSIVE populations with imbalances that can't be easily addressed now. Now, the servers that are dying don't have additional servers that they could have potentially merged with to fix their imbalai. 
---
Admittedly it would still be a problem. Higher number of servers at launch wouldn't necessarily fix the imbalance issue, but it would have helped with a myriad of other issues. IMO the best action to fix the imbalances would be with faction-locked server transfers (which Blizz botched from the start).
---
You came to the wrong neighborhood, heretic.
---
I dont see how people dont understand this concept.
---
Not *learned* so much as *decided* to use my big coc for profit.
---
back in the day we would start with 1337 or 420
---
yeah you know those guy are gonna dodge when things get tough
---
oh for sure, i've just seen people see like a 94 parse on ele sham and think its some crazy dps or something not knowing parse = dps, and when pointed out the dps was like 224 they understood
---
The improved stun is nice for leveling too because a baseline bash is just a tiny bit too short to land a regrowth.
---
Took me over 80 runs to get mine, and I am not going to lie this pic made me cry irl.
---
That has nothing to do with being a nochanger and everything to do with being incapable of clearing the raid.  Anyway, didnt you say the raids were EZ mode and would be cleared by non 60s in green's?  Which is it?  You seem to be confused about your own points.
---
Also FWIW,  there were plenty of guilds in vanilla that couldn't kill cthun and just farmed the other bosses until Naxx launched.  So I'm not sure what you are trying to prove by bringing that point up.
---
From what I Remember gw2 did a good job of presenting quests as well. always knew why I was doing what I was doing and was also excited to see what the loot would be
---
you neither tanking nor healing tho.
---
also, that odd moment when the fury-prot tank outdps you too...
---
Nice
---
AP is a meme spec. It's really only good for raiding. You can go dungeons with it but you'll die a lot more and be less useful.
---
[managed this the other day. first and only time sonfsr getting him summoned.](https://youtu.be/kvVtj_TdCN0)
---
hum.. 500dps on single target stuff like mag or golemagg isn't even top 10%...
---
It's not honor wpvp people care about. It's ruining your time lvling and farming.
---
Bear Cleave SWIPE!
---
Did he know what he was doing?  Or was he clueless thinking "it's purple and I can use it?"
---
&gt; The point is not to stop every last instance of it ever happening again, the point is to create a detection and punishment for the heavy abusers.
---
A false positive means that you identified someone as an offender who isn't. The concern isn't that you'll miss players who need to be banned, it's that you'll ban players who don't deserve it.
---
&gt; At minimum they are submitting false reports that they know are false
---
You do not know this, this is speculation. While many of the people you punish this way will have been abusers, there are people who reported afk in the spawn who had no intention to abuse and you're screwing those people over for a bad reason.
---
&gt; There may be only a few abusers, but they are ruining the gameplay for a large number of others, up to 5-10 people per match it looks like.
---
No, they aren't because Blizzard implemented longer afk times which is a MUCH BETTER SOLUTION than banning accounts for this problem.
---
Pretty much everyone except Priests (because of Benediction/Anathema) want something from AV Exalted.
---
You can upgrade if you don't need the gold, but for AOE during lvling always use rank1 or it will mess up the "rotation" a lot. There is a big difference in mana cost :)
---
I’m sorry but I have to chime in and say 19 hunter is literally, without exaggeration, the most boring thing you can play in this game. You will not do anything except auto attack and concussive shot, with the occasional serpent sting on rogues. 
---
There is nothing even remotely engaging about the gameplay
---
Oof.. That's gonna be a big YIKES from me, sweaty! Oh you sweet summer child. Let's just walk all this back right now and figure out who hurt you!?
---
yea i knew about priests but wasn’t sure if there were any other classes :)
---
&gt; Ruined by the players rushing to 60 and primarily rolling AOE spell cleave farm classes.
---
How is other people's leveling speed and strategy ruining anyone else's leveling experience? We have (casual) members in our guild who are still leveling and they seem to be enjoying themselves. As a healing Priest, I've ran with my fair share of AoE farm groups, but still quested a lot and generally had a blast while leveling.
---
&gt; Easy mode raids with no mechanics that are cleared by non 60 players in greens
---
Again, how is other people's performance affecting everyone else's. I was clearing MC with a guild 3 months ago, then a RL friend asked me to join his guild 2 months ago, we transferred to a new server with about 20 people, merged with a guild there, recruited some more and are so casual we're still only 9/10 in MC, yet we're still having fun.
---
&gt; World PVP is entirely gank fests where people camp flight paths and dungeon entrances 40v1.
---
While it's true some servers are so imbalanced that people have to corpse-run into instances and raids, there are plenty of servers where that's not the case and that doesn't prevent people from having genuinely interesting PvP interactions, too.
---
&gt; AV last 7 minutes now and no PVP takes place. If people force PVP, half the raid leaves.
---
I've been in plenty of AVs that didn't last only 7 minutes and where there was actual PvP.
---
You're basically seeing the glass half-empty. You simply focus on every negative experience you can (really, why do you care how other people level?!, you do you, let them do them), while apparently ignoring the fact that it's not all there is to the game.
---
Furthermore, you provide zero constructive criticism, you just whine, whine, whine. People like you are the problem with this game, as far as I'm concerned.
---
Classic isn't for everyone, maybe it's simply not for you. Maybe you'll have more fun if you go back to retail. Give it a try...
---
Sure it does. It is showing yet another unintended consequence of classic. If C'Thun is really as hard as people say, people will just skip it because it isn't efficient. If it is super easy, people will down it without any effort. Either way, it shows a clear flaw with classic raiding.
---
Loved your book, it's sitting on my shelf next to the three wow Chronicles and every collector's edition since 2004 :D
---
The way I figure it works is that the list is sorted by create date.  Therefore the last one in the list is the oldest, and is about to end and be recycled.
---
I mean, I wouldn't do scholo if I wasn't going to get shit from it, its a very entitled attitude you have toward people who have worked for what they have. Its easy, you pay me gold, if you don't other group will. If you want people to do shitty boring content like dungeons they already did, give them a reason to.
---
I only see bad hordes losing every game. Dunno what you are talking about. &lt;3
---
Why'd they do that
---
1800?  Na bro, its 2200 chain + 1400 shock.  Need all of those 30 seconds of res timer to find that melted face.
---
This made me laugh so loud, i ran 3 warlocks a hunter and priest in sm cath, we all just changed aggro in the giant open areas. Would love to see a raid done like this
---
I've only have problems on my mage if they were orange or higher. Same level or two levels higher even has been fine thus far and my mage is 40, he's probably just not maxing out range/positioning the blizzard correctly
---
Ah yes I am sure the first time you did something like that you just sat there all stone faced. Real tough men like you and me don't share emotions!
---
I would quit all gaming forever if I could have a dedicated good group for D&amp;D or boardgames on standby for whenever I felt like it.
---
How would having a shammy tank slow the raids dps by so much that it doubles the run time?
---
I would hope you’d get an AV token for the loss, at least. Haha.
---
Honestly the winter event in retail was pretty fun to re live. People dont zerg there and actually pvp
---
Roflface? Is still 2012?
---
There are some ranking points, but I have no idea how they are calculated. My honorSpy says that I the reset is right now, I will get Rank 3 at 25%. Not sure how accurate is. The question is how far should I push?
---
You want a BiS AV strat. Ok here goes
---
1. Enter and ask lead to set loot to FFA for "quest turn ins"
---
2. Farm rams they drop BoEs trash gray items and ram hides a "quest item"
---
3. You win or lose and make gold profit based on how much your farmed. ( got one travels backpage instant looted) (remember loot FFA)
---
4. If its a real turtle turn in ram hides and convince someone to go tame 25 wolves. 
---
5. Summon 10 wolf riders for bonus rep and honor.
---
Darnassus is a great city. When I played retail on and off before starting Classic, I played an alliance Hunter and stayed in Darnassus for as long as I could just because of how serene it is. By contrast, I'm playing Horde now in Classic and the cities/areas are not nearly as nice. I think this is a known thing in WoW.
---
No, for one boss they can pull ungodly insane over the top impossible to replicate tps. For the rest they just do more.
---
No, we are alliance in a PvE server. I don’t know what barrens char is.
---
The why have I just hit revered?
---
No idea why people voted you down for this 
---
ZT has ally majority- I love it though
---
Have I totally screwed myself for going Troll over Orc? My guild want me to go Fury dps.
---
Fuck minmaxers they’re viable all the way through naxx, and are broken in BC. Naxx isn’t nearly as hard as  the tryhards claim it is
---
Can anyone in this thread explain to me why everyone’s saying a shaman MT reduces everyone else’s dps by so much that the entire raids time is increased?
---
Yea.... hes not complaining about barrens chat.
---
Reddit DEF does not represent the wider wow community. 400k members sure but only 6-10k on at any one time. That only represents like 10% of people who actually play the game. Most ppl who play aren’t even on this sub that much or don’t even comment on things. What you saw was probably the worst of the community who bothers writing anything on this subreddit. 
---
You do u guys! Fuk the haters. Enjoy your game!
---
It's not abusing, he'd be using the report system exactly how it's meant to be used.
---
What im saying is; if you have no reason to do that content then dont? Just speaking for all the people that are still gearing or trying to make some gold for epic mount. Its not entitled to think that people who arent as far into the game as you, for whatever reason, shouldnt have to pay people for their time. Hindering the progress they're trying to make. Whether its for an epic mount or whatever. Seems a bit entitled to take money from people who also need it probably more than you. If you're geared. Go farm. Sell profession services. Theres more ways to make money other than doing content you hate doing so much.
---
Not sure if anyone knows right now since this meta is beyond broken
---
And I would rather battle in battle grounds and not let the enemy win.
---
Undead are the coolest-looking race in the game full stop.
---
Honestly kind of a weird way to spell Derek.
---
Fuck that.  I have to be nice to people irl.  The internet is where I come to be a dickhead with no consequence and I wont let you take that away from me.
---
And those that saw the writing on the wall went to kromcrush to avoid them both.
---
I have more free time than most people my age tbh, but unless you inherited a shit ton of money or bought Amazon stock in the 90s an entire day to just play video games is a rare luxury in your 30s.  And I say that being childfree,  add kids to the equation and it's damn near criminal to play wow all day.
---
It’s a 15 year old game are you suggesting these are all new players? LOL
---
It's honestly not that bad when it turtles if you don't get super frustrated about items haha. Last night both sides dicked around until we summoned Ivus, way more epic and hilarious than min/maxing drek in 3 minutes.
---
They get it at 20
---
There's really no 100% in fishing, unless you're fishing pools. You're *most likely* to catch nightfin between midnight and 6am, but it's not guaranteed. As you noted though, you have a 0% chance to catch Sunscale Salmon at that time.
---
There are [four fishing time periods](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/fishing-classic-wow-1-300#fish-available-at-different-times) which influence which fish you can catch.
---
Hey world, you're welcome for saving your asses again in dubbya dubbya II. We are 2-0 in world wars, and we'll use any damn system we want. We measure our dicks in feet, we measure our women in pounds, and we measure our beers in ounces. 'Merica... fuck yeah.
---
Highest you can get the first week is rank 4. You won't even be close to that though. With 500k you might get to 3, but I wouldn't put much money on it.
---
Depends on who you are. But I'm rather right/real than nice. Some people like that.
---
&gt; The heroic strike modifier scales with d stance and defiance.
---
Yes, so does maul. But heroic strike's bonus threat is just a flat 145. Not 145%, 145 points. That gets modified by defensive stance/defiance to 210 points.
---
Maul's bonus threat is 175%. And that combines with bear form to 254%.
---
So, for example, let's say that maul and heroic strike both hit for 700 points of damage. (In practice maul usually hits harder, but let's be generous to heroic strike.)
---
After modifiers, A 700-point heroic strike generates 1,225 threat. A 700-point maul generates 1,776 threat. 
---
And since maul's threat modifier scales, this only pulls further ahead as gear gets better and damage output increases. For 1000 points of damage, heroic strike generates 1,660 threat, and maul generates 2,538. And so on.
---
Get off this sub. If you are not min/maxing or complaining, there’s no use for you on this sub. Just play the game. Have fun. Put the blinders on, and go at your own pace, takes long time to get 60 if you’re casual, long time to get to the point where most people are(then perhaps you be jaded as well)
---
Agreed. If I wanted to roll healer on Ally, I'd go Druid or Paladin just so I could play without feeling gimpy for not picking Dwarf.
---
Original comment was misleading. I tried other mmos after cata  before I gave them up.
---
SAVE US IVUS!
---
Yeah
---
First day average (9 hours of just queueing):
---
AV: 8½ min
---
WSG: 11½ min
---
&gt; Uhm... Okay :/
---
how is that "real" or "right"? You already were trying to put them down, then they gave you an answer and you felt responding with this?
---
Less threat = DPS have to hold back.
---
You can get a maximum of 13000 RP per week depending on your standing. I think from 1-3 is 5k total, and every rank increase after 3 requires 5k RP to complete the bar
---
Keyword consistent. Almost every class has that specific fight they do incredibly well on.
---
Gotta be a heartseeker, herod, or faerlina player lol
---
&gt;I would argue Thick Hide is required for good Bear play.  As druids have no parry or block,  our only real mitigation comes from armor and a bit of dodge,  this maxing out our armor is of upmost importance.
---
Completely  unimportant in dungeons.. healers that are not specced into healing can hold up a druid tank not specced into tanking. I literally tanked UBRS as a 60 resto druid with a 58 shadow priest and a 57 farel druid healing me... Damage mitigation is not an issue with proper play and itemiziation. Threat however is!! The less of the above talents you take the harder it is to do your job at making targets stick to you.
---
He’ll yeah I got 5 black lotus in a row this AM
---
&gt; A false positive means that you identified someone as an offender who isn't. The concern isn't that you'll miss players who need to be banned, it's that you'll ban players who don't deserve it.
---
I know what a false positive means. I  also addressed this. That is not a legitimate concern here due to the nature of the exploit. It is not random individuals harassing other individuals which would be much harder to determine, it is guilds that are booting everyone who isn't in their guild until the raid has all their guildies in it. Since that cannot be accomplished without regular and repeated mass afk reporting by an organized group, it is VERY easy to determine versus the average player. There would be nearly zero false positives.  
---
&gt; You do not know this, this is speculation.  
---
We talked about this as well. It would be speculation if it was based on one individual instance, but it it's not. These behaviors(same as all ban-worthy behaviors), are based on the behavioral history of the player which is easy to determine from the logs. It is pretty rare that a player will catch a ban over a single instance, even if that one instance was obviously abuse. We have seen a history of that as well, so crying over 'all the innocents that will get banned' is pretty ridiculous. 
---
&gt; While many of the people you punish this way will have been abusers, there are people who reported afk in the spawn who had no intention to abuse and you're screwing those people over for a bad reason.  
---
Why would you assume that these people would ever catch a ban at all? There are multiple metrics available to separate the people properly using the system from the people abusing it and I listed several of those data points which would easily cover this situation.
---
Thanks for making all the legends. BlackRock Depths was, and is, the most immersive place I've ever been in any game. I heard your interview on a podcast and was just spellbound.   
---
Thanks
---
Same chance of rolling that 1 as any other number right?
---
I like you.
---
sometimes people have friends and laugh... you wouldnt understand
---
It’s more like the alliance has doubt on this strategy, some people believe this strategy is not working any more. That’s why I am writing a fucking essay to discuss the points where we can improve. I mean you have to believe in the strategy to make it work.
---
It's almost as if the game encourages networking and fostering connections with people to get things done. Sounds terrible./s
---
Dude if you haven't played them I would also recommend Oblivion and Morrowind. They're a bit dated, especially Morrowind, but I find them to be way more immersive than Skyrim
---
I saw a druid insta shift from travel form to travel form to break out of Nova, like he didn't get into humanoid form at all. How does one do that?
---
hey man, wish you good luck then! 
---
"MH CHT wasn't bad at all as far as numbers go, crit ambush/backstabs were barely noticeable!"
---
what do you mean with "barely noticeable" in that context?
---
Also, you should almost never be using arcane shot. It is actually better to wait for another auto shot to go off and cast aimed shot then to use arcane shot to try to not clip. The only time you should use arcane shot in a raid is (1) if the fight mechanics will interrupt your cast such as being 1-2 second out from a fear on onyxia, (2) you are being charged by an enemy such as a surger trash fight in MC, or (3) you HAVE to run for the next 3 or more seconds such as you are the bomb during the far fight.
---
Lol "Worked for what they have"..... just means they can just play the game more. Wouldn't call playing wow "work"... work obligations are a common reason a lot of people cant play as much as you.
---
Pretty sure it gives the rep to everybody in the BG, you want people to know this.
---
Still a mix
---
Thx!
---
Ridiculous post.
---
The fact is many of the changes that happened to world of warcraft over the years have been for the better. The reason people kept playing the game into BC and WOTLK was because they started to make the kind of changes you're talking about as a negative.
---
Arthas was the best pvp in the world
---
Got to play with Pat, Maydie, roguezeroskill/Mute, hulksmash, castorius, ioneye  and bunch more known pvpers.
---
lol this is also one of the greatest private server warrior players of all time. But, sure, believe that you could do this too if you want
---
Ok boomer, whatever you say.
---
Btw, I was master on Korea in Hots, but abandon it in Lotv for lag issues.
---
Yes. Spamming shadowbolt as SM Ruin or Demonic Sac would still greatly outdps someone putting up dots and drain life.
---
Rank 4. You can find it broken down online but rank 4 is placed at 10k RP. Rank 5 at 15k RP and so on in 5k increments. It's only possible to get 13k RP maximum per week (you need to be like top 3 in standings for that)
---
MOM, BATHROOM BATHROOM
---
You are not in a raid group.
---
Managed to win one last night, I think we were about 10-15 people doing defense. I did die a lot but the allys never got through to drek :D
---
Gatherer will give you a "you are not in a party" message every few seconds.
---
Yep.  Yesterday I took off because horde decided to pull winning streaks and each one took as long as three losses.  I quit after a 45 min match.  Fuck that noise.
---
Lol there's a video from like 2007 of people doing this, and it happened on pservers constantly. This would be like me putting up a video of wiping Ally at drek, or a video of me breathing and saying "WOW CAN YOU BELIEVE IT I JUST BREATHED".
---
You're
---
RIP.
---
Oh well at least I have cool face paint.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Not everyone has to work 5 days a week. I honestly wish my friends had half as much free time as I do. Instead most of them work nearly twice as much for maybe half the income. One day out of the week when I have multiple days off isn’t much, so I think it’s hilarious that you guys think one day equals spending all my free time on WoW, especially since I probably play less overall than most.
---
Sick burn
---
This literally happens in every av as a mage, chumps didn't even use invis pots they just corpse walked like casuals rofl
---
Yes.
---
I mean it wasnt that had unless i imagine you were on a really unbalanced server.
---
&gt;Once I was done with retail during cata, I couldn't find anything else. 
---
Presumably he was looking for other MMOs once he was done with cata. No gap here.
---
Yeah this is 100% accurate. They end fast cool, but in the off chance anything happens on the alliance side and they don’t Zerg win in 10 minutes. It’s gonna be a 150 rep 400 honor 25 minute game for the alliance
---
Bind it to your scrollwheel + a modifier. Personally use shift+scroll up for bear, shift+scroll down for travel etc. etc.
---
Always happy to help! My hunter just got to 21 so it happened to be something I knew for sure, which is rare enough
---
Sounds like a very self centered thing, to only be concerned about your local reputation, maybe don't sign up for PVP if you're not going to PVP
---
Rank 4, you need to consistently week after week remain in the to n% to rank up each week, multiple rank ups per week past rank 4 are basically impossible.

---
Raid frames replace spot of Spy when in I'm in raid.
---
As a Herod player this makes me sad to hear
---
Nah, unless you're full tryhard and competing for world record times, your race doesn't matter *that* much in pve as a warrior. You'll have a slight dps disadvantage compared to orc fury warriors but not a huge amount, and stuff like paying attention better than them or using more consumables can easily make up for it if you're concerned about meters.
---
lmao
---
If Alliance have RH and FW GY, horde that die in base spawn in the tunnel.
---
You can’t really expect the hardcore players will be babysitting you for everything, can you? Sometimes you need to figure where did it go wrong and be a “hardcore” yourself.
---
The accuracy is absolutely insane
---
Thats an interesting one. Are those the raid frames in the bottom center and the skills off to the side? Seems really good for healing. I like this one a lot. Its unique. Always good to be unique :)
---
Thanks for responding.
---
Why the inclusion of FD, I've never had issues with peeling a boss - I assume the auto shot -&gt; multishot opener is so explosive I might need it?
---
Can you post your talent build please.
---
It is tough to compete in AV as far as zerging goes.  100% ally weighted, but honestly the P2 shit we went through is paying off.  This is my first ally toon and I'm feeling kind of (very little) guilty in AV but damn it feels good.
---
Horde queue times are around 10 minutes
---
my server was normal sized tho, and it was pretty great
---
we still had a couple raids at brm, but everywhere else in the world the most running around was usually 10, tons of groups 1-3
---
This sounds like a problem for some servers, but it's not universal.
---
Devilsaur leather is 5g ea on my server. Black lotuses, 20g. There's not a ridiculous amount of demand, even though the populations are much higher. If spawns were increased, it would just tank the economy further.
---
Darkshire
---
The blood and scraps are 10 org rep / 1 Frostwolf rep, the flesh is for wing commanders, and they are like 5 frostwolf rep per turn in.
---
Grinding turn ins for AV rep isn't very efficient.
---
But, if that is what you want to do in a game, go ahead, have fun.
---
All of this is just bs. 
---
The question is do you have fun? 
---
And some people feel pulled into a playstyle that is not fun to them and some even  feel like other players force them to play in a way that is not fun to them. 
---
The question to blizzard is "how do your design design facilitate these different approaches to the game." 
---
If players have to decide to play optimally or play for fun there is a problem in the design. How large the problem or how big the price is to fix it is another question
---
If 60% mount people actually stay together, they actually can stop and fight the 5 - 10 horde there picking them off, and should.  Fight takes 1-3 mins, mount up and rejoin the zerg.  There is no reasonable scenario where the horde cannot send 5-10 people to slow the 60% club, and promoting them to stay on their mounts and not fight just makes the horde strat more successful.  If the 60% mount club fights back, the horde have to send more back, which then buys the main group more time to finish rush.

If 10-15 people focus on holding relief hut, the rest of Alliance can kill galv and all the other honor giving npcs on the way to the base.  they get there about the same time as the RH GY cap, and can still win the pve race, though it is not as high % win rate, it is more honor.  When this is done right, it perpetuates the 'greedy' strat because who wouldn't want to win with more, which then continues the drek/galv debate @ the start of every match, typically dooming either because both strats need most of the 40 people to be on the same page.
---
Taking the FY GY is bad unless you are in a slow moving turtle towards their base.  Do not do it.  On this, we can agree.
---
Took me 71 runs, 50 of them I was the only one who needed it but it just never dropped. Hope you have better luck than me
---
I wont be flag carrying for you, just fyi.
---
Because a shaman generates less threat than a warrior, meaning that the dps have to hold back so they don't draw aggro. In the long run that will increase clear times.
---
... man, I'm sorry you raid with such shitty DPSer.
---
Yes I know, you still clear MC. it's clearable by monkeys.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000#boss=670
---
feel free to scroll to other bosses.
---
500 dps is the top 25% for war/rogue from lucifron to domo.
---
now keep in mind those statistic include the mouthbreathers, people who refuse to AoE, people who die in the first 10 seconds, guild who don't let melee attack shazzrah and so on.
---
This is an insta queue privileged only.
---
8 minute queues kill this :(
---
&gt;Then after 4 weeks they'd be all geared and selling spots to whomever wants to down the boss
---
FTFY
---
Thanks for the information. I am sorry you had a bad time, and I hope that your new server is everything that you had hoped for!
---
I feel like i want to try a druid, but i have the idea of "stance dancing" aka always switching forms. Is there a lot of taht with druids, or do you pretty much stay the same most of the time without switching back and forth. Like, if you mainly stay cat all the time, but just switch over to cast a heal, and then go back to cat... i'd be ok with that. thats not much dancing
---
I always attack ppl from my server first! ;)
---
Lmao I know it’s like “I remember my first mage too”
---
Agreed. None of the "casual" guilds I've played with are clearing MC in 2 hours.
---
IF YOU HAVE AN ASS ILL KICK IT!
---
Fire locks as well. I have 5x arcanite dragons on my multibox locks and at 5 stacks my machine gun imps hit for over 400 dps each, with me doing about 700-800 dps. Nothing lives long enough to get a fair parse though, and in raids it's much lower because of all the resist right now; need Rodrigo's and wsg trinket badly.
---
It only works for alliance
---
options &gt; addons &gt; disable addons.
---
Doesn't work for horde at all.  Have tried ~50 times, have yet to succeed.  We also give up immediately, no dropping queue, we just take whatever we get, then try again the next time.
---
Revenge is a dish best served cold, I’m hunting down horde for sport now, no more zergs to protect.
---
Hah, warriors as a low apm class
---
Yeah there isnt, can it be an addon or something that makes that option dissapear.?
---
Can't cover it up man, your just KO'd
---
These days more people dont want to/cba to communicate w randoms in BGs. Thats just a fact whether people like it or not. And group queueing is nigh impossible horde side.
---
Thanks! That solved my problem!
---
Your 2nd best option is to stay together to ensure you have good numbers, and kill the 5 horde picking you off one by one.
---
Your best option is to take advantage of 99% of the server being in AV to farm up the gold for your damn epic mount.
---
&gt; Why would you assume that these people would ever catch a ban at all?
---
Every single system of punishment has false positives without fail. There are 0 exceptions.
---
Druids, what did you guys do at 60 to farm gold for your epic mount? I'm on Pagle, if it helps. Is there anything outside of professions that allows druids to farm gold relatively quickly?
---
Interesting, my first av premade "let us carry you to an 8 minute win" was a grobbulus failmade
---
Were you the test subject for John Gabriel's greater internet fuckwad theory?
---
Yes, in this situation you gotta stop and fight. Thats why I only assume 25 people is the max number that can possibly get into horde base, which is enough. Non-epic riders can sit back and delay the horde’ s attack, still make huge contributions to the team.  In addition, my alt doesn’t have epic mount but I still did a few base run. If I can’t run away, I will get off and fight the horde interceptors to keep the team moving forward.
---
Get edgemasters and you will be fine. Trolls actually scale harder than orcs, by aqish berserking beats bloodfury. Patchwork which is considered THE dps benchmark boss is heavily troll favored
---
sounds like you'r quite informed. care to share any other interesting stories or tidbits from  your research over the years?
---
How can you sell a boss when alliance could kill you?
---
Get yourself some Edgemasters and swords and you’ll be just fine. As others have said, DPS comes down to rotations, awareness, consumables and CD timing more than being Orc or Troll.
---
So max RP I can get is 13 000. I guess there is no reason for me to push harder. Thanks
---
Yes, this is called "powershifting". It's best accomplished with a macro so that it happens instantaneously.
---
Thanks. So rank 3 it is.
---
Since the whole game is about the grind, everything gives experience or money, so it turns the game into "do whatever you want to do because everything gives you a reward". Versus WoW (and most other MMOs) where you don't get to do whatever you want, you're forced into a certain playstyle for progression. 
---
That characteristic makes the game the least repetitive out of any MMORPG, if that's what you want to avoid. Everything you do from the start of the game you can do later in the game if you'd like to, and still gain experience or money (except for quests, which are one time completion). I've got hundreds of days of playtime in RuneScape and right now I could still log in and do something I've never done before, and it will probably always be like that until they stop updating the game or I play all day every day specifically trying new things. I can't say the same about WoW.
---
Hahahaha kinda. But in my defense, my first time in UBRS both the doomsaw and valor shoulders dropped at the same time. The guildies let me have both of em (I'm in a guild full of super nice people and a great GM). But as far as being as dark as possible with a silver ponytail yes that is Jenkins inspired. Its a good look.
---
Definitely doesn't work for horde.  They are full before you see them on the list.  So unless a bunch of people don't join you just sit in huge queues while the system gets back around to that number again (after the one you queue'd for ends).  We tried several times and never even got into an AV with this strat waiting up to ~20 minutes for the queue to pop.
---
Yeah they need to disable that shit. There's no reason a cross-server pug battleground should be able to change loot rules.
---
Raid frames in test mode yes, hence no names. The thing on the right is TellMeWhen set up to show me my cooldowns; my Bartender ability bars are hidden for more visibility, as everything is hotkey'd.
---
Kromcrush best server.
---
Yeah, sorry I made this mistake. Will edit it, my brain is too tired.
---
Lemme know how the fuck you get two opposing teams in the same WSG.
---
I'll wait.
---
I just noticed that last mention of being 2nd on your server, if you can hold that you'll definitely make rank 4. Rank 4 20-30% in or so
---
Is it pointless to level Resto if I want to heal dungeons? If it's best to just spec Feral for solo, at what level would I need to start carrying a healing set for dungeons?
---
Have zoom as shift scroll up + down
---
Or alternatively have pet control as shift scroll up + down. 
---
I also have pet stay on my mouse as well, so I can control my pet simultaneously to my other skills.
---
I'm not going to lie, I'm pretty sure you were in the wrong.  What kind of monster binds blink to T?
---
Honest enabling point, you can stream from a phone, tablet, smartTV, etc, some people can’t be around their PC every day, just like we all can’t be billionaire CEOs.
---
I...I can't unsee that.
---
As a lifelong Alliance player we've just been taking rank badges and crystals from your corpses...you...guys are taking of skin and blood?
---
https://i.imgur.com/I0rR5zr.png
---
More or less the same UI I use for years now, needs some minor changes like numeric countdown on debufftarget frame.
---
Warlocks will have a chance to beat mages as long as the multi rank imp shadowbolt works. If blizz "fixes" that then mages will be king ranged dps.
---
Correct. If you achieve the max RP this week that will put you to the highest rank achievable for this week for you, which is Rank 4. This is calculated with the 20% decay on the 13000 CP. (13k x 0.8 = 10400)
---
You must be alliance right?  Waiting for 5 queues for horde, which still isn't going to get most of your group in one game, is easily 30-40 minutes.
---
No heals for you then, healers need 2-3 water per AV.
---
I've noticed alliance have started slowing down the rush to kill more officers for honor.  I think since a lot of the top farmers are exalted or close to the rep isn't important to them now.
---
As a horde I have no problem with it.  Because like you said, anything that slows the zerg gives horde a better chance to win.
---
This reddit is CANCER...

I post stuff here cus i need information or different opinions and almost always have to sif tru piles of shit before finding something worthwile

By the light of Elune!

Many blessings!

May your mother pass to the next life peacefully!
---
Well yes i do do terrible on ragnaros like REALLY bad idk how to do any better but trust me man you act like i dont know what I'm talking about I get it rogues and warriors are op on certain bosses lol I understand and yes my raid is filled with pretty damn bad players im a boomkin and am usually #3-6 on the meters but still the point I'm argueing is boomkin is viable and good to a raid.
---
ST?
---
Solo pull drek without killing any warmasters, burn him before the horde port back after balinda...
---
Counterpoint: He should stay on here because gatekeeping is for nubs making nubs mad is good and fun
---
During RF use a non-clipped full-rotation, so you let your autos finish and start your aimeds after their cast. Only time you use arcane is at the end of a fight where you know an aimed cast will not finish and you would rather squeeze in another auto/arcane. Remember, with Rhok it's better to clip outside of rapid fire.
---
Its entirely brain dead easy mode, and having one boss that is hard isn't enough to fix that, especially if it is the very last boss that can be skipped by all of the players who just want free gear.
---
Idk about all that but my guild left skeram because they wanted a better chance of getting world bosses when they came out 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Yeah I rerolled to a PvE server and just could not level another Horde character. I want to be Horde, but I'm not gonna play if there is no exploration or new things for me to experience. I leveled a single Night Elf to like 8 one time ever, so last night running around teaching my mewly made noob friend how to spot herbs and how professions work, and being in a "new" zone was so enjoyable I didn't care that I got a total of maybe 1k exp in 3 hours
---
And black lotus
---
Yeah it is stronger for melee classes because that backfire is beneficial
---
HAH Epics are for closers
---
I love that
---
Yes its because to maximize dps for a parse you want to open as quickly as possible so you do auto-&gt;MS which will 9/10 times pull aggro on a cleave fight so you FD it off.
---
Something like https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/50003200502-05251030513051-03 is what I use
---
Yes sir.
---
With the weekend coming, I doubt that. But thanks for answering.
---
It is really important to try new things as a raid group to build a culture of trying and failing. If all you ever do is breeze through content you run the risk of fracturing or imploding when you start having issues on new content.
---
What a view! What resolution are you using? Seems like you have a 2k monitor or something. But idk i haven't had a widescreen monitor in a while
---
I don’t think paranoia works on stealth... just invisibility...
---
Or am I missing a joke here?
---
Yes, many people are wasting their life trying to obtain this insane rank. I just dont understand how one doesn't get burned out playing that much. I think I would be done after the first week playing 12 hours a day lol
---
Sort of. Everyone can queue at the same time and see which match they get into. I'm a part of an AV premade and we just do this until we all get the same match (or at least most of us). Usually only takes 1-3 tries.
---
Obviously, I didn't mean it as you won't catch anything else, but that the two fish share spawns, and that they are the relevant fish in the area.
---
Where you from? 1080p monitors can be purchased hella cheap now.
---
not certain bosses.
---
everyboss minus geddon and rag. and it's only gonna get better as rogue/war scale harder and harder. 
---
as far as ''boomkin are viable cause we clear content''... yes, the thing is clearable with 20 people, we got it. been said over and over.
---
If as a 300dps boomkin you're in the top 5 DPS, you're guild is simply shit-tier. it's stupid to compare yourself to them. both of my tanks do more damage than that on every single fight.
---
At least you got a cool staff though
---
Yup this sounds similar to my experience with those server
---
Do you feel better after putting other people down for not knowing the things you know? You’re the problem.
---
As a 52 horde who didn't participate.... pls don't.
---
Probably because cross realm, so time zone would differ for us all.
---
Apart from levels 1-20 is there really only one leveling route in Classic due to how scarce quests can be at times? Is it not possible like in later expansions of the game (completely different scenarios, I know, due to less xp req) to skip areas or have a choice between a couple zones to level in? 
---
I know that heavy dungeon grinding could open up a lot more flexibility in this regard, but other than that, it makes leveling alts pretty repetitive having to revisit the exact same zones without any variation.
---
I mean it definitely looks good. Nice visibility. Symmetrical. Looks good man.
---
I hate the no changes bs. I wish classic would go the osrs route where the community votes on potential changes.
---
Red Guy from S1 of RvB: It’s more beautiful than I could have ever imagined!
---
Lightning reflexes is never better throughout any of classic itemization.
---
Hahahah
---
Well, not so much "on top of" as "instead of." 
---
If you're using a fast blue dagger, your damage output will be considerably lower than with a real weapon. So that +145 points stays the same, but the rest of your threat goes down notably. It still comes out ahead for that one specific fight, but not by nearly as much as it would if it really were "on top of" normal threat output.
---
Don't post on this sub, seriously. All the toxic people are here.
---
&gt; AV is being played as a 5-10 minute dungeon right now.
---
So much on the button, it's literally LFR mode that is so derided. Only easier and gives top tier rewards rather than basics.
---
&gt;you have to fuck around and use awful meme specs or your guild will fracture and implode!
---
I don't even.
---
Yeah the "alliance always gank people in groups" etc, no... Everyone does.
---
I honestly wouldn't be surprised if someone dies trying to get r14.
---
What addon do you use to color the enemy health bar like that?
---
It definitely isn't required, but is a massive boost.
---
And I've been saying warriors can be very effective 1v1 for ages.
---
I haven't done any fishing in AV yet, but in moderation, I don't object to it. They are at least out there as a potential target, which is better than AFKing in the cave. 
---
Fish do exist in BGs to be caught, after all. If Blizzard didn't want anyone to fish, they could have skipped that.
---
Call Pet literally just calls your pet if it’s not out already.. as in if you dismissed it or it despawned due to range...
---
It'll be "hilarious" for a single raid and then nobody will care anymore.
---
Yes, because it is a pure dot. Generally speaking, you want fill up the 16 slots first with essential debuffs, and use the leftover slots for spriest SW:Pain (also a pure dot), and the rest for corruptions. Unless you have a strange raid composition, there should always be leftover slots (around 3-6). On a sidenote, if you have 4 or more warlocks, the warlocks without a assigned curses (CoR&gt;CoE&gt;CoS) are better off using curse of agony (also a pure dot) over corruption, even without amplify curse, provided there's a leftover slot for them.
---
You could always make an alt in the other faction, that's a different leveling route entirely.
---
Night Elves have a vastly different 1-20 than the other races, as do Undead.
---
Yeah and what if 20 guys defend just from the beginning so you dont even get to drek?
---
You cant win fast vs a defending grp, that's what my comment was all about
---
Yeah, this post was a joke about the lack of combat in most AV's. Unfortunately for me, it looks like I did not make it obvious enough.
---
Thanks!
---
FO DAYZ! With the +crit gear, the talents in the holy tree, and the right rank you can basically flash for an entire entire encounter and have pleanty of mana.
---
Don’t forget the clusters of dickheads that would report afk to get more of their buddies. They legit need some kind of punishment.
---
Almost exalted with AV, then I can finally play the game :D
---
That is correct
---
Yeah horde cities kinda suck, undercity is my favourite though. Hated it when I first went there because its a bit of a maze but it makes sense once you understand the layout and colours.
---
Not owning a multi button mouse and having to key-bind your scroll is funny?
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Elemental_Invasions_(Classic)
---
I did my research on skills as I leveled, I tamed the LBRS pet and learned the max rank skill then dumped the pet, my plan was to level the SFK worg and he would then be eligible for the max rank howl.
---
However it's a pain in the ass to level a pet from lvl 20 at max level so I might just go back and grab a 50 something worg and bring him up to speed.
---
Exactly, I forgot to mention about 60% riders in the post.  I definitely agree with you and I actually did this on my on alt. I always try to defend the group from the interceptors.  If I can’t make it to the base, I will stay and defend. 
---
For Drek/Galv debate, rush drek is obviously the most efficient option, that is 1000 honor per 7-10 min. While doing Galv is highly possible to make the game turtle, especially when the horde decides to come back. Even the horde is not coming back, the game is still not a guarantee win for the alliance, it’s 50/50.
---
That’s why I think Galv is better to be a backup plan, when the game gets turtle, the alliance can still get Galv. So it’s either a quick win, which is excellent or Galv with 15min debuff (still acceptable).
---
 Yeah, this post was a joke about the lack of combat in most AV's. Unfortunately for me, it looks like I did not make it obvious enough.
---
Herod was actually not so bad, I mean yeah, you got fucking ganked everywhere but one faction didn't dominate the other into complete submission. Alliance regularly held BRM and made horde corpse walk into BRD.
---
I disagree here too. For me the point is about making a statement about what Blizzard is going to allow their game to become. It starts with a 50/50 choice. Allow unexpected code interactions to be exploited or not? I think we can agree that heavily exploited MMO games are not typically fun for long. So that leaves them with the only option of doing something about it. I like what they decided to do about the situation, I just dont think it sends a strong enough message to the people willing to use such exploits. I also think not punishing them at all is the equivalent of signing off on the behavior.
---
Very insightful, thank you.
---
I mean this positively. When a group of people treat you poorly the best thing to do is dis-entangle yourself from them not tell them how to act. The community for Classic WoW is huge, the in game community is the actual game play and the people on these forums aren't telling you how to play your game unless you ask. When you ask, if it is not the answer you want it may be best to just ignore not attack their responses.
---
Got em coach!
---
If you love feral, play feral! Don't let not being optimal hold you back. Go watch Shedo's videos on DPSing, or Skarm's on tanking...  Also, faerie fire is super good, and resto druids don't use it, so having at least 1 in your raid to keep ff up is always good
---
And again, I get that it isn't optimal, but it's fine. We're playing a video game for fun, and if feral is fun to you, you should be playing feral. Enjoy not having any gear competition :)
---
I just found it wild you didn't know how to use the chat. If 11 year olds can do it you can too!
---
I can't even imagine being upset with how others play the game, let alone being mad enough to send awful messages over it. So long as you're not hindering anybody else, do whatever you want.
---
If your date system is so superior, then why are we talking about an american made game, on an american made forum, on an american made network?
---
Because people who worry about date systems have a hard time getting dates.
---
Google Blizzard Stock. Take note that it saw a big spike right around August 27th. "whatever-his-name CEO" didn't get the position of CEO by being a petty person who would make massive business decisions based around giving the finger to their player base.
---
OSRS Ironman changed this. Good update.
---
Came here to say the same. At least blizz perfectly recreated the level of noobs in classic that always leaves you in awe.
---
I've basically been farming HKs at the trinket teleport point and the gate between the towers, most horde attempts to bust the zerg seem very weak from my perspective tbh.
---
Not sure wether the event is working properly or not... Or if they didnt actually add it in since im at work during the day. But usually its at certain times throughout the event when the "invasion" (units spawn) happens
---
http://imgur.com/a/wHr08kF clean if you ask me. Been using more or less the same on pservers for years.
---
I suspect the nochanges crowd has a bunch of  min/maxers from pservers trying to maintain their advantage, rather than true nostalgia. For this reason, I expect them to never go away. I also expect them to never be ok with TBC. 
---
(I am sure there are people who also have these viewpoints that were just nostalgic.)
---
100% ally weighted yet horde wins the majority of the time, AND gets more honor than an alliance win for losing? Yeah, totally ally weighted. 3k honor guaranteed for killing Balinda because she's closer than Galv. Literally the only reason Alliance rush past everything and end in 6 minutes is because any other objective is slower than the horde objective. You guys are fucking farming, regardless of win or loss. If alliance loses it gets literally nothing. Really ally weighted
---
I've literally never had to wait.
---
&gt; why do level 48s give honor?
---
I was with you up until this. If you think people will stop ganking you when you're 48 if you don't give honor anymore, you don't understand why they're doing it; if the honor was the primary motivation, they'd be in BGs.
---
Twins!
---
Paranoia gives stealth detections, detect greater invisibility gives ahh...invisibility detection.
---
Yeah but i have the most gear competition. I go against rogues and warriors lol. 
---
Im mostly talking about pvp where druids are dog shit :(
---
tl:dr 
---
This is how vanilla was for about 4 years.
---
Students have far more free time than those with a job with few exceptions lol
---
Yes. He said "because it's new", which is simply so false, there is nothing else to reply. "Whatever you say buddy."
---
3 minutes for WSG. 7 minutes for AV. Pretty short
---
Darnassus is a great looking city, arguably the best in the game.  Its layout is quite terrible, arguably the worst in the game.  Its location and accessibility are absolutely the worst in the game.
---
Double Honor methinks.
---
I agree that most encounters are quite easy and have been theory crafted and analyzed to the point of being almost completely solved,  but I dont agree that it is necessarily a flaw or that it is something specific to classic wow.  It is inevitable for any PvE content from any game that over a long enough timeline the things that were previously challenging will become a breeze.  It's for this reason that speedrunning gradually became the primary method of competition in the past decade, and not just for wow but for a plethora of other videogames as well.  If you are this dissatisfied with the state of classic raiding,  perhaps you could try to get recruited by a competitive speedrunning guild to further challenge yourself.
---
I tanked strat UD with one yesterday, shit was fine.
---
We had a weird group comp though.
---
- Prot paly
---
- Shadow priest
---
- 58 Priest that was like "Gogogogogo"
---
- Boomkin
---
And a rogue
---
Byebye :)
---
Well yes certain bosses lol and i agree warriors and rogues are only gonna scale better.
---
I never said "boomkins are viable because they clear content" fuck off you're coming on a thread to shit talk cause your terrible I'm saying that boomkins are not as bad as everyone says they are they are generally viable for every single piece of content.
---
My guild is shit tier but your tanks do not do more than 300 dps each fight sorry to tell you that man. I also never said I compare.myself to my guild i compare logs with everyone that plays classic.
---
&gt; Good tip on the wolf, I have a level 25 wolf from SFK with the faster attack speed that I was going to level
---
Pet damage is normalized to the species, faster attack speed doesn't give you faster damage, the only benefit is more caster pushback in pvp. Cats and raptors have +10% damage, wolves are at baseline.
---
thank you for making a video so straight to the point, this could have easily been padded with a few more minutes of useless talking and info.
---
lol this is every game for me
---
What is this macro thing. Can someone elaborate for me? Thank you
---
I'm refuting that accusation that it's "mostly the community" and thus shedding Blizzard of their fair share of the blame. 
---
In classic Reddit fashion, I get attacked for doing so and the hive drones come out in numbers. Ask yourself why you immediately jumped to such hostilities to an internet comment calling out a bogus claim. Thinking for oneself is hard these days...
---
More like the raid tanks are already exalted and no longer in AV.  Ally gets there and wipes because no tank.
---
On alliance we do it consistently every 10 minutes, some people got exalted rep day 1.....
---
MC is hard with a group of 25.  Even with very well geared and coordinated players you will struggle on Garr unless you happen to have like 4 warlocks.  You will also struggle to beat the submerge timer on Rag.
---
It's probably doable but very few guilds right now I would say can beat Rag with 25 ppl.
---
?? Capital city afkers? Literally anyone that you want to blow all your cds and consumes on?
---
Tbh another reason dwarves are OP is desperate prayer. If I went with human (bangin’hot) female at least I’d have that.
---
&gt; More anger now...
---
Somebody never went to the Official Forums in 2005
---
A tip: look up the different orc tribes within the Horde. The feud with the darkspear trolls and their other kin, the Tauren vs the centaur. I played Horde and found myself playing Alliance this time. What I miss about the Horde is putting your mark onto the world. On the Alliance you just maintain that. On the Horde you're seeking to venture out onto the world that is completely alien to you.
---
Keep telling yourself that if it helps you sleep at night I guess. I'm sorry you feel that way.
---
If you min-max for honor it literally only takes just over 10 hours to get exalted.
---
/r/whooooosh
---
dang
---
I think he is implying since everyone is doing AV if you don’t continue to do AV you will derank at some point because everyone is going to be getting way more honor than you. So if your intention was to do AV and get wolf and then never step foot inside AV again then you will derank if you stop. So back to doing AV.
---
Nah, we do the normal strat where we go losing- leuts/Val/etc, and then we send people to wipe your raid at Drek to give us enough time to get Van

They won't have fun in Classic again i swear it! We're so glad that Fun Police Officer Appropriate-physics has informed us that all available fun has already been had in vanilla and on pservers.
---
U thought u were gonna be cute huh? Bye to you too! Go back to ur lil tranny subreddit.
---
You’re definitely right, I’m just disappointed. Not telling people how to act, just venting. I wasn’t even asking for advice. The amount of people that insulted my intelligence, called me names, or just straight up attacked me over a comment is crazy.
---
Some BoE staff dropped in BFD. Everyone just rolled need except for me even though a mage or priest definitely could have used it and not the warrior. What is the etiquette for BoE drops? Fair game? Or class specific roll need only?
---
Reported.
---
Expecting anything from reddit? What are you? Insane?
---
This is a limitation of the classic system that had no intention of being a viewer friendly game. Just another aspect that I hope they look into adding if classic + becomes a thing. Being twitch friendly is so important for games these days, and it doesn't have to change anything about the gameplay, just add something like a different queue to challenge another premade squad for no rank, and add some camera angles/pov views like they have in the modern wow arena tournaments.
---
Like he's never met a rogue with too much free time before
---
Those are just the default health bars. Least i thought they were. What color are they for you?
---
This is wrong the bottom of the list is the newest ones. The way me and my friends join together is one picks first available the rest of us scroll down and join the number they got. We wait until we are all able to enter then go into the big. It’s works a majority of the time.
---
That's not how atk spd works. 50% atk spd increase means that in your previous atk timing (2.5) you'll swing 1.5 times. Meaning your attack timing is 1.67s.
---
You can check this by hovering your mouse over your attack damage range on your character sheet. 
---
If my math or understanding is wrong please correct me, this is just what I've seen as a snd rogue.
---
just rephrase ''Certain boss'' to ''almost every boss''.
---
&gt;I never said "boomkins are viable because they clear content"
---
that's not what you said but that's what implied
---
&gt;I'm saying that boomkins are not as bad as everyone says they are
---
they are doing half  of rogue and warrior damage. and it's only going to get worse when fights last more than 2 minute/scaling.
---
&gt;but your tanks do not do more than 300 dps each fight
---
that's the first tank.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/us/earthfury/rilix
---
that's the second tank:
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/us/earthfury/wreckingcrew
---
on single target boss like magmadar, if they don't take enough damage Wowlogs think they are fury instead of prot... but obviously he's not respeccing between lucifron and gehennas...
---
now, before you say ''it's not consistant'', you can view all of his log on every boss: out of 10 lucifron log, 9 of them are over 300dps... for the 10th he probably got MC'd and got cleaved down in the blink of an eye...
---
Heck, even in max fire resist gear on Ragnaros he's still pulling 200+ dps. consistantly
---
Oh, brave dad. You have pointed out the pun no one else was daring enough to share. +1 for the pun. :D
---
Lots of assumptions here 'bro'. I was just making lighthearted joke about the lack of content in phase 2 in combination with clearing it quick. All of that other stuff about appoval and ego is your brain making shit up. Classic butthurt reddit again.
---
Yeah now they can practice healing purple instead of brown. Excellent practice.
---
Couldn't have said it better myself \^
---
Screw you rogues, it's payback time!
---
(as a warlock main ive been stunlocked to death so many times since vanilla)
---
Man, what a sourpuss.
---
for pve they are both pretty easy, if your going to try AOE farming though mage is harder.  
---
grouping though mage is easier and priest can be more stressful.  
---
Pvp there isnt really an "easy" class. But i guess as a priest you could just stick to a well geared tank and follow the leader.
---
Here is the full readout article about it, and a copy pasta from a post I made just recently in an identical question thread.
---
&gt;Read this article.
---
*It is accurate except for the comments on kill diminishing return. Its actually 25% reduced per kill until you get zero actual honor on the 5th consecutive kill of the same player within 24/h.
---
The honor you earn every week goes into a ladder with all the players on your faction on your server. Honor is earned from killing faction city leaders, to players, bonus objectives in BG's and passing in honor tokens from playing in said BG's. You need a minimum of 15 hk's that week to be entered into the honor ladder.
---
These honor points are then how you earn weekly contribution points (CP) which are actually how you go up in pvp rank. The top bracket is rewarded 13,000 CP for the week, second 12,000, third 11,000 etc. Depending on your server's faction ladder pool that week, there may not even be enough players for anyone to actually get 13,000 (top bracket) that week as its based on the % of players in the ladder pool.
---
There is then weekly CP "rank decay" to climb against. This decay is why it is so much more difficult to actually climb in the higher ranks as you literally cannot progress in rank without being in one of the top 3 brackets, or top bracket after rank 13.
---
R0 - No pvp kills recorded, no title.
---
R1 - 15 HK's earned that week
---
R2 - 2000 Ranking Contribution Points. (this is trivial and can be done quite easily by just pvping as the bottom bracket 2000 is rewarded to something like the top 90% of players...so basically anyone who did some type of pvp that week)
---
R3 - 5000 CP
---
R4 - 10,000 CP
---
R5 - 15,000 CP
---
...
---
R12 - 50,000 CP
---
R13 - 55,000 CP
---
R14 - 60,000 CP (HWL, GM)
---
"But that should be easy to get! IF I can get 10-13k cp a week I should get rank 14 in less than a month!"
---
--Wrong. Rank decay is 20% of your TOTAL CP currently. So at rank 10 which needs at least 40,000 you lose 8,000 CP off the bat on tuesday. That means you need to be in the top 3 honor brackets (&lt;1% of the people in the ladder, average of the top 40 players on a server) to even progress. By earning 9k CP it take you 5 weeks to progress to rank 11 alone. If you do not earn enough CP that week and you decay +weekly earned is negative, the loss is 50% of the actual total earned that week. So say you lose that 8k due to decay and didn't pvp that week, you're CP would go down by only 4k CP and be close to losing Rank 9 the next week at 36,000 total CP.
---
For a player to from rank 0 to rank 14, the minumum earning the top placement reward of 13,000 (I.e. the person who earns the most arbitrary amount of honor in a "not small" server bracket) would take 12 weeks straight.
---
Here is the math for you to help understand how absurd the grind is for those who do not work with a full pvp group to achieve rank 14.
---
w1=13,000CP (rank4) / w2=23,400CP (rank6) / w3=31,720 (rank8) / w4=38,376 (rank 9) / w5=43,700 (rank10) / w6=47,960 (rank11) / w7=51,368 (rank12) / w8=54,094 / w9=56,275 (rank13) / w10 = 58,020 / w11=59,416 / w12=60,533 (rank14)
---
And keep in mind this is the BEST case scenario which is absolutely unobtainable for 99.98% of the player who are in the ladder pool (not total players on a server, just those who are eligible for earning CP that tweek) base on a server with a ranking ladder pool big enough to even have a person able to get 13,000. Only 0.02% of people in the ladder ranking are able to actually get rewarded 13,000, and if there aren't enough people pvping that week you cannot get into that bracket regardless of how much honor you grind (rip people on 1 sided dead faction servers).
---
If you are more realistic and get 11,000 cp by being in the top %0.8 of the honor earned bracket, you will not be able to progress past rank 12 due to honor decay.
---
Good luck.
---
That makes a whole lot of sense, thank you for that!
---
So it will always be relative, but you won’t be so hard pressed on lower rankings.
---
Thank you for that splendid explanation!
---
Ohh, one more thing.
---
Is rank 10 considered high, or merely semi-high?
---
As mentioned, i just want the blue gear, since they’re an upgrade.
---
But at the same time, i don’t have the willpower or time to push much higher.
---
Think rank 10 is reacheable?
---
If i’m someone who plays a decent amount while i’m not working, but not a juggernaut that plays 24/7?
---
I’m mad?
---
Don't worry, they're going to have to pay for both side of the AQ gates if they want to raid in 2020.
---
- Heartseeker Horde
---
People do both ways, but if it's worth any actual gold you should probably expect everyone to roll need. In a lower-level dungeon I'd expect people to only roll on it if they actually need it though, since I can't imagine anything in there is even worth trying to sell. Worth discussing as a group, as obviously if you bring it up and they agree you can always just reroll and trade it.
---
Yep I played an av last night and got 2k frostwolf rep and 700 org rep. Gotta love those hr and a half warzones
---
galv is more rep and honor. things like this is why the alliance are so bad at pvp
---
Crit&gt;hit until critcapped, then you need more hit to increase critcap, so you can get more crit. Basically the only reason to ever go beyond 6% hit @ 305 weaponskill is to increase your critcap.
---
How the f... am I ever going to unsee this, you animal
---
As someone who is nearly exalted, it's a lot, I've lost count.
---
Have you unplugged it and plugged it back in?
---
Everyone is always in competitive with each other in the ranking system regardless of their current rank.  There is a certain % of the player population that can land in each ranks "bracket" each week, and rank points are assigned by your standing at the end of each week.
---
The higher you rank, the more aggressive your rank point decay gets each week, this is why the high rankers (rank 11, 12, 13)  Meaning that when you are Rank 13 you have to be in the top .3% of honor grinders in order to make progress in your rank.  With a little coordination on your server you can have several Rank 14s each week, it just involves paying attention to the standings and Rank point decay
---
In order to reach rank 10, you will need to out gain your decay each week, but don't need a high standing like 14 or 13  to make your way there.  Id go for as much honor as you can, but try to be in the top 2-3% should safely let you hit your goal.  I recommend Honor Spy add on as it will estimate your rank point gain and standing each week to help predict these things.
---
I'd also like to point out for rank 10 as a goal, stacking at much honor as you can will result in a lot of wasted time.  It's Only necessary for those pushing for a topic rank.  Set yourself a reasonable honor goal to obtain each day should get you to rank 10 in a reasonable time frame, and aim for a top 150ish standing and you should be fine.
---
Make them bars mouseover, you know that your keybinds are : and get a nice sext weakaura that changes with your stances.... it can be even cleaner.
---
Lots of people rolled Faerlina or Herod so they didn't get stuck on a dead server.  There was quite a lot of expectation at release thatserver pop would plummet after a month or two when the shine wore off and people finally came to the reality of "think you do but you don't" stuff.  
---
In hindsight that didn't matter much, sure, many servers are surviving fine, but it was a calculated decision at the time. 
---
Not everyone on Faerlina really gives a crap about streaming, and I doubt everyone on Herod is necessarily anti-streaming.
---
Besides,  why would he need chat when he's only been playing with his GF sitting in the same room?
---
MMOs get far more content far more frequently than any single player game ever
---
Have one person select first available they announce the number they got then the rest of the group scrolls to the bottom of the list and selects that number. It works a majority of the time.
---
Check out the classic WoW warrior discord, it's called Fight Club.

I leveled all the way to 60 just by questing on a high pop pvp server, I feel a small sense of achievement by not cowering away in dungeons
---
Thank you good sir! 
---
Crossing my fingers that i can atleast reach rank 10 :)
---
i've taken to biting the bullet and if i see a pack swarming the 60%'ers I'll charge/howl/fear so they can run by.  It seems to help initially but my last 7 games horde are turtled in drek's room with hunters and mages.
---
You have 0 idea of what kind of person I am. Don't judge a troll by its cover
---
By that logic nobody should ever do AV if they have any interest in a world boss. I get it if it’s a dungeon, I’d be a little miffed if someone left after the hour of grouping, traveling, and clearing the dungeon, but AV is such a different story. It’s fast queues, instant transportation, and the event itself is normally laughably short.
---
Let's get married first and see how it goes...
---
I would  be happy for something to add a competitive layer to the game, but I would settle for AV not spewing 10k an hour for being AFK, and letting us grind it out in 10 man WSG and ABs (eventually)
---
All the pve-at-heart noobs who rolled on pvp servers are celebrating, now your cowardly asses can enter a BG to kill some NPCs and sit afk while other people get HKs for you. Congratulations the game just got stale af. I wish p2 never ended.
---
Rolled Faerlina simply because it seemed least likely to die off.  Almost went Herod for the same reason.  I'd much rather be on a high pop server even if it means queue times since I want to raid AQ down the road.
---
It does not matter what level you are. An opposite faction member will see you and they will gank you if you are between levels 1-60, honor or no honor. The benefit that they get from corpse camping your lvl 47 ass is in the hopes that you'll call for help in general chat and bring more people for them to kill.
---
My math might be off but still attacking 50% faster is the point.
---
My enjoyment of the game went up dramatically after I abandoned that cesspit Herod and re-rolled on Grobbulus.
---
Fair enough
---
Interesting.  Thank you.
---
They don't stack. It will show both buffs on you, but the agi from mongoose over writes the agi pot.
---
It doesn't matter for queues. As long as the similar amount on both sides don't queue for AV it will change nothing on honor gains. As long as you have instant queue as Alliance you sabotage yourself honor wise not spamming it.
---
Those damn Rams! Everytime dismount me in a single hit
---
He says made it for the guild, but it's posted on Reddit. I'm not the inconsistent one here. 
---
When it comes to my "people," I mean redditors. I recognize different people have varying opinions. I am simply drawing a comparison between the OP and YouTubers who record themselves giving money to homeless people. They aren't exactly in a position to say "no" to the video camera or the attention it garnishes.
---
I’m an orc but am going to get exalted anyways for the ring. Probably will grind it out and save the extra 140g.
---
You don’t bust the Zerg by teleporting back when you all are already there. It’s too late at that point if that’s what the horde is doing in that game. You break the Zerg at the start when everyone first runs by each other, but and once you die you run straight to base and defend from the inside. Those are the only way to truly break the Zerg. Since if you die while in our base you get sent to far back, usually stone hearth
---
Thanks alot mate :)
---
Yeah, rank 10 would be sweet, it’ll give me some upgrades in PvE before BWL.
---
Obviously getting the epics would be more of an upgrade, but that’s not gonna happen.
---
So honor spy will essentially say which bracket i’m in (rough estimate)?
---
I made the mistake of rolling the same faction this time around instead of trying out the horde side.
---
They can still ghost run to the frostwolf graveyard, but you remove their option to res with partial health/mana at their body (or be ressed by a friendly) if you take the insignia.  Plus, if the game goes long you can turn the items from their bodies in.  So, by all means, please remove insignias.
---
Also, if Alliance ghost run to frostwolf GY and the Horde defenders manage to wipe them before the cap, those who ghost ran are SUPER screwed.
---
You have my vote. I ended up on a west server. Raid time is well after bed time. I’ve met some cool people, but I haven’t stepped foot in any raid, server is basically dead for me. Even going to low pop odds are I’d see more people.
---
HT7 or bust, it's a godsend.
---
I've been Ill the past week so I've been able to farm like crazy nearly exalted already. Although I still need 300g for the mount fml
---
I mean this is basically to accommodate supremely idiotic people, so no
---
Any other biS gear quest I should do?
---
Crazy thing is it will take even longer to grind it out this time around just because of the number of people pushing for it.
---
so eaay to break alliance, stop the rush and they give up, ez win
---
They were sorted by time zones when they launched...
---
Upvote x1000. Getting tired of seeing the hashtag altogether.
---
Thanks for being the the only guy who got the point of my post. 
---
AQ should be a lot better hopefully, I just can’t see a lot of my guild still playing by the time it comes out. Pvp has been a big letdown for me, it’s just not as fun as retail wow pvp which is saying a lot.
---
And some people might enjoy that.
---
So you’re saying I can resurrect one person, but that’s it. This is too much pressure.
---
No I meant balance patches as well like talents from 2.1 and then just applying like patch 2.2 or whatever later
---
ques were fast when most ally were playing, quite a lot of the pve players were going for rep and we let them get it done in 1 day. Now they've stopped queing and we're down to 20m ques and im guessing its going to get longer.
---
I feel. Also I can definitely see how that would help learn my lesser used binds. Definitely going to try that out. Thx for the tip man! God luck and good speed to you my friend.
---
"Barry the Randy Banana"
---
I go on a WPL gank spree to say hello to all of the levelers who thought it was safe to come out and play.  Chillwind -&gt; Sorrow Hill -&gt; Dalson's Tears -&gt; Hearthglen and by then a queue has usually popped
---
What is a "good" AV then?
---
I keep hearing about them, but I've never actually seen one.
---
People really just need to accept that its a bad BGs.
---
After all the purchaseable pre-raid bis after being somewhat slowed leveling by all the 60’s camping Tanaris, clotheslined killed by the devilsaur farmers, drive by ganked by the Feralas/Winterspring farmers, and unsubbing while the roaming gank squads for p2 honor made things impossible to farm/get to in a reasonable period...we’ll lets just say not everyone was onboard the meta game farming timelines.
---
Then don’t be a troll. Lol. If you ever want to play, shoot me a message! We’re on Windseeker.
---
Nickel Cerium
---
I mean using 1.12 gear and talents already spiked dps to trivialize raids...
---
&gt; Can someone please explain the honor system to me like I'm 13 again
---
This is the video for you my friend.
---
https://youtu.be/rOmDUYlZXGw
---
We had a boomkin in our mage group last night for Domo/Rag/Ony and it was awesome. The 3% crit was noticeable. I don't know how he did on damage or mana, but as one of the mages in the group, I loved it.
---
Your honor gains (per week) get compared to everyone else on your FACTION that qualifies for comparison (min HKs). You than get rank points based on where you sat (in the comparison) to your peers (top x% = y points). Each week, your rank points also decay by a set amount (of however much you earn), like how some guilds use a decay system for PvE raiding points.
---
How hard it is to rank up depends entirely on your server. If the majority of your server only gets 15 HK's per week and then stops, and you get 100 HK's it'd be fairly trivial for you to get to the higher ranks, even whilst putting in the minimum of time. The problem is you have people who grind 24/7 (or close to it) and then slightly less extreme and this makes the 'comparison' to your qualified factional peers less favorable if you've PvP'd less. If your entire server agreed to never do more than 1 hour of PvP per week, it'd be easily possible for players to hit Rank 14 with only 1 hours of PvP per week, for however many weeks (of course that's never going to happen so everyone suffers).
---
&gt;The amount of hate I received, especially in personal messages, was astounding.
---
If you were one of these idiots, get a fucking life. Or better yet, *go play the fucking game*.
---
I noticed it when people only wanted warrior tanks for raids/instances. No one seems to want to just have fun. Everyone seems to think they’re going to be big content pushers.
---
My server not toxic!!!! All other toxic!!!! If you truly believe that, you're probably toxic yourself and can't recognise a toxic player.
---
Where did they say they were gonna put resources behind revamping parts of the Classic experience? From everything I read, they basically said the exact opposite.
---
Are we done with being entitled?
---
Damn what server, I’m whitemane horde and it’s rough
---
He definitely uses deathwish. He literally tells you on each different line what stuff he used deathwish/rek, etc. If boss values are wrong, it shouldn't matter since he's applying same values to all classes.
---
Alright, DoT classes get this buff, give Paladins back unlimited Reckoning stacking.
---
All of Reddit is cancer. Look at the popular tab. So many negative politics posts
---
Each week you're put in one of 14 brackets based on where you ranked on your server the previous week.
---
You get roughly 1000x your bracket in rank points minus 1000. So basically if you're bracket 14, you get around 13000. For bracket 10, you get around 9000.
---
Each rank requires a certain number of overall ranked points in 5000 intervals (after rank 3) up to 60000 (R14).
---
Then each week your overall ranked points decay 20%, so you have to make up for those losses before you can start to work towards a new rank.
---
Here's an example of someone who is bracket 9 every week.
---
Week 1: 8000 RP, Rank 3 roughly 60% through 
---
Week 2: 8000 - 20% = 6400 + 8000 = 14400, R4
---
Week 3: 14400 - 20% = 11520 + 8000 = 19520, R5
---
Week 4: 19520 - 20% = 15616 + 8000 = 23616, R6
---
Week 5: 23616 - 20% = 18893 + 8000 = 26893, R7
---
[Here's a link](https://i.gyazo.com/db3ba532fbc5f5a70c2232a0ca51e133.png) showing the ranked points required for each rank, and the number of weeks required to get each rank given your bracket each week. Note that the number or ranked points wouldn't be exactly 8000 in bracket 9. It would be a bit more or less depending on where you are in the bracket. It's complicated at first but starts to make sense when you think about it.
---
Surely. But it's only a burden on the other 39. Boomkin is not much of a raid wide supporter, beyond innervate and brez.
---
It prevents multiboxers from being able to do their thing as they rely heavily on follow macros.
---
Agreed!
---
I lost my old warlock pin. Feels bad man
---
&gt; Everyone who rerolled or made a sob story about quitting must feel really dumb now.
---
Nope.  
---
Rerolling on a server with x3 more population of your faction is like moving from a village into capital city with millions of inhabitants.
---
Ohh, you’re right.
---
Thought it was meant towards my clueless post, rather than the system itself, sorry about that.
---
But hey, not everyone can be Grand Marshal or High Warlord.
---
I think the healthiest way is to try and settle for a rank (in my case 10), and push forward from there, If time lets you.
---
I know rank 13 and 14 won’t be achieveable by me, but If i get rank 10, and 11 looks possible, i will  aim for it.
---
And If i reach 11, and 12 looks plausible, i will try and make it happen, but i won’t overcommit past 10 :)
---
You laugh, but it works.
---
I can’t be sure as they’ve only targeted players from my experience .
---
did you not read the part after that? Or are you only focusing on that
---
That's funny, I see the r14s as the losers
---
My ping is honestly fine. It'd just be nice to able to raid on this character I got up to 60. That's the main reason I'd like a server transfer.
---
It works out for me. I'm east coast but work til 6pm if not later. So i can raid 6pm Western and have plenty of time
---
Surprisingly, this game ended before the 58 min mark. I thought it would last for hours.
---
It’s usually only a few of us not sure how well this works with big groups.
---
Yeah, if you are in any semi-decent guild you wont notice having a few people under 60 in your clears.
---
But why would anyone care about being VS a multi boxer in BGs
---
That's a free win.
---
The dude called me out on a typing mistake, you really think he cares about a discussion?
---
The thing is.... I don’t care what you believe. Did you just post to call me a liar or do have something constructive to add?
---
OP can I be in the manifesto when you inevitably make it to national headlines
---
Just so you  know, not all people spew vitriol. Its a game, play it how you want. Just be upfront about things when you eventually do things with other people, like "I've never run Scarlet Monestary before"  People tend to explain things if you are upfront.  If you don't, sometimes they assume that you know where to go or what to do and they'll be nasty about it.
---
I got invited to a "mage aoe farm run" I said I've never did one before, I healed too early, and we had to reset. He then remembered I said I didn't run one before, and explained it to me.
---
Forum trolls feel especially empowered because of the anonymity. Just remember that these people don't know you and don't let their judgement of you, affect you in anyway.
---
It’s all starting to make a whole lot of more sense already, and i’m really grateful for your information, thank you for that :)
---
and safe and legal
---
Crusader is a 15-25 str buff on average. If you think that 15 agi vs crusader is gonna be a significant change in the data, you're wrong.
---
Please stop playing this game.
---
Trying to force other people to your ideal way of playing is what is toxic... 
---
If you don't like how AV is; tough shit. I would rather go through and rush my reputation grind... that and talking with my guild mates is my idea of fun right this moment. when I am done I will get a dopamine high and move on to my next self made objective, and grind out honor to get higher in the rankings.
---
THAT IS FUN TO US. If you don't enjoy it, then don't partake. If the meta doesn't work for you to make you have fun, then you go do something else or find what will make it fun for you.
---
It doesn't seem fun to me to spend 3-5 times as longer to achieve the goal I have for myself just because you aren't having fun. This is classic.... take it or leave it. If you want your opinion to matter about mechanics and meta... go to retail or find another game.
---
Thank you, I am really. Even getting camped in the overworld is part of why I love this game now. When I read people just run SM from 32-40 I thought, no shit people don’t like this game, there are so many quests/territories to explore. It’s the journey, and people always look to the destination.
---
Shame the guys that deserve the revenge are in BG's around the clock now.
---
Can confirm, announced times were always PST.

lol all the top comments support you on both threads. this is just reddit, stop being over dramatic. the community did not “let you down” lmao you just had the wrong expectations.
---
hahah I have been very very much. Actually the other night a horde healer saw 2 of us in the flag room. He used the mind control cap on me while he grabbed the flag and dashed off. While I was his pet / guardian I crit our warlock with a mind blast hitting him down to 10% LOL
---
There is some timer or something I believe. After some time which isnt super long anyone can loot the white/grey items from the mob.
---
lol I didn't think about that... If only it worked similarly from West to East lol. You guys are all about to be done with the raid or going to bed when I log in at 7 haha
---
I'll take care of 'em for ya.
---
Stay arms. Keep your weapon(s) up to date, buy sharpening stones, food with stam buffs, elixirs of strength if you can afford them. At 30, have a friend or guildie help you get Whirlwind weapon and that will carry you to 40, maybe 43-44 if you're not lucky with upgrades. Not sure about dungeon quest rewards since I'm alliance, but if there's an equivalent, alliance gets an axe that is 3 more dps from the SM quest line.
---
Keep a sword and shield in your bags and up to date so you can tank if need be, but to be honest most leveling dungeons till at least 40 can be done with a 2h weapon pretty easily. 
---
Also, if you know an onyxia buff is going out, go get that bad boy then go quest! That AP and crit helps SO much.
---
i think im gonna stay 49 for a while
---
Usually when the horde have finished Belinda, they will either come back or push forward. That’s around 5-6 min. So if the alliance can not finish the game in 10 min, Drek’s room will start to have more and more horde to defend. 
---
As I said, it’s all about timing. It’s a rush so it needs to be done ASAP.
---
Lmao, try playing casually in osrs, we only get on for a thrill of eficiency or quit for the kabilionth time. One cant simply quit runescape.

---
thanks! exactly what i was looking for
---
im loving this bracket. instant que times, everybody in general is just playing for fun
---
Of course! Send me your contact info for the reporters.
---
I think it also won't give credit for the quest. I had that happen yesterday. Not sure if that's by design, though.
---
I absolutely hate the pve hotw ns spec for almost all PvP... only exception is fighting rogues lol. 
---
The 1/29/21 with ng, some cat talents, stun duration, and inspect swarm? It's s great spec overall but I mean it won't be as good as the nshapeshift / charge / sm build for carrying.
---
rogue doing the heavy lifting I see :)
---
40-49 bracket has instant que times
---
&gt; Although I've also seen other horde players shame heartseeker horde, which makes even less sense.
---
Why would anyone do that? Playing on Heartseeker as Horde is like playing on Ultra Nightmare Hard Mode.
---
When I used looking glass on battle.net both east and west coast servers appeared to be hosted in los angeles.  
---
Are you just disgruntled that your server time shows 3 hours later than your phone time?  There are lots of raiding guilds and players that are in each time zone, in each faction, on every server.
---
Worked out by mistake. I literally did the same thing you did and it just happened to work out ok
---
I heard a rumor that a bunch of former Calamitous Intent guild members ran train on the GM's wife during an IRL guild meetup and didn't let the GM join.
---
A warrior that can't sunder is a warrior that is having threat issues. Never use this with a warrior tank, ever.
---
Thanks, so do I put talents in prot tree for when I tank, I'm useful? Or do I find a guide for tanking with a 2H?
---
Don’t worry, you’re fine :)
---
the mage resetting the boss got me.
---
A lot of factors go into a 1v1 and the majority of the time they wont be in the wars favor.
---
Found the guy OP is referring to lol
---
Exactly. 
---
You should pass orbs to Hunters.
---
Thanks for posting it. I’ve been looking for this comic for a while.
---
Notice this post: All items cost gold.

---
Spoiler: hes keeping that threat lead with sunder.
---
What do you expect from a bunch of people that inject marijuanas all day?
---
Lol this was fun, enjoy your time in classic :)
---
Imagine thinking there aren’t different opinions on fun
---
And that's why some/most guild don't want to bring meme spec at all even if they could since MC and Ony are really easy
---
I got a message calling my girlfriend a dumb slut. I was definitely let down. People who knew they would get downvoted to oblivion decided to message me instead. I DO expect better.
---
People are really stupid, they call them traitors to their home server.
---
Front to back clear times for a mage does not only consist of frostbolt.
---
What your describing is someone's version of fun... just not yours. So step off the high horse and realize people enjoy different things, and process things differently.
---
What? They're just supposed to leave rotting corpses in the snow? Pretty wasteful
---
On horde I'm winning a LOT more games and getting a LOT less honor. At least we are winners right? yay!
---
Yeah I was about to complain because alliance side is the same but IF rep x10 and stormpikex1 for storm crystal (your blood equivalent)
---
Rogue: what are your WSG/PVP talent specs?  My rogue is about to be 60 and I want to start getting ready for pvp
---
Like the other guy said, switching factions would help. In the middle of the game it is really limited, but I think it opens back up for the last 10 levels or so. Blasted lands, East Plagues lands, West plague lands, Un goro, Felwood, winterspring. Lots of options there. I only did like half of them.
---
Not if you're stuck on their team...
---
Firemaw has a perfect Balance.
---
I haven't gotten this spam but I HAVE had issues with ClassicCastBars not allowing me to enter the battleground until I disable it, and I cannot use ItemRack keybinds inside a BG. I also have DBM but haven't noticed issues that I know came from that.
---
Twink question. How toxic are the BGs at different levels?
---
At 60, I ran a WSG BG and as soon as our team started losing, before the first cap, the whining and complaining and blaming started. Worse than AV whining. Since I have no interest in playing if that's common, I'm wondering if the twink brackets are more of the same.
---
Because it was a bug?
---
There are few classes that can recover from being jumped as effectively, and warriors get to say "not today" every 30m if shit hits the fan.
---
please explain the difference I'm too dumb to get your point from just the video
---
Set up a DBM countdown. Usually out of 7ish people, 5-6 of us will get in immediately and the last few can usually enter the queue and get in.
---
lucky.... pair that with the +spw to wep and AV offhand
---
The private server meta will be nearly identical to classic meta, the difference being that a slight variance in something as simple as armour values and hit tables will make a marked difference in threat gen. Regardless, this spread sheet is a damn joke. Gl with Druid tanking.
---
Imagine thinking spending an hour fighting on a bridge chokepoint (read: spamming blizzard) is even remotely interesting or engaging
---
You don't have to participate in those things. I don't and I'm having a great time.
---
You can queue at the same time and often get most of your group in. That’s how it has always worked.
---
I was getting almost 4k honor and winning in 8 mins per av yesterday. It only takes a few seconds to kill galv. No idea why the alliance doesn’t do it.
---
Get a thicker skin.
---
People cry when they get insta ganked by a zerg.
---
People wail when they get  deleted by a multi-boxer.
---
It's not about the winning and the losing, at some point in the past the wailing was great enough "that's not fair" that it was changed..
---
Shhhh, the turbo-casuals will hear you and say you're playing the game wrong and ruining it for everyone else.
---
Over-crowded PvP servers are their own seperate issue that I'm not trying to touch here, but folks need to realize that in a fandom of millions there's going to be a lot of different preferences and ways of enjoying the game.  Some like taking things nice and easy and enjoying the journey, others want to min-max and be the most powerful character on their server.  Neither is *wrong* though and this whole "players will optimize the fun right of of a game" circle-jerk that gets parroted on here just weird to me.
---
It's a big game with plenty of ways to play it.  Getting pissed at others for enjoying it differently outside of outright griefing is just silly imo.
---
I'm sure it's much more nuanced.  You just affirmed the quote I reposted earlier and wonder why thats not for everyone....  I'm not dissing your game man I play shit that can be pretty unpopular there's nothing wrong with it not being someone elses cup of tea.  Hell the stuff I enjoy most in WoW is often what others used to call "work" why would you play a game that's like "work" they'd say.  I love that aspect of this game.
---
Idk man I am in a guild where when I joined I asked healers for tips and 4 people couldnt speak english, 4 used no addons and there was one guy I had a decent conversation with. Everyone is not bothering to get bis items and casters have the +spellpower gear from lvl 40 instead of the best ones. Like all of our warriors raid in pvp spec and half of our rogues too. My guild leader has to tell paladins to roll on their bis items (the robe) and tell mages its terrible.   A bunch of guys somehow always have 20% parses as mage every fight every week.
---
And yet we do MC in 1h30min every week.
---
yeah, we had a bunch of meme spec say something similar before my guild started MC.
---
then fury warrior/rogues in blues with trash blade + mirah's song topped the chart on everything but domo.  
---
3 months later with a bunch of epic gear they dominate so effin much some mage-lock want to reroll.
---
Facts\^\^\^
---
This is the same with every online competitive game dude. 
---
Gamers™ are an older more experienced demographic now. Pair that with other factors like competitiveness, less time to play games and a wealth of information available right at your fingertips and you end up with a mindset of hyper-efficieny.
---
For better or worse this is not going to change anytime soon.
---
I think games just haven't evolved enough in the past 10 years. We need a game that is less formulaic, more resistant to the BiS phenomena and something that isn't riddled with microtransactions. Something filled with wonder and awe.
---
Damn I've had longer games without having one of these summoned
---
What keys do you use for strafe?
---
The only way prot makes sense for speedleveling would be if you're exclusively running dungeons, and even then, probably only down to defiance.
---
Hard to say if sticking to dungeons is the fastest way to level. Usually it isn't, but if you've got a reliable group to back you up and aren't spending forever waiting for everyone to gather up it might be. I usually do a mix of dungeons and soloquesting, but I certainly wouldn't be able to get 1-60 in a month w/out not sleeping.
---
Arms is usually the smoothest for leveling- you get some AoE with sweeping strikes, and gear is easier to get (hit % is less important with a 2hand vs DWing). You also get a nice 2hander from a class quest.
---
My bad, i can see how my first comment could be interpreted that way.  I left out a couple of words that could've made it much clearer.
---
The da do’s don’t understand this. I’m tired of hearing complaints about the horde getting more bonus honor. The alliance strategy was for fast rush wins because we get 2-4x the number of games horde do. So the honor per hour ends up being the same, but it also has no effect on you how much they get.
---
Great. Thanks!
---
It lets you win the 1v1s that turn into 1v3s.
---
Gold my dude.
---
THIS.
---
that said if you're trying to be able to make groups and consistently run content as 60, one or both players sold be capable of tanking and/or healing because looking for a group as 2 DPS can feel bad.
---
Read more comments..
---
Right, latency is usually never an issue. I was mainly just worried if wow used too much bandwidth to be able to play past my data cap. I'll have to go steal someone's wifi and download the game this weekend and test it out lol.
---
Multi shot damage is based on weapon damage which Rhok has significantly more than csc so csc outdamaging rhok on multi-target fights is absolutely false.
---
Hey what addon you are using for raid frame?

You turn in meats to the wing commanders, but they have to be rescued first, and they have to survive the run back to base (of course nobody ever escorts them), so whether they're available in any given battle is kind of a crap shoot.
---
People are jerks, for sure. A lot of the hate is coming because you're being lumped in with a particular type of awful member of the community.
---
There are people, not saying you are one of them, who only play 2 hours a week, but are on the forums/subreddits talking about the game 20 hours a week. They lobby for more 'casual friendly' development choices and other things that annoy the less casual players. The game is not for you if you can only play an hour or 2 a week.
---
69 beats 100 every time
---
Taliesen...is that you?
---
Making excuses for a multi-billion dollar corporation are we?
---
I did every dungeon at least once, and as many quests as possible on my mage playthrough so I could experience the world again. Was about 10 days later to 60 than most of the guild, but that really didn't make a difference in the end. I'm sure I enjoyed my leveling experience much more than most people did
---
This was awesome, this deserves way more upvotes
---
Great, just making sure.
---
If you kill galv before the horde kill balinda you get 125 rep and a ton of honor.
---
Yeah we had a boomkin in our raids and I literally forgot he was there until I saw him sticking out (ie the start of the run or end) as he was irrelevant dps wise lmao
---
It’s not true because it’s a mistake. How many times do I have to say I made a typing mistake? Clearly I meant the other way since it makes no sense. 
---
But hey. Here’s another comment that wants to talk about my typo instead of the actual discussion. Cool.
---
If you don't think gear is impacting difficulty to a great extent I believe you are mistaken. A great example of how the spell power stacking that is currently possible and was not during vanilla MC is affecting difficulty look no further than dangerous.
---
How many guilds have seen dangerous submerge? That's directly related to crit, ap spell power gear being available. Multiple submerges was the norm before that gear became available and significantly increased fight difficulty.
---
Look at the pre 1.12 item stats. You could not get spell power on items outside of raids until diremaul launched. The class sets really were bis at the time. Healers had to use the 5 second rule to conserve/regen mana with large spirit stats. This is because dps is significantly lower when agility strength stacking with a rare a80 piece was your best option. 
---
TLDR increasing dps by 50% reduces fight times and eliminates mechanics and mana issues.
---
Is this a meme?
---
Thanks. Maybe a month is overkill. My buddy who got me into this did it in 11days game time.
---
Thanks buddy you too.
---
well, due to the map layout, alliance either has to rush drek, or turtle bridge. its not about smarts. its just a shitty map.
---
Is there a comprehensive list of all loot systems and variations anywhere?
---
I'd like to convince my guild to switch from loot council, it seems very unfair especially for neutral item pieces when discussing mages vs warlocks and warriors vs rogues. 
---
Also, there obviously seems to be a bias with a female rogue in the guild. They justify it by showing the same amount of items, but hers are all the best ones.
---
Whenever the loot council is switched up, they always argue they wont go to dkp because people can cheat it - and they give the example of class collusion on set pieces (e.g. ok I'll bid 2dkp you guys bid 1 for this tier piece, that way we can outbid warlocks on neutral items) etc. 
---
Is there a good system that helps prevent that?
---
If you stand on a street corner long enough smiling at everyone that passes, a few are going to smile back, and a few are going to flip you off and that's going to make you want to stop smiling but don't. Just keep doing what your doing and shake the haters off.
---
Honestly, I prefer AB for actual PvP. Just not a fan of the BGs where one team can just turtle and draw it out. 
---
At least with AB the entire premise is to fight the enemy and win. The other two can just bypass the whole PvP aspect.
---
\&gt;  There are lots of raiding guilds and players that are in each time zone, in each faction, on every server. 
---
On the east coast server that I am currrently on. 90% of the people are from East coast and match with server time appropriately. This statement is almost agreeing that lots of people were just as dumb as I was? Which I really don't think the majority was at ALL. And so yes, I'm dumb. Don't clump everyone else with me.
---
\&gt; Are you just disgruntled that your server time shows 3 hours later than your phone time? 
---
I'm at level 60 now and wanting to raid. The 3 hour time difference makes it very difficult for me to get into one. There are no West coast guilds on my east coast server. I have looked.
---
There's one for the states closer to the middle of the US but on the east coast. 
---
I do not care about ping, only raid times.
---
All jokes aside, it makes very little sense why they would let this happen. Why take another reputation hit if they already knew what it would take to avoid this issue. Unless it's totally because of billizard trying to save money. Who decides what cost limit is acceptable when it comes to maintaining a solid reputation for a quality product as well as having happier customers? The consistancy of bugs and poor quality of servers is so ridiculous that it leads me to imagine potental conspiracy theories.
---
Nah, no need to respec while leveling. You can tank the majority of 5 man content as arms or fury, and only really need to find dedicated gear sets for tanking versus DPS as you approach 45-50+. Nothing super different about 2H tanking, it just does more damage, generates more rage and equals more threat which is the hard part of tanking while leveling.
---
Wow classic might be going strong right now but I am just here waiting for Blizzard to kill it again when they want to release a new wow expansion and don't want the sub numbers to be so extremely one-sided.
---
It snapshotted the health regen apparently as well, so you threw on full healing gear, then the sword the back to tank/dps gear you still had the full regen.
---
But so few Horde transferred to Heartseeker. I've been on the server since it opened and the number of Alliance that transferred over in those first couple weeks was so massive that the Horde-only transfers that opened later barely even made a dent in the server's faction imbalance.
---
The US ones in the WoW interface were all just listed as US servers and later split to East, West etc. 
---
Sure there was info, but most players never thought to look at outside sources to check what time zone the server is, and really think about if that mattered to them or not.
---
Yeah honestly this feels like some 40y using facebook for the first time.
---
for one turn in yeah but like mentioned it’s around 500
---
I don’t think it uses hardly any tbh .. I can only squeeze in a few hours a day at This point but I only ever crept on my data limit like once .. I play on a toaster tho and don’t use my computer for anything else so who knows lol
---
There are, what, 30 dps in a raid? So 3 people would account for 10% of the damage. If they are doing 50% less damage than an optimal person you would have to be wiping at 5% over and over for it to be the difference
---
Its a flaw with #nochange however. If Blizzard changed the raid bosses to be harder, or to even just add guards to flight paths and boats, the game would be significantly better despite the cries of #nochangers.
---
Mobs have an unavoidable 1% chance to resist no matter what level you/they are. When you're pulling 20-30 lvl 44 elites at a time and doing ~15 pulls an hour, you're going to get a resist once in a while.
---
Ah I didn't know it was a bug
---
Can you only gain 1 rank a week? I was rank 2 before BGs and have been spamming AV almost nonstop since then. Would I only be rank3 next week or would I have a bigger jump because my standing would be pretty good for once?
---
Yesterday I walked into UBRS without getting so much as targeted. Then of course I lost my Briarwood Reed drop to a moron, but hey, it's nice knowing its not gonna take 20 minutes to get there next time
---
I have received probably 10+ items so far, I wear 4 of them in raids, including probably the best healing item in MC (bene aside). 
---
Still, every fuckin day, I ask myself why the utter fuck did I not roll a warrior or something? 
---
Loot is not the solution to all problems, I promise you this. It's fantastic how much loot you accrue as a druid, but at the end of the day you still have to play a fuckin druid lmao.
---
&gt; If you are not min/maxing
---
Are we living in the same reality? Min maxing is hated here.
---
Then report for "other" not afk
---
&gt; For pet, get the worg from LBRS. It has a much better raid ability “Furious Howl.”
---
Sure, if you want your warriors to hate you.
---
I said from the start that changes need to be made for classic to succeed.
---
Wwwhhhyyyyyy mouse on laptop 😮
---
Usually 25 dedicated dps. 10-12 healers and rest either full tanks or hybrid tank/dps.
---
Hm, maybe. I came back home yesterday at 8pm and then had to learn for the courses I take. I'd say it's much more irregular, sometimes I come back home way earlier than a working person and sometimes way later.
---
It also depends on what you study I guess. I have tons of math courses I can't just wing that I need to take.
---
Lmao, I was in the middle of tanking UBRS and remembered I had asked my wife to cut my hair. Ended up convincing her we could do both.
---
Is it weird that I kinda miss World PvP already?  I am on a fairly balanced server, and patrolling the zeps and protecting the flight masters from filthy rogues was pretty fun.  Sure I died a lot, but I had a blast.
---
Look around plenty of guild run all sorts of raid times a post on guild discord/reddit/world chat surely you can find a group with similar schedule
---
When it gets resisted: Stand just far enough away from the group to CoC them all, wait until the frost nova has like 1 second left on the mobs and then CoC the group, move back, use rank1 blizzard. By then you should be close to being able to re-nova.    
---
Its not great, and you still can get messed up, if it looks like you are not going to have enough mana to finish the job jump up on the ledge and let the mobs reset.
---
In all honesty I'm just in there for the rep for the items and then I'm done with AV. I'm not ranking (or at least not going out of my way to do so) so once I hit exalted (probably tonight after a few more games) you won't have to worry about me in there anymore.
---
I was close to making an Alliance Character. Couldn't decide between human warrior and orc warrior. Decided to go Horde cause it's what feels right. At this point now being level 60 and losing 75% of my BG's I'm starting to regret it. However I think that it would have taken me a lot longer to hit 60 on alliance since I've never done it before. And I also really don't like that human mount and wouldn't want to farm a different rep.
---
I'm definitely considering rolling a casual character on Ally since I've heard their quests have good lore behind them. It would be good to see how the other side lives for 20 levels or so before getting into contested territory where I suspect there's a lot more overlap.
---
decurse, 0 cd faerie fire. gotw. innervate CR. he does legit 0 dmg and 0 healing, purely a utility bot, which is fine.
---
&gt;This community has let us down.
---
Overdramatic.
---
Sometimes we're assholes to each other, but it doesn't mean the entire community has failed anyone.
---
All any of us can do is enjoy the nice people we meet and not dwell on the mean ones.
---
You're right. If bosses have lower armor on live, then warriors would get more of a benefit. But as far as I can tell, this spreadsheet is as accurate as the values  provided private servers.
---
Ahaha no surprise 2 normie carebears made this post
---
Ive never seen some1 use their laptop as a mouse pad shits weirding me out
---
If you want something really different try Eve Online. Grinding is also a fact of life there also, but the "story" of the game is 100% player driven. Empires rise an fall in zero security space and it  is completely determined by a groups ability to manage it, make allies nearby, and fight off armies trying to kick over their sandcastles.
---
I'm not 100% that once the rep grinders are done there will be enough like minded people in each AV to demand the 6min game. My thought is that once the rep grinders are out, there won't be enough rankers per game to get everyone to stop turtling.
---
Wait you’ve already nearly hit exalted for real? GD dude how many hours?
---
I tried to tell people in dungeons that it’s much quicker to mark targets and not to split damage by focusing on one mob at a time and they called me a min/maxxer and threatened to kick me from the group. 
---
Like all I wanted was for the dungeon to not take a long time for no reason and not to prolong fights wasting healer mana. 
---
I think there’s a lot more sensitive people out there that just don’t like to be efficient. You can enjoy the game and be efficient like the majority of the player base or complain about it
---
No way... an extremely small % of the players will probably ever achieve it. Doing that grind just makes you hate yourself and the game itself... I could never bring myself to playing 12+ hours a day EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.
---
Premade... AV.... Wut?
---
MC will be difficult. 
---
Gotcha.
---
So yeah, im Reyzero from Razorgore PvP EU, holypaladin and raidleader of Epoch.
---
I have 43 days played on my paladin, farmed all the mats I can for Sulfuras alone and got the rest (5 ingots, cores, some bars) with the gold I farmed. The last 3 ingots I borrowed from guildbank and paid it three days after. In total I paid ~6k gold for it.
---
Was communicated from the very beginning that I would get the first one (dropped for us finally this monday) and everyone was fine with that. Everyone got their lionheart helmet themself and our tank has Force Reactive Disk aswell. But I guess its better to sit idle on my personal 50 bars in case bwl drops out of nowhere and we could get TF without bindings :).
---
How does Cleave work while Sweeping Strikes is activated? Does the cleave on a secondary target issue a sweeping strike back onto my primary target?
---
I got exalted without being able to click the Accept Button.
---
I dont even browse this subreddit. My britbong friend told me to make a pvp video of me popping  big crits on npcs
---
Why? there might actually be pvp in AV then
---
He was 2nd DPS throughout the instance.
---
Paly tank do ALOT of damage on groups of 3-4 Undeads 😂
---
Rip
---
You're not a victim. Stop acting like you're a victim. Don't tell me to be nice, I'm my own person and can do whatever the fuck I want. 
---
Go play the game and ignore people that aren't nice to you. 
---
Like look how fucking pathetic some of what you said is. It's like you're here begging for sympathy points. 
---
&gt; The amount of hate I received, especially in personal messages, was astounding.
---
---------
---
&gt; The amount of vitriol over my comment made me wonder if we should even keep playing.
---
-------
---
&gt; viciously attacking us
---
&gt; I thought you all were better than that
---
----------
---
&gt; This community has let us down.
---
Like seriously just fuck off. 
---
Guess what, we all meet people everyday we don't like, we just ignore them in move on. I'd be willing to be bet that most of the hate you recieved was from your smug ass attitude:
---
&gt; NO - we don’t care that we are paying a subscription fee to play a few hours per week.
---
&gt;NO - we did not know how to use chat before then because we never tried.
---
&gt;NO - we don’t want to google the best leveling strategies.
---
You're post is irrelevant and people who pretend like if somebody says something that isn't nice to them the proper response is to go pretend your some poor victim that everyone should feel sorry for is just annoying as hell.
---
If you haven't seen it yet, most of my games today have had Alliance switch and rush Galv, cleave Lts and then it's a 30 min game.

This was like a prisoner's dilemma experiment. The best case scenario for everyone would have been keeping to the 8-10 min Alliance wins but Horde had to try to push it, so now Alliance are just going to have to do the same and now we're all spending 30-45 min per AV. The only people who won were the people who hit exalted before today.
---
Huh, did not know that. :)
---
That's why new lore and expansions to take classic in another direction would be tits
---
You are right. Thank you for the perspective.
---
nice to see Athene finally getting a haircut
---
I wouldn't say supremely idiotic. We made a mistake but not an unreasonable mistake. The servers were not very obvious about their time zones on server select and less experienced players may not have noticed the server clock was off. I didn't notice until I was already a few hours into the game because I was so excited to be playing again. My server was picked by the first person to create a character in our group of friends and he was already several days in by time I noticed the time change.
---
Works just fine, especially if your group understands you dont have a taunt so they should actually follow the target order :)
---
I'm definitely gonna try more to find one that fits me better, thanks :) I've been looking, but unless a guild starts raids at 9pm I'm probably out of luck on the weekdays.
---
At least you got your offhand though!
---
The vast majority of people who never ever even reach the full blur set. Their honor rates are just too far away to threaten the rankings of the few real contenders
---
lol that's insane. There are some really good items for everyone from doing exalted AV rep. Unstoppable Force for someone who may not have easy access to MC weapons is a fantastic PVP weapon for quite a while.
---
But please don't sit around and delude yourself with thinking that solo queuing and participating in AV turtles requires some epic "challenge." They're largely braindead zergs just nipping at each other until one side tires of it.
---
Barrens chat. The barrens is a level 10 to 30 horde zone. A big zone with a lot of people so the chat is kinda fast, heavy a d stupid cuz there is to many people in that zone. 
---
What class are you both playing ?
---
People will still be in BGs after they finish their rep for the honor. Anyone who wants to rank at all (even to ranks like 8 or 9) have to spend time in BGs, it isn't just rep people are in there for.
---
Yikes.
---
I mean, my guild doesn't have any shitty mage/warrior/warlock/rogue players. I guess if you're in a lower caliber guild then it doesn't matter but once you hit the point that all 40 people are solid, it's undeniably a disadvantage to have memespec dps over real dps.
---
I'm glad you're enjoying the game! I think a lot of people have played vanilla over and over (thanks to private servers perpetually getting shutdown after 6-8 months), so the idea of suffering through the Barrens for more than a few days is appalling to some. 
---
Keep up the good work, you still have a lot of game to discover and it's one of the best experiences created in the last 20 years, enjoy every second of it!
---
Note that Blizzard is probably going to bring in paid transfers sooner or later, and when that happens the tendency for the minority faction to leave a ganking server will get stronger.
---
If your net "gain" for the week is negative, that amount is halved.
---
Imagine thinking a rush fest for an honor grind is even remotely in interesting or engaging
---
Oh wait I can, because I understand people have different interpretations of fun, hence why we have hundreds of genres and sub genres of video games
---
Probably a pve server. Theres an insane amount of bots running around on westfall and prices for everything are dirty cheap
---
Nice.
---
Did a 12 year old child make this video?
---
If you cherry pick footage like this you can make any game look terrible...
---
&gt; Why take another reputation
---
Because they don't care and it apparently doesn't even effect their bottom line, so why bother?
---
Haha, what server BRO?
---
Min-Max dmg matters. The DPS ends up being a avg but the important part of the weapon choice is the speed
---
Anytime
---
Cute. Difference is I am fine with the Meta... you are opposed to it and saying it is everyone else's fault and problem you aren't having fun. 
---
Literally no one is stopping you from doing something about that. Especially now that AFK auto kicks have been disabled.
---
I agree with your play-style, but the irony of this comment is quite hilarious.
---
Why don't you go ahead and link your /played on your main?
---
Any chance of getting this book signed?
---
Oh yeah, he was afk farming AV aswell :D!
---
Every may get BG rep, but Org rep is for the person turning it in.
---
Honor mostly. It just feels like every time alliance only zergs drek you only get like 700 honor for the game while horde gets 2.5k, seems like we're leaving honor on the table when you can easily get 2.5 as well and still secure the win.
---
Welcome to golemagg ☝
---
Yeaaahh, MMOs can be unhealthy for people who play them for the wrong reasons... in my teenage years, I was depressed and played WoW all day as a maladaptive behavior rather than trying to make friends and pursue interests in real life. And yeah like you said, that happens to adults too. So, could be the guy can't afford a sub because he's neglecting his real life... could also be he works two jobs, makes just enough to support his family, can't morally justify paying for WoW when he's on food stamps, finds himself buckling under the stress, has one outlet that helps take the edge off, costs $15/mo. That's a fiction in itself because I know hardly anything about the guy. It's just as presumptuous as saying he's an addict who is being enabled. So if it makes no sense to assume either, is it worth our mental energy to? 
---
There's just not enough information, so my stance is a neutral one here - schrodinger's dwarf. We know nothin' bout the person, feel like it's better to us to abstain, as we'd want others to do when hearing our story.
---
And I totally ramble. I think it's because I like to hear myself talk. /flex I'm thinking about getting a journal to act as an extradimensional void to fill with my tangents.
---
Anyway, didn't intend to sound too righteous the first go around. Ishnu'alah, brother
---
You know it is an addiction when you start to resent your family for giving your life purpose. Fucking freeloaders.
---
Or maybe it’s the fact that people have fun in different ways. You might have fun in a turtle fest game, but I do not. I have fun by getting the most honor and therefore gear. Slow games are less rep and honor for everyone. Blame blizzard for giving us 1.12 AV where Zerg starts are possible
---
Only thing I do as a leader is set myself as the master looter
---
Hey.  Hey you.  You're finally awake.
---
Honor is relative to your faction. If ALL alliance get smaller honor values it’s a moot point and actually makes WSG for them a LOT more viable as a means to rank
---
I get like 15-40 armor scraps per kill. The turn in requires 20. For ONE Stormpike rep. Maybe horde get better drop amounts? Or have less required per turn in? I doubt it, I think you and OP are just misunderstanding the numbers.
---
Basically leaving form doesn’t use your gcd, so you can then immediately shift back (which does use your gcd).
---
When you're ruining other people's matches by your own willing intent yeah generally i'd say that person is pretty shitty yeah.
---
Yes it does. Because then I can play a good battleground
---
Omg thank you, no more disabling bartender
---
Yea as others have said, Reddit is an echo chamber for those with very loud voices. This sub, especially, gets pretty toxic. Enjoy the game at your own pace. (:
---
Good idea to add this, don't even need the 5 man cap, but also prevent people from using timers to solo queue their whole raid into the same instance. If people want to premake they should be matched against other premades to at least some extent.
---
I didn't know it's possible to level it at level 60 tbh.
---
10 would be very very  hard battle, but doable.
---
Dang we tried to queue simultanelusly and then just join the specific bg whoever got the first pop but it was always full
---
lmao the table wasn't picking up my mouse but the laptop does and I didn't have any time to waste at this point since I had to move my set up
---
we have 3 different items that drop from alliance and in high quantities. The blood requires 1/1 rep armor is 20/1rep and meat/flesh i’m not sure but it’s also relatively low maybe in the middle.
---
Why does the kill order between Galv and Belinda matter?
---
maybe dont karma whore next time no one cares that you know how to chat
---
Wow never thought about running as a ghost to the boss GY. Good tip.
---
People like this douche need to have their characters deleted. I would love to see a GM just roll up and *BAM* "sit the fuck down" *douchey asshole's account obliterated*
---
Yep
---
I rebound those buttons to + and - on my number pad.
---
Because unfortunately people just don't care enough and they have enough anecdotal evidence that any strat other than rush Drek is inconsistent to just not want to try anything else.
---
If you're feral you honestly should just stay in bear. If you have charge its gg.
---
Someone is just salty a Ret Pally has hand of rag. Congrats to you though!
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
I've won a fair number as Horde where we have like 5 people harassing stragglers in mid and falling back to keep. If they wipe on drek then its pretty much a guaranteed 20 min win.
---
Can we use XL cables and then if they fail, pull out our other set of cables?  I only made XL and was curious if there is a benefit to using two...or if they share the same CD.
---
Exactly!
---
its a thing
---
Their ability to burst you down is based entirely around RNG and a 30 minute cooldown. Outside of that the matchup is quite one-sided in the Druid's favor.
---
How are you getting sword spec as a dps warrior?
---
Yeah how dare you do all that stuff on your own to get your orange text item!  Screw you!!!
---
But when you are gear for pvp, you are geared. If u reach lv 60 u need to raid all the time to upgrade your gear
---
The rest of the raid was probably too far away to get the roll.
---
A good av is a back and forth fight with contested grave yards and bunkers. Where sub teams form to tackle different objectives and every thing that is won comes from a hard fought battle.
---
cool ty. just looking trying to get blue set 2pc
---
That’s what they have Runescape for now
---
Reported for reporting.
---
Can't believe I bothered with imp blizzard. This spec is the way to go
---
Took awhile about 25 hours roughly, luckily I've been ill and off work otherwise It would take me a good couple weeks. Need a few more hours worth of AVs to get exalted.
---
I'm sorry mate, but 100% of Arugal playerbase is pondscum. I don't make the rules.
---
Isn’t that what people do now? Mindlessly farm the best gear....if there is a single upgrade out there left for you that means you ARE TRASH
---
Good. The horde must pay for the atrocities of P2 somehow.
---
this is not principled
---
&gt;*The level of idiocy and cowardice is astonishing.*
---
Not really at this point. It's kind of expected given the reaction to phase 2 wpvp that we saw on the forums...
---
And tbh that is the meta that if you die crossing, corpse run south and wait for a gy. Most people that rush will know what you are doing and some will even choose to defend a gy even more if the see your ghost jumping at a soon to be capped gy. I wouldn’t just stand there looking idle I would jump in place just to show you are attentive and ready for action when shit pops off.
---
"those bars could've sustained the guild" lol for what? so he can complain to other people for having arcanite reapers or lionheart helms?
---
You hit the nail on the head.
---
So many people here think that being able to clear MC in 2 hours with a bunch of meme spec is some sort of gotcha that proves you can bring a bunch of moonkins and enh shamans without sacrificing anything.
---
Different priorities, starting at a later date.  Lots of reasons.  Getting 900 gold without establishing a farm, which is much harder during peak hours, it’s going to get tough.  Half us are doing AV in part for the cheaper mount.
---
I mean if you're using a shield, you're propably shield blocking. If you're not gonna shield block, then just go duelwield and do more threat. But even if that's the case, he tests fury/prot duelwield where he can't shield block.
---
Why? After I get Don Julio's I'll be done with AV forever and can exclusively focus on the BG where your ability to play actually matters..
---
They did it for queues
---
Horde should be able to roll as dark irons. Thatd be pretty cool.
---
Whichever one gets the kill first gets 125 rep. If you kill after the other faction you only get the honor
---
&gt; Learn to pad damage meters on certain fights.
---
I hate it, but yeah. Sometimes you gotta do this if you want good chart position.  Also good tip about DPSing while others are waiting.
---
This has to be one of the biggest let downs in Classic for me. I know PvP doesnt' require a lot of skill, but I thought you at least had to PvP to rank up. Now we're gonna see Commanders/Champions who got there by being afk in AV. So sad.
---
It's pretty common for people to just tell you to ghost run down.
---
Some give this man a platinum
---
This guy is right lol. Especially at 19..
---
this is so low effort you couldn't even be bothered getting 5 unique character pictures
---
I enjoy it when people make assumptions about something they literally have no part in at all. Hes literally judging a book by its cover and has no knowledge of anything that has to do with you or your guild.
---
Innocent until proven guilty? Nah.
---
Damn elitist community and their...
---
Shakes magic 8 ball...
---
Chat functionality
---
That blows. It was seriously night and day difference when BGs were launched for me on Blaumeux. I can progress again.
---
It'll vary from person to person, group to group. I would talk about it with your group if/when it happens. If it's a really expensive item, most people will probably all need to safeguard against ninjas.
---
sure, but it might be easier and less time consuming  to raid for a few months to get gear as opposed to ranking to 10+ for gear. Warlock gear is high stam and practically pvp gear, especially the fel set
---
I mean; we usually stack up to 9 people in a game through coordinated efforts... but if there is something easier than queuing at the same time and trying to pile into the battle with the most queue pops then I wanna know.
---
This has all the makings of a copypasta.
---
I wish we could make this an auto mod response triggered by "sulfuras"
---
Happy cake day! ~
---
Bro you know we can all see your previous posts claiming that calling SH GY is griefing, right?
---
If you have been encouraging people to afk vote those who cap SH GY, youre the exact type of person that should be banned for doing so.
---
&gt;"That's fine just don't grief by capping SH."
---
what do you mean? its clearly working as intended. theyre summoning their friends into the instance
---
Idiots unite!!!
---
Not op but I just bind strafe to A and S. Then Q and E for some other spells
---
What's your hit percent on rag and rest of bosses?
---
Typicaly you put twice the effort compared to rogues and warriors, but get roughly 70% of their result.
---
i'm not going to read that op
---
It looks fun as hell to spice things up like this. It doesn't matter how much time it takes. If people in your party enjoy it and agree with you doing it, so no one that wants to do a quick run is caught surprisingly, then why not?
---
I would have no issue with them just nerfing the honor gain from NPCs and maybe making it so the AFKs don't globally get the honor anywhere in the zone.
---
One way or another though this version of AV is not in any way shape or form the classic experience.  Never did I do an AV during Vanilla where I ran through 30 Alliance untouched in a Battleground.
---
As a horde on Heartseeker, we are playing a different game - Hardmode wow. The rest of you are just casuals.
---
That’s too deep man
---
Took me about 20 hours total. Just depends on run speed, queue times, and win/loss ratio. It can vary a lot but I'd say max 25-30 hours.
---
PvE’ers are those that want a fast rep grind.  55 minutes is not that
---
I’ve got the Crest of Darkshire, Morgan Ladimore’s sword Archeus, Totem of Infliction, and Torch of Holy Flame. I’m a sword rogue so I can’t use these. Is it worth trying to sell them to other people? Or just sell them to any vendor?
---
What would be a fair price for these items?
---
Suicide Kings - You have a ranking list, of say 1-50 for all your raiders. People get "Dibs" on an item over everybody beneath them. Example: Mageblade drops, and the highest ranked Mage is rank 5. You're rank 7. Rank 5 person gets it, and is now Rank 50. You move up 1 spot on the priority list for the next piece of gear.
---
DKP - Participating in the raid gets you points, which are a made up currency. You use up points for individual items. This way, if you were dry for 10+ weeks, you don't immediately lose it all for your next drop.
---
Loot Council - Let people / Officers bicker about who should get gear
---
Free Roll (MS &gt; OS &gt; PVP) - Just like in 5 Mans, but only letting tanks roll on tank gear first. Prevents feral kitties from rolling on leather Healing gear.
---
BIG DISCLAIMER - Nothing stops you from creating additional lists. I've seen Suicide Kings where you have a master list of all 50+ raiders, and then a separate list of all rogues for their tier pieces. This way, getting a tier piece has zero effect on that viskags you are looking for.
---
Yes I confirmed it with both the mace and the axe.
---
Too much competition for the real good %crit stuff though (robes of volatile power, mageblade). I don't think  replacing Fordrings ring with band of rumination or hammer of Grace with inventors focal sword is worth losing the +healing. But that's just me.
---
I think their point is that the cancer just keeps moving. Each time something comes out we have to bear through those few weeks where the people super serial about it make it terrible for everyone else. 
---

Imagine if you could have done those things the whole time and also do them now. It’s not a matter of comprehension it’s a matter of being annoyed that people stopped others from doing those things before and are now stopping them from enjoying AV and saying “just wait your turn, we’ll be done soon”.
---
Whats a regular efficient way to get AV Rep? Not planning on min maxing, but just want to make sure that I'm at least not doing it in the slowest way possible.
---
Idk how much better the higher attack speed is in practice. It just feels nice to know it's theoretically the best pvp pet.
---
I try to keep only the essentials on my screen  https://i.imgur.com/pG7LudM.jpg

This is my first time playing classic, so I went the healer gf route...had a great time lvling and running dungeons, but now it's time to raid..I'm still learning how to heal and haven't done a lot of raids yet. I'm used to dungeon healing and wondering if any of the vets/experienced players have some tips and tricks for me to not under perform too much when I do raid?
---
Hence why people that abused the system are assholes.
---
Turn ins give you rep for Frostwolf/Stormpike AND ALL FOUR MAJOR CITIES. Your chat log only shows you Frostwolf and Org rep, but you actually get 25% towards the other three main cities as well. For instance, 5 blood turn in will give you 50 Org rep and 12-13 rep for UC, Trolls and TB. Look at your rep tab while doing a turn-in to confirm
---
if only they knew how slow and inefficient horde is in AV, this is coming from a long time ally player, every game is the same they never learn...
---
I'm currently leveling a hunter and going for a Parry Survival Hunter Tank build, if you want it enough, anything can work.
---
Just a question, how do you guys, in 2019,not know how a chat window works? No pun intense, just curious
---
Have you told him this?
---
I couldn't make it through all the editing.
---
Vanilla dungeons are still still the best dungeons that wow ever had.
---
They are just at another level when it comes to immersion
---
i'm constantly adjusting my camera zoom
---
Pservers ran serverside anticheat. It would take probably 1/3-1/2 of the dev’s time. I can tell you how nutty their anticheat has come along cause i played warsong12x, ed, og valkyrie where their anticheat was not as strong. And yes, people speedhacked and invinc all the time back then. In fact, modern pservers only feel like clients give them “proper unmodified data” because of how expansive their serverside checks are
---
Maybe unfriend the other 'friend'? Or call him out on his negative behavior...
---
Hunters would clearly serpent sting themselves to the top of dps charts.
---
Big yikes.
---
Picked a server with balanced factions, but I have to sit in a bg queue anyways. Fuck me, right?
---
14-31-5 feral cat dps  i have tank and heal  every high level instance with the same  spec just swapping  for  +int/heal gear all thank to HOTW bonus 20% int   
---
as of raid i manage to get friends  with our guilds top dps  and they dont want to raid without me so i have  my spot in every raids to give them the 3% crit and innerv the healer   
---
as of 1VS1 druid is a very good class most mage are bad and panic when you remove their roots and slow   
---
i usually also perfom better in duel with  +int gear than with +strengh+agi gear     
---
problem is for bg druid has very low burst   you can win duel but you will take time and most of the time the ennemy will have reinforcement  and you will get destroyed   
---
druids are better use as eitheir  flag runner thank to bear forms  travel form and roots   
---
but in alliance with a nelf hunter they can make very good defense   
---
have the druid detect humanoid and the hunter  detect stealth  and you can pretty much  react to anything
---
CELEBRATE GOOD TIMES! COME ON!
---
You used jumper cables :(
---
I totally agree except for that last quote.
---
AQ and then especially Naxx are going to kill many guilds after they spend a month wiping.

wat.. call pet is for when your pet isn't summoned. It does literally nothing when your pet is already active

Don't mind the timestamp
---
"Why are there no healers south?"
---
Because we are trapped north :)
---
No, you absolutely don’t shield block when attempting to generate high tps. Look, I’m not even a main warrior and I can see some glaring issues with his methodology. If someone more experienced were to look at this they’d likely tear it apart. This is not good reference material.
---
You are comparing hacking, the shit company known as bethesda and the hong kong thing to players abusing a report function. Its hardly a fair comparison.
---
Yep, I use this and it works great. YouTube, Netflix, Disney +, twitch all work.
---
I use A and D for strafe. No need for turn left and right bindings.
---
Yeah thats resto. Rip
---
Just take all your gear off and run mounted until you die and then res and do it again.
---
&gt; So for the alliance, it’s either to choose not rush, or rush and finish the game in 10 min. There is no middle ground.
---
&gt; In the end, I think a determined rush usually can not be stopped, unless the other team is fully dedicated on defence.
---
When I read this line, this tells me you are not really thinking of other strategies other than racing.  It's what you know and all you know how to do.
---
The game hasn't changed but how we play it sure has...
---
Why do you think they give a shit what version people are playing? A sub is a sub. They'll likely risk losing more people than they gain by trying to force classic players into retail
---
Just the tankies from California lol. 
---
Source: Am a southern boy on a California server, and they are toxic as fuck, especially if you disagree with them on any worldview. Have gotten kicked from 5 guilds because of it, but finally found a good one.
---
Loot Council is *supposed* to be unfair, the idea is that it should be unfair in a way that benefits the raid. If the council is playing favorites rather than distributing in good faith, you don't have a system problem, you have a player problem. Don't spend your time trying to police those people and keep them in check, just join a guild with leaders who are interested in long-term success.
---
I’ll join ya, potentially. Just let me know what server you’re on- and your character name and I’ll roll a new character at some point to say hello. Not sure if I’ll get it to 60 as I have a 58 priest, 28 rogue and 20 mage atm... but it might be worth a shot seeing the horde side of things and picking a new class.
---
Are you adding the 10min queue times into your equation?
---
So yeah, you're going to want righteous fury,  because I assume you're going 30 or 31 in holy. I would very highly reccomend blessing of sanctuary at the least if you plan on tanking. With this you can generate enough threat on aoe pulls to let warlocks/mages do their thing.  Strat and scholo are simple to generate high threat on due to exorcism. I tank with holy shield,  though it's not necessary,  it allows for alot of threat + mitigation as a buff that can be frontloaded so you aren't spending a GCD on it once the pull had started.  I find this useful for tanking Drakkisath, emperor, all the diremaul bosses, etc, as you don't have the threat boost from exorcism.
---
Long story short, Paladins are awesome dungeon tanks by far, but don't ignore the talents that make them work.  If you don't take improved righteous fury,  even salvation blessing won't help you keep mobs from running to your warlocks/mages on aoe pulls.
---
For reference I personally play generally in a 13/31/7 spec for pve. I respec for raids.
---
Imagine using a weapon chain over death grips or strongholds
---
This is hilarious
---
I've had some very challenging fights in AV
---
Does that guy still play and make hilarious videos?
---
Healcomm is an addon that shows what heals other people are casting on raid members. Beyond that, it is good for healers to collude and determine priorities. You are on the main tank. That pally is on the new offtank. This priest is raid healing groups 1-4. Etc. Push to communicate with others on what you should prioritize heals on.
---
Translation: im jealous you have an item i want.
---
This is reddit. We hate everything.
---
I honestly think people who click it deserve to be booted. Its incredibly scummy to do so, but if you fall for it you kinda deserve it.
---
Ironic you post this comment lol
---
The big potential issue is queues getting too long. If that happens, serious rankers will hearth or fly somewhere to start filling in queue times with honor farming, and the world will get a little rougher again. I imagine Chillwind Point will be pretty unplayable at times.
---
Lol that depends on the player.
---
But I do care about exalted, it's not like every one of my games was a turtle. I'm about 2/3 from exalted because quick games just happen half the time, everyone has good gear. I'm not going to rage quit and sit in the city like a pussy for 15 minutes because I'm salty about wasting time in a video game.
---
Take your upvote, you earned it
---
Bag space is the real money maker
---
Most efficient leveling zone...or at least it seems that way.
---
Also correct
---
I have to download an addon just so I can maybe play with a single friend in a BG?
---
In 2005 AV still had NPCs.
---
Is ranking for the rest of classic’s life just AV spam? If you want to rank, you need to sit in AV and ignore WSG and AB?
---
Followed a friend as ally on a PvP server, my last four levels being right when phase 2 hit. Pretty painful, but I can at least say I finally solo’d a warrior on a rough PvP server.
---
Dinging 60 on it is when I also realized PvP severs were not for me. *I* don’t have any fun getting outmanned and force to spirit walk, so why would I want to do that to others? I had way more fun socializing around the possibility of PvP, like helping a struggling shaman farm some devilsaurs or wandering by southshore and helping a warrior get his axe.
---
I didn’t transfer but I do have a new toon on a PvE server. It’s quieter for sure but also much more what I wanted, love me some coop.
---
Phase 2 pretty much killed the game for me and my gf, we were playing like every day at least 5 hours after work and more on weekends. Phase 2 came, and we been slowly playing less until we were not logging in anymore. Now the world is quieter and back to what it used to be, but still we just got hooked off and we barely play.
---
It's a shame since I love this game, but something got lost in p2...
---
I'm saying you are probably making it up for attention of the topic about toxic players yes.
---
Also how rich of you saying people insult your intelligence
---
&gt; That’s the problem though. People attacking me personally, attacking my intelligence, calling my GF names..... over a comment saying we were having fun. You can be a tryhard without being a piece of shit. 
---
And straight up 2 comments earlier you commented:
---
&gt; Is that the name of your guild? Damn... I support you bro. Despite your intellectual handicaps.
---
Um because they also will want to actually sell the new expansion? They have to report those numbers to shareholders as well. You better believe they will do something to ruin classic when the next expansion releases to boost the sales.
---
You seem like the kind of guy id like to have cyber sex with;)
---
Capping Snowfall graveyard every game for the win brother!
---
Possibly. There are also more people on my each server so it's possible those two things will balance out.
---
Sounds like AOC has turned her attention to classic
---
how dare they
---
They join a match, start kicking people for afk even if their not afk, and tell their friends what av number their in. Its scummy but it's a thing right now
---
Horde has been dominating AV on EU servers today. 10/15 defenders with others pushing in. 20 minute games per.
---
There is a girl in this picture, obviously not a real wow photo
---
How so? Im genuinely curious.....  How is there not time wasted between running into melee range, meleeing, and out of melee range into "ranged range" to do ranged dps? I could only see this working when you have multiple targets spread out to DPS at the same time.
---
xpoff.com has some good resources for gear etc.. hope it helps
---
Right? 
---
The rule is: if it brings up the need or greed box, it's obviously hunter loot. 15 years and folks still don't understand this.
---
Cast rank 3 or 4 regrowth on the raid. Max rank regrowth on the tank when you are anticipating big damage and keep it rolling. I wouldnt really use rejuv, because if there is another druid, they may snipe your rejuv as they do not overlap like regrowth. When you get around 30-40% mana, ease off on the regrowth spam and focus on casting rank 4 healing touch, aka the most mana efficient heal in the game. Always have major mana pots, 10 should be good for each boss in MC, 10 nightfin soup, and the spirit alcohol from DM. Keep those Max rank regeowths on the tank, spot heal where you can, be nice guy druid and toss a priest or shaman your innervate. Download DBM, pay attention,  have fun and may the PHAT lootz be given to you!
---
This is so scummy
---
But good players can be hard to come by
---
"man who's team has a natural advantage on a map wins a lot, more shocking news at 11."
---
isn't every class the same way at 19?
---
I am a California boy on a California server and I am sorry that happened to you. Your accent should have no impact on your class performance. That's messed up.
---
It will not be out until p5. Spell penetration as a stat made its debut with AQ, so only having one item in the game with it would be strange. Now it's just strange to only have the melee ring and just the off hands for casters.
---
its all good man no big! Still able to play at least! I mean, as long as i have 15 extra bucks left over by the end of the month hahaha
---
At least I'll be 60 by then and have some decent gear so I can somewhat put up a fight instead of just getting steamrolled.
---
Excuse me. We also do mushrooms and kick a bunch of hippies out of a cave...
---
Yes on the xp, 3 for a win &amp; 1 for a loss
---
Much cheaper than the 900g you pay for your faction mount.
---
"Come out and playyyyy~"
---
I love whitemane... it seems like one if the few super high populated servers that doesnt get brought up in these types if threads lol
---
In a perfect they drastically reduce the honor gained from AV so wsg premades becomes viable for ranking.
---
Nice 500 word essay to a person you don't like about how you should ignore people you don't like instead of engaging.
---
It’s almost like mage portals tell you they are portals to a certain capitol city when you mouse over them. People clicking wildly and not looking get no sympathy from me.
---
At 40 when you get mounts
---
its not about being anti social. its about cost. Why pay for something when you can literally get it for free in AV?
---
can feel that, no brut blade, no BRE, 1 staff, 2 mageblade, 1 perdition, 2 OEB, no talisman, no bindings, no recipes ... and yeah now 1 Eye
---
Also had a 9 week streak of leafs ... then 1 divinity eye again and now back to leaf ... lets see next week :P
---
Honestly release SWTOR was the best "variation" MMO. The story and how it affected your character was really awesome.
---
I'm almost exalted so I will pick those up, thanks!
---
manbearowl
---
That's awesome that you found this item! You should try to sell it in the trade channel or find someone looking to buy it in the trade channel to escape the fee that the auction house takes. If you end up level 60 w/o being able to get rid of it, you can consider putting it on the AH because its crucial to get that epic mount bruddah.
---
How much Rep does each Mark give?
---
There wasn't a pun here
---
Damn that's a reference
---
Would have been 11/10 if the initial rush clip had 1 rogue picking off the last rusher with a 60% mount.
---
I mean id rather play and have fun rather than lose quick and go back into the queue, especially with queue times going up and up.
---
ok good plan thanks.
---
Thanks :)! That dude btw was a warlock
---
Everyone else is a bot in your single player game called life.
---
Why would you summon someone anyway?
---
oh come on av rep isnt long and painful even in slow games wtf its one of the easiest to exalt, chill out lmao
---
Are you trying to get to R14?
---
Youdont take dur damage from pvp, so this is worse then useless as it makes you vulnerable to frostwolf bowmen.
---
Each turn in of 3 gives 110 rep.
---
Or snowballs to cancel the herb picking
---
low effort reply as you would need 6 unique character pics...don't forget Balinda!
---
Another “take your time, have fun sucking at the game and wiping your party , as long as you have fun who cares how the party feels” post, how original. Why do so many casuals come to reddit to seek validation for being bad at this game lol
---
Well I'm getting a lot more fun and a lot more rep. I dont really care about the honor. Rank 3 is enough, rank 6 is nice. 
---
Winning is more important to me.
---
The first day was rough as horde basically had no strategy besides trying to rush faster, which just doesn't work. Now that we have a handful of people committed to D i rarely lose.
---
Wait so you get 3.3k xp from each turn in of 3? That could be easy leveling.
---
Paly tanks do ALOT of damage on groups of 3+*
---
Do you know what it does now?
---
13
---
Lol! That was sarcasm replying to his post where he claimed I had an IQ of 60. I asked if that was the name of his guild. Maybe I should have put an /s but you would probably still be an asshole so it doesn’t matter.
---
Warriors tank all leveling stuff as dps spec, so that doesn’t lower questing speed. Warrior + heal is the best imo. Druid shaman also can tank help and gets movement speed at lvl 20. Any 2 classes that can tannk and heal are going to be great for questing and very fast dungeon groups.
---
Someone forgot to take there meds this morning
---
yeah let us queue as a group of 1.
---
Last I heard the guy was the leader of a cult.
---
yeah, its a 5% reduce instead of 3,6%  in dungeon content where you could possibly take 50% more damage and the healer would still keep you up.
---
I think this is changing - particularly if one is in competitive e-sports and has some success.
---
It shows competitive spirit, ability to dedicate, improve, etc.
---
Gaming for gaming sake, you’re right,  but I could also care less if you’re casually paying tennis. If you are competitively playing tennis even with little success it counts, likewise for e-sports.
---
And its almost as if there is absolutely no need to summon anyone the 40 yards from spawn to the gate. I like the way you think sir
---
oof that guys bags are giving me anxiety
---
As a rogue in distracting the densest part and than pick off the last of the horde. IM HELPING
---
Really? As I said I looted around 7-15 vials of blood per alliance player.
---
Yeah I accidently joined a westcoast server as an eastcoaster. I'm chest-deep into a raiding guild already so I'm kinda boned unless they do this :/
---
nearly ever horde member would have a 10 loss to 1 win record in AV. "balanced" lol
---
&gt;  We expect some realms listed above to experience long queues after this step. We especially encourage players on **Arugal** , **Faerlina** , **Herod** , and **Whitemane** to use the Free Character Move service to avoid excessive queues. 
---
One of the overcrowded servers Blizzard asked people to transfer from, I believe several times. I don't think people who stayed nevertheless have any right to expect their server size complaints to be taken seriously. You should have transferred when given the chance.
---
I was initially confused about the dazed Warrior because he was heading the wrong way
---
I'm not a Hunter so idk about the details, but I have a good friend who's been playing the class for 14 years and says it works
---
Get dunked fat boy
---
Get a load of this guy
---
Incidentally, would it be safe to assume runes of perfection from WSG are also not available as they are sources of spell pen, too?
---
I love healing in BGs but I really wish mages were more willing to hand out water.
---
A little bit but at least casters have a large mana pool to work with, rogues and wars don’t need to worry about spamming as well.
---
Hunters in particular will have a very tiny mana pool where they just can’t afford to cast a lot of spells to keep things interesting. It’s move a couple steps, auto attack, move a couple steps, auto attack, ad infinitum.
---
No thanks. I'll stick with people that know how to use *have* instead of *of*...
---
Only from the first time you turn in the quest.
---
Myself (a rogue) and a warrior 2-manned a lieutenant last night, it felt super rewarding.
---
Lead your pvp opponent into deep water, root them, sea lion form away!
---
They are summoning them from outside the instance, silly! They just wanna pvp with their friends, that’s all.  ;p
---
Thats actually really good analogy for these types of UIs. I see a lot of people have their stuff all at the bottom which makes total sense because its easier to see in your periphery, as are car dashboards which are also designed for that purpose. Huh. Learn something now everyday i suppose! Thanks!
---
I'm just trying to grind it out to rank 10 personally, and I've gotten a lot of feedback of the same thing from others I've played with. We're old, we can't get rank 14, but we can get that sweet blue set
---
Dont think so, i did this at 60, xp rewards from a quest is replaced with gold, and only the first turn in gave me gold, everything after that only rep and honor. So dont think it wil give xp each turn because it aint giving gold at 60.
---
It's lose, not loose.
---
Just report the bots and get them kicked.
---
Problem solved.
---
You fish in my AV one more fuckin time buddy and I’ll hack your account and get us both banned.
---
You can see the bedpan in the picture if you look really close
---
Most people are just nice and want to help, so they do as they’re instructed. The thought that it’s a teammate griefing them probably never even enters their mind, until they’re in the portal room in Darnassus.
---
You fish in my AV one more fuckin time buddy, and I’ll hack your account, then get us both banned.
---
Is the solo princess gear more spell power focused?
---
Ok that makes sense.
---
And I’m sure this warlock is so altruistic that he selflessly farms only for his guild. All his rune cloth sure doesn’t go to his tailoring, you can bet that. He’s 100% making bandaids for his guildies. 
---
Who am I kidding this dude would probably vendor the cloth before he’d let someone else benefit over himself.
---
That sounds like an outlier, are you na or eu? Because na east battlegroup I don't think I've seen Ally beat us on bal/galv a single time in the past 2 days.
---
60 hunters: where do you farm food for your carnivore pet? im trying to save money so id rather kill for meat + skin instead of just buying from vendors (40 silver for 5 pieces no thanx)
---
some humanoids sometimes drop roasted quails but it's still a low droprate.
---
it would be simple if all lvl 50+ beasts dropped max happiness meat but they dont, so where do u get it? thanx
---
&gt;*these complaints were absolutely levied before the game’s release*
---
And they weren't addressed then, so why keep bringing it up?
---
Being able to play AV with friends would drastically solve a lot of issues I have with the battleground.
---
If I want to do anything, I'm usually by myself because I can't convince 39 other people to do what I want. As such, it makes sense to just follow the same braindead strategy game after game and run it down til you either win or lose.
---
Roll pve server. /pvp for the experience
---
Yep GM and an officer team is the way to go
---
Single best thing you can do... REPORT THE BUGS!  Developers can't fix what they don't know about...and the bugs that get the most reports move up the priority ladder.
---
I was getting 1 loss in 10 for the first couple days as Alliance, then it just fell off a cliff, lost like 6 in a row today. Idk if the better players hit exalted and quit or just bad luck
---
Just find where the majority of Horde are queuing and politely ask a mage for water.  Last night there were around 30-50 horde cycling in and out of the BG in the Alterac Mountains, north of Hillsbrad.   Was dead easy to grab water from one of the ones dueling while waiting for queues.
---
really? they only drop silver for me
---
Welcome to the Horde! Lok'tar ogar.
---
This is the only way. Else I feel a sense of incompleteness and my OCD eats at me.
---
and I still am
---
I wish i had an excuse for this. it's getting pretty late here though :[
---
We had that in vanilla too.
---
Yeah, you are right: I suggest you don't queue to WSG solo, this experience could be sad.
---
I could not imagine a better response. Well done.
---
When did thte wow classic community get so shitty? or am i trippin and it was always like this?
---
You still need element, recklessness etc ..
---
Yeah having great healers makes a huge difference because it allows the locks to effectively channel the healers mana bar into an extension of their own. I maybe stop to drink once or twice during a typical run such as after 3 pulling the first core hound packs while waiting for Luci to pat within range to pull because all the healers are drinking then as well.
---
How is a hunter top dps? Trash group?
---
Love this, what addons?
---
Because you were kind of a prick about it and were completely unjustified in your response.
---
Why are you here leaving rude comments that make no sense?
---
Hanters gonna Hant
---
Premades have always existed, back then and now. Either take the quick loss or just leave, all you can really do.
---
It’s the Alliance, like myself, who are pressured and forced into Drek rush or lose.  Us who don’t have epic mounts and get left behind then picked off by Horde, told to go corpsewalk and they fail to hold the graveyard.
---
It’s also the Alliance who rush off leaving people behind and hate it when they lose.
---
On a emotional level it’s such a huge swing from 7-10 min wins for rep or be stuck in 20-50 min turtle that half the Alliance don’t want to be in.
---
He has a right to complain, no one will treat it seriously though aside from couple of mentally challenged folks. Most of the servers have the population of full/high vanilla server, his own server has 2x of this but he had it coming.
---
You get +396 honour for killing Bal.. not 3k
---
Yeah, there are a few contributing factors to that. One, the Alliance starts closer to the Horde base than the Horde start to the Alliance base. Two, bunkers take slightly longer to take over than towers (not that this one really matters much). Three, the Alliance base is set up a little more defensively and has a very clear choke point, being the bridge. Four, the Alliance always rushes Drek and skips every bit of bonus honor, but the Horde always gets the extra honor. So even if the Horde loses, we still win in terms of honor gain (sometimes by over 3k). The Alliance earns reputation 3x faster than the Horde, though. The weird thing is that, after playing on several private servers, this is how the Alliance always plays. Even after the reputation race is over. The other weird thing is that the Horde always goes for the honor, even though WSG is better honor than AV.
---
Sometimes I feel like the only one who thinks a premade team- whether in this game, or Overwatch, or any team based competitive game- deserves to stomp all over randoms. That's the whole point of forming a team, to have much better coordination and thus, a higher chance of success.
---
Sure you can play a priest but you will never play like hydra. Just like you can rent a fast car and take it to track but you will never drive like the professionals. I can go to the local park and play a pickup basketball game does that mean I have no reason to watch the NBA?
---
No I am not. But I can emphasize with them. You clearly can't :P
---
All solved now, thanks
---
I was in a WSG just now with a bunch of Heartseeker and they literally were calling for us to afk and concede in the first minute after we lost the fight in middle.
---
Alliance always has 4 paladins and a priest constantly healing. Horde you have 1 druid who maybe heals sometimes and 1 full time shadow priest.
---
I went arms until 52 then switched prot and farmed dungeons for pre-BiS. Being prot helped me in dungeons and I always got groups. It is not needed but imo the extra tools make it great for dungeons. Concussive blow is fantastic when a low health mob is about to run off and agro other mobs for example
---
In that department, our guild has been a bit disgusting, with 2 different bindings, 2 eyes of sulf, 2 earthshakers and like 7 OEB's.
---
No spinals or Bonereavers though.
---
Because you are alliance probably. Horde has way longer queue. This is why this is mainly for Horde, because Horde farms rep a ton slower by constantly losing. Sure gets us the most honor per hour, but I would say maybe 10% are truly there for ranking, the rest just wants their rep.
---
The reason we have such long queues is because the alliance constantly wins which means they farm rep way faster resulting in fewer alliance queueing.
---
&gt;Now that bgs came out the PvP in bgs does not feel the same as WPvP. There's no excitement, no sudden rush of being attacked because you expect it. No feeling of revenge.
---
&gt;Be proud boys because you stuck it out, and bgs has totally fixed the problem.
---
???? 
---
how was that a problem?  that was literally the best thing that bg's just ruined
---
The more we play games the more we see them as a collection of assets and mechanics
---
thanks for your tip. i know about that but im an old fart with very basic skills &amp; gear, skinning &amp; LW as profs.... not planning on rerolling since it took me 300 hours &amp; 900 headaches to get to 60. those guys soloing bosses are elite players, i know I'd fail miserably if i tried hehe.
---
Yeah that's why I'm okay with some sort of cross server stuff. Arthas wasn't that bad, but it wasn't good. I played Horde originally there and I do think we were actually outnumbered 2:1 which was great for BGs. I ended up rerolling alliance between AQ and Naxx for PVE reasons and really didn't do BGs much on Alliance because queues were an hour or more a lot of the time.
---
I really want the community, and as Horde on Herod I think I'd be fine with a bit longer queues to only play with Herod people (depends on the exact queue length) but I don't think 2 hour queues are really reasonable either. But I still wish they'd done some pairing or small groups to balance it out. Everyone together seems really dumb.
---
Lol you must not have played a private server if you think that
---
It wouldn't be weird except this stat is already in the game, I don't think that's even the reason they held it back.
---
Thunderfury cannot be crafted until BWL comes out
---
I'm sure you've heard it before, but the honest truth is if you're not engineering you're gimping yourself for pvp. It was reasonable back in vanilla, but now because the vast majority of pvpers know how valuable it is it's become a requirement otherwise you put yourself at a massive disadvantage in every single fight
---
Feels like horseshit when shamens roll on resto leather. I don’t roll on cloth if there are priests. But it’s not my call.
---
I've had a few horde wins today and I don't know *why*. The alliance just... didn't kill Drek'thar before we killed every single Lieutenant, Commander, Balinda, and Vanndar. You might be right, alliance did get exalted faster, its possible a large amount of the good players (that don't care about rep) are already gone
---
Av has been out for 3 days.  To think it has a meta and to begin making suggestions about how to change it is laughably premature.
---
Sounds about right. What a reputation to have!
---
Representing Stalagg horde here, ready to make them quit again.
---
Ah okay, but the bindings still drop in MC?
---
Ty for not transferring there 
---
-Stalagg horde rogue
---
I've been living in raid spec for like a month, hardcoring dungeons. Here's my experience:
---
1) You do top dps in any extended fight. The aoe shatter coc whatever spec mages will jump out in front as soon as the tank lands his first ability on the hostiles, and you will be shooting frostbolt at whatever the tank is getting threat on / skull marked mob. You will almost always pull out ahead by the end of any pull with mobs that don't die in the initial burst from the aoe guy. You also do far and away more damage to bosses unless they're immune to frost or something, because pom+arcane power+frostbolt is an easy macro that says "fuck that guy right now" 
---
2) You don't fuck up the pull. I mean, if you really wanted to you could nova shit in a bad spot but if you just hang back and frostbolt skull, you are being the perfect dps boi. The other mage who is blizzarding or nova+coc shatter or whatever is pulling mobs and having to run around and try to shake them, ass pulling packs, and novaing mobs onto the priest who explodes. Ice barrier isn't *that* much hp, ice block has a 10 minute cooldown, and you're still wearing a bathrobe.
---
3) Basically the same utility, and in one specific case more. So you don't have improved nova for cooldown reduction, but you do have presence of mind so you can pom poly stuff that you really, really cannot allow to exist for a second and a half. Like when your warrior accidentally grabs two pulls, or the other mage panic backpedals into a patrol, or the lowbie can't make the skip. You still. have frost nova, you just have 8 more seconds of cooldown. And your chills aren't nearly as oppressive, so blizzard is just damage. It makes the exploding zombie room of Scholo more interesting, but that's about the only time I've found where I go "man I wish I was aoe spec, this would be a breeze"
---
Around ZF or Uld it will help to have a 1h and shield in your bag to switch to for bosses.
---
UD rogue detected
---
I never mentioned cross-realm whatsoever.
---
Thanks for the info
---
You just 1shot all of them with the .die bug and win...
---
The competition is real that is true but that's the nature of of the game...
---
Ok. Good to know
---
Yeah. If you’re going to pay for a tank, first orb on res is a good way to do it too. Zero hassle and ensures no one loses money on any given run.
---
On the OCE realms ally were winning for the first day before horde adapted, now it's either 8 min ally win or 30-60 minute turtle for a horde win, about 50/50 for each
---
We can’t even use Sulfuras, can we?
---
Yes. You need BWL to smelt elementium bars.
---
Stay in school, kids.
---
Okay UD rogue
---
Since going back to classic I’m playing the old way again... enjoying the story and the beauty of the world. It took me 15 years to build a proper gaming PC but I can play on ultra now and it’s freaking gorgeous.
---
I like to groom, I mean help, those level 47s train until they become a level 48 then I congratulate them, then spit roast them
---
oh yeah your right. Just logged into check and my gear had dura damage. Still think its not worth going naked though cos of bowmen. Interesting point though.
---
Make a mage.
---
I made a mage first literally just because its the best at gold farming but my mains are a druid and a warlock!
---
Spec SL and laugh as they hit you for nothing.
---
Okay, thanks. I think that’s what I was confused about. Appreciate the response! Cheers.
---
It’s one guy
---
I disabled ALL addons and I still get it
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sm7KGTju2lw
---
Windseeker what's up!! Favorite rogue on the server, Keif. Also your name reminded me to clean out the bottom of my grinder, so thanks!
---
Fair points. I think overall population plays into it as well.
---
Trust me any Faerlina player knows their names, they're grinding honor.
---
Hi, /u/TBizzle123
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/eaahdj/classic_av/). 
---
&gt; especially for healers who can get groups rather fast. 
---
What planet do you live on? DPS have an easier time getting groups than healers do. There are an overabundance of healers in Classic.
---
It’s somewhat anecdotal but winning did give more but it took 3 times as long as doing the honor farm and losing. We lost so often as horde that I averaged that I got around 350 rep per 7 minute loss. To give you a concrete answer. Wait for AV weekend. Or just do it passively. You can’t coordinate all 39 other people to help you maximize your rep farm when half want honor. A quarter want a quick loss and the other quarter want to Zerg van.
---
We have no bear, just a cat, chicken and 3 healers!
---
If it doesn't sell at a reasonable price on the AH, find your server's discord and post it there.  It's BIS for frost mages, so it is in demand.  Discord is just a chat program and you would typically negotiate for a gold price and either CoD them the item or list on the AH at that price.
---
As for selling gold/items outright for cash, you really want to steer clear of them.  It is against the Terms of Service to accept anything but in game currency in exchange for in game items.  So selling gold for money or items for money is expressly forbidden and you will get a ban if caught by the GMs.  Personally, there isn't anything that I must have immediately that I would risk my account for.  Others feel differently.  Which is why there is an industry around it.
---
I gotcha. Everything I’ve ever learned about melee weaving has always been for atleast 2 targets at the same time so you don’t even really have to move. Melee’ing one target in the downtime of your autoshot cd etc
---
I was waiting for the second wave of mounted travelers to come through (the 60% plebs) but perhaps they were too slow to make it in time for the video.
---
Looks like there's a seriously salty idiot who's quite jealous of you. Grats!
---
Not everyone trying to rank is going for R14. R10 is easily attainable and has a ton of good gear.
---
"I don't want to work hard, but can I still get R14?"
---
That’s true, but heartseeker wasn’t the only server people went to right? Just a majority looking at population and the amount of alliance on heartseeker. But if they are cowards aren’t the people who transferred to other servers “cowards” as well?  The only difference is heartseeker being one of the few if not only alliance dominated PvP servers. Not sure which other servers were an option, I think Earthfury and Arcanite Reaper, but honestly I have no idea. I guess someone has to claim it.
---
But vanilla had cross realm BGs. The AV as they are now is how AV was in vanilla. A rush to both sides without any pvp in the middle. At most, I remember it being like 5 people would wait in Drek's room to try and slow the alliance down long enough for horde to win but that was with people in BWL+AQ40 gear.
---
Furor is 40 energy and wolfshead is 20 so you get 60 from a powershift
---
Assuming you have hit pieces to swap yes. If you don’t stick with Elven until you do.
---
That's fine, but know that the majority of people doing AV right now do.
---
:( Hope you still enjoyed the clip
---
I do that to my DH friend on retail. He's been farming the Warglaives of Azzinoth on both his DH and rogue chars, and I have both of them on my paladin.
---
What do you think breaking addons is?  Anyone can install them, but Blizz broke Spy anyways, due to people having complained in mass, much like people **complaining** about being unfairly being flagged and kicked from BGs.
---
But as an arcane mage I have only 1 semi useful aoe attack
---
yeah, judging by that, either the entire thing was faked for the sake of the joke, or the guy complaining is a legit lunatic
---
&gt; I came up with this build: Build
---
if i was in your shoes, i would spec now to 31-18-0 and finish leveling. stay 31-20 arms/fury for the easier dungeons while getting starter tank gear set and knocking out quests to build some gold. 
---
then i'd go 31-5-15 to hit the harder dungeons and pvp a bit.
---
You up?
---
Thanks, thats what I thought about selling for Money, just wanted to be sure.
---
Yeah true.
---
The first walk through the forest was great to see it all for the first time.
---
The next few times revealed new details that I'd missed before as I knew where I was going and had time to take more in.
---
After a while, the walk was getting a bit boring so I started running to speed it up, not taking as much in.
---
Now I just drive my car through it as I just want the journey over with as fast as possible :P
---
Good question, but idk.  I have never seen someone even try.
---
everything in this pic makes me feel so sad.....looks so poor, unhealthy, uncomfortable.... i pray that you can play with a big ass screen, standing desk/gaming chair and proper gaming keyboard &amp; mouse. if i had lotsa money i'd set you up good bro... WoW should be a feel good experience, not a painful torture on cheap setup. but i understand, i played the first few years like that, even started in internet cafes back in 05 since i had no puter! good luck mate!
---
Quit queueing AV and go get your Epic Mount
---
As long as you are off the GCD when you use a powershift macro like this:
---
!cancelform
---
/cast Travel Form
---
You will shift instantly, if you are on the GCD when you hit it you will be in human form until the GCD is up then you will shift.
---
I would highly recommend not to honestly. I just hit 60 on my Druid (immediately went to respect boomy ofc) and I cannot express how insanely good/fast/easy feral leveling is. I originally intended to level as Balance as well but gave up on that very very quickly.
---
Lies. Lies and slander!!
---
This fate is well deserved if yer a stealthie sitting AFK in the open or along a high traffic route.
---
Is this a troll post?
---
they got it at 22...
---
You lost cos it knew you’re the sort of cu t to say lel
---
Dude, why the fuck are you even playing the game? 
---
Do you actually enjoy it or is it just another medium for you to get your elitist rocks off on?
---
Probably from people with better luck. Results oriented thinking.
---
just right click the icon on mini map and enter from there.  no need to disable anything that way
---
Is there a BiS guide for this?
---
Not false
---
Don julios give 1% hit as well.
---
Probably a weeb
---
Tanking some of the late game instances at 58 is tough, but certainly possible. If you are having trouble joining a group, try to get a guild healer and make your own. People are much more likely to join a group that has the tank/heal positions filled.
---
As far as counting on quickly getting MC/Ony gear -&gt; don't do it. You simply have no way of knowing how many weeks it will take to replace a specific slot.
---
&gt;Unfortunately, reaching r14 won’t happen for 98% of the players.
---
That's kinda the point
---
This going to be the raw version or cooked version?
---
Tbh i can see in AV who's done any fighting at all and who hasnt, and maybe its just confirmation bias or recency bias, but in my AV runs most people who gave up early were from Earthshaker.
---
Just wait until the shitshow that is the BWL attunement,
---
I'm pretty liberal but the part about the bars "sustaining the guild" was a good laugh too. I'm sure that guy selflessly donates all of his expensive mats.
---
I was looking for a server to roll Horde. PvP/PvE doesn’t matter. West coast preferable but I’m a flexible guy.
---
I legit love the new noobs. It brings back amazing memories of how much of a noob I was but was still better than a lot of the people I find. 
---
Example I play rogue run into a mage. 
---
Sap to wait for ice barrier to fall, instead of waiting for me to open up I walk away to let my energy to recap. Mage then ice blocks, then freezes the ground, blinks. Doesn’t redo barrier. I then walk up stun and kill him in 3 shots. 
---
Biggest difference between what used to happen is that the mage won’t go to forums to complain how op rogues are. They’ll just add me on Bnet and tell me how terrible of a person I am for killing them.
---
Took me about 16 hrs to hit exalted
---
Let these fools be mad. Always appreciate a good basement troll gif. Southpark has quite a way with words and images. If they're sick of seeing unoriginal content then they should make some themselves hahaha.
---
if u add the copper &amp; skillup numbers up the result is 70.....SO CLOSE. 😂
---
Not when you have a group of people purposely abusing the system which is what’s happening. They are spam reporting people not from their groups trying to get other members in.
---
Hahahaha that durability damage and all the food that he keeps eating just to instantly stop
---
I used to think developers ruined my MMORPG experience. Now I realize it was myself.
---
&gt;easily attainable
---
I would think about the things that you have issues with in your loot council. Are they objective issues or subjective? If they are objective issues your concerns are probably deeper than the loot system (if the female loot priority is really only because she’s female not because she’s the best rogue, etc.). If they are subjective, then look at why you feel that way (if someone better than you is getting loot, that’s not a problem with the system). Loot council is definitely an effective system in an objective guild. If a player expects loot they need to perform adequately.
---
Correct
---
You heard it here folks. No fun allowed in the world of warcraft. Only serious business in this video game.
---
Yeah that's going to be fun, we definitely just go through ubrs.
---
What are those raid frames?
---
Druids are very sought after for Naxx, T3 is insanely good.  One druid tank healing to keep the 350 HP buff up on the tanks, and another raid healing and rejuv spam for the rage/energy/mana gain(rank 1 when little to no healing is needed, ranked up when it is).  The gear by then largely makes up for their shortcomings in earlier content.  
---
Progression guilds will bring at least 2 resto druids to Naxx.
---
Nope. Revenge on lower levels.
---
The cycle must continue.
---
BuT mAh OpTiMiZaTiOn
---
It's alright-- fish anywhere at lvl 1 is the mechanic in Retail and has been for many years. Easy to get rulesets mixed up.
---
People get so triggered when they see ret pallies
---
Druid warrior. Never get kited again and be your own pocket healer with hots and swiftness
---
Ruling The gold shire duel fest was always my game. And making new friends. My greatest achievement was outkiting this really good 60 war at 52. The duel ended and he said “whoa boys we got a mover” never felt so proud. That’s still why I play this game but people don’t just chill in goldsbire for shits n giggles anymore
---
It is a PvE server.
---
what exactly do you mean? How would you stack for reduced warlock threat?
---
How engaging is Rogue to play when leveling? 
---
Recently leveled a Paladin, had a fun time with the class but for all the sturdiness of it it was a bit boring.
---
Now I've got extra gold for weapons and mounts I wanted to play an alt, on a PVE server if that makes any difference to my playstyle as a Rogue. 
---
Ty!
---
I'd rather have someone nice in there, than you.
---
its amazing to me that anyone is dumb enough to fall for that.
---
Who do you think you're summoning dummy? Someone 5 feet away locked behind the gate? lol
---
go die, thanks :S
---
I am pretty sure that regardless of being 305 or 310 skill you still need 6% to cap yellow attacks. I don’t think you hit the next threshold until higher than 310 because of significant DRs.
---
There are no bosses a warrior can't tank, and for vast majority of encounters warriors are better than bears.
---
I hope they release the attunement quest before the actual release of BWL. Would make BWL a little less of a shit show.
---
A warrior with stealth and those cooldowns would also be pretty scary
---
I have seen collusion, where the players of one class agree not to bid on the same items as each other, so they save points to bid against other classes. This effectively makes their points worth more, since they effectively buy more items.
---
This is mitigated to a large degree with minimum bids for class specific gear.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/us/faerlina/feythe
---
14/32/5
---
Yeah.
---
At what lvl can u equip blue and epic AV rewards btw?
---
Have you rebooted? How many times?
---
PvE server. Lots of bots, lots of farmers. I can buy rugged leather for 1.2g/stack, and felcloth at 3g a pop. It's great for consumers, but hard to make mount money.
---
Yeah of course. You guys can farm uncontested
---
Why would warriors hate this?
---
Mage and warlock.  Lol jk they’re the same thing
---
Yeah, I have perditions but haven't had luck with an MC OH. Or the NS leggings.
---
Maybe play with some friends/guild.
---
Yeah this is what the people above us don't realize. Unless you send your own mages/hunters at the enemy raid, this causes the horde to get Belinda first. 
---
You shouldnt mount off and fight the intercepters, you should be spread out so they can't nova the whole raid easily. They shouldn't be able to get more than 5-10 people
---
I think 5-10 servers would make a lot more sense. But yea as much as I want it to be server only, as I really enjoyed the somewhat balanced world PvP when I could find it (hilarious on some level to me that I play on the opposite of what I played on in vanilla, stalagg alliance is super outnumbered) but I also get that alliance on stalagg seem to be outliers a lot. We have some really strong guilds that make the wins really worth it, but I understand other servers don’t have that luxury.
---
It’s 149.5%. Threat modifiers always multiply, they never add.
---
Cross realm bgs were added in 1.12, that accounts for 25% of Vanillas  lifespan.
---
Stop acting like a 12 year old and he won't post a 12 year old meme.
---
I'll have to check out Healcomm thx 
---
When I got into my first raid I asked my friend about healing assignments because I thought that was the best way to do it...was told to prioritize the tank and rest was a free for all lol it was chaos
---
People don't like honesty.
---
What else happened?
---
because the changes are obviously the cause?
---
i used to be able to play av with my friends. it is impossible now. and av in its current form is going to dominate pvp because of how much honor it gives. meaning anyone serious about ranking plays the game alone.
---
this is directly the result of blizzards choices
---
I don't have all, just some...will check em out thx!
---
"ur just as bad as trump"  
---
How to tell you are talking to an overgrown toddler.
---
I'll probly switch to exactly that in a couple weeks.. Just right now my guild sometimes needs a healer but we have some healers almost 60 :P Also good point about hit cap over mitigation for threat
---
Pretty much agree with everything you said, except we don't have to wait till P3 but I agree it's fine to let a warrior grab it and just mcp P3
---
Did not know that thanks :o
---
Multi shot is based on weapon damage, which due to the speed of the crossbow it has more of. Weapon damage for doesn’t mean what the weapon alone does, it is the combination of your attack power, weapon, and attack speed.
---
Wtf? Why?
---
I get bothered when it takes more than 3 seconds to say I’m ready to enter
---
and cross realm was the beginning of the end of the community.
---
Dominos, easyframes, nugenergy, FPS/ms addon, don't remember the name, lorti UI and a texture pack.
---
Is Paranoided a new rogue skill?
---
Paladin warlock. Twice the bubbles.
---
This system breaks if there is collusion between the leader and members of the raid. The leader can echo high bids to his friends, so they never overbid by too much.
---
Eenis penvy
---
The main difference is we have 9 minute queues, so the longer we are in the bg the more rep and honor we get compared to alliance who have instant queues and wont as many bg's as possible in an hour.
---
Hit for hit on this one so it’s a good switch.
---
I put life stealing on my IBS and it procs every third hit or so ...
---
FW Gy is absolutely not pointless to cap and defend. Horde having FW GY is how turtles happen.
---
Yeah. I'd say AB is my least favorite "game" of the three BGs, but it has the best pvp action. Small scale, dynamic, not a race to run away/escape.
---
Every phase of gear gets worse and worse for healing if you allow it to be chaos. When you have TOO many healers though, it really doesn't matter.
---
Allies collect crystals and we collect blood? Are...we the baddies?
---
Kodo tho ;-;....its alright. I'm still having TONS of fun just exploring stuff still, and chatting with strangers. It's not the end of the world or anything, and I knew it was an awful idea, but if no one spoke their mind this world would be a dreary place to live in. :p
---
Multi shot damage is based on weapon damage, which due tot he speed of the crossbow it has more of. Weapon damage does not mean the number on the weapon alone; it factors in your attack power and weapon speed.
---
go anger management fury. it's great for tanking dungeons and dps
---
But let say u raid now, you get MC gear, and BWL u need BWL , same for Aq nax etc..... at least when u select a bracket to BG. You can stay efficient even without the enchant. Last time on nost, me and my wife stayed level 29 until we reach exalted with WSG and AB. After that we started to level
---
Warrior Paladin. So I could get taunt and a proper Prot tree on a paladin.
---
You sound like a religious person. Only do good if you can get something from it.
---
Just you wait for later phases. Warlocks are shit right now relative to their maximum potential.
---
You only need 6% hit if you have 305 weapon skill. Anything beyond 305 is heavily affected by dr as well.
---
Severely doubt it, faction changes weren't added for a long time in retail
---
One for rejuv buff is often all you really need. 2-3 is fine. 6 set bonus for tank buff is often achieved when you are at the end of progress anyway. Considering you often bring 12-14 healers on naxx progress, they are underrepresented compare to the others.
---
The bigger issue is nobody knows *who* is going for side objectives. Its easy to say send 5 people, but nobody knows which 5 in a pug.
---
Seid ihr euch bewusst, dass ihr für die Horde der größte Abschaum auf Patchwerk seid?
---
Its #nochanges. People did that when cross realm bgs first came out, though the auto kick function adds to the dickishness. Back in the day it was "help us summon" and drop a mage portal
---
you mean the build i made? or some build in particoular?
---
The word you're looking for is empathize
---
The same reason people love Skyrim is why WoW was so cool to casuals. Maybe they weren't competitive raiders or High Warlords, but they were for the first time in a fully populated, rich world that they could explore. I think people are forgetting that open world wasn't really a big thing in '04.
---
Hunter and Hunter.
---
Because my two favorite classes and I don't understand the question.
---
Shaman + Paladin becomes an unkillable tank with insanse burst damage so I'd go with that.
---
In BC they made the riding skill very expensive and the mounts cheaper, and the skill worked across faction mounts. You still couldn't buy opposite faction mounts but it made collecting those on your own faction much easier.
---
I tank strat live alot and always do round Robin for orbs.  Some people just don't know what things are and will roll greed on it etc. But yeah,  if group loot is on, group loot is on.
---
Sounds a lot like an alliance problem tbh -- which is ironic because a lot of the complain threads about AV appear to come from alliance players claiming its the horde complaining when we couldn't be a better position to enjoy AV.
---
I can solo them v as a hunter but why would I? Better to just solo kill a few horde and get more honour for myself than for everyone who keeps running and leaves half the raid to die.
---
Literally everything benefits heavily from smart stance dancing.
---
The word you're looking for is discovery. It's why Zelda and Maria games continue to top the charts. You can min max it, but the experience of discovery can't be relived.
---
TIL some people can click the accept button.  I thought minimap was the ONLY way
---
actually screw it, weirdo, [here's your proof](https://imgur.com/gallery/wus01HC)

Priest and warlock. Infinite Mana dots fear
---
Yep, there is.   
---
Mostly from this guide:  
---
[https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?p=5018](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?p=5018)  
---
There are some items I find not so effective in terms of overall toughness, but it mostly wraps up all things about Shaman Tank.
---
you ask for end game duo and most replies here are about leveling.... if u just want to raid then just pick your favorite class altho pure dps classes such as rogue/hunter/etc. are abundant so u will have a lot of competition. Tanks are #1 demand followed by healers. Two healing classes make the most sense imo, so you always have each other's back, my personal picks would be Shammy + Drood.
---
Mh, so what do you suggests? for me at least 3 point in tac mastery is a must to enjoy this class.
---
Mind sharing how you farmed so much gold as holy?
---
This sounds like Rift. A Bard Sabateur was my favorite combination in that game.
---
what is a "break"? is that something casual players do?
---
MMOs need a revolution IMO. Something where it feels massive and genuinely organic. I'm waiting for a game that can dynamically carve out terrain, allow dynamic shaping of rivers and geoforming stuff along with being able to build stuff like castles and forts. Realistic physics I think in an MMO would be insane but I don't see tech getting there any time soon. Most """MMOs""" like WoW can't even have more than 40 people in an area without it lagging. Wonder if there'll be an MMO that comes out one day that has hundreds to thousands of people in an area without lag. 
---
Something about lack of innovation and tech just makes modern MMOs super boring to me. I don't know if I'm outgrowing them in my 30s now or if they're just stagnant.
---
Did Wpvp as a horde on Heartseeker during P2. Gotta say it was hilarious seeing the alliance complain like a bunch of babies whenever they got killed 4v1.
---
If your lazy right click general on the chatbar go to settings go to other turn off system messages.
---
Who needs a mom when you have a brand new computer :D
---
Why dont they just bring their own supplies to a raid ?
---
Have you tried since BGs came out? Lot fewer enemies out in the world right now
---
crit, 16ap and hit, its pretty hard to beat for something you can farm in less than a week.
---
Dunno lul, it usually takes about 8 seconds for our warrior to get 4k aggro, guess how much it takes for me.
---
waiting... for queues? what is this sorcery?
---
Not taking FW GY is how you cause turtles, by having horde constant respawning next to you and rushing in to wipe you.
---
WEE-OO-EE-OO FUN POLICE YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
---
Some people need to visit a theme park. Then again, they might try to speedrun the roller coaster.
---
Once Zul’Gurub launches we’ll also have the Zandalari Raptor and Tiger you can potentially win, and one of the Brewfest mounts is a Ram (or Kodo). So there’s options for other faction mounts, kinda, but you gotta get lucky.
---
You do realize that 450dps is incredibly low, right? Incredibly low.
---
My anger was far worse when I was a clan leader in runescape as a young teenager lol. Not so much anymore. Frustration would probably be a better word.
---
Warrior+Mage. Would essentially be the Battle Mages from Strat Live, but better.
---
Clickers, clearly
---
Same way you report players of your own faction.I play horde and report bot dwarfs with boar pets named pig all the time.
---
Totally.
---
fuckin weirdo
---
I was just explaining to the other guy how they do it. Personally idc about changes vs no changes as long as the majority is enjoying themselves and they dont stray crazy far from what the game was.
---
I consider it a dick move, whatever form of tricking people out of the bg, back in 06 or whenever I was playing, we had to sometimes wait an hour to get into the big then  some dick tricks you I to leaving or boots you for afk when your clearly ready to go.
---
On private servers you still had zergs with original AV. Just much more organized and they were 7-8 min long.
---
u got that right bro.... he IS getting back, sooner or later, it is as inevitable as taxes, dentist &amp; death.
---
2-6 hour spawns would be crazily excessive (people would immediately complain as that’d be very retail-like), and would allow some serious problems as those interested in griefing could easily do so with more frequency. Cutting the respawn cooldown to 1 day instead of 3 would be better.
---
And as I said, we have a guild that fields 8 raid teams. Not counting non-raiders and people in its feeder guilds (I’m not sure of the size of these, but it has at least one or two). They can and do easily have people on for nearly every spawn. Those they haven’t snagged have been gotten by another group. Only one kill thus far has been outside of these two teams. Even if they have the loot, limiting access to the potential recipes/patterns from these bosses still holds value for these teams. They’ll continue to compete for these for quite some time.
---
Related question: how is boomkin in PvP?
---
My boyfriend is convinced that he'll be a good flag carrier but I dunno
---
You can get a Kodo from Brewfest, but it’s a really rare drop. Of course I’m not sure if that’s in Vanilla or if it started in TBC.
---
Is there a way when in cat/bear/whatever form to switch back to normal? For example: I can bind cat form to a key but while in cat form I can't bind a key to switch back. Thank you!
---
I would say turn of that questing add-on but we all know that reading the text for vauge locations gets old by the time you reach lvl 20
---
Peek a Boo bitch!
---
I used to think perception was garbage until I rolled a horde rogue...
---
Looks like 55-60 depending on pieces.
---
That's BC, the alliance got a ram that was pretty cool too
---
If the 49 bracket dies you're hosed. It's best to have a main and find a 19,29,39,49.. Im gonna skip the 49s tho.
---
i made it from 45 to 48 by just slamming my warrior into ZF over and over, but my girlfriend pretty much gave up and we rerolled to a pve. She's very much enjoying nelf hunter.
---
Whats the hit cap for white skills with 305 weapon skill?
---
Druid shaman. I could form hop, chain heal, res, and ankh. Plus inntervate and manatide
---
My beleaguered human rogue on Skeram decided to take a nice fishing vacation after a rough month in Blackrock Mountain.
---
Per return
---
You know, some classes have very obvious best race picks on the alliance side. Gnome Warrior and Dwarf Priest are no-contest the best combos, for example.
---
As a dude who loves death rolling, I don't care if someone logs after I lose. I already gave you the gold.
---
The mage scream is on point.
---
Mage plus anything would be crazy because it lets you get the glass-cannon damage from the arcane and fire trees in addition to the damage mitigation from the frost tree. AP/PoM/Pyro, Blast wave, combustion, cold snap, ice block, and ice barrier.  Just imagine AP+PoM+Pyro from the safety of an ice barrier.
---
Mage+paladin would be unbelievably durable with plate, a full bubble, a melee bubble (BoP), and heals in addition to the ice block, ice barrier, and cold snap mentioned above.
---
On the other hand, rogue or druid would get you a sneakmage (with heals, in the case of druid).
---
You definitely have not. Even in TBC when the crit bonus was 5% instead of 3% and balance druids didn't oom in 30s, it was always a net loss for raid dps to bring one.
---
we get it, bad words are too much for you to handle. No one cares...
---
No
---
Yes, and it's very obvious to see now. The entire value of classic's single-realm community is out the window, and you're thrown in with a bunch of random people, most of whom do not care one bit just how toxic they are to you, nor are they concerned with any repercussions from it.
---
As much as the queue times would get boring, especially on my smaller realm, I'd love to have the cross-realm nature removed. This obviously wouldn't work for the PVP realms, especially the ones that are so one-sided as to be dead/de-facto PVE, but...
---
I did it some weird backwards way, I kept /reload my UI and pressing the accept button right after because whatever is erroring that button isn't loaded by that time.
---
Still winning almost all as alliance
---
Galv is waste of time now imo, dont get honor and already exalted
---
Better to just round up all lit and captains in centre and aoe down then storm drek
---
When horde do win it is a 20+ min game
---
🐻 form would like to have a word
---
Dumbest fuckin character icon I've seen in a while, so hipster-y. And that side look and head tilt makes it seem as if it's not an mmorpg, but a girly shovelware wii game.
---
There is a streamer/YouTuber called MadSkillzzTV that has  great elvUI and add-on profiles for every healing class in the game. The only catch is you need to be a twitch sub or join his YT channel (both cost $4.99/month) to have access. If you have twitch prime, you can just use it on his channel and get the profiles essentially for free.
---
3300 per turn in
---
But with the double exp wouldn't it make some sense to take advantage of that? I am not sure what exp I am getting from AV beyond just the quest hand in, guessing some exp from killing random stuff
---
Right?  What is it paying rent? Your guild got a high water bill this month?
---
Thank u for this info, will try to get all of those gear!
---
Easy sunder, tab, sunder, tab ,revenge (if able), tab sunder. Repeat till every one is dead. Taunt if you need to. For dungeons of course. And shield block when you need it.
---
Honestly this. You can throw some bleeds up but mostly sit in bear form. If you're in cat form you're risking getting frozen and eating a 2k aimed shot.
---
AV is good now because everyone wants it for rep. Give it 2 or 3 and weeks and queues will increase substantially.
---
DELETE THIS!
---
I logged on last name night, tried to quest in the plaguelands and got ganked within 5 minutes of logging on.  Was good times.
---
How do I get to Talonbranch Glade from Auberdine by walking/running?
---
That's just not true. Plenty of guilds do 20m mcs, mine included and we are not a hc guild. Pretty much any half serious guild should be able to do it with their best 20 players.
---
It hits two targets and each hit triggers a SS charge. So you hit both with Cleave and SS.
---
Horde player?
---
Give up
---
Healers should never have to use it if you have a feral druid.
---
Sup fellow druid! No questions but I got a flag cap last night and it was glorious
---
You're still eating up a debuff slot though. And it also sounds like your fury warriors were bad.
---
His Rogue vids are some of my all time favorites. Hunter pvp unfortunately, for me, just isn't very interesting to look at.
---
Didn't like the music choice either.
---
Heartseeker dodging pvp- that's literally their purpose in life, to dodge pvp and be cowards.
---
It's good to see even with a premade and equal numbers, they're still a bunch of dodging losers.
---
This sub in a nutshell.
---
Oh no, people having a laugh? Relax Gloomy von Negative, don't get so personal (triggered) watching people actually enjoying themselves
---
hey man, ever since i ran this (which perfectly served its purpose btw, i no longer see the correct count on spells in my action bar that require reagents. Do / Did u have the same?   
---
I initially thought it was an elvui issue, but some guildie without bag addons ran that line (cus i shared it) and now has the same issue with her warlock spells. Any idea?
---
Well he said HOTW pvp spec so I assume he's not gonna pve in it. Primal fury is not needed for Pvp at all.
---
They could easily combine smaller realms or those with imbalances into battlegroups by hand. 2-3 server battlegroups could still have a community
---
The big servers dont need it though
---
Can druids use daggers?!
---
Just watch out for misclicking that "leave queue" button.
---
I mean I personally don't go for the most efficient methods. I like it as something to do while I watch a show or movie so I pick things to do that don't require too much attention even though they might not be the most efficient and I just set varying small goals for myself rather than trying to rush a skill to 99 as fast as possible; I don't think that would be fun for me. I still don't have any 99s yet and I play on/off but it's a chill game that I always come back to and I can always basically pick up where I left off vs wow where if I take a break for a few months suddenly I have to catch up on all the new gear/lvling/etc.
---
Something that suits both dps and tank role is the standard arms pvp build. If youre tanking as an arms warrior youre never in defensive stance so theres no point in putting anything in there. And with a few xceptions like the aoe packs in strat live you wont be using a shield either.
---
Since you want to keep tactical mastery your only options are arms pvp and impale prot. And with prot you will not feel like a dps at all.
---
It's been aids today.
---
Instead of zerging people are intercepting which turns every game into a 40 min slog because every dead player can't get through so they will just delay the other team instead. It's horrible.
---
Ye
---
All the rogues in my guild got it:)
---
Thanks but.... I don't think you read my title.¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Sunder doesn't effect your auto attack. Whereas Heroic Strike takes the place of your auto attack so it actually spends rage and prevents you from gaining it for that swing. Slam spends rage and resets your auto attack swing timer.
---
TECHNICALLY \*nerd voice\* Slam is the best option, but this requires using it correctly, which is a lot of work. This macro actually helps a lot if you want to focus on optimizing your Slams:
---
*  \#showtooltip Slam 
---
* /stopattack 
---
* /cast Slam 
---
* /startattack 
---
Using this macro when you have the rage and your swing timer is less than the Slam cast time (1-1.5 seconds depending on talents) will give you the best results. A swing timer addon is usually required for this.
---
From the sounds of it you are seeing the best results from Sunder because it doesn't effect your swing timer. So it is definitely a good option if you want to do the "casual" route. Heroic Strike should only be used as a rage dump.

i hate to be the reality check guy but always have a plan B. i played no life wow in 2005 and quit a bit after TBC release because of, kinda like you, found an awesome job and girl with serious marriage &amp; family bright future type of scenario aspirations. i thought we'd live happily ever after and i was glad to not be a no life gamer anymore. but then illness struck me, couldn't make enough money to keep the dream alive, she was annoyed, we fought, i found myself going to internet cafes because she was mad, so while i was there i had to watch wow videos, because back in 2006, it was the biggest game ever and the hype was just too intense to ignore. a few months later, i woke up with divorce papers for me to sign on the breakfast table. it was such a nightmare that i swore to myself to never try that standard "career+wife+kids" model that isn't meant for everyone (and is highly overrated imo) . so i went back to the solo gamer life and since then my illness and suicidal tendencies have gone away. i get to work small jobs here and there, enough to pay the minimal bills and i can fully embrace my hardcore fighter nature. having a steady job, &amp; a loving family is very light, fluffy and joyful, but i believe there is a fighter inside all of us who NEEDS to go on the battlefield, hear weapons clinging, armor breaking, death cries, etc.... some people go all or nothing, ie they are either 100% social/family guy or 100% no life combatant. it's possible to be a little bit of both i guess, like a hybrid class irl but it seems pretty rare and hard to pull off as partners &amp; kids want your dedication and will get jealous of games/sports. maybe it's all gonna work out for you, i wish it does if it's what you really want but at the same time, if it's not your true calling then don't try to force it and do what's gonna keep you the healthiest the longest. good luck!
---
And I just got the mask!
---
It is literally the definition of antisocial behavior. I assume that mages on your server offer to sell food/water for some amount in various locations around the world. They do this because it’s a nice thing for them to offer the community (equivalent vendor water several times more expensive) and to turn a small profit for the time they spend selling services. Time is money friend.
---
The only way you can get water that doesn’t cost 6-10g for 6 stacks is asking a mage on your server, and it generally only costs a single gold, which can be made in about one or two minutes of playtime for the average player.
---
And yet, you would rather queue for AV, spend xx minutes to get into a game (5-10 minutes for me), get water from a mage, and then AFK out instead of using that water to actually try to win the game or at least make a passable effort.
---
It would be faster to farm the gold and buy water/food from a mage, yet you deliberately take a resource from someone who will use it in the group activity they queued for, in order to use it somewhere else for most likely a solo activity you are doing 100% for your benefit.
---
So either you are so lazy that you are literally hurting yourself by wasting your own time that could be spent more efficiently, so cheap that you value money over time (hint one of those is a finite resource), or so antisocial that you take resources from a group with a common goal to use them 100% for yourself.
---
Heck, I make water and food and ports for my guild mates for free and will event port to them to help them out! Are you actually saying that you don’t have a guild? Or in the case you do, maybe your guild mates know you are anti social and don’t want to help you? Or maybe your guild doesn’t have any mages? 
---
This is what I mean by you being antisocial. You could easily get it for free from your guild mages. Is there any reason why you wouldn’t?
---
Phase 3 is bwl.
---
Regardless of the meta I would like to play with my friends. 
---
Isnt that what classic wow was about? 
---
Why the fuck is the severely dominating form of pvp essentially solo gameplay?
---
&gt; draenei females
---
That's.. a funny way to spell [Redacted]..
---
That’s awesome.
---
I farmed this one bot at the STV Murlocs, I just kept him super low hp and hit him every time it tried to eat. Eventually burned thru all his food and it wouldn’t rez anymore
---
I just realized that I’m sorry forgive me 🤣
---
One issue with that is that large gold sinks encourage buying gold to get it now, whereas small regular gold sinks encourage farming for it.  
---
All classes are quite able to farm up 40-80g per week for raid mats and respecs, simply via dungeons and grey drops if nothing else.  Whereas 900g for epic mount takes a month of planning and not spending.  And once it's done, you won't buy another.  
---
So although the amount of money taken out of the economy in the short term is the same, the mindset of the player is different, and in the long term you either need to keep introducing new gold sinks that the players want or you keep the steady drain going.
---
Looks almost like league binds with main abilities on Q E
---
Considering the fact that most people are doing this for a particular grind, be it honor or reputation, it matters more how much you're earning per hour, rather than per match. The rep grind people just want to be done with it sooner, and the honor grind people are competing with everyone else on their server to earn the most total, not most per match.
---
So yes, 5k honor and however much reputation is terrible if it takes you the better part of an hour to gain, when you could instead be gaining \~3k honor and reasonable amounts of reputation in a quarter of the time.
---
That is, a ten minute 2500 honor game (easily doable for either side) is way better than a 45 minute 5k honor game, even if you have a ten minute queue to get in (which isn't the case even for horde).
---
Sounds like he’s having a bad day/week/month IRL.
---
Isn't that the worst part, though? Imagine 12000 people camping that mob for the quest.
---
good troll but if you really want I can also post a literal video of it
---
bgs are a part of phase 3, in fact they are the main part, they have drastically changed the pvp scene of the game.  a new raid?  so what, nothing changes.  bwl is 3.5
---
Feral is a trash pvp spec.  Absolute trash.
---
I’ll believe it when I see it!
---
After using the purple skeletal warhorse for 2 months, i got a bit tired of it because the hooves make so much sound lol. The wolf has a nice riding animation and barely any noise so i'd say go for the cheaper wolf option (900g v 640g)
---
You can easily hit exalted if u play 3 hours a day for a week
---
Anything that promotes intra-server interaction with the same people on both factions.
---
This is the real long game right here folks
---
For some reason I bought a 2080 and a 9700K to play classic, I sit at 300-500 FPS. Money well spent.
---
Agi / stam for bear, agi/str for cat. Shadowcraft set is an awesome starting point. Slavedriver's Cane or Fist of Omokk are the best feral dps weapons you can get from 5 mans. 
---
1 agi gives 1 attack power 0.05% crit and 0.05% dodge in both bear and cat while strength gives only 2 attack power in cat. 
---
If talented, crits give more combo points in cat and when talented crits give more rage in bear.
---
For best dps, you want 9% hit but this is currently impossible for cats so get 5-7 (truestrike shoulders, blackmist armgaurds, blade master leggings will give 5 total), and stack agi and attack power from there. For bear simply stack agi/stam
---
Idk, alliance players are raid logged since they killed drek seven thousand times and are now all exalted? Might be it.
---
bots are actually pretty cool tho
---
How are people already exalted with AV without premade group ? I always get groups that drag for ages or if I leave I still have to wait the deserter timer ...I've been grinding almost all day today and still 2k from revered ...there's alway at least 1/2 of raid that is fighting in middle and we get wiped in south ... I'm playing alliance
---
Disagree but alright bud.
---
Sounds like 'those clowns' tactically beat you guys and made y'all look like clowns lmao
---
Disagree, we run 2 25 man splits and clear it in a night.
---
Good job healers
---
Alright, ima b honest, i dont give enough of a fuck to read all that shit. Paying someone to run a dungeon is dumb. If yr geared as fuck and a tank and you still cant hold aggro, tells healer that its their fault, even though heals had mobs on em cause tank pulls whole room like a fuckin idiot, wipe is their fault. Also what server u on? Sounds like it sucks.
---
True. But we do have more mitigation then a dual weild fury/prot does.
---
What makes you think you’re so special I can’t replace you with a priest, paladin, or shaman?
---
Mages have a monopoly on cheap food and water, druids don’t have a monopoly on healing spells. In fact, your healing capabilities compared to any of those other classes is pretty trash, so why would I want you anyway?
---
When was it any different? 
---
Any dedicated player with a good attitude can easily find a raiding guild. Have you ever consider you are the issue?
---
&gt; That is the only true vanilla experience.
---
Don't forget the 'home-schooled 15 year old, that everyone thinks is an adult because his parents let him be on wow when he does his work, and is always there.. until that one day. and he just says "oh some irl work buddies wanted to chill" ...but he was actually grounded.
---
It's literally been 4 days since BG launch.  Like.... its hard to understand why anyone would willingly do this to themselves.
---
There's this ENTIRE game to enjoy.......but you like refuse to enjoy the journey.... you fight it at every turn.  1-60 in 4 days, mc clears week 1, exalted rep grind in 4 days........ i fucking loath you and the mentality you represent.
---
Just que at the same time?? Problem solved
---
Thank you, will look into it!
---
100% oh and happy cake
---
I can tell you dont care about being right. Nowhere did I make up situations that dont exist. I used basic math to prove that you can shift forms a ton of times to remove snares even unbuffed because you refused to believe it. 
---
Glad you admit that I’m right though. Most people dont have the balls to admit that they were wrong. I respect you for that.
---
no idea, 6 stack of us tried to kick a toxic idiot who was just flaming chat and nothing happened.
---
Ground mounts.
---
Doesn't work we tried many times
---
Do a countdown in discord and all queue at the same time. 
---
If you get the same one join it together. If not leave queue try again.
---
yeah same here.. tall me
---
could have been a smol thicc woman
---
How about YOU come up with a strategy that stops the opposing side. 
---
People like you ruin this game. 
---
Not to be rude, but it has been done multiple times where one side stops the others zerg and that side wins by stopping other. 
---
Go back to f’ing retail in the most respectful way i can say that.
---
I saw on twitch that guilds queue with around 20 people and some got lucky to be in the same bg but we are 5 and never got lucky.. never
---
The Dark Lady is shamed by this affront. Shamed.
---
On an EU server?
---
Unfortunately shaman tanks suffer from the same shortcomings as prot pallies.
---
1. No taunt
---
2. Mana as a resource
---
A drillborer going to an OT when the MT doesn't have one isn't right. Your guild needs to realize that gearing the MT is priority #1 when the loot drops.
---
OT shouldnt even complain because they'll get their loot pretty quickly compared to dps/healers. I'm the main OT in our raid and I'm just as stacked as the MT. Our tank drops are now getting rolled out to anyone that slaps a shield on for certain fights.
---
The more geared the tank is the smoother and faster the run.
---
Is your IGN Lynnia?
---
We tried it .. don't worry
---
Yea don’t worry about them I spend half the raid dispelling
---
As a rogue horde, I isolate and camp the healers near rarely used graveyards the alliance control so that the game takes massively longer.
---
ITT: some people really can't stand to watch other people enjoy something.
---
Not all heroes wear capes. But it seems that this one in fact does.
---
How so
---
I would like to know how to down rank regrowth, how plus healing works on it, and what spec is best for it?
---
nope, everyone says not to
---
Shaman tank aside, what a weird raid comp.
---
8 rogues and 0 dps warriors?
---
Dude, you don’t have to justify shit.
---
Love catching them try to sneak by while we're capping their gy... "Oh hey! Don't forget your dots!"
---
Gz, now you van finally shadowmelt hunt lvl 50s. Oh wait BGs are out nvm
---
You don't think parses are fun? I personally really enjoy trying to beat my best every week.
---
Imagine. 78 runs lmao
---
On our server, it’s usually LFG chat after 11 PM. It just devolves into chaos.
---
Yeah, the tank shouldn't have issues with threat in the start of a new raid. If they can hold threat against pre-bis dps in dungeons they can hold threat on pre-bis dps in raids. Ony head should be prio #1 for tank since it drops every week.
---
The other items it can be a tough sell to auto loot to the tank. A lot of them are on the lower chance to drop. Fury warriors don't use tier gear, and are pretty much exclusively looking for those sort of drops. The +hit items and the weapons are fire drops for melee dps.
---
You would need to make sure that everyone is on board with that type of looting, and even then you still may get a lot of no-shows in the melee dps side of things. People don't want to raid if they don't have any benefit coming out of it.
---
I'd argue more threat. But a 2h warrior will be better for aoe tanking.
---
it's a pvp weapon mostly.
---
I agree, I think if they dropped item levels all together that would fix this issue a lot.
---
In what way? Just no flying mounts period and only ground mounts?
---
Paranoia+Catseye googles, the famous forsen1 build.
---
It nearly drove me insane.
---
Do you always play with your bags open for no reason?
---
Thats the sad truth.
---
Despite Classic bringing in massive revenue(according the Blizzard), they seem committed to spending as little as possible on it.
---
wrong. if you're tanking as arms you still need to tab sunder in defensive stance
---
I almost downvoted this, but I didn't.
---
Hybrid specs. If I want to go deep Arcane for AP, I can still get pyro or frost. Or I can go elementalist and be raid-viable in both frost and fire.  Priests can go deep holy and still get shadow weaving.  On retail, you choose a spec and that's all you get.  You want pyro? You're all-in on fire. No AP-PoM-Pyro or elementalist.
---
the dark iron ring, fire resist shoulders, and the tanking cape off of rag I think are the three most important.
---
Maybe Accuria, but I don't know how important hit is for a feral tank.
---
These whispers seem like an oddly specific thing to bitch at someone for.  
---
Who was this guy in relation to you, OP?  Another guildie?  Former guildie?  Was it even someone you knew or had seen before?  Or literally just some rando who walked by?
---
This is like randomly walking up to a dude with a kid and telling him he is a monster for kidnapping the child or something.
---
There's plenty of rich thorium veins in bottom of azshara ocean if you want to make some profit
---
At this point, the gearing is basically the same. Having the lionheart over Wrath is good since you can't get any T2 bonus from it yet.
---
The most important thing is just having the weapons. Perds/CHT/Aged leather gloves will generate far more threat than mixing in Lionheart or Onslaught. Right Claw is great too.
---
-Removal of LFG/LFR
---
-We need a reason for crafting or a more complex system like FF14
---
-bring back class uniqueness
---
-I honestly liked layering especially with PvE servers are filling up with PvP refugees
---
-really wanted player city housing
---
The co-op is a blast...being able to play the whole game with my buddies if I desired was fantastic. Being able to summon randoms into my game or help out others  was very fun as well.
---
I even PvP'd quite a bit as well. I welcomed the red invader every time.  The fact you can search and jump into somebody's game and try to stop their progress is hilarious to me. I invaded all the time and loved it. Pulling off a 2 or 3 v 1 was thrilling.
---
 Even got involved in the community and hosted and partook in Fight Clubs. Shit was a good time IMO.
---
I try as a holy paladin.  but nobody is tanky enough for my heals to matter lol.  might want to stop 1vx, everyone lol
---
Dude.
---
Ya gotta start using keyboard shortcuts, man.
---
I'm pretty much in the same boat right now too. Love my druid, but man it's depressing sometimes.
---
Of course it's blizzard's fault, the system is made so it incentives this type of playing and if you want to "keep up" you're basically gonna need to do it. You can't expect the playerbase to handicap itself for a contrived way of playing
---
in some sim that isn't realistic lol gotcha
---
until I stop topping caster dps as SM/ruin i'll stick with it. which may be as soon as bwl, or never.
---
I completely agree, I think we should have all abilities the class offers no matter what spec we pursue just like in classic. Opens up more more customizability in terms of how you want to play.
---
I assume you mean you have the following lines:
---
/cast Blood Fury
---
/cast Mortal Strike
---
This should work with no problem, since iirc blood fury doesn’t use the gcd. So even if it’s on cooldown, it’ll try to use it then move on to the next line. Did you have a specific rank of mortal strike mentioned in the macro, but you’ve since upgraded that skill? Like you have “mortal strike(rank 1)” but you have rank 2 now? I know warrior skills auto update when you get a new one and the old version doesn’t appear in your spellbook, like most other classes have. Maybe this is causing a conflict since you technically don’t have the old rank anymore?
---
You could add a modifier, see if that works.
---
/cast [mod:shift] Blood Fury; Mortal Strike
---
That should work.
---
Mage rogue
---
Stunlock stealth sap vanish and blind with arcane power Pom and pyro
---
My guild is doing MC like clockwork 2 hour runs, and we're way away from a top guilds. Actual top guilds can do regular 1 hour runs, 4 hours is an absolute yikes even for progression.
---
&gt; You go to WSG to have fun.
---
Not everyone liked WSG to have fun though, While we probably arn't even getting it. When a majority of people are exalted, Nerf honor from AV and buff the stuff up. for the casuals (like me~) who enjoy a big scale PvP war like that, but in MMO form, I mean, sure games might take forever to queue, and it probably won't be that often, I'm fine with that..
---
As someone who used to run with a outfit in planetside 1 as ANT/ant defenders and constantly be in the back lines of our faction doing supporting roles.. (Gathering mounts of calv/ stuff in the mines, etc.) or harrassing other outfits ant groups (ganking the tamers of the enemies mounts/killing the mounts for hides/ganking stray players in the backlines, maybe poking a tower/bunker.)
---
I'm all for the old AV, even one that's horrendous for honor.
---
They also can't taunt the mob so you have to really be careful and let them get aggro
---
then play WSG.  problem is WSG is actual pvp and you need to know what you are doing.
---
No changes
---
It's a classic for a reason.
---
Hi, /u/Stendecca
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/eabwue/discord_overlay_doesnt_work_since_last_patch/). 
---
Sure but I'f you're getting focused you just go bear form. If they Wana keep trying to kill you then the rest of the team is free to dps.  You're not a rogue, you're a utility bot that can throw out burst damage when needed.
---
It’s also on mage T1
---
No, problem is WSG is shit honor compared to AV so if you want to rank you just do AV.
---
Oh my god thank you so much this is the answer I needed
---
I lol'd really hard at the transition, great music choice!
---
Very fast TL;DR
---
At the end of the week every player(who has gained 15 hks) will be put on a ladder based on how much honor they get. The "standing" you see on your honor tab is what number in the ladder you got. The higher up(lower standing) you are, the more progress into your rank you get for that week.
---
Yeah I agree removal of the dungeon finder and LFR would be great, I think the in game LFG tool works great cause it just removed the need to advertise your group in the chat but still allows for communication in the group.
---
In the beginning I was full prot, therefore I could easily to dungeon spam with friends. I also did some herbing meanwhile, some enchanting gold and what not.
---
In ~week 5 of launch, I switched to Holyprot (30/21 to have Sanctuary for the guild and being able to solo farm / tank dungeons). With this and the mining skill I got, I started farming multiple things.
---
Silithus hive farms (although harder as paladin than as rogue or hunter), DME 2man farm, Scarlet Monastery aoe farm and the best of all: Badlands.
---
Simply pulling all the big earth elementals in each area (theres a total of 5 elemental areas) with rank1 consecration to keep them leashed, grouping them up and bomb them away (due to sanctuary blessing, skullflame shield and demon chet I didnt really got damage. On the way to the next areas -&gt; mining.
---
I did that excact farm for a roughly 100 hours, on primetime with competition like 30g per hour and in early times or currently before I switched ret (will still be holy for raid) I could actually do ~80g per hour.
---
Damn your setup is slick. What is this??:o
---
Sounds like you’ve spent too much time in AV, better rest your mind it’s getting dumb.
---
As opposed to your slow way of wasting your time? People are going to play the game the way they want and forcing your inefficient way on the majority doesn't exactly make you good
---
Everybody knows Tauren males are the chads of azeroth so you are jealous.
---
As alliance how long is your queue?
---
Yes, but the current raids are "introductory" raids and really easy. My guild 15-20 mans ony every week (not much point of doing it with less than that since gear will likely go to waste). If your guild allows it, then play a meme spec. 
---
The problem comes if you join a hardcore guild who really cares about parses (percentage-based rating). The question is not IF you can clear raids with meme specs. Everyone knows you can. It's how efficiently can you clear the raid as noone wants to spend 3+ hours in MC.
---
A warrior in our guild spent 4 weeks farming for it.
---
Comes on an alt run on his lock and it drops first time for someones alt rogue level 52.
---
I witnessed a broken man, that night.
---
Every damn time
---
Totally agree my dude. Yes, it’s more peaceful but the world feels empty. It’s probably just the PvE drought, but the game lost its charm for me
---
&gt; Lots of people rolled Faerlina or Herod so they didn't get stuck on a dead server. 
---
So idiots?  Low pop servers in classic are large than high pop servers in vanilla.
---
I pickpocket the mines make s few goldfish
---
Id there a video available?
---
Imagine quitting at the slightest sign of resistance.
---
&gt; Now how did he make all those instant raid text messages appear?
---
/rw (raid warning) is how you make those raid text messages, requires you to be either leader or assist
---
Go to any other competitive team based game and it's literally the same. Nobody in any game wants to play with people who don't pull their weight. 
---
You are just looking at the past with rose colored glasses.
---
Lvl 19 twinking already a thing? 😮
---
I wish I had fun at 60.
---
I think for me the difference is the amount of time needed to do anything at 60.
---
Besides BGs you basically need at least 3h to do a few dungeons or a raid. 
---
I'm casual I sometimes play for 5 hours but usually only a few. I cant commit to a raiding schedule and its easier for me to pug with anyone who is on.
---
Unfortunately thats usually late at night and I chose a server that's 2h earlier than me (fucking friends that quit).
---
Who said anything about quitting? How about you don't intentionally force a turtle by defending stupid objectives
---
Oof a holy pally with it?  Oof.
---
&gt;     I really hope that Blizzard bans ~~Spy Addon~~ Combat Log
---
This topic has been done to death. It pulls information from the combat log that everyone has access to. It just puts it together in a neat package for you. 
---
They already addressed this by making the combat log radius 50yd.
---
PvE server ;P
---
Rogue warlock. Shadowy daggers, a demon pet, sacrificial pact, fearing enemies.. unbeatable 👊
---
Agreed. It ruins the fun, especially for rogues.
---
We don’t have a queue.
---
Grind rams and wolves in AV. Best of both worlds!
---
AV confirmed best lvling strategy?
---
Yeah that's what I'm realizing. Just can't get that vanilla nostalgia off classic wow. But subs been gone anyway.  And I see alot of people feel the same way too about the game
---
Like blizzard gives a fuck unless they can automate it.
---
Just hang in there for dementia... and then resub!
---
It’s not stupid if you’re going for a particular rank. 
---
The *system* is stupid, sure, but people aren’t stupid for pursuing goals.
---
I just hit 60 on my Boomy and the mana issues are so exaggerated. I just did my first MC (pug) and I didn’t even need innervate for all but like 2 bosses. The only time I was flat fucking oom was the last adds on Garr
---
The addon is nothing like it used to be. It’s been nerfed already severely, I don’t really see it as a big issue anymore.
---
This picture is everything.
---
Ive literally never been on any competitive game where someone got mad cause you don't play 80+ hours a week either.
---
Agreed. Item level does nothing but breed elitism and toxicity in my opinion.
---
Pretty much the last point. Was just doing random AV, game started and on the way south random dude from another server write me this. Nothing before, dont know him, nor did I said/do anything before.
---
52 (maybe 53?) agi per crit for hunter.
---
Hey buddy, honestly not alot man. I think the official HK count from the second clip was somewhere between 90-107hk's. Was only getting approx 15-20 Honor per kill. We just did it for fun, about time Alliance had some fun at the Hordes expense :)
---
Love this movie, man.
---
Dude bots are actually killing Classic, why cant Blizz identify them and do a ban-wave like they did on HonorBuddy users...
---
Onyxia can easily be cleared with 20-30 people if they are decently geared and know the fight mechanics really well.
---
Molten Core can be cleared with 30-40 people but anything less than 30 is gonna be a struggle even with proper gear.
---
You're a moron. Let people enjoy the game the way they feel like and if efficient face-paced is that way, there's nothing wrong with it. I might think it's stupid that you spend 3x more time doing something than an efficient player but I don't give enough of a fuck to scream about it every chance I get because it literally affects no one.
---
Yup. I explain this to all druids who go "but I'm a cat/bear/owl".
---
No. You're a druid. Be flexible. You think the bear and owl can dance like that when they're so uptight? Hell no
---
Fun story. We had the ret paladin trying to get into one of our 2 main raid teams. Over the last month or so, there was growing dissatisfaction with guild leadership and one night 40 of the best parsing raiders from the two teams split and formed a new guild. This ret paladin then asks in guild chat "Is there a spot for ret now?" and 5 people all instantly responded "NO" and he immediately gquit.
---
If I was a mage I would say the same, but as a rogue it is really annoying and puts us in a great disadvantage.
---
I’ve noticed each day people evolve their strategy and the meta shifts. I think it’s actually really cool to watch happen.
---
Herod?

I thought they did already, also as a mage indo this constantly in PvP no addon needed.  I can spam rank 1 arcane explosion all day.
---
Well, no of our warriors wanted it so far and we dont have a retri pala. And as I want to PvP as ret and wanna try it out at least once in a raid, while also willing to farm for it, I was the best match.
---
Next one will go to a holy paladin aswell most likely as none of our warriors still want it^^
---
I keep seeing different answers on the internet lol: is the consumable from Lei of Lillies on the same CD timer as potions? Also healthstones?
---
As a sword and board traditional tank... I'm offended :-P
---
For sure they are. You're probably top 25 of your raid dps.
---
16 hours a day of av is sure to give you a stroke, probably slow down a bit.
---
Moms are great.
---
Heres mine

I try to keep it clean, putting exp and rep bars into TitanPanel. Also got RareElites working with SUF.
---
no because trying to win is often losing very bad
---
Ah, that's way worse than my guess lol.  So around 0.3% crit or so for 15 agility.
---
It’s the healers job... yours is the one without CD and you want it on all adds instantly
---
So. Heres the thing.
---
Moonkins usually use max level star fire. This is wrong. You oom too fast. You use wrath or lower level spells until you get the proc for a free spell then use max rank.
---
Most moonkin gear also usually has a lot of crit and no mana regen. Get mp5. Int. And crit. You'll do more damage over time.
---
Again. You're still a druid. Use your innervate on the heals. Toss a regrowth on a dps warr pulling threat. Use your abilities man.
---
Hell. The mobs on the healer? Go fucking bear and taunt that bitch. No caster I know can do that.
---
I've had a similar thought. It'll definitely depend on how many people do it but could be a decent way to rank up. I mean if everyone did it (not going to happen) then all the alts would be in bottom 50% and everyone else in the top.
---
Awesome thanks much
---
Thanks buddy :)
---
people where saying that vanilla is hard but MC is easy most of the time. the hard part was referring to leveling and how much time a lot of the things take to do which is kinda true. I don't believe anyone thought MC would be hard though.
---
How is a feral putting FF on all adds of a fight? Yikes
---
You've clearly never been in an AV for an entire day with no end in sight lol.

TukUI's chat module, with Prat for class colors and timestamps.

Something to make previous raid tiers relevant. I don't necessarily mean old expansions, I actually enjoy the fact that the main reason to go back is for transmog and I'd hate having to learn 4 expansion old fights, but like right now if I dinged I'd like to run Uldir for loot and stuff. LFR is just bad, it's a miserable experience that either culminates in loot pinatas (but the loot is outclassed by dungeons and world drops) or has one-shot mechanics that wipe the raid of 20 something people that don't pay attention.
---
they dont need a buff, just make them immune to disarm. Then they'll hurt
---
A couple off the top of my head
---
* Challenging quests and zones that are kinda tough even with a five-man, available to both factions. One of my most memorable experiences continues to be P1 Stromgarde.
---
* Quests that require materials that can only be obtained through professions you might not have
---
He’s one lucky dude for sure.

Lot of iffy info here. Check out the hunter classic discord and you can get all the info you need.
---
I like :)
---
Maybe let them enjoy how they like to play and you can do the same? K? Cool
