Anyways WELCOME HOME!
---
I used to work in a restaurant, and the amount of times I would walk from the font to back forgetting what I was doing was often enough my staff learned to recognize the exact moment I'd forget what I was doing.
---
Same thing happens in Skyrim now. Why did we evolve this way.
---
I feel this way about buffing with Call of the Wild and Thorns.  I have more fun trying to make sure everybody who runs by me is buffed than I do fighting stuff.
---
As a mage, I would never seek to demean my warlock friends. We're all clothies, after all.
---
^^^^Also, ^^^^please ^^^^cast ^^^^Curse ^^^^of ^^^^Elements, ^^^^thanks.

I was trolling chat and got muted twice already before this. :D
---
Not one bit. Retail wow is incredibly simplified and easy. Virtually no risk of dying, no having to ration your money on what skill upgrades you buy, etc. let alone all of the preference based QoL upgrades like not having to fight over tagging mobs, aoe looting, dungeon finder, etc.
---
Not doing all 3 wings? What a casual. I bet you don‚Äôt even keep a pee jug next to your desk, wow.
---
I caught myself yesterday running after a mage in Stormwind telling him to stop so I could give him a healthstone after he buffed me. Can't do this for everyone, but I always try.
---
is he a warrior by any chance : )
---
Me neither
---
Thanks for the life advice. I'll try to let sexist, racist, homophobic, and other types communication slide and not be so sensitive. /s
---
Fishing Dalies in BC were ok
---
For the horde!!!!!!!!
---
That's classic wow.
---
Over 9000!?
---
Mage or bust!
---
I'm just having fun selling wands and bags in org occasionally going to quest for a bit.
---
I know I'll hit 60 eventually, I'll do some raiding eventually.
---
when I want to fish, I fish. when I want to grind, I grind. casual means having fun at your own pace. there's really no rush. we'll be playing this for a long time.
---
I understand the argument back then of .01% of the player base gets to see the endgame content.
---
I think the easier solution to that WAS the raid finder difficulty...my only change would be to remove all rewards from it. If you want to see the content, sure run through a watered down tour bus version....but if you want to SEE and EXPERIENCE the actual difficulty and be rewarded for it...go do the real raid.

You're better off watching a youtube video that breaks down the different classes, so you can actually see what each one looks like etc
---
Unsubbed. Complete waste of time. No game should force the users to have to remotely log in. Oh well, back to private servers.
---
So what's the catch?
---
Wont be able to help you with class choice atm..

 But if you see a really long que. Dont do it

thanks bro

Would the click to move option work for you? It‚Äôs in settings.

And it nearly killed them
---
You can setup a VPN to bypass this restriction although I suspect it's not really there and the pin pairing method will work (I'm pretty sure I've used it before)
---
Depends on what you want. For Dps you have melee or ranged. From there you can choose what you‚Äôd like. Mages are user friendly and easy to be good at, hard to master tho correctly. Same with rogues. Stealth makes them nice to quest with you can bypass unwanted mobs.  Hunters and warlocks have ranged Dps and also pets to help with questing.
---
Go human. If you‚Äôre going to have to stare at it from now to 60, might as well pick something that you don‚Äôt mind looking at. No one will turn you away just because you‚Äôre human.

I saw someone last night asking why people thought the mankirk meme was funny.

---
Guys, he doesnt know.
---
I can spot an idiot when I see one, and we had plenty.
---
You do if you've decided to invest all your time and energy on your main, maybe two or three nights for raiding, and the rest of the time for dungeoning/pvp/rep grind/material gather after you hit 60.
---
That's the World of Warcraft that we plaaaayyy, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
---
There are few people pretty close to 60 now. Jogurd is 52+ now and has been aoe mage farming damn near non stop
---
I need to get on this.
---
I was wondering what to do with all that linen
---
could you pat yourself on the back any harder
---
Half the time I've seen people RP in goldshire they seem to not care about the lore of the game at all and just want to speak old english to each other.
---
Ah!  The missing piece of the puzzle.  Thanks.
---
I have to add a large list of things on the "honey do" list and 2 nights out a week once i hit 60 to where she can get away from the kids.

Will that display the new quest markers and highlighted areas? Cuz I‚Äôm doing a lot of wandering around trying to figure out where these nightsabers are that I need to kill

Thank you for your service

Got some GREEN shoulders from a Wailing Caverns questline and was hype as fuck.  Most people my level have a grey in that slot if they‚Äôre lucky.  I‚Äôm crushing the loot race.  They‚Äôre faces are green with envy while my shoulders are green with awesome.
---
Seems like I'll either go with mage or hunter.. Any pros or cons for both?
---
I had a dude chase me down into the very bottom of a mine and try to sell me a bag. 
---
It was Fucking hilarious. He said he chased me because he said I looked like I had money...
---
I can quit any time.
---
That's a weird looking cat.
---
Yeah, the children over 25 will be fine once the children under 25 leave.
---
&gt;...while playing my Classic character, if I was to start a new character on today's World of Warcraft on a new server without any heirlooms... Would it feel the same?
---
100% no.
---
Exp rate is different, quests are streamlined, mobs hit harder, miss chance is higher, everything costs money you don't have, there's generally actually less skills now than there was then, casters can oom....
---
It's barely the same game anymore, really.
---
Bad troll is bad
---
That was not always true for Vanilla, I thought it was different for several patches.
---
As others have mentioned, you can get addons to put those types of things into the interface.  Another option to consider is playing it as is.  The zone are pretty well constructed to give you hints about where quest hubs might be (eg - if you are walking down a path and see a dirt path turning off to the side it is probably worth exploring).  Sometimes that building in the distance has a quest giver, sometimes it has an elite in the basement, sometimes it has some interesting lore thing going on.  When the quest text says "you'll find it south of town" I find it fun to be searching the horizon for the thing that they are talking about or paying the price of time for not remembering where the quest giver was when it comes time to turn in.
---
Anyway, playing that way isn't for everyone.  It is definitely a slower way to go.  The big advantage to me is the sense of immersion in the game world since you are looking for landmarks instead of following arrows on the mini-map.  The big drawback is that some quest descriptions suck ([classic.wowhead.com](https://classic.wowhead.com) helps there) and sometimes you spend 20 minutes wandering and fighting your way to something to discover that it isn't all that interesting.
---
There is also the middle ground.  I'm assuming that addons like Questie have options for turning off things like quest objective markers while still having !/? for quest start/end locations.
---
Genius, blame blizzard for this kind of behavior not the intelligent one that decided he doesn't want to wait 4 hrs a day to play with his friends
---
Maybe, but that is everyone's assumption. It's a bad choice
---
How much for scott/ronald

Me as a hunter

This is why I'm not going to play it again. I know how much time I lost to it the first time round

Do you hear that sound? *Wah* In the distance? *Waaaaah*
---
I played retail before I played classic and although I prefer classic over retail, there‚Äôs something special about taking a Geared DK and stroll through zuldazar grabbing 20+ mobs and heart slicing the entire pack while popping bonestorm
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vyw6n1EKlww
---
You're a good brother!
---
Or like OCE, a single PvP server at launch. I had 20+ people reserve characters only to be spread across the now 2 extra servers because of ques.
---
i got a dude in the trade chat selling greater mw  . So i whispered him , we haggled over the price and got one for 15s . Classic has been so much fun !
---
Just make sure you have enough water and you‚Äôre golden
---
probably on a shit server. blaumeux is p good
---
feelings get hurt
---
Started at 9400, but I respect your right to meme
---
Mage, Rogue both very high DPS
---
I mean, you hate us until you are too lazy to run to the raid/dungeon lol
---
It's hard to click cancel?
---
I'm not buying every single one, but I do have to buy some, and the threads end up costing a lot once they go to a silver a pop.
---
Same stuff is widespread in runescape pvp clans!
---
Calling out which player to attack is often done by location and combat level so for example "123 northwest", pking clans caught on and renamed themselves to various different variations of that like 126 east etc.
---
Also to make calling out players by their username people would use gibberish as their username (often with the clantag still in the name, so names like FLSG034333442) or something hard to tell apart from other names like iillilli and liilliii
---
A certain clan Reign of Terror dominated a season of deadman mode (pvp enabled everywhere with a cash prize for the winner) so normal players started using their clantag in their own username so they wouldnt get attacked by other players who might think they will call his non-existing clanmates to come help him.
---
Another season of deadman mode was won by a clan (Frontline) who used usernames from a rival clan (Reign of Terror) in the final hour, the rival clan thought they were clanmates and thus wouldnt attack them, at the end the Frontline members started attacking the non suspecting Reign of Terror members and took them down.
---
That's one thing they need to bring back to retail, the old talent system
---
Every zhevra drops a hoof now from what I noticed. Same with raptor heads.
---
You can search for macros on the forums. I've seen good shit there and the people even explain what they do. 
---
There are macro documentation by Blizzard that describes how everything works too.
---
Oh thank god I'm not the only one.
---
It should count for both weapons and double or you can mix and match
---
Hypocrites never get it
---
Fix what and how?  Sounds like it‚Äôs working as intended.
---
What part of my post had anything to do with shitting on people for enjoying something? It's the exact opposite of my point.  
---
I don't understand why people enjoy the constant barrage of negativity.  If I wanted to constantly dwell on the garbage aspects of retail, I could go to /r/wow, or any one of thousands of videos on youtube
---
thats will be great when u will have a lvl60 toon on empty server with dead ah and without a single chance to endgame content...
---
Yeep, almost slept through my alarm today. It's rather dead this week so sitting here unable to load any WoW related sites is *killing* me. I can't even plan WoW stuff while idle at work.

Bullshit...all the new servers filled up a day or 2 later...quit gaslighting people with that response.

Best thing to do is grab 4 warriors with 2 handers and heal it. Its glorious.

You should create a guild named ¬´¬†bag man¬†¬ª so you have that tagged like if you were an NPC

Hey, at least your wife didn't die in battle and you have millions of people making jokes and memes about her. Rip. :(

I had this happen a couple of times. For me it's not a big deal if I don't get it. (Even though I obviously would prefer to have it) Whenever someone else is nearby and I get something I can't use but they can I always hand it over. I've seen enough generosity in this community that I'm happy to pay it forward, even if someone else isn't.
---
&gt; Maybe don't play on a high pop server?
---
For a social rpg game you have to admit this advice sounds bad.
---
I think you misunderstood me, what I thought was the case is that it's 6% on average regardless if I hold one mace or two (for example, if an off-hand mace would not stun at all). I was not sugessting that it would somehow turn into 12% per swing, just 12% in total.
---
Well I guess it's not strictly 12%, since it also depends on a weapon speed which can be different for two maces I hold. But if it applies to every swing, then it means that the total chance (roughly) doubles if you dual-wiled maces!
---
You literally ZOOM through zones. Questing and popping queues for dungeons and bgs... you can skip MANY zones, quests, places and people. What did they put aaalllllllll this shit ingame to jist be skipped... 
---
I cannot express how whenever I was a kid, it was the sheer atmosphere of this game that made me feel older, kinda cool, like I was learning and becoming some sort of adventurer in the most tame of aspects.
---
Being lost out in the zones, finding small details and mobs some other might not... I could just go on n on n on....
---
But classic does it best. That sense of reward u feel when u win a battle royal or a TDM or whatever... it's so miniscule when compared to simple things like finding ur first blue or killing a level 20 something dungeon.

I've never seen one. Maybe it's just a Firemaw thing or just something that only happened on the first day but my experience is a few groups spamming to get the tag.

Retail and classic are two different games. If you like a social rpg friendly hard mmo that rewards grouping players then play classic and if you like a more mainstream mmo that pushes you to max level as fast as possible without challenge and no little to no class identity untill harder raids (tank/dps/healer) every class can pretty much do whatever untill max.
---
Can't wait! :D

Why you gonna half ass it? Lets take it a step further and put portals at every landmark, zone, hut, hole in the ground. There u go kid. Hf

---
If you work for something it feels valuable. Running from org to tb to get the flight path is a marathon, but it makes you invested.
---
Casual
---
Its basically an heirloom mount. Because you cant get riding until level 20 in retail you can get a "mount" where you get chauffeured around in a side car. You control the mount but your character sits in the side car.  
---
In essence its just a level 1 mount
---
Really!?
---
There is no rush for me.  I'm reading quests and enjoying the game.  I love how everyone is talking.  It's almost like an MMORPG.
---
Should have never equipt that honestly. That Twink item is worth a shit load! Could save it for phase 3 and you would be rolling in gold.

Had you googled this you'd already know the answer is that they haven't decided or said anything definite.
---
Yeah, start with classic. I‚Äôd argue you‚Äôre in a better position to play the game than those who play retail
---
Honestly I being a girl online now is muucchh more normalized than it was back in 06. I doubt they'll be able to take advantage as much today. We'll see though
---
Get throwing weapons
---
A large portion of people who were clamoring for WoW Classic were children under the age of 25 when vanilla was first released. I was 12.
---
There is a HUGE EST population on grobb. People already made guilds and don't want to move.
---
I love how you take a break to study and not take a break to play üòÇ
---
Uninstal the game, then go outside and sit in the garbage can cause you are trash.
---
I'm telling you, I've tried. But they simply don't listen or care. As long as we made it through the instance, it was fine for them.
---
But having you spend all your time running back and forth is a good way to keep you subscribed.
---
SPIRIT TAP is applied auto to me when I get a last hit on a mob. When that happens, I want it to announce to the group.
---
I mean, at some stage they are right in the sense 1-120 would be a ludicrous thing to ask new players to do with levelling the same as classic. It would take at least a year for most normal players to hit max cap and I think you'd burn out before you hit end game.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
What's the solution? Idk.
---
The fuck out of here with this nonsense. Classic is fine
---
yeesss :D
---
No, you misunderstood him. He said it like it is. You get 6% per mace swing.
---
Because people are allowed to play in anyway they want. :)

Mine is guild

Oldest thing I have for WoW related consumables are the real life Health pot/Mana Pot energy drinks from like 2008. Kept them in the refrigerator since unopened. I drank a little of the health pot as a kid and hated the taste so I never drank the rest

As somwonw who quit in BC I am shocked someone wouldn't know what a kodo was. Csn you not ride them in retail??

---
Solid bait
---
Right... because you have to wait for it to reset daily or weekly...like we've been talking about
---
And now I had to laugh at this as well. Why can't anyone just focus on providing good analysis without having to invoke emotions. Fuck this community and it's sense of pride in having fun again.
---
Absolutely. And having to make decisions, and deciding what spells to upgrade etc. there is pretty much 0 investment in retail now. What I noticed today, while drinking as a mage between every couple mobs, was i was constantly looking around making sure no one was near. Meanwhile in retail, just run in, aoe it all down and move on. I‚Äôm so far behind but I have loved every minute playing classic so far. Meanwhile I can barely log in to retail. It‚Äôs not even a chore anymore.

Classic really isn't that "hard" more it's just time consuming. 
---
A casual player can easily play the game, but it's definitely a slow progress to level. But that's the point, it's about the journey, exploring the world and doing the grind. Feeling like you actually accomplished something.
---
Hell yeah my dude. I get better fps with lutris n amd gpupro than i fid on windows because of the bajillion services always running. Even got the twitch app to work so i dont have to manually update addons
---
Thanks for the breakdown! Ready for some RFC tonight and this should help a lot.
---
Yeah you should train them, you will have better luck getting decent bows/guns and the stats on them will be pretty decent. If I remember correctly, there probably aren't any throwing knives that are better for you until you get class specific endgame loot. But feel free to fact check that, as I never played rogue in vanilla.
---
Yikes
---
I don't care if it is corny, I legit teared up when I arrived.
---
How does one shrink the UI?
---
You‚Äôre absolutely wrong. You could log onto smolderweb in its prime time right now, no queue. But go ahead and spread lies bro. You‚Äôre the one who is full of shit.
---
Honestly both are pretty viable. 1h/shield will give you more survivability, 2h is definitely bigger dps but you'll have to cast heals more often. If you go 1h, try to find a fast dagger and use flametongue for some decent dps. I've leveled both ways and don't notice a significant speed difference.
---
As far as weapon enchants, I usually use flametongue or rockbiter depending on which I've most recently ranked up--until level 30, then it's all windfury. Only exception is if you're using a dagger or other very fast 1hand, then flametongue beats everything, including windfury.
---
WeaponSwingTimer ... I got it from the wowinterface site. I‚Äôve only used the shot stuff for wands but the options panel suggests it is really designed for hunters.
---
How do you think suggesting this now would change anything when it hasnt for the past 15yrs. Theyre not taking this kind of feedback, no one is shrinking the map for your little lame gnome legs to run on.
---
Cheers!
---
There are so many directions this can go.
---
It‚Äôs a great game. I‚Äôve invested maybe thousands of hours into BC/WOTLK. Classic is just as fun. Good luck!
---
You should play, screw whatever other people are doing and their veteran status. The game is easy to pick up and fun
---
V true, i did that this evening actually so I guess I am the problem.
---
Not even second fiddle. It's like you're playing the kazoo. You might be the best damn kazoo player out there, but you're still playing a kazoo.
---
Man on Stalag everyone be helping everyone on Alliance.
---
Same man, how‚Äôs the lane you picked? :)
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
I agree with you, as a matter of principle I refuse to tank for other warriors.
---
Those orderly queues tend to be OCE or EU servers I think - and I say this as NA player
---
Which mobs did you farm for that? The defias near Moonbrook or that farm in the NE corner of Westfall? And what level did you do it at? I went on an epic and dangerous mission to obtain this mask last night, but I failed horribly because of the amount of Allys.
---
Another thing Classic teaches that many (including myself) refuse to learn: you can skip quests.  Its fine, really.  There are no achievements, no one is checking in on you, its not required for raiding.  The loot probably isn‚Äôt even all that good.  Just skip it, go do some other quests
---
id slap the shit right out them
---
Don't play on a massively overpopulated realm at the start of a relaunch of probably the most anticipated game ever. Plenty of servers that have no or low queue times.
---

As I said above its 259 CND. That's retardedly expensive for 1 feature that should have been there all along. This stupid update actually gives people control of deferring the update 35 days, go figure.
---
Passers-by. Just sayin' ;)
---
I would bet a lot of money on the fact that it will not be.
---
I'm currently leveling as a warrior tank and jesus fucking christ its slow.
---
If your weapon skill is low (equipped new weapon type, getting lots of blue skillup messages in chat) then you will have a much lower chance to hit mobs, especially ones at or above your level, your hits will be glancing blows (reduces damage) and you won‚Äôt crit ever.
---
Each weapon type has to be trained (trainer) and skilled up (through use) for it to be useful against mobs of your level.
---
The first ten talent points you'll get will feel like a bit of a waste because it all goes into stealth. And then you can start putting points into other cool shit. Where the other trees have early points that are extremely useful.
---
Personally, I'm going to level combat swords at first because it's very effective (though boring to play). And then at level 37 pay for the respec and change to 0/3/25 Hemo spec. Then work towards Cold Blood as I level to 60.
---
In Redridge around Lakeshire it‚Äôs pretty good!
---
So I just learned something. Now I can't wait to get home and switch out the buttons on my bar with the ranked up spells. Im level 18 and still using my originals. I thought the questing was getting super hard and I was dying so much last night. 
---
Thanks random reddit thread!

I played Rogue heavily from 2004-2007.  IIRC correctly subtlety is decent in PvP. You don‚Äôt get the instagibs like you would with assassination PvP spec but you can really lock people down and make their lives miserable 1v1. Preparation has good utility too.
---
For PvE I remember experimenting with a build but it doesn‚Äôt have good DPS. The utility is adding that debuff (Hemorrhage?) for greater raid DPS. But the PvE build is not the same as the PvP build. Subtlety overall is pretty niche compared to what you can do with an assassination or combat build but it still has its uses and fun.
---
I ran to teldrassil and /emote peed in a moonwell. They told me to stop rping. I told them I was rPeeing.
---
Yep, can't risk letting them have the opening
---
Ah, I didn't think of that! I might make two, then XD But that's really just the greed talking XP
---
This needs a repost, just used it and it is amazing!
---
Smolderweb‚Äôs a nice little home.
---
Ah, thank you! I probably wont be playing subtetly then. I want to be usefull during the leveling etc.
---
I just got to TB finally and can use my gun.
---
I wish... Today I killed murlocs in redridge under water, while 3 warlocks passed by my priest. Noone shared a buff back to me :(
---
Does anyone have a recommendation for a stand alone all in one bag mod? I tried OneBag3 (1.12 and 1.13 version, including the Ace3 dependencies) and it doesn't work.
---
Ah you know, it's hot out, I can use a good dip in the water.
---
Pretty sure the zeppelin from Orgrimmar to TB is not a thing in classic.
---
The fly path from TB to Orgrimmar cost only 50 coppers or some such.
---
It's fine for leveling. I'd recommend daggers though since the improved ambush is what really makes playing the spec work. Once you get preparation leave the tree if you want to get the most out of each talent pt you earn.
---
Guess I'll [link the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBLdQ1a4-JI).
---
I strongly recommend AGAINST Hunter as your first character. Pet management can really frustrate a group, and Hunter Weapon is a thing.
---
Focus on a mage because they really are among the most self sufficient classes in Classic, they're always in demand, and you can focus on a more traditional character and gear before you have to learn what ISNT a hunter weapon or how to keep your pet from dragging half of WC to your group.
---
Is there like a world Channel so you can know where this type of stuff is happening?
---
too real
---
\&gt;  Piracy can be a crime 
---
No. It IS a crime. There is nothing legal about it.
---
It doesn't matter what people think of the significance of the crime. There are plenty of people who probably don't think stealing a car is that big of a crime. There are also people whose livelihood depends on the car and they probably have a different opinion on the significance of car theft. Either way, it's illegal. Piracy is not a victimless crime. It's not up to the person pirating the stuff to decide if it's illegal.
---
Haha druid tank lol.

/cast [@mouseover] Power Word: Fortitude

That was when I realized the player base had changed, and it was by the dev's own doing by changing an important community portion of the game.
---
those people invited you to do quests together did nothing wrong. when you tag a mob, if he / she invites you or if you invite them, both of you get the quest.
---
i do love to punish and make people miserable just as the next guy, but as a grown up, it is my duty / responsibility to act like one, and show others (usually younglings) that there are other ways to deal with your problems. 
---
it does not include blocking people when questing, if that person is spamming, obviously yes. there was a blocked characters limit, i don't know if it still exist, and you might want to use it for spammers in trade chat.
---
Super unpopular opinion but like I liked the dungeon group finder... never did raids so I have no opinions on it but like today I queued with some peeps, I was the healer, and the warrior pulled a whole room on two occasions, one almost got us all killed and the other did get us killed. Then later on in the dungeon I wasn‚Äôt paying the fullest attention and he died, I Rez him after and he asks ‚Äúno heals?‚Äù Then he just kicks me after. Really pisses me off how the tank can make a tpk happen and nobody blames him but if a healer doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúheal‚Äù on one occasion I get flamed and kicked. It‚Äôs really annoying. I like the idea of finding groups throught socializing but it makes me feel like I have to put up with assholes more
---
Best wishes mate. I'm actually functioning better with wow too. I'm getting slightly less sleep (7 hours instead of 9) but I don't feel as tired. I know it's like any drug and had to be done in moderation, but since other escapism tools don't work for me I'm glad this is back.
---
Druid it is, then. I'll probably make two, one for mining nodes and another for herbs. Not that I have the time for it, but the scheming of having two gatherers does appeal to me.
---
Didn‚Äôt realize the prairie wolf I was fighting was fucking Neo.
---
This happens naturally. Too bad buffs are quite mana intensive, otherwise I'd throw out that fort buff while in combat as well.

Go into your Spellbook and look for an icon that looks kind of like a slingshot. It‚Äôs for pet training. Click on that and it will open a pet training window with growl, nature armor, and stamina.
---
Growl can be taught, by you, for free. The others cost points that your pet gains as it levels with you and accrues loyalty.

Roll resto it's so fun. Ignore swiftmend tho it's garbage while lvling imo. You got this man! Ignore the min maxers and enjoy your ride as a resto druid
---
What are your PC specs?
---
Looked for you on Fairbanks last night, but looks like you made th switch. Have fun!
---
I had a guy run up to me, put a dagger in the trade window, and just stand there. I hit accept trade and waited. He said "best offer." I turned and ran away.
---
I think the biggest thing was stealth classes going in to solo 1 boss or loot a chest and zone out, so the limit was put in the make it still viable to do, but not grossly destroying the market.  you would have 60's outside uldaman all day grabbing the chests for rare items/mats zoning in and out back in early WoW
---
The worst part is that its a hunter. On a rogue its a waste but jesus... BiS twink reduced to a stat stick.

Praise be to the Bag Man
---
It's a fantastic PvP buff, especially on Alliance, but limited PvE for sure
---
Healing them coming of of WotLK when healers were gods sucked. DPS expected the healer to be able to carry every mistake like they could in WotLK and we simply couldn't.
---
Actively trying to kill? You're joking right?
---
Looked for you on Fairbanks last night but looks like you made the switch. Have fun!
---
That's fair enough. I think LFR it's only a small part of the overall problem anyway.
---
I played had a feral druid alt in classic back in the day. My friend who was a rogue and I did alot of world PvP, mostly ganking. The benefits to being a druid were being able to heal and travel form, but I was always envious of the rogues stuns and vanish ability. I'd say rogue if you really want to be a better stealth character, and go druid if you the versatility matters to you but you're okay with not being the best.
---
How long have you been sleeping like that? I‚Äôve been doing it for about 10 years now, and I‚Äôm wondering if it will catch up to me
---
hey mt fellow hunter, how do I go about doing addons for classic wow? There's no easy way like on retail in client, right?
---
Any1 know how many subscribers wow has now after launch?
---
Have a good day.
---
My OnniCC says it's out of date no matter what J do, can I just ignore that and force load it?
---
Shaman is top tier in PvP. Wear a shield, spec Elemental/Resto, and you will be tanky as hell + you hit really hard. Purge destroys casters as well. Overall very strong 1v1.
---
Main weakness is you're just flat out bad against multiple mobs/players. You don't have any CC and it's close to impossible to heal yourself when multiple targets are attacking you. You don't have any tools to escape from a fight, either.
---
A good couple times now I saw couples of tauren in the same gear and my gut reaction was "oh, they are intentionally choosing to look the same to show others they always stick together" and then watch them swiftly run apart. - That's just the questing gear two randoms are wearing.
---
So, the main/alt thing really only exists if you plan on doing raids and stuff at 60. Otherwise, play how you want to play, there is no endgame of wow for you, just different wow. And if you know you want to do endgame content, that is part of how you push down the alt itch. Because all the classes are pretty fun, sometimes you just get stuck thinking you're not having the most fun, because you're at a place that is hard, boring, or something. My advice is have a hunter alt. Hunter is pretty easy and relaxing to level, and if you're in the mood to do something very different, you can go track down one of the rare pets/pets with a new ability for you to learn.
---
I had stuff to do tonight and couldn't jump in the queue early at like 430.
---
Started it up at 830. 7,000k queue

oof that hurts.

Okay now I want to role play as a simple minded idiot warrior lol

Yeah but did it Titanforge tho?

You are probably right

It‚Äôs not so much about the water as it is about the time wasted drinking it.

Playing a mage I do what I can. Throw AI on casters, toss that hunter kiting a frostbolt, burst out that second mob that warrior accidentally pulled etc
---
Makes me look forward to leveling my shaman next and being able to bro out

By the time they write you a formal invitation, that mob with the 30 min respawn timer that you have tagged will be dead.

Do you have a character created on that realm yet by chance? I have a theory that anyone with a character on a realm has full queue priority over accounts without a character.

Yeah!  Who wants all that clean empty space on the screen, with neatly clustered bars and targeting frames??
---
I asked the same thing!  My soul is complete now
---
Well, neither one is 25.
---
Agreed. Personally my biggest issue with retail is just the fact that you‚Äôre babied throught it. But that‚Äôs a problem with most games. Like, most triple a titles have a tutorial but it feels more like they just have a npc show you how to do everything rather than just figuring it out for yourself

Well I‚Äôm glad this is what it is. It was driving me nuts and I figured it had to do with an addon

i was thinking just the same. But if you want it you can stay awake but you look like zombie, who knows..
---
 I've kinda seen everyone buffing and healing Warriors as they go past. Makes me happy because I remember how painful that leveling was.
---
If your doing DPS make sure your always attacking whatever the tank is attacking so you don't pull threat off something else
---
Because karma has so much value, right? Just because you lack a moral conscious doesn't mean everybody does.

I disagree.  At least "char" is a short-handed version of the actual term, which is character.  "Toon" is a short-handed version of the wrong term, and barely even makes sense (they aren't cartoons).

You‚Äôre not wrong. Actiblizz cares about logins and time played a week and keeping people on the FarmVille hamster wheel.

At least they‚Äôre keeping their inept hands off the lovingly crafted beauty that is classic.

There is literally NO issue running any kind of warrior or druid or a pally (once they get wisdom) as a tank for your dungeon, no matter the spec.
---
Last night I was wandering the streets of Stormwind after dark and I had to just stop and take it all in. I forgot how it actually used to get noticeably dark at night time, and how glowing warm light flowed out of all the shop doors and windows. And the ambience... Ahhh..... So comfy.

What happened? When did it all go so horribly wrong? More polygons and yet shittier effects. Missed classic weather!

See this is why I play hunter...in wpvp it fits the class fantasy so damn great...hunting your prey, waiting for the right time to strike, your a skirmisher, and as soon as they think they have you a trap goes off. They were never winning, they were being lead to a trap

Is AOE mage spec worth it right now?

Also what is the best ST spec if I can't do that?
---
Based on the meters, you needed that luck
---
Funny , I rolled Alliance my first time around ( Beta Vannila up till 2015 ) . This time I'm horde,  playing a Warlock ( which I've never played before) . My main was a Night Elf arms warrior and my Alt was a Holy Paladin.
---
I don't anticipate classic will go to cata.
---
I'm guessing that classic will get a bc expansion and maybe a wrath expansion before getting reset back to vanilla.
---
Months before this reset, players will have the option to transfer one character to "save" them. (With be additional transfers to retail costing a typical transfer fee)
---
there still douchebag out there. was in stockade group for quests as priest. asked how hard it is because i never played wow before (lots of similar games though) and was instantly kicked and ignored. was level 26 at this point. have done the deadmine a couple of times without a problem. dunno if this a highly coordinated dungon or what. i doubt the early dungons need more then 1 person knowing what to do and the others just follow up (at least thats my experience so far)

---
You can also get as mob drops.  I got Parrot and cat from VC today.

A waste of mana honestly

 Don't worry, that shoe goes on the other foot at lv60.

My tower isn't anything super fancy, but it's new model and all that, built this year. So I figured I'd need that screwed in blue cable. But if I only need an hdmi then that is pretty pleasing.

So if I went with dell's screen, $100 minimum.

Walmart, same and not the best choices. But they do have good tvs... for the same price, so I figured that'd be my better option.

I jist didn't wanna go do it and realize I now have to return a TV for any reason.

In response to your reply to the comment above - I would take that answer with a grain of salt. It‚Äôs certainly possible (though costs a little bit) to respec once you hit 60. So if you want to try something like combat for leveling and then switch to sub at 60, that‚Äôs more than possible. But when we talk about leveling - some people confuse viable with optimal. All the specs are viable, and unlike BFA, playing a sub rogue is going to be 90% to playing a combat rogue for the leveling process. There are definitely different builds, but you‚Äôre probably not going to be more or less useful depending on your spec until black rock depths.  
---
  
---
So I would take a look at the talent trees, see what abilities interest you, and go with that for leveling. I‚Äôm personally doing the same tree as I did in Vanilla - a combat/sub hybrid that prioritizes out-of-stealth damage and survivability. It‚Äôs none of the popularized builds on icy veins, but there are plenty of people willing to group up with me and I know i can always change at the end. Rogue is a really fun class to mix up talents with, so I would again just take a look at the free and see what interests you most :)
---
Hah! You leave the main city? Pleb.
---
I hope they go like oldschool runescape and add new content for level 60
---
I'm pretty sure you can attach an extendable arm/monitor stand above your bed. Put your monitor into it and hook up the PC. Hey Presto, you can now play Wow.
---
still you better read it. i leveled 2 characters on private at march, not reading the quest really hampers you even with questie.
---
Best spec for raiding dps is Demonic Sacrifice/Ruin (DS/Ruin) which has you sacrificing your Succubus for a 15% shadow damage increase, but you can also play the slightly weaker build Shadow Mastery/Ruin (SM/Ruin) which lets you keep your pet out, usually the imp for Blood Pact.  
---
   
---
Pet management in PvP on the other hand has a bit more to offer.
---
Rogue is fun
---
It will be before that. Highest guy is currently level 52.5

Im playing on Thinderfury-US. I have yet to see a queue.
---
I remember people telling me I had to CC because blizzard had said they were making the heroics hard again and then them saying "oh" when I tanked everything no problem.
---
Would you suggest a monitor instead ? I haven't bought anything yet. I'm just pickier eith monitors is all, many are too long for how short they are u know ?
---
I...cannot deny...I am in denial.
---
I don't remember ever really having trouble because I was a rogue, more so because I played at non-peak hours.  Getting gear IN said dungeons is going to piss you off though, because practically everyone rolls against you; druids and hunters want your armor and pallies and warriors want your weapons.   Other than sometimes missing out on good gear you *really* needed, you'll be fine.  Just don't get ahead of yourself and pull aggro on things you shouldn't, and your group/guild will take care of you.
---
warriors have shouts, thank you very much.

Idk why people act so desperate for bags. They'e litterally 3s in the AH. Just buy some bags, wtf?!?
---
Maybe this is now my punishment for joining a low pop server, but it seems like every other realm has people begging to group and handing out free bags except for mine. Now that nobody is low level anymore it's starting to get even harder.
---
I was the bag man in Brill, Zandalari Tribe this night. It feels amazing to be recognised by everyone
---
Are you crazychris? Maybe it defaults to first roller.
---
Party only IIRC
---
Have fun later in game trying to find raids or dungeons.
---
Another BFA bad,  Classic Good post. It's really getting boring. With this momentum in two weeks you're gonna start burning those who dare to play on retail.
---
Wait warriors can wield guns in classic??? I had no idea about that and I‚Äôve been playing since BC!

i havent even checked if mine says out of date, but it works just fine.

As long as your desktop has a hdmi slot you should be good. Sometimes there's a thing where the hdmi output needs to be specifically enabled to output from your dedicated gpu. But if you have a newer computer that shouldn't be a problem.

Also, I just hooked up a second monitor that didn't have hdmi. I bought an hdmi to dvi converter from best buy for like 15 bucks. So worst case you could do that. But you should be fine.

Always keep pet on passive, always dismiss before jumping on or off a ledge.

Did you do your level 10 Warrior Quest that gives you taunt, defensive stance and sunder? I tanked RFC last night, was wondering why my threat holding wasn't great, and realized afterwards that at my level I should have had defensive stance and taunt, but had simply forgotten to do the quest. We got through it fine, but I felt like a dummy afterwards.
---
Yeah man it feels so weird I was always a main tank or melee dps on horde
---
Had my first blue 2 hours ago ! Feels great.

Learn how to be useful. As a druid keep your buffs people. Learn when to use brez and innervate. Don't break cc.  Faerie fire, etc. If people say you don't have c.f. remind them you can sleep dragons :)

As a warrior i kinda feel bad that i can't give anything back, then i remember i play warrior and my life is horrible compared to those classes so i stop worrying about it.

Today I had an instant login. Feels good man.

Warrior levelling is just painful as the first character. It's doable, but a lot of people gave up back in Vanilla. I did it and it sucked. I went rogue this time around. Not MUCH better but I feel like I have more tools at my disposal.
---
I was fishing with my quiver the other day!

is your cpu sitted properly? I'd take it out and reapply the thermal paste and just dust out the pc

Pretty much exactly what you said: you can't GET cheaper quality entertainment than wow. 15/month is a massive bang for buck with how much content the game provides. in college WoW saved me so much money lol.

Just turn the wood plank bridges into glass bottom bridges.

What Addon do you use for name plates
---
as for the serpent sting/viper sting.... i dont believe there is anything in the macro system that will allow you to "auto pick" whichever one you want.... youd have to use modifiers for that, like cast viper sting when pressing shift and serpent sting otherwise...

learning characters is wonderful, and there are MANY characters to learn to learn love and hate. but to really immerse, is ''knowing what you are gonna do'', and making sure the quest you take is not a ''kill 10 of these'' quest, because there are many quests that are kinda complicated, like the destroyed house in dustwallow march. but for some reason noone leveled in there when i was playing in Light's Hope.

Just wear a shield and know your high-aggro skills and you‚Äôll tank great.  Keep this in mind when you recruit healers, as long as the tank knows his defensive stance shadow priests and enhance shammies will heal fine.
---
Spec defensive if you want to do dungeons severly underleveled or just grind dungeons to 60 and always plan to have a group

Until you switch realms or a bunch of people quit your realm.

Don't forget underwater breathing :)

Aoe can be lethal with an unknown tank. Befriend the Warriors in your guild and you can go ham :).

I didn't like the warlock trainer in Stormwind, down in that cellar, there's also a class quest that sends you to a guy in southern Barrens of all places, not optimal placement.

I saw something online recently where someone was asking for an alternative,  apparently you can't get them anymore or anything like it. I thought "I'm sure I have one of them at my moms" sure enough, found it and it works a treat.

I'm still not 100% convinced that I truly understood the message he was trying to pass.

Practically speaking, once you couldn't get any gear from solo/5-mans, before battlegrounds, there wasn't exactly much else to do. Not NOTHING, but anything you had/wanted to do, might as well be doing it on a toon that is getting exp for it, right? The only true benefit was having 2 more professions, and maybe a second bank (but you wouldn't really ever need THREE bank alts). 
---
As for leveling alts, it isn't EASY, but you will benefit much more from rested experience, as well as having a high level character to farm gear on to make leveling easier.

---
I'd imagine most folks with kids/job are queueing orders of magnitude more than they're playing.
---
As someone who mained warrior in vanilla, mage. Leveling is faster/easier,  far less work involved in doing crazy dps, and you're one of the scarier presences in organized pvp. If you want to win most world pvp fights you're involved in, go rogue.
---
As you level in the Human lands, you discover exactly WHY all the zones surrounding Stormwind are under siege and in desperate need of reinforcements. That's where you come in and why you're so important to the game! You, as the wandering adventurer, assist where you are needed (i.e. going from zone to zone doing quests as you reach the appropriate level for them) and discover just how troubled the world is. Eventually, you get to Burning Steppes in the later levels and, while doing the Onyxia pre-req questline, discover that Onyxia herself as disguised herself and been controlling Bolvar from behind the scenes, keeping Alliance forces from helping in nearby lands, soughing chaos and pulling the strings.
---
Most CC (Sap, sheep, shackle undead etc) breaks on damage. The only exception is stuns, but they usually only last a few seconds.
---
You'll have plenty of time to play Mario during your 4-hour queue.
---
Why do you want to reroll? Is it the queues on your current server? Then I guess maybe just stick with it, because queues are probably going down in about a week or so.

I got stuck on Herod because my sister's guild intentionally chose it because it was the highest pop server. Life is pain.
---
Anyone have any ideas how to kick this into gear?

through the client or site?
---
I experience, that with hitting closer to 30, I can't afford to spend that much mana on buffing others while questing myself, so I do it while running between quests. I mean 400 mana a pop, I am oom in 3 buffs.
---
I had a guy try and ninja one of the Wyvern eggs in Needles, while I was killing the mob guarding it. When he then got attacked and I took the egg, I was met by a shitstorm of "why are you taking my egg, not even healing or buffing me you bastard". Some people man.
---
This is pretty funny considering how much flak people gave WoW on release for being dummed down and easy compared to other MMOs
---
to have longer killtimes? how dare you!
---
You mean fun events happen on servers that aren't the streamer server? WOW!

If this won't happen today late afternoon/early evening (Friday) then I will be too high level for this on my main, and won't have enough time to level up an alt for this either, so... when?

a few days ago I was 22k in queue, this queue time hasnt changed at all.  just went to 74 minutes, then 43 minutes, then back to 136 minutes. I don't understand how the system is so flawed.

SM starts at level 30 remember, so not _that_ insane.  There are people who are level 45 n shit already.

Well that's their problem tbh. If you need it you need it.

I have seen alot of gnome mages, but play what you want.

The OP's post was clearly satire but I don't know if yours is trying to follow it, or you're a legitimate asshole. If the former, congratz for making me doubt, you're doing it right!

He would be mad I keep telling him the queue's are ridiculous so no point in playing for a few weeks.. not a total lie, but not the whole truth. 
---
I'm in deep shit in a few weeks when he finds out there was SOME server queue issues... buuuuut he coulda played (we have 4 kids and he SUCKS at parenting while playing games.. so if he plays, I cant)
---
whats a good level to do it?
---
Our First kid was born 3 weeks ago... work long hours and I keep thinking about leveling when I get home. Thankfully the queue has been helping to keep the need for the fix in check and keep me in the real world
---
I always just jumped into the water back in the day. :P Then again I played druid, so yea...aquatic form.

Ahh this brings me back...

Yes. Monitors tend to have better colors and input lag compared to a tv, especially on the low end.
---
There are cheap 27" 1080p monitors nowadays and should be big enough for most people.
---
They do the same thing, so choose which one you like more.
---
Play what you like. Rolls some alts if you want to try some other classes. Mages are always useful late game.
---
I have one of each, the merc and the merc stealth. I wish I could figure out how to do the driver workaround, but instead I‚Äôm using ahk to reconfigure a couple of keys the way I‚Äôm used to. It‚Äôs hard to unlearn 12 years of muscle memory from something like this.

You won‚Äôt be anywhere near raid ready in a couple months if you are playing casually if that is what you are concerned about.

Same. My buddy struggles to make ends meet but is successful considering what he's given. He was broke this week from paying rent but was super sad he couldn't play with us until his next paycheck in 2 weeks. Said fukkit and bought him 3 months so he wouldn't have to worry for a bit and could play with his 4 friends.
---
I prefer ClassicCodex over Questie. Specifically the feature that shows the spawn locations of all the mobs for the quest.
---
That UI setup is both beautiful and such ass.
---
He dont know either
---
Yeah, and the simple fact that it's easier, more convenient, means that a good part of the player base will use it, forcing the rest of the player base to follow suit or end up having a real hard time playing the game. 
---
It's such a shame really. Sure, we have classic now, but the game didn't have to go this direction. TBC and wotlk were great in their own ways, albeit obviously different from classic. Imagine a world were Blizzard kept much closer to vanillas design principles throughout all of retail. TBC even had some really vanilla-esque stuff in it on release with the attunements that were later removed. 
---
LFG was late wotlk right? Never really thought about how well that syncs up with me losing passion for the game. It's not *only* LFG, of course. Some stuff I hate happened much earlier, some much later. But I think that might be the tipping point.
---
If your on a PvP server... world pvp. If you see a person from the opposite faction, you can fight/kill them. Wait till you see the giant battles that will break out because of this ;)
---
If not... you can still do BGs/arenas (pvp players can do this as well.) BGs are capture the flag/king of the hill style games. Arenas are 2v2,3v3 and 5v5 which are ranked and you fight a team of similar rank. So much fun with friends/the right class. So much skill/knowledge goes into might be just waht you're looking for after something like Fortnite :P
---
But I'm also referring to the ranking system with rewards like better gear, that actually impact your game play.

You should basically have a main leveling pet you keep within 1 level of your own to use as it'll have max friendliness with you for abilities and one stable slot to stable it while taming randoms to get all the pet skills. Check [https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/) for a list of all the abilities out there.
---
Personally, I've just been taming new ones as I run across one with an ability I need as I'm duo-lvling and I don't plan on keeping anything until I get Humar at lvl 23. Then I'll stable him as needed to get Bite, Claw, Cower, Prowl, and Dash. I'll go for a wolf later when I can buy the third stable slot, that's money I don't want to use at lvl 20.

You're asking the game to show you a tooltip. Since you didn't specify a tooltip, it shows you the placeholder icon which is this smiley man.

im new to classic and rolled a troll mage. Im not sure if im playing the class wrong but im level 13 and everything is hard to do. idk if I just have shit gear, I bought a wand off the auction house recently since I heard thats good. Mage enemies shit on me idk if this is normal or if my gear is really outdated.
---
As for someone whos new to Classic, you dont know how happy I was when those shoulders dropped.
---
Hmm, odd.
---
I started at #150 in queue and I am now at #1934, lol.
---
I like how you accuse me of boot licking just to agree with me.
---
You‚Äôre not very bright, are you?
---
No I do mean the LFG system. It removed the *necessity* for keeping relationships. Sure people could still do so and then use LFG to bolster missing slots, but it did eventually lead to casual runs with complete strangers who didn't know each other and didn't care to. RDF built on that because you can't run an RDF system until people are comfortable with not caring who they play with, which was first introduced with LFG. 
---
I never made as many friends in any other game as I did in vanilla WoW, and I never made as many friends after TBC  either.
---
Randomly checked who was highest on the server, someone in Hyjal who is level 59, not on anymore. No clue if it was a GM or not. Hyjal didn't register as a zone in Vanilla, so we're even more confused.

Doesn't keep me from questing for hours though.

If you DC in queue you go to the back, if you DC ingame you have a grace periode.
---
Nar I don't agree, your playing an MMO, you need interaction from other players good or bad.. it's good for you.
---
I'm playing wow for the first time and my pet is making me super frustrated. It just disappears every so often, unable to be revived or called. I have been feeding it. I'm 99% sure it's a bug (happened 4 times). I'm not sure if I should just re-roll at this point. A hunter that has to find a new pet every hour doesn't sound fun at all.
---
I‚Äôd imagine xfers to a full server are unlikely. If anything they‚Äôd be doing transfers for people to get off Herod.  On second thought though, with paid transfers I could also see them opening them up to all realms to make that sweet sweet $$$.
---
Opposite faction = kill on sight.   you are doing it right.
---
That's why I go ret until 60...
---
Yes. Camping outside of the arena is fun too.
---
Just spent 10 minutes trying to explain the difference between mage and warlock so my wife could decide which to pick and she wouldn't make up her mind. Showed her your two comics about it and she immediately picked mage.

If you test it, let me know if it works. I don‚Äôt have a wand yet.
---
I had to vendor some items in Stormwind to pay for my flight path and buy them back from the vendor in Redridge once I had killed a few mobs for some silver. It's a tough world out there.
---
It's already a 5-6 hour queue that early in the day? That's intense.
---
Appreciate the response.
---
No one knows at this stage mate if we will be able to transfer. If your mates don‚Äôt wanna come join you is tough it out for a few weeks and hopefully the population and ques will die down. Priority would be playing with friends. You could all ways start on another server in the hopes of being able to transfer. But I‚Äôd just do the days you can wait for the que( like early Sunday morning) and slowly grind.
---
Y'all keep making fun of me and I'm not summoning you after repairs.

---
With First Aid.

He was gone as soon as he appeared it seems, a handful of us were able to see it, but no longer online.
---
pragmatically speaking, anybody who CAN heal likely will be asked to heal because they are hard to find. You can bluntly refuse, just be aware of the time you're wasting. All the best raiding gear for shaman, priests, and druids is straight up healing gear, which kinda does pigeonhole you late game, yeah. Unless you like healing.
---
Easiest classes to play are hunter and warlock, the pet classes. Not that pets are OP, just a little more forgiving to have something that can tank adds for you and generally soak some damage and keep you leveling with minimal downtime. Both have decent damage solo and in groups. Warlocks also can summon people, which right now is pretty huge as many people won't be able or willing to run all the way to the entrance of Blackfathom Deeps (or your favorite way out of the way dungeon).

Its not the fact that he's playing in the boys' room, it's the fact that he's stuck in the closet. Uh huh!

Honestly even "low" pop servers get blocked up every day, mine was a "low" pop server and I sit in a 30 min to an hour queue every time i log on
---
Make sure you buy and rank up your spells. And put them on your bar after
---
That's something I've always disliked. The world is a complete mess because of Cata. You're switching between so many time periods while leveling it's impossible to keep up. And on top of that, your character is assumed to have done all these super powerful things when all they've really done is kill a bunch of boars for 120 levels. 
---
I've played a lot of FFXIV and even though there are issues with the pacing, the MSQ makes your character actually *feel* like they're the Warrior of Light. When you're credited for defeating Gaius or Lahabrea, it's because you've actually gone into the dungeon or trial and spent time and effort to do it. In WoW you get the credit for killing the Lich King even though you most likely have never even set foot in ICC, maybe not even Northrend at all. It makes it so hard to care about the story, even when it's written well.

Warrior is ¬´¬†the tank¬†¬ª in vanilla 
---
The hardest class to level but it‚Äôs the only tank in raid. And once 60 with a pocket healer you are an invincible beast in pvp 
---
Not joke healer+warrior is phenomenal
---
I use to play a lot of vanilla WoW back when I was 10 years old on my elemental shaman. I'm leaning pretty forward into coming back into this game as it looks so much fun on Twitch. Whats a class that is needed in a lot of groups so I would not have to wait long? I was thinking of switching into becoming a priest or a warlock.
---
I‚Äôm amused and heartened by the community, and by little things like hopping off a boat at Menethil with a group of strangers who all buffed each other, and then everyone buffing the new group jumping onto the boat at the same time.
---
I‚Äôm finding the grind and the travel slightly worse than I remembered, particularly quest item drop rates and very long runs to vendors/inventory management. 
---
I didn‚Äôt expect to make it past 15, but now I‚Äôm 15 and want to at least get to 20 for teleports. But the leveling has really slowed down already.
---
Yea, i am not happy that so many cant play (not being one of them, i havent seen a queue past opening day) but the fact that they did what we asked should be praised a little.
---
Yea I'm getting kinda tired if people saying "just roll on a low pop server". Um, which ones genius?

This is it cheif

I got a [Guillotine Axe](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2807/guillotine-axe) on my first SFK run and almost equipped it without looking.  Now it's sitting in my bank, just waiting.  Any experienced players know what I can expect to get for it in a month or three?
---
It's hard to say until most people are doing some of the high conflict areas like stranglethorn vale or the plaguelands. But I CAN say that there have been no alliance raids on the barrens yet while I've been online, so that's a good sign that even on PvP servers, right now people just want to level.
---
But all servers are super high pop. So it's roll on one or not roll at all.
---
It‚Äôs not even RP it‚Äôs more of. We all have to kill this dude so instead of us fighting over it let‚Äôs do this in a nice way.
---
I spent a half hour today doing a rather lengthy fetch quest that ended in me getting a cloth robe.
---
As a rogue.
---
That I happily equipped because it only was -3 armor and it gave +3 stam.
---
I would never imagine doing such a thing in retail, it's just so devoid of purpose.  I had to find where to go. I was in the wrong place for a long time. I didn't just run to the yellow marker.  The upgrade had opportunity cost, but I happily made that choice.

It's good, ended up horde instead of alliance, and playing with some friends who want to jump on chat together instead of a guy with a new group of friends. No hard feelings between us but it's all good now.
---
He didn't forget
---
I dont think it will be fixed but who knows
---
Did you not read the portion where I was getting camped? I got a little bit of sweet vengeance and figured id leave before needing to do another corpse run and then be camped by cowards 4v1 killing someone lower than them.
---
This sounds normal. *feels warm nostalgia*
---
That is POG af
---
ok, i found it, i still need to link credit card to it ??????????
---
Hero !!!
---
All the servers are gonna a be populated. You dont want to deal with Herod's queue times believe me
---
This. Battle shout+ bom are like 30% attack power increase in early lvls.
---
Yeah take that with a grain of salt though, because I never raided in vanilla.
---
After level 10 warlock leveling is easymode.
---
Yeah I don't think he's played classic if that's what he thinks. Obviously you will see a lot of the same but the difference will be seen between dungeons and raids. You won't see the same set tmogged for all.
---
Thanks for the quick and insightful response. What do you mean by downtime?
---
Thanks!
---
I haven‚Äôt played alliance in so long. I kinda miss stormwind. Good thing we have a raid coming up soon
---
They sell you a service that you cant use. Fun fun.
---
Wait, this just hit me. So in WoW, you need gun training before you can have a gun, but you don't need to do that in real life?
---
Because idiots think the level 18 saying LFM DM in West fall is tryna run dire maul
---
Mages have more competition than warriors, simply because there‚Äôs more cloth wearing classes in raids than plate.
---
Kept running past a player afking with a script making them jump.  I reported them each time.
---
If all the afkers just logged the queues might be reasonable.  Might.
---
Thank you so much this was driving me insane
---
i feel that only for today i said more than 500 times thx and ppl said it to me for helping each other, trade buffs, food and stuff. bfa isnt wow...
---
Even on a Wrath PS, the LFD system (don't confuse LFG and LFD. LFG is TBC's group system and Pre-3.3 Wrath's (the only difference between them was Wrath LFG let you select a role instead of having to type it in your note). LFD is Post-3.3 Wrath to Current's system) is pretty awful. (the LFG system allowed you to make groups, not find dungeon groups, and was fairly flexible about to look for dungeon groups, elite quest groups, PVP groups, or just hanging out in a zone groups. Once it turned into LFD, you could ONLY find dungeon groups, until they eventually added the custom group finder, which as mentioned works much more like the original LFG system did, just with more bells and whistles).
---
It's just too convenient to spam dungeons, so it's all about speed, instead of simply enjoying running the dungeon.
---
Just removing the teleporting aspect would SUBSTANTIALLY improve the system by making it convenient to form groups...but not TOO convenient to spam dungeons, as you still have to get to the dungeon.
---
I wouldn't expect much for it. It's a rare drop in there, but it's not an amazing twink weap.
---
Have fun!
---
Do you want to sit through all of the Lord of the Rings extended cuts and enjoy the beautiful story or would you rather watch a 90 minute popcorn action movie that looks great but you‚Äôll never think about again?
---
That‚Äôs classic vs retail imo.

Its kind of like magic. Imagine a list of reliable tanks and healers that are almost always available to you, and all you have to do is ask.

Mauradon @princess
---
went last night with the boys...and we get in the dungeon and we all realize we dont even have a rogue to make use of the mask...
---
Just use keybinds
---
Yeah I noticed that today.
---
Works perfect, thanks!
---
Dude I'll jump in a pond right now if you give me underwater breathing
---
Mine just hit me, finished and 203min in queue remain!
---
Pink in what sense? Class color Raid frames didn't exist yet.
---
It will largely depend on what they do with Classic in the next 6 months.  If OSRS has just remained the same, it would have died.  The only reason it is so successful, is because Jagex developed new content for it.  What is Blizzard going to do, just keep releasing content from past expansions?
---
I am a Warlock who buffs everyone I see with 10 minute water breathing so that they don't die in the barrens...
---
I played retail from the beginning of Cata up until now. I dont really ever remember becoming friends or even chatting with people from lfd or lfr.
---
WoW Classic has been on for 3 days and the amount of people helping each other is unreal. If I'm stuck in an area (happens often. Squishy mage.) I can and have literally just invite to group anyone standing around and they will help me. In return I take an hour and help them with whatever they need.
---
It's so refreshing being in a community that actually gives a shit about one another and everyone going for the same goal.
---
you can trade a healthstone if you are really dedicated
---
Grab forgot her pills today.
---
some dude took my egg too right after i was done with the mob. he "stole" it, ran away and i got 3 mobs on me. 
---
we later made a group to kill the big spider mom. i still tried to kill him with mobs before, because my egg.
---
why do people think that people want to buy random shitty names?
---
Cool another lower pop server to avoid and make the already high servers look even more attractive, making them even higher pop, making the low pp servers even less attractive, making the high pop servers more attractive, making the low pop servers less attractive, making the high pop serve...
---
Why? Is this name wanted?
---
Quite a different feel from retail.  Well written!
---
I didn't steal anything?
---
catch up
---
i did it in idk hour and a half last night? one trip thru deadmines got us 2, and we just swam there from gromgol, was pretty simple actually, but maybe we were lucky
---
Holy shit, Masque is available for 1.13! Awesome
---
Retail got too focused on your character being a hero/god.  In classic i just feel like an adventurer looking for work
---
Its like an old prog rock album from the 70's. When it reaches the end, it just flows right into the beginning.
---
Well good news, they're working on fixing that. I'm not sure what the exact plan is but the level 50 MSQ is definitely being cut down. 
---
But if you think ARR was bad, you should really try BfA.
---
That‚Äôs why somes also call them bard, for being a buffs machine in raid.
---
\#showtooltip  
---
 /castsequence reset=combat Freezing Trap, Feign Death 
---
i put it as cast sequence cuz you dont want to accidentally hit the button while youre on GCD and the FD pops but the trap is a bit late and you end up breaking FD by casting the trap late...
---
or you can try your way like this
---
\#showtooltip
---
/cast Freezing Trap 
---
/petfollow 
---
/cast \[combat\] Feign Death

this way itll pop the trap first

---
Yes. 
---
Just pick the same faction, either horde or alliance. 
---
Your race might make you start in different areas but that doesn't lock you away from anything, you're just start apart.
---
Your class will give you class specific quests which you can help with but you can't have the quest to complete it unless you're that class.
---
I really like watching Nixxiom and Lazy Peon, they're both just questing and having fun. Both really chill to listen to while I play.
---
i wanna know about more settings too. must be something interesting more
---
It's alot smaller of a download too... 55ish GB for retail, 4ish GB for classic. Wasted about 2 hours DLing retail.
---
Because that‚Äôs what heroes do.
---
Yeah I'd like no changes for a while, give everyone a chance to do end raids (not everyone but u know)
---
Well, don‚Äôt hate the player. Blizzard has forced us to extreme measures. People have taken days off and looked forward to this ever since classic was announced . 
---
I log off if i know I‚Äôm gonna be away for several hours, but if I need to shower, cook, clean the house, go downtown or whatever I make my fianc√© jump my char every 20 min or so. The past days I‚Äôve been online roughly 14 hours without logging of, most of it I‚Äôve been actually playing and longest break has been an hour. Usually I set the alarm 1-2 hour before I need to wake up to get in queue (queues are usually pretty short before 11:00 in the morning).
---
I roleplay a merchant. Time is money friend.
---
No problem!! What server are you in that allowed you to equip and hop back in lol
---
I waved at a Tauren running by, and 5-10 minutes later, he sent a whisper waving back saying he had barely seen the emote.
---
I macro /startattack to a commonly used ability, like flame shock.
---
I know what you mean, but sometimes you gotta take a long shit and ask a family member to press space just in case...
---
Oh shit you made me laugh loud in 4 am..
---
I set them specifically for Bartender, there's an option for your keybindings.
---
Just put your foot down and tell them to stop. That you're enjoying yourself without them and you don't want to get focused on leveling pace. 
---
Explain to them that the journey to 60 is what interests you most. Not being 60.
---
A-FUCKING-MEN!
---
It was spooky :p
---
I‚Äôm still fucking waiting... #1604...
---
Five minutes my ass... it‚Äôs been almost an hour
---
&gt;Wow classic content and there's nothing new on the way.
---
Lol, none of it is... new.
---
Oh nice that might do the trick, thanks!
---
As a priest I went to ratchet for some dumb reason. Long story short. I stood on the guards and watched horde kill themselves hitting me many a times. It was a great night.

Me not want to cry.

Especially in 2019. Girls on the internet aren't an anomaly really anymore like they were in 2006
---
Shaman buffs are way more interesting and powerful, don't worry, when people start raiding, Shamans won't be overlooked. If anything it's the other way around.
---
They have made it enough of a pain in the ass to activate with pirate software that if just rather spend the 5-10 buck on a quasi legal grey market solution
---
Forcing people to wait time is not time gating...interesting.
---
Yes we do.
---
Be glad you don't use polearms at least, they're a premium weapon and so cost 1g for training
---
Or just use Skada, because it's better.

I logged out during primetime for the first time since release. You're welcome.

Lol yea I had a 5 minute queue for 6 hours yesterday longest 5 minutes of my life lol

I think it did alright.

---
Sorry, can you elaborate on this? I play a rogue and am a noob/just started, whats the best swing bar timer and how do you time skills? Do you just cast them in the middle of the swing?
---
You just woke up today and decided that you wanted to start an argument with someone, huh?
---
That's whack. My guildmatws are all not playing with add-ons. I even told them I'm not running dbm
---
I'm an Australian. I follow the @Blizzard\_ANZ twitter feed. I had to stop and think for a moment because it was about 15% potentially real.
---
While there are \*some\* Australian's that talk like that, it's not common, and it's highly unlikely to come from an official company feed.
---
Allow myself to introduce... myself
---
Questing adds are good for alts. First and maybe second playthrough is best done raw.
---
Saw duskwood and knew what was coming
---
well yeah that's end game, you can't tank with dw while leveling since you have no hit (also getting 2 good 1h is harder).
---
Some servers are much higher pop than others. Herod, Faerlina and Stalagg are much higher pop than most of the other ones. On Blaumeux I get maybe at most an hour queue.
---
Jokerd 53 should be the leader for western servers, right?
---
Are you in America? If he looks at the server list he will see all the medium and low servers :) Or are you stuck on a particular one.
---
My work mate has to play after 10 pm when his kids go to bed lol.
---
/u/Grunex Jokerd just dinged to 53!
---
I think he's talking about Naowh. They just got back online and only have 4 in their party due to queues so they've dropped back a few levels.
---
There is a button in your general tab you can hit that will toggle autoattack.
---
Or you could just right click.
---
You can't bubble hearth till about lv50 IIRC
---
Looks like it came out in 2003. I was in high school. I was playing Nexon's Dark Age at that time.
---
what level are you? no problems so far in terms of hunter specific jank?
---
Nope, Classic isn't either of those things for me. We did a flawless WC clear last night with a lvl 18 healer in shit tier gear. Now he has blues and greens, so we can drag him to DM next. :D
---
I‚Äôd like to see the heirloom  effect made into equipment so players can use whatever mount they want. Doesn‚Äôt solve the problem but at least we wouldn‚Äôt have to hear that mount anymore.
---
Yeah there's some that you just won't use that much but you'll want it somewhere accessible if you want to use it. 
---
I also recommend using a macro like the following. 
---
&gt;#showtooltip
---
&gt;/cast [whatever totem] 
---
Because you can give the macro a quick name so you can see it written on the action bar so you don't have to remember what your poison cleansing totem looks like.
---
Laughed way too hard at this.

---
Ikr? Soul shards go to waste faster then M&amp;Ms and TicTacs. Its unreal, but its kinda super fun.
---
If classic is successful enough that Blizz should probably dedicate a team, I reckon they're in an awkward position. If they dedicate a team to Vanilla that'll bleed more players from retail (which makes me think they won't unless Vanilla keeps its numbers for 3 months+) , if they make the next expac more like Vanilla (I doubt they would) they'll make people use to flying/solo-play/ease leave. 
---
I'm fully expecting some kind of push in the next expac for more community style playing and leveling somehow -- but it'll still be not up to vanilla players standards. If vanilla doesn't keep numbers up for awhile I think the chance of new content is super small, we may get a TBC server though, I don't see why they wouldn't.
---
That was pretty much me back then too. I never got into to WoW then. Too easy, too antisocial, too boring I felt. Fast-forward to today and I hesitantly started Classic thinking I already knew how this would go. Instead I've been having tons of fun, and this is the first MMO in quite a long time to actually make me feel anything while playing it. While playing Retail, FFXIV, etc., I don't feel like I'm doing anything. Nothing feels challenging, so nothing feels rewarding. Been loving it so far. Really need to pick a main char though(instead I made a 3rd char. lol.)
---
Love that simple UI. I‚Äôm using bartender and Luna too but it doesn‚Äôt look as clean as yours
---
I know right? I'm still in the lower levels (12) but every interaction I've had so far has been extremely pleasant. I party'd up for a couple quests, expecting the guys would not even say a word and rush to the objectives as it would happen in retail, but to my surprise people were actually very nice, we spent some time talking but I never felt like it was lost time. 
---
People are also helping each other in the trade and city chats. Nothing compared to the constant troll/flamefest in Boralus Harbor in broken French. People here know how to spell our language unlike in BfA where half the players are illiterate, I think it says a lot about the average player age.
---
I mean there are encounters in MC where you need more than 2 tanks and a few dps need to be ready to sword and board it.   Since there is no such thing as multi spec you are going to be off tanking adds as Arms or Fury and be totally fine.
---
Same. I'd love them to re-release BC, but tweaked to not have flying.
---
But how did he fit in the cup?
---
Paladins are the best single target healers in the game bar none. 
---
But yes in raids you heal. In dungeons you do anything.
---
So I was out killing shit, and this mage runs by and slaps me with an AI.  A light bulb popped over my head - I had Lock Candy!  So I made a healthstone and ran and ran saying "wait" - finally the mage stopped, and I traded the candy.  Felt good.  Theeeeeeeeeen a minute later, mageypants is back, opens trade, and I get some conjured water.  
---
God damn, that was cool.
---
You won‚Äôt drink it... lol
---
A true friend
---
Oh how the turntables.
---
Play on a server without a que.  Even low populated servers are absolutely packed from what I've seen so far.  Low/Med/High clearly doesn't mean what it used to mean.
---
This joke is so good I‚Äôm not sure the whole thing wasn‚Äôt a setup to deploy this weapons-grade pun.
---
Also curious
---
Just like airline pricing
---
It's actually easier to just hop off the ledge  onto that same lip imo
---
You're getting +8 stam and there is nothing you can do about it.
---
Even though this is satire, it still pisses me off. Cause there are so many people brainwashed into thinking retail is a good game that requires skill.
---
You and me both - I was on for hours today - finished one quest. :]
---
so I had one of those collectors set pets on my account back in the day. The lil diablo I think. Do I still have access to it on the same account now with classic?
---
Your most used earths will be stone skin, tremor, and earth bind. 
---
Air- Grace of air, windfury, grounding
---
Fire- fire nova, flame strike, magma, with an occasional frost resistance
---
Water- mana, healing, poison cleanse, occasional fire resistance
---
When fighting other shamans or druids  nature resistance (water) can help
---
Idk, not once did this happen to me
---
Nice strawman.
---
Are you replacing your spells in your action bar? When you rank up a spell you have to replace it with the higher rank spell.
---
I‚Äôd recommend watching videos from a Youtuber named SoupaSoka.  His videos may be what you are looking for.

Apex is still good though
---
Time is your most valuable asset in WoW. Not worth it.
---
I moved to a lower population server, Surferas, and I‚Äôm still stuck in a queue. It‚Äôs the newest server for goddamn sake!!
---
I guess but then where do you draw the line? Don‚Äôt get me wrong fuck these people afk for 12 hours
---
Isn't that what Classic WoW is essentially?  
---
I mean, it is amazing, but eventually people will want more, or different, just like they did before BC. and just before WOTLK and every other expansion. Once the hype and circlejerk runs out, or the content runs out - whichever first.. Blizzard just banking millions off 15 year old content.
---
god bless
---
I've been playing since 2005 and deadmines has always been VC to me
---
I gamed with that mouse for so long. Classic. Love the floppy drive. I think we might have the same desktop? https://i.imgur.com/5EecnMQ.jpg

You aren‚Äôt the hero we deserve, but you‚Äôre the hero we need

Further proof that the vast majority of wow classic players are well past their childish ways
---
Flying really killed it. I hope they don't bring in TBC. Because having run everywhere makes it feel like a proper world
---
I am fairly sure that nobody from project management walked into the class design meeting and specifically demanded to reduce certain classes to a shell of their former self in the name of "balance."
---
Ive met a couple new players and theyre so nooby its cute. I help them out as much as I can.

I‚Äôve been going UP in queue for over an hour, what the fucking fuck.

When I give a buff to anyone and they don't buff me back, I get upset and tell myself it's the last time I ever buff anyo- *Oh a druid! You get a fort!*

&gt;This "WoW Classic Community" is destroying the wholesome fabric of gatekeeping and elitism that has made WoW strong.

fuckin lmao

&gt;I earned my right to be the best at WoW and people who like Classic are just mad that they're not good enough to play Retail.

Even with World PVP, on Atiesh, the alliance we were attacking in Westfall ended up banding together to drive us out. This is the most fun I‚Äôve had playing an MMO since Vanilla.
---
One of the web comics I follow is PvP. When I started reading it Brent and his then girlfriend Jade started playing WoW and Jade played a little while Brent was at work (he's still in L10 jumble, she's in T1 on a moonsaber).
---
This week's comic had him asking her if she was planning to play classic at all and whether she could keep it under control, the suggestion was no.
---
Don't increase the level cap, use lore, quests, attunements, keys, buffs, etc to give talents, skills or access to the new content. 
---
Got 5 new zones in the latest xpac, give the new talents and skills as rewards for finishing the main quest lines in each zone. Gate them behind achieves. The artifact weapons would have been a great gate keeper for expansion progress to denote endgame. Got all 3 slots filled at x level. Great that's the start of endgame.
---
Only way it matters is if you are holding them back somehow.
---
This is especially funny because I was doing this in Orgrimmar last night. 2 at a time to the lowest level characters I could find. Had to chase a few.
---
Better start at what
---
You won't regret it man.
---
I'd say it's on the medium scale for optimal play, and easy-medium scale for casual play.
---
The game eases you into it as new skills are added, and you'll learn the best combinations for dealing with single mobs or multiple mobs at once.
---
For solo play, the biggest thing is just not pulling too many mobs. And level your bandages.
---
DPSing is very straight forward, and tanking just requires applying sunder armor to the mobs, then doing AoE damage to keep them all interested in you.
---
It's a fun class :)
---
 
---
Should you wait to sell stuff in the AH until the server is older?
---
Stash everything in bank and wait till later?
---
short bastards
---
You have a really confusing standard for immersion.
---
Eff the living!
---
Tom Tom doesnt automatically track quests. You need to get an addons like questie that has info on quests and it will have coordinates you can click and it will turn the tom Tom on to point in the direction of the coordinates. Or have a quest leveling guide
---
They're charging money, I'm so salty today.
---
We play alone most of the time so I can‚Äôt see how
---
Yeah, we have lots of cool stuff for people in our groups, but it's not as easy to give out to randos we pass on the road.
---
to be fair i do almost always reject group invites.  not because i‚Äôm antisocial, but because i‚Äôm very noob-y and don‚Äôt want to mess people up (or be judged when i inevitably die :‚Äô))
---
We had a UPS for the modem and wireless base station, did raid during vanilla from a lap top during power outages.
---
I also was helping out a bit a Auberdine. Wizban the gnome on Pagle server. Free food and drinks too as a mage. DOn't waste money at the vendor!
---
There are a few funny things that can happen. I remember in Wotlk when I engaged a group of enemies as tank. Suddenly the healer died and I couldn't move anymore. Guy misclicked and gave me the 3 minute shield that kills him. Meanwhile the enemies murder the adc's.
---
Yes, it does. He was able to apply the buff on a separate group of players but not us (guildies). Similarly, non-guildie warriors were able to buff us just fine.
---
I'm not disagreeing with that, IMO BC arena was the ultimate. I spent hours during in Nagrand queuing with buddies. But yes, in vanilla the way to be 'the best', since that what GM/HWL is supposed to be, is simply to spend the most time there. It's just that for now retail is the better choice, but I'd for sure vote for a BC release
---
Do it! It‚Äôs a great game!
---
im trying to make a macro without making a macro because it wont allow it in this UI
---
The Deadmines = TD, makes sense.
---
Yeah it is my dad works at Blizzard
---
putting some add ons on classic dont make it retail, thats fucking dumb to say.
---
Hey, in case you might still be interested: I bought a GTX960 for my rig (Phenom II X4 955 BE, 8GB RAM, Windows 10 and classic on a SSD) and it runs fantastically well in 4K, surprisingly. 
---
My settings are a custom mix (no anti aliasing whatsoever, distance and density sliders to 10, shadows on high, water on high, everything at about ‚Äûhigh‚Äú) and I‚Äòm able to run classic in 4K at locked 60 FPS (60 barely drops, only drops I had were in barrens. Everything else was a rock solid 60). 
---
Really happy about this, I spent a total of 80 bucks on my upgrades (most of it for the GPU and SSD) and got the full 4K/60fps experience.
---
Just play the way you want, enjoy it, and put them on ignore lol
---
I will trade any of these 30min buffs for a 30min warlock trip to the dungeon, where I will need his staff because its a nice two hander for me üòÖ also will get the same buffs he gets. Another 15mins regroup corpse runs saved by soulstoned healer. Love your warlocks and warriors people üòÖ

you do realize that you get a 6 minutes grade period to log back to your previous position right?
---
Right? I won't give away the whole logic for it, but it is not just a random number generator at play to choose when to press. 
---
Looks the same to them as someone slapping their keyboard every once in a while.
---
Me luv you. Me protect you

Are your using the hamstring strafe method it save hp?

Wooooo!

Beautifull esp at night. Wonder if theres the old warrior coming of age quest at the summit of a peak in barrens.

Love how this subreddit has the odd post with people legit bragging for breaching ToS and being a dickbag to those in queue.

Don't forget your flint and tinder.
---
It's not goddamn picnic, that's for sure.
---
If you have someone that will level with you, it's much better. If you are charging solo, Godspeed my friend.
---
It is easily the most tedious class to level, but I wouldn't call it difficult.  As long as you are careful not to bite off more than you can chew, it's fine.
---
Lmao I‚Äôm not sure what game you‚Äôre playing but you can bubble hearth once you get bubble....

&gt;LFG was around in TBC but it really only got refined into a "I don't give a shit who I play with" by the middle of WOTLK. 
---
&gt;
---
Oh yeah, that's right. Forgot about the first version, and honestly don't even know exactly how it worked. 
---
&gt;People are lazy, I include myself in that, but I have a drive to be sociable so I resented and worked against that drift that came into the game. But yes, people just went the easy route, and why wouldn't they? The designers of the game set the rules, we just created the atmosphere, and that was awesome in vanilla, good in TBC, OK in WOTLK and then pretty shit after that.
---
Yeah, I'm certainly not blaming the player base for choosing the easy option. I am lazy too. 
---
It feels so hard to make new friends in retail, you play with someone, they're good and friendly, but I hesitate to ask them about adding to friends because why would they go through the hassle of playing with me when there are thousands like me in the queue. It's weird, and honestly it's probably a bit of social anxiety from my part haha. I also didn't play in a raiding guild the last two expansions (couldn't raid with my work schedule), which is one part where you still have a bit of the social aspect left in the game.
---
wisdom hunter, might pet

i noticed in a lot of areas with fps, horde fps fly very low in some areas which allow for things like this, is it the same on alliance side?

I can't exactly remember, but I thought it was just:
---
/cast !bear form  
---
Do I have to add an /unmorph above it?
---
First of all you need to copy the name of that rival bag man, roll alliance, join a PVP guild, and camp that Mf'er. &gt;.&lt; No one fucks with the Jesus of Bags.
---
Then they dont want to play wow that much.
---
It's rough. 
---
You can't heal. 
---
You use rage to deal big damage so if you need to heal inbetween fights you'll lose your rage and be weak again. 
---
If you pull more than one enemy you'll need to do some interesting and tough stuff to not die. 
---
But when you get to a high level it suddenly flips and you are wild.
---
The fucking warlock lmao.
---
*Cries in 2 second healthstone cast and trade window*
---
You kill. I heal. Good warrior. :)
---
My point is realistically, that you're overcharging in a market where there's very little room to do that. On top of that, player reputation matters A LOT in Classic. If you're known as that price gouging guy, it's gonna hurt your chances at being the guy people come to for bags, or enchanting or w/e. Your player reputation matters.
---
On retail? I'd see no problem. But if you're trying to be a part of the server's community, you gotta look at what you're doing now as an investment for what comes later.
---

Waited like 15 minutes and it fixed itself. Idk what happened but at least it's working now

The game only became cancerous when arena hit.

Nice, you got any other magic strings of text like that?  I know theres another one that zooms you out more.

Man i wanted that dagg so bad for my twink rogue. Classic hunter is classic.
---
Pet pathing was what I was referring to. Only 19 so far.
---
On private servers pet pathing was often atrocious and even in the best of cases had issues with attacking things in water or had odd paths around objects like trees. Once I had a pet run around three trees when I'd move just a few feet to the side.

Keanu hates Barrens chat it's one of Keanu's pet peeves...

"Put Garrosh in charge of the Wrathgate mission. Trust me."

not sure Alt + F3 is a default hotkey - does nothing for me.

Right, look at smart guys here. Thinks he‚Äôs smarter than every Brain at Blizzard. 
---
Let me school you soon, 10,000 people on one layer may be doable. The servers are handling 40,000 plus.
---
40,000 people on one server would make resources impossible.
---
Want to craft, sorry no
---
Want to do an escort quest-no
---
Want to win STV fishing tourney against 40,000 other player- no
---
And for big events where everyone shows up in one area - boom server crash
---
If you could do that , why would we even have layers Einstein?
---
Typical horde greed asking for mats /s . I went to North shore Abbey and gave out free linen bags to all people popping into the server
---
Tailoring/Ench is the recommended way to go, but prioritize your enjoyment of the game over the efficiency of your character.
---
Bear in mind I say that as the guy who rolled the tailor/ench dwarf priest following a levelling guide. I AM minmaxer, but if you're not, don't stress.
---
Couldn't be more true. Earlier today around 2AM I was trying to get my Nelf from Loch Modan to Stormwind but I got kinda lost, so I asked this random dwarf I spotted farming if he knew where to go. We ended up having a nice chat while he guided me for about 10-15minutes all the way to the ironforge trains while he could've just quested. 
---
This community has been amazing so far.
---
When leveling, engineering is very useful for ranged pulls as a paladin.
---
Yeah it is, there's a clip of him talking about it. He appears a few times.
---
You are the greatest, I was thinking my mouse or keyboard had something sticking and was losing my mind!
---
So say an ally warlock stood there and dotted lowbies that were flagged as the flew by, could they die in flight?
---
Always ear your greens kids.
---
Why are you trying to accomplish this? Couldn‚Äôt you just have the macro cast the spell for you?
---
Same with my dad.  My brother built him a little gaming pc a few years ago, and all 3 of us played loads in 05-06.  I've been thinking about getting him 6 months just to explore Azeroth again, though I know he doesnt really have the time to invest again
---
Its all dependant on drops. Lots of people vie for rogue weps..except.daggers...so alot.of times they get daggers.
---
Try bringing up GeForce experience and checking that you have enabled the overlay
---
I was now coming here to say the same thing. When my little vacation ends and I can only play nights, what's going to happen?
---
it‚Äôs honestly all I think about while in class
---
Lol, thats pretty cool, better hope those bats dont 'bless' you in return.

It could be more weighted towards the tip than a typical sword of the size with a longer hilt. It's basically the impractical two-handers used in the bronze age that were 100% just for show.

Take the Zeppelin to the Barrens! Also don't be afraid to ask these questions in the /1 general chat either I'm sure someone would be nice to help

Wtf, thunderfury sounds like a lovely place. My server is just full of white nationalist
---
If you stood here as an alliance priest, could you mind control flagged people and make them get off at an earlier stop?
---
Go barrens son
---
I also want to know this. As a priest, the wand sound is driving me insane.
---
I have 4 drops across 2 level 10 toons. Based on my experience I'd say it's a little odd.
---
Looks perfect man, grats.
---
Came here to say this!
---
You could get to hyjal in vanilla and I do believe it showed the name. Look into wall climbing.
---
Is that because I'm alliance and you hate it or because you're horde and you love it?
---
Either way, may love not warcraft. Peace my brother.
---
You are a fucking boss.went into you profile and just upvoted stuff
---
Grind or go to another low level area and do the quests there. Most likely you will just grind.
---
A tip for Classic is to always be grinding while you are traveling during questing so you won't have to do it between areas. Like yeah walking on roads is safe but you get more xp if you don't take the road and grind ur way to wherever you are trying to get.
---
Head to cross roads, should be a ton. Grab the quest from varimathras, and the 2 in thunderbluff and the 2 from orgrimmar and head to Ragefire chasm as well, should get you a level or so
---
Interesting ty I‚Äôll try it
---
I‚Äôve been tanking as a bear and though it‚Äôs been tough at times I‚Äôve managed fine, as a warrior you should struggle even less. If it‚Äôs what you want , put in the time to learn it, mark what you want the group to be attacking so it‚Äôs easier to keep threat and go at your own pace until you‚Äôre comfortable with the role.
---
Better to level learning to tank than jumping into it late game where the dungeons are much more difficult.
---
im looking to do lots of pvp, and world pvp. the most interesting class i see looks wise is druid, i really love their endgame armor. what are they like? are they stuck to healing? can i 1v1 in in world pvp
---
Agreed, not sure if i hate it or love it. Any idea what addon it is?
---
Over supply of everything, people crafting for free and people having no idea about prices.
---
Also, nobody has any spare money.
---
I have a numpad on my mouse so mine look like his
---
You answer your own question
---
Reminds me i need to get on my pickpocket macro
---
It's rough mate I'm at level 15 now. Weapon upgrades are of utmost importance. As a BS I made a 2h copper axe with 9.0 dps. Just now I purchased from someone a 13.1 DPS axe with 3 Stam and 3 str for 18s.
---
I try to kill mobs 1-2 levels below or at my level and it makes it easier. Once you go a level or 2 above your own level it's awful
---
You can cast a lower ranked version to conserve mana
---
Pvpmode
---
Only problem im having is finding a guild with more than 20 people.
---
Test
---
Thanks for the advice, is there point buying from vendors at low levels or just trying to gear up from items you find while playing? Or should I save currency for learning new skills?
---
sick humblebrag bro
---
I belly laughed from this.  Thank you.
---
Not sure if this question fits the thread, but how should I spec as a warrior leveling up? I have a friend or two I play with pretty frequently, so I think being on the tankier side of things might be more helpful but I genuinely have no idea as I‚Äôm a total noob.
---
As long as you're out and back in within a minute or so, you don't have to re-wait in a queue. I am on Sulfuras though, which had a ~10min queue 2 hours or so ago.
---
Still waiting for GHI and Outfitter
---
I got on just after 5 today and it was a 2.5k. When do you log on?
---
Don't bother catching up. If they're ahead, it's gonna stay that way or they have to slow down for you.
---
Classic bad, BFA good

Updoots to the left
---
What abomination of a form has that druid shapeshifted into to get his motw and thorns hands on opposite sides?
---
Mine is Nemsy from hs
---
What about that drive-by Bloodrage Battleshout?
---
It depends. 
---
The currency now is worth more than it will be later. 
---
A silver for a bag is worth the same than 4 silver for the same bag in 6 months. It's the same bag it's buying. 
---
So it doesn't matter if you use the money when you get it. If you hoard the money then it's value will decrease. 
---
The only hard use of currency is buying a mount. I'd recommend waiting until you're level 35 and then working the AH to get the money you need.
---
I got 2 6 slots by level 10
---
No it was a bummer when she woke me up because we‚Äôre out of granola and she reeeaaally wants granola but is comfy laying in bed with the cats and her new book. So you drag your crusty eyed ass out of bed after 2.5 hours of sleep because you‚Äôre a dumb man child that stayed up late playing WoW.
---
Oh, he said gf not wife. Oops.
---
I love running around and giving people PWF and healing them while they're fighting. I saved a guy at 1% today while fighting a mob. It nust feels great to feel like an actual community again.

A few years ago, after spending 13 years playing WoW, I thought I would never come back. So, it's great to enjoy what I fell in love with.

If you go to steelseries.com got to the download page you can find the old Zengine , I not long ago figured it out.

Of course, enjoy it!

As a broke ass student right now I just want you to know that friends like you are one in a million. I'm fortunate to have support but many others don't. Thank you for being such a good friend to your buddy in his time of need!
---
POLO!
---
Does it continue after your group exits and restarts the game? I'd still report the issue endgame regardless
---
I had issues with being unable to skin animals I had fully looted until I quit and restarted,could be some flag got set wrong on your profiles? I'm shooting in the dark here
---
I chortled. Ya got me

and yet here you are,  can't get enough of this post eh

Diablo deals with larger touches and doesn't go into details too much.  It's much harder to screw up a Diablo story.  Blizzard is free to add the content wherever it makes sense.

&gt; He open traded with me and didn't even ask and just shoved two of his name into my inventory 
---
You joke, but I had some dipshit walk up to me in Crossroads, open trade and put some white mail shoulders in, and goes "offer?" in /say
---
I close trade and walk away, he follows me and does it again. "offer??"
---
Seemed surprised when I told him to piss off. I was already wearing shoulders...

What even, I'm not the bird! This is literally what's happening in-game I'm not even picking a side here. No sense of humor, and I spent an hour on this.

You download the addon and then save it in Wow&gt;classic&gt;interface&gt;addons

I thought you didn't get exp in raids. Are they exploiting?

Well, I used to play horde. If I was to come back now, I'd play alliance. Only way to replicate that since I never played an ally character.

I played through ARR with the view of "the story is something else I have to grind".  Once I got to the ending points of ARR, I was really all about the story (and it only got better, but you've heard that before).  
---
But like, man, there were parts of that ARR thing that were absolutely a slog.
---
Fuck I was ready to die on my hill until I realized what you were playing at. Well played
---
Actually I didn't in the post. It's because he purchased the time, BUT the transaction is still stuck in pending due to Wows severs being slow atm.

A good 2h staff with rockbiter and earthbind kiting is faster leveling. But if you have a good shield and 1h flame tongue is decent until windfury. Overall though there's probably not much difference
---
"i slog through life"
---
It didn't help anything that legendaries from Legion were still active until level 113 iirc. Up until then you curbstomped everything, but when the effect was disabled it was sort of a rude awakening.
---
Awesome server, by the way! Lots of cool people on there. Highly recommend.

Could be the increased server capacity. I dont know when it was going live.

My girlfriend started yesterday and tonight she was refusing to go to sleep until she finished all her quests in one area. It was funny listening to her as she was stealthing around caves looking for treasure and mining copper ores.
---
The game is absolutely fantastic. I'm lucky enough where work keeps me busy but as soon as my 8 hours are done I'm in Azeroth and forget about everything else

Oh! you want a tag of the mob I'm killing, sure body I'll invite. Oh! you drop group even tho we still need 9 more, no problem, maybe you're done. Oh! I see you kill one of the quest mob 20yrd from me, I ask for invite and you decline TWICE. 
---
frankly I love classic but the community have change a lot,  At least on Skeram and Pagle.
---
Completely agree
---
Ya, no. An hour or two of free time a day doesn't translate exactly to time available to make money.  Some people really are that poor. This post was probably bait but people do exist in that situation. "Try harder" does not always fix poverty.

I was in high school when vanilla was out and knew there was no way I could convince my parents to pay a subscription for a video game. Now that in older and can buy whatever I want, I'm having so much fun. There's so little I understand about MMOs in general. Like I never fully grasped the concept of raiding and how it lasts hours with a bunch of people. Still don't but now I have a chance to once in get there
---
Which saves exactly nothing?
---
This was the only moment I remember people actively saying the game was too hard. 
---
Early Cata was really challenging but I never thought it was too time consuming. Yeah ok I couldn't run 5 - 6 heroics a night but it wasn't a big deal. The race to 85 was quick with the new and improved questing and the end game looked promising. When they added the nerfs to dungeons and once LFR came around I lost interest and ended up RPing a lot. 
---
I'm sure people loved MOP but I saw it as them turning the game into a joke so I quit for good.
---
Yup. Just was thinking about whether or not I‚Äôd have time tomorrow to log in. Lawn needs to be mowed, new employee no call no showed today so I‚Äôll be filling in for a 12 hr shift, and I promised the fianc√©e we‚Äôd run in the morning so I can‚Äôt play tonight.
---
Maybe next week. :(
---
Interesting, must be bugged, you can't play classic with a trial account, and you do not need to buy the base game to play to the end, you just need game time which you say he has, I'd contact support.
---
this is not warcrafts best friend race!

Haha amazing.

Mage is one of the funnest classes to play, there will always be a lot of them. It is a class where you really have to strive to be the best so you can separate yourself from the pack. A mage that does meh damage in raids or who doesn't know how to control the field in PvP is a dime a dozen. Top the charts like you can easily do and understand how to manipulate your CCs while blowing up the flag carrier and you become highly desirable.
---
Thanks be been waiting for 2 fucking hours in queue (Sulfuras) meanwhile everyone in the discord are getting in 20 minutes or less. How the fuck is this possible? I‚Äôm not moving down in queue AT ALL.

If youre on grobb i have to go to TB anyway, we can cruise and ill help you re-quest to 12.
---
Appreciate the advice a lot thanks all,
---
Wow lol. Some people have children, mortgages, child support, bills, medical bills, student loan payments, like really the amount of things someone might have to pay is infinite. Some people REALLY DONT have $15 extra for entertainment. It's not a case of not caring or wanting, but being stretched to the limit to pay for actual needs. Living paycheck to paycheck is a real life thing - literally almost every dollar is needed to pay for bills or recurring costs.
---
Yeah. 
---
That moment when Cata heroics got nerfed was a hell of a thing.
---
12 isn‚Äôt too low for Silverpine. Should double check your info.
---
I want to buff people, but I play a warlock so I can't yet.
---
My warlock is also an *alchemist* though, so every so often I'll see someone low on HP being attacked and I'll save them, open a trade, put in a minor defense potion for armor and a few healing potions, and then I'll leave without saying a word.
---
I *can't* say a word, because I'm an undead with no lower jaw, on an RP realm.  Makes talking hard. 
---
In my mind, from their perspective, this is what goes down:
---
* Be me, dying (again) to two dark doggos who are trying to play fetch with my exposed legbones
---
* See a fellow undead run up with the world's largest, angriest blueberry.  I can't decide which of them is uglier
---
* Watch as one dog dies and the other runs off
---
* Watch as uggo laughs and lights the other dog on fire.  He's trying to say something, but I can't make it out because of the drooling and his flailing tongue.  "Ot awg?"  Fuck if I know...
---
* See the trade window open up with three potions in it
---
* Take them and watch as he runs off into the distance, stoops down to pick a flower, and then lights a bat on fire
---
* Hear laughter all the way over here
---
* Oh shit, the dogs are back!
---
Hey:) I have the same monitor!

OP has more silver than I do in classic.
---
I‚Äôve been doing this since vanilla but you don‚Äôt have to climb up to the higher part you can jump walk off the edge and land on the same spot, just make sure ur not gonna land too far forward
---
Any kiting is gonna be harder on a Tauren with their extra 3yds or so of hitbox.

That said, it feels like to me that mobs are a little sticker than they used to be, but that could just be me misremembering.

Layering isn‚Äôt permanent.

I guess I'll tuff it out for the end game
---
Its the least effecient, but it's not crazy difficult - the hardest times will be where you are using an item from 5+ levels ago as you can't find anything better, they're super weapon dependant compared to other classes.
---
I think a few points in shield specialization helps with rage generation.
---
I just randomly discovered you can do this 10 minutes ago! This is awesome and I condone this behavior!
---
Yes, my wife and I play. When we were dating, she was in college long distance and we played wow as our way to hang out.  Her parents hated me for it because they thought she was missing out on her college experience.  16 years, 2 kids, 2 dogs and 2 cats later, we're playing classic and it reminds us of when we were dating all over again :)

&gt; apperantly this is needed...... /s

The 'forced update' thing that linux users always spout cracks me up man. If they can't figure out how to disable updates in windows then I don't even understand how they make their way around linux lol.
---
In saying that, I've never had win10 update when I don't want it to since it launched anyway. Probably because I restart my computer from time to time, and some people like to just perma leave their computer on for some strange reason. Jus get an SSD if you don't like waiting to boot boys; they're cheap now.

Thats what ive done. Havnt seen a que since day 2.  Low pop server is still packed.
---
Absolutely. What you‚Äôre looking for might not be optimal in terms of contributing gameplay, but it‚Äôs more than enough to be an important team player and, more importantly, have fun.
---
&gt;those people invited you to do quests together, did nothing wrong.
---
I never said they did and I'm not punishing anyone. I appreciate you taking the time to explain how mob tagging works, but I've been playing MMOs for 14 years, I'm familiar.  
---
I'm not obligated to accept every invite that comes my way and am perfectly content to quest on my own. If they can't be bothered to type two words, then I'm not the questing buddy for them. 
---
Yeah, I was being hyperbolic with the insta-block comment. But ultimately, the result is the same. I'll cancel their invite and just keep going about my business. Spammers get the block.
---
There was a poll in here a week ago, most of the pvp servers are split 55/45 favoring the horde.
---
I would not drink those potions. 
---
Maybe a good prep drink for a colonoscopy.
---
Yeah, caves are actually hell.  When you enter a cave, you leave Azeroth and are actually teleported into hell itself.
---
He is!
---
yeah, if you have pvp toggled on, your name turns green lol
---
They've done the Citrus Cherry (the orange red one) since the Halo 3 release, usually once a year or so, but now it's a permanent flavor regionally (which is bullcrap).  I personally think the flavor is amazing and could have replaced ones like Whiteout or Livewire or Pitch Black.  Or hell, it didnt even really have to replace anything, just add it as a permanent flavor nationwide so I dont have to only be able to buy it when I go to a northern state
---
The queues will go down soon. Whitmane is a really healthy server with a lot of Blizzard F&amp;F players. I would recommend staying if you were lucky enough to get a spot before it filled up...
---
But I posted this in my guilds discord 24 hours ago so you stole it from me who stole it from you who stole it from me.

WoW... WoW never changes.

I‚Äôve spent all day @ work trying to figure out how I could play or bypass the administration password to install, you sir are a fucking life saver.
---
Just wait until you get to SFK, WC, BFD, I've only done those three so far but the challenge makes me so excited for late game content.
---
Priest will get groups pretty easy, but since there are 3 healing classes and only 1 tanking class it is definitely easier to find groups as a warrior. Druids are okay at tanking for 5 mans if you know what you're doing, but with such fewer tools to manage threat or incoming damage, you are kind of at the mercy of your group to know what they are doing. Warriors can just focus on tanking and not worry too much about losing threat as long as they are on the ball.

A guide I read said Rene to level 3, then stop
---
Overpower only the first.
---
5 mins. 30 in game afk timer.
---
Im playing a mage, and leveling with both quests and dungeons. I see specs either focus on ST or AoE, but what would be a good leveling spec for best of both worlds with the potential for AoE grinding once im at 60?
---
Swing Bar Timer is the best, you attack then weave a spell or two in, attack then repeat, sometimes you can fit 3or4 even.
---
It‚Äôs not like pandaren didn‚Äôt already exist either....
---
ShadowedUF.
---
Absolutely, but reshade is unfortunately outside the scope of this PSA, and not as simple as flicking a switch in an overlay
---
Why does it matter to them that you're not using add-ons? Ask them to mind their business and you're playing how you want to play which shouldn't affect them at all
---
Meanwhile on horde there are fires burning and people screaming
---
But the XP is, also when we hit cap layers will still exist and it will make for some super easy farming which will in turn favour aoe farmers
---
Toss meh.
---
.
---
I cannot jump tha distance, you'll have ta toss meh.

Don't tell the elf.

Is it even working on anything none humanoid? I did it on private servers but have had no luck on classic. Everything moves just a little too fast.
---
Hnng I'm level 10 and using a 5dps sword. I'd be so happy if I got a green drop like that!
---
It's pretty incredible that somebody could read the whole post and not get this.
---
Your time will come
---
Oh I'm sorry, I thought that this was a game you played for fun and not a job.

This. This is the classic experience.

WOTLK introduced the [Chopper](https://www.wowhead.com/item=44413/mekgineers-chopper)/Hog motorcycle mount and it was a 2 seater. WOTLK was the expansion that added 2/3 seater mounts with the Mammoth from that wpvp zone in Northrend. I farmed the crap out of the mats to get that chopper mount and it was great for WOTLK. The newer one was introduced in a later expansion though

BiS is such a weird term to use before max level. Surely you‚Äôll replace it...
---
I am SO confused what you are trying to accomplish with this.
---
Why would you want a button you press to press another button when you could just press the desired button in the first place?
---
I agree, fuck the poor!
---
It was so sad logging in after 8 or so years and seeing that "Shop" button with all the other ones, as if it was now a part of the game.  Felt like a glorified mobile game.
---
Hey, does anyone know how to reset allyroute? I'm a gnome warlock and it shows me the dwarf hunter path... Thanks!
---
I'm on that realm. I like it. Lots of grouping in undead starting zone!
---
I assume a game called Toontown was always designed to be carebear. Even more carebear than WoW.
---
Hi! If your friend's (retail) account was freshly created, then it'll take 24 hours before the Starter Edition limitations would be removed. If they've already had the account for awhile then this may be indicative of an issue with their payment. If there's still some concern, they can shoot us an inquiry via this page: https://battle.net/support/en/help/product/wow/166/167/channels 
---
You're also welcome to give me a shout back, but as I won't be around much longer tonight it might be faster to go the ticket route.
---
Its quite obvious this story is false or he doesn't actually play a hunter.
---
A) You say you finished him with a arcane shot after landing? After using disengage? You do realize all disengage does in vanilla is reduce your threat to a target and make you stop your auto attack?
---
B) You drop a "frost"(freezing, you get frost at 28) trap AND a immolation trap, You can only have one trap active at a time.
---
C)Rogue gets detect trap passive at level 24, if he was 25 he'd definitely have it and it would take a very special kind of person to miss a trap when you are not even in a hurry.
---
Was hunter in Vanilla, I call BS. Damn horde fake propaganda.
---
Correct. There aren‚Äôt any floating islands in alternate Draenor
---
If you're not lvl50 at this point the competition is over for you so you can relax.
---
Cmon man, thats one of the most frequently brought up, and most frequently argued over, topics in politics. Don't get me wrong, it's fine to bring it up and start discussions about it, but why do you gotta do it in an mmorpg subreddit though? Go to /r/politics or something, you'll find people who actually want to go into this discussion with you. The great thing about WoW is that it's its own world without problems that actually matter in the grand scheme of things and you can play and forget about the problems that do actually matter for a little bit. You a hard-core red hat wearing trump supporter? Don't know, don't care. To me you're a level 25 night elf hunter trying to gank me. 
---
The common topic in this subreddit is that we all want to play or discuss classic WoW. So let's do that and pretend to hate each other because you chose red/blue team in game and let's not *actually* hate each other because you chose red/blue team irl. There is a place for that topic, but it's not here; you get what I'm saying?
---
Onebag3
---
At the expense of a bag slot. Not exactly a thrilling thought lol.
---
Update: So yeah its still quite blurry. It's very bad when graphics are at max and but its also noticeable (albeit less) when they are very lower because there is less ground clutter. So I'm not entirely sure, I don't have the problem in retail so it has to be something unique with classic.
---
Just thought some would find this interesting. Data captured at about 7:30MST on 8/29/2019.
---
just got to 13! :]
---
I believe it's called a kassi
---
&gt; Quite daunting for new players as there's no maps or any sort of direction at all.
---
Extremely untrue in 2019.
---
Gotta respect some people's hustle man. I tuned into his stream for a few minutes, and I would tear my eyes out after a couple of hours doing what he's doing. Looks almost as bad as runecrafting in OSRS. That may be a slight exaggeration because nothing's as bad as that, but it still looks pretty bad.
---
I killed a lot of extra mobs while doing the 10-13 quests. Once I unlocked the elite quests and higher teens I went and caught up in the Barrens before coming back and finishing up.
---
Well Read
---
Well no /s actully.. i am worried that i clog up people inventory when i try to give then 4 stack of mage stuff (2 food 2 water) 
---
But noone has cancelled so far and everyone has said thanks
---
It's to be expected. People around here act like vanilla was all sunshine and rainbows in regards to community, but the things you experienced in the Barrens is exactly the same kind of things that happened back then too when everyone and their brother was competing for kills/spawns. There were shitty people then just like there's shitty people now even though it's much less pronounced than retail. 
---
Though I will say that I think if we give it enough time, once people are more spread out, and the opposite faction become the ones we are competing against, that it will get much better. Everyone being all clumped together in the same zones (never saw this many people in parts of the Barrens in vanilla unless there was a pvp battle going on at xroads) is just going to exacerbate shitty behavior.
---
Pvp makes the class for me...something about seeing the other person just give up when I have wingclip and concussive shots hitting him constantly gives me a warm feeling in my heart
---
Don't tell the Elf.
---
We must be on the same server lol
---
Poor hunters.
---
I'm going camping for 3 days. No internet and weak cell service. Just enough to check reddit. 
---
Going to read a new scifi novel I picked up and drink beer by the lake. 
---
Going to forget the queues for a while and enjoy myself.
---
Yep, I got kicked from a Cata dungeon at the start of the expansion because I kept running out of mana trying to keep people up. It was the only time I can remember being kicked out of a dungeon as a healer to be hoenst. People were so used to Wrath dungeons that they just ignored all the mechanics and took so much damage, it was crazy.
---
Rfc always hit me as a little stale, I was alli in vanilla and went horde this time. 
---
I recently did it and enjoyed it but don‚Äôt think t had the initial wonder that Deadmines has. 
---
The Goonie-esque adventure style to it. 
---
That was when I fell in love with the game, refilled paladin this morning after getting a troll priest to 16. I had to go back to the nostalgia of alliance again. But... for the horde.
---
Thats mad.
---
Exactly. Then barrens until 20ish, stonetalon then Zoram strand
---
On quest mobs? Meh
---
Hey me too. Had to sell some cloth just to afford the training. But range pull is worth it!
---
Ww  thanks for sharing

I was on whitemane , but I'm on mot going to sit on 3+ hours just to play for an hour. Currently no queue on rattlegore or smolderweb, and they are just as busy in game.

---
Thank god. Upvoted
---
Yes! Vanilla SFK was one of my favourite dungeons ever! It's been far too long since I've run it
---
Priest or Mage for solo leveling and maybe helping people out at later levels?
---
there should be no line to draw. 
---
i understand you want to play this game, the same as everyone else. But if you have real world obligations, and you are AFK'ing while looking after said obligations; you are still part of the problem.   
---
If you cant play the game at that moment, let someone else. Its that simple. You are still scum if you are 'reserving' your spot beyond the auto-AFK kicker. "but its just for a couple minutes" right? ... now x that by 1000 as other players do the same.. and the only opportunity for players to get into the server is gone.
---
I was able to stay in barrens from 10-21

They do indeed

The looks so fucking good rn
---
Ha, well IMO it was going that way as early as WoTLK with constant dailies, and many casual options to be geared and do all the content. I don't want to gatekeep people, but working hard for it was what made it rewarding IMO :P.
---
Is this taken out of context?
---
The running gag in Brill on my server was that the zeppelins don't exist in phase 1. I also fell off the zeppelin on my first ride. :X oh how I missed this game.

Rolled on Rattlegore and it seems like the sweet spot.  High pop at prime time but no queue.

I do :) np mate, was you the orc rogue?

Underrated comment.
---

---
The hero we didn‚Äôt even consider...
---
I remember playing TBC in late elementary school. No worries in the world.
---
I thought to myself one day, when accidentally starting a small fire via lamp, that I was truly terrified of my house burning down because I wouldn't be able to play WoW anymore. 
---
That is when I realized that I was already lost.
---
Winters chill and frostbolt. That's all you need
---
Hope he always has giant growth flask on
---
Inner Maraudon?
---
This is what makes WoW the community that has long since been lost on retail
---
If they gave you food and water and bags of goodies yeah
---
It can be more interesting to start with. A lot of interesting places to go to and you'll be getting new abilities. 
---
I don't pvm in osrs that much, I prefer to skill. The grind to level 60 in classic is similar to getting base 70's in osrs I'd think. 
---
You have professions in wow too and you can grind for rate drops and materials off mobs. It's not like osrs though, the scope of professions is smaller than the scope of osrs skills. They are still great though. 
---
If you enjoyed working the ge on osrs then you'll enjoy working the ah in classic. It's different so you'll have to learn more again, but it feels the same.
---
You may get a quest for the area thats too high but when you get to the areas town or hub, there might be quests for your level
---
I come from 33 years into the future. Garrosh is actually your dad.
---
Bro i think you need to chill
---
Don't know the drop rate, but I have a good one too, I got a Dwarven Hand Cannon epic gun drop off a dwarf guard in Alterac Valley, didnt know they ever dropped anything decent.
---
hahaha, this reminded me of a guild i was in during TBC - Come honor face. Great times, lots of puns
---
Frost in raiding uses two specs, winters chill and deep arcane. Bosses can't be frozen so shatter is not taken. One mage will go winter's chill to buff the others and the rest take deep arcane for the damage buff and mana recovery talents.
---
I‚Äôve seen more than one person alliance side that had some class quest that involved being under water for long periods and they were very thankful to the warlocks handing out unending breath.

Portland metro?
---
They started going that price during the end of vanilla
---
As a hunter, I buff the people I pass by killing the mobs they are fighting. It's the best I can do.
---
I think setting my pet on your target is sort of like a buff.
---
Wow, that must have been a great surprise in a battleground. They must be pooled into the loot data just like normal mobs.
---
You'd be stupid not to do it at that price. Like I would have given the guy 1s.
---
Retail night I was on the quest to kill Zalazane (or whatever that troll's name is) and he has a 4min spawn time so of course there were roughly 200,000 people waiting around to kill him.  So I am doing other quests with the timer going then running back every 3 minutes or so to try to get the tag.  I had invited a few other people to try to get the tag too, and everybody else was grouping up as well.
---
Well, it turned out a new player had started one of the groups and did not know creating a raid made it so you couldn't complete quests.  Apparently he had nearly 30 people on his raid that didn't know this either, and they had been trying to kill Zalazane for over 25 minutes.  The only thing that tipped them off was they managed to tag Zalazane and he didn't drop the head needed for the quest.
---
Thanks for making me look crazy!  I just laughed uncontrollably! And my friends think I‚Äôm insane!
---
He didn‚Äôt cheat, there are no explicit rules against using magic in a Mok Gora.

Besides, Thrall was throwing lightning bolts at Garrosh in their first Mok Gora.

Not OP, but Final Fantasy XI was essentially group-only.

Yeah, those teleport bug while you are sleeping are aweful...right ?
---
Mage for sure. You‚Äôll have AoE spells that‚Äôll help a lot. Helping in later levels, priest will be best for heals obviously, albeit not a strong healer. Mages can be a top class for dungeons though in terms of AoE and damage output.
---
Which pet is that?
---
ill put the EU link
---
That shit needs to die already
---
Yours joking but I died killing snapjaws in the oasis... I simply forgot about the mechanic and was literature in too deep to get out in time.
---
Cue song by Queen
---
they apologized for it
---
Either one solo, priest will be more welcomed as casual healer help at later levels. You can walk into just about any group

Someone please tell me if it is okay to roll sub spec for Rogue to play and lvl since I am so used to Stealth travel. Or it only for PvP?
---
You'll need SuperMacro for something like this. Macros can't really call other macros with the default editor.
---
They do say, "what doesn't kill you only makes your ass stronger."
---
Same here man.  I was playing a low warrior running around pulling with my gun and people were like..."warrior with a gun?  Da fuck?"
---
As I've started dungeons with my priest I see a big difference in how people treat dungeons.  They don't understand the concept of cc.  Or how to pull single mobs.  Or kill order.  Or how to avoid cleaves.  They don't think to disarm the boss or demo shout him.  It's not that they don't know it's rather they're surprised these are core concepts in classic and you just can't zerg rush things.
---
Oh my god can you imagine tons of people gathered in orgrimmar watching two people create bags for as many people as they can for an hour. It would be legendary.
---
For reference. I've gotten bear gall bladders that sell for 6s at lvl 25. 6s is cheap for a 1 time purchase.
---
Just for PvP zones
---
Yes dude! I'm on Grobb as well. Luma, Dwarf Paladin. I've been pleased so many people have supported CC, haha. Rock on!
---
Ah, I see, so I would need one of those pets on the list to teach it dash, which I learn from the pet trainer. I don't get the skill from those specific pets to teach to other pets of the same type. Gotcha, thanks :D

Make sure to select WoW Classic from the game version drop-down menu.
---
Something to keep in mind, this is still phase 1. Even if some servers are lesser populated it will still be more than sufficient, especially if they remove all layers.
---
Lol. There were rolling restarts both today and yesterday that included patches being pushed out which increased server capacities. Twice now. 
---
Blizzard is doing their job. They know more than you. Try using a remote app from your phone, play at non-peak times, wait in line with the thousands of others in your position who all want to do the same thing you do, play the game.
---
Take my money
---
Enjoy it while it lasts.  It will be ruined if they go to TBC.
---
I don't know who you are. I don't know what server you play. If you are looking for ransom I can tell you I don't even have silvers, but what I do have are a very particular set of skills (skin &amp; LW). Skills I have acquired in Ironforge ten levels ago. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my vanilla experience go now that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you, but if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you and I will trade you free leatherworking gear.
---
The only people that laugh at Warriors using a staff are people that don't know the true power of staves.
---
I say spell but I mean any ability, for casters it doesn't matter, I often mix the terms my self. If you use an ability like rogues "Sinister Strike" it will wait until after the ability is done, then auto attack, which causes lower dps. So for example if on a boss fight you performed your rotation perfectly, you could get 500 auto attacks in, but say you messed up a few times and only got 450, that would equal a certain amout of damage loss.
---
It seems small but auto attacks over the course of a fight do a lot of damage.
---
There's a list of helpful add-ons on WoWhead that are compatible with classic.  I myself just installed a few through the Twitch app on my PC.  Questie being one of them that definitely helps out with questing and such.  A good site to start with is  [https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/) .  Hope this helps.
---
I'm in the same boat. Level 17 with all of my professions at a good level and some gold to boot. On Fairbanks too with other friends. Tried logging in to the server today around 7pm for the first time and the queue was at about 7000. I just don't have the time for it. I can't afford 2 hours of waiting as an adult. What do I do now? Pray that eventually it drops in people? I'm definitely not making a new character after logging around 24 hours of game time on this one. My friends and I have decided that if they open up server transfers we would go. Just no fun if no one can play together.
---
wisdom pet might hunter for maximum trolling
---
Cool. Thanks!
---
I dont have a q tho
---
Needs more jpeg
---
This shit is wholesome af
---
That's why they need to do transfers now and not when people all start hitting 60.
---
You the real MVP
---
It's only cowardly when the other faction does it to you right?
---
It was a good story though, I'm not on a pvp server, but maybe I'll roll an alt there one day.
---
In general very low.  I think I saw one in like 80 days /played in "the old world" from late vanilla to tbc.
---
OOF
---
I had a warrior telling me not to come out of stealth when sapping in RFC. Not realising you need to spec into it to stop that happening.
---
Stonetalon at lvl 15 will be rough.  I went there with a friend at 17 but some of the spiders are lvl 22 and the shredders can be lvl 23 or higher.  It's doable at 16-17 and it makes the zone feel very dangerous but you have to keep an eye out for everything.
---
taking off tomorrow for wow gonna be a long weekend because i am not logging off again and having to wait every time. Playing from tonight until i pass out at my keyboard and then hopefully wake up with enough time to allow me to not have to wait. I am taking it that seriously but only for this weekend then back to adulting.
---
Yeah, because of how higher end dungeons/raids work it's not like rushing to 60 is going to get you anything other than the ability to screw with slower levelers of the opposite faction on PvP servers.
---
Another madisfied customer.
---
Mouseover sunder is something you should definitely macro up, being able to start slapping them onto secondary targets is amazing. Revenge is God, sunder is your bread and butter, shield bash is decent snap threat. Heroic strike or cleave only if you've got rage to spare.
---
From there, it's just practice and telling your party to wait until things are *actually* being tanked
---
At this point we're straying pretty far away from the topic, but I'll just say that my point wasn't that the data sent is your personal data and that is what you should be worried about. My point is that it's sending data and *you can't stop it*. You are not in control of Windows 10, Microsoft is.

Eh, piracy is a crime in the U.S. maybe. Whereas theft may be nearly universally considered a crime, things like piracy, homosexuality, or smoking pot aren‚Äôt nearly universally considered a crime. That‚Äôs because they are in fact victimless crimes.
---
When a car is stolen, someone has lost a car unjustly.
---
When a car is pirated, a car is created and no cars are lost. 
---
You‚Äôre making a false equivalence here and trying to inappropriately equate control over private replicable information vs. control over irreplaceable personal property
---
I wish, but I would need an ally character which I can't create.
---
What time are you logging in. That is very important to queue. Most NA servers are getting queues around 3pm local time it seems.

I haven't played since LK, but the "Alts and Rejects" late night raids were the best shit after the new shimmer of progression raiding wore off. Brought the fun back to actually laugh at wipes and intentionally kill people for the comedy of it. Ah, pulling the next mob group when someone afk's to smoke or eat. The classics never get old.
---
But if grind to 60, I can help them even more.
---
Potentially, but only if the ratio is 50/50.
---
My one hope is that nzoth 'opens our eyes' to the fact that everything up to this point has been a dream or forced reality (matrix style) and the void/light has actually controlled all of azeroth for some time. 
---
Nzoth was able to link into this, shows us the truth and BAM, we pop out in a messed up azeroth at lvl1, everything reset and off we go again. Option is there to go back into the dream to play old content still but nothing you do would carry to the 'real world'
---
Gold, mounts, achievements...it all resets without resorting to wow 2
---
I'm on Kiranaxx and it's pretty normal, it just adds an extra element of danger in the world nobody takes it that seriously
---
Amazing
---
Holy shit I didn't know I needed this so much in my life!
---
They can wield guns in retail too.
---
Out of curiosity, what's the reason for the /f if you already ask the race? Lol. Can't be a Human, Mage, Horde. Haha.
---
(Please start a new continuity).
---
Please take the 5 seconds to crop next time. Big QoL bump for everyone else.
---
Playing a Druid and I‚Äôve had a warrior in every single instance fun I‚Äôve done ask if I‚Äôll tank.  I actually prefer to tank, so it‚Äôs fine with me... just find it funny.
---
KEEP YER FEET ON THA GRROUND
---
What should I off-hand on my troll hunter now that I can dual wield?
---
You can get xp in raid, you just get significantly less per kill.
---
Ur fuckin with me 
---
This really shows how little I play warrior lmao
---
it also happens every expansion so most people know that this sort of thing will be a problem with the launch of a "new" game.  Especially something like classic, which is wildly popular and has been highly anticipated. 
---
I am happy i have to wait because that means people are playing, if we are lucky 50 to 66 percent will stick around and servers will remain healthy.
---
General play, 31/5/15 (mortal strike + defiance, 1/5 imp shield block for raids), PvP 31/20/0 (mortal strike/enrage)
---
I see, thanks for the reply/
---
We already went over this. It's not the same thing at all. Dungeons have nothing to do with time
---
Is a PoM Pyro/Elemental Mage hybrid possible? I wanna do PoM Pyro but instead of arcane power get Blast wave, I lose out on cold snap but plans is just a super bursty caster for both single target and aoe
---
Where is this goddam mankrik‚Äôs WIFE?
---
Yeah as a Warlock in the starting area of Elwyn (aka the laggy hell that was the first hour) I quickly learned to just rely on my dagger to claim mobs before others could.
---
that is %100 true, though professions are introduced after lvl 10 or so, hopefully the character had some pouches till then.
---
those skinning knifes, fishing rods totaly takes a huge place : / well immersion comes with hardship, i guess we don't want to press a button and go to a dungeon. who knew.
---
Lmao at all the people patting themselves on the back. It's still the same old grind. The only thing special this game had back in the day was the social aspect; now my friends who started with me are obsessed with hitting 60. And for what? To replay old content? Questing solo is boring AND hard. The old good times can never be recaptured.
---
Waaaaaaaaaa waaaaaaaaaaaa waaaaaa stfu
---
Uh. Fury dps spec is just fine. You don‚Äôt need to spec protection until 60 if you‚Äôre gonna tank raids.
---
Leveling protection is just masochistic.
---
Generally speaking no. Gear from dungeons/certain quests is more than enough for lvling. There are some exceptions to that rule (ex battleground twinking*) but generally speaking you shouldn't waste your money on AH (Auction House) or on other gear vendors. As i said b4 save as much as you can:). You will need every single penny you managed to save for purchasing mount(s) along with riding skill.
---
*Once battlegrounds are out you will notice a tendency where some alt characters would wear some very rare/expensive gear on low lvls (generally 19, 29, 39 and 49). The reason for that is some ppl would purposefully "overgear" their low lvl characters to make them ridiculously powerfull on bg on *9 lvl brackets.
---
When people just jump around while in the instance and pull 2 groups and your healer is level 12
---
On my priest in retail most of the time I don't even buff myself with fort when questing
---
In a cleave group, helps informing my party if I got a spirit tap or not and move things along faster
---
Vendor everything if you actually want a mount at 40, level enchanting after that.
---
This is what we need in our lives.
---
Lol, I remember seeing clips of stuff like this ages ago.
---
Na, in two weeks nobody will be playing except people who're scared to cut losses.
---
So, you are like 99% of others in the Barrens chat. Grats on being completely the same as the next guy.
---
but... the space goats don't appear until Burning Crusade...
---
Well it worked then
---
Still saying GG to the massive que boss.
---
Isnt there a dude who's 53 on Firemaw? This video is fake news.
---
Enchanting is a costly profession. I have been disenchanting everything but I have also resorted to selling wands to vendors for silver to train.
---
Did you take pictures of me?
---
There was a 45 minute shitfight last night on Yojimbo trying to kill the named Troll in the orc starting area
---
Standard arms leveling build is fine, tactical mastery plus anger management should be enough for charging in and stancedancing into defensive. No real need to spec into prot just yet.
---
Drop skinning, don't feel like you can't trash stuff, loot less.
---
I'm a rogue. No buffs here, but I'll pick ya lockboxes. üòä
---
Really really dumb idea.
---
Mages do suffer from doing one thing at a time more than warlocks, but, warlocks one thing is basically the same in dungeons, pvp, raids, and solo. At least mages play pretty different in those different arenas and I think it breaks up the monotony.
---
Definitely! Husband and I are playing together. 
---
We joined retail a couple of months ago to get back into the swing of things and max leveled there together! 
---
We did make alts so we wouldn't get ahead of each other on our main characters if one wanted to play while the other didn't. 
---
You can even start in different zones depending on what race you choose, one may just have to make a long run to the other!
---
Incoming unnecessary "Omg idiot doesn't even know how to screenshot" comments
---
A human warlock was farming lower levels in ratchet earlier on zandalar too.
---
I'm on Kaharaxx? I have extra silver if we on the same server.
---
Tell them to bug off.
---
Of that's what they prefer then tell them to go play retail and keep on trucking my friend. Classic is about the road to 60, not the destination of 60.
---
Shift+m brings it up in any zone. #nochangehere

trying to click two spells at once because macros dont allow it like private servers do

1. [Like this?](https://imgur.com/RqqeJKw)  Questie does just that

2. atlasloot?

3. VendorPrice does that.
---
Good luck!
---
Ain't no such things as.. . Oh the irony of your username when paired with your demeanor
---
Yes. I confirm this. It keep sending me from crossroad to silvers spine to do 2-3 quest and then back to crossroad to do 1 - 2 quest, then thunder bluff for 1 quest, then xr, then silver spine again... Wtf
---
Get to 13 if you can and have a blast, man! Warn your group about heavy aoe damage on the big sword boi (aggaman or something?) and get a mage to polymorph pull and you‚Äôll be good.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know what you mean, feel free to link a clip or something.
---
I checked out his stream today and didn‚Äôt hear him yell once. He‚Äôs not even triggered that easily. Chat will say something he disagrees with and he‚Äôll just be like ‚Äúoh you guys don‚Äôt think so? Alright we‚Äôll see man‚Äù. I‚Äôm sure he gets triggered but he doesn‚Äôt seem like a rager or something.
---
Like watching his stream today it practically seemed like a q and a. People ask what he thinks about x, he says what he thinks. When he does get aggressive it isn‚Äôt even yelling he‚Äôll just say ‚Äúno, you‚Äôre wrong. Like *insert explanation here‚Äù
---
damn, you just got really unlucky with your groups. You'll find some decent groups soon enough. 
---
Just did my first deadmines last night and it was some of the most fun I had since release mythic+10 dungeons. 
---
We somehow managed to aggro VC and Greenskin. In the end only me (heals) and a dps were left standing.
---
Carebears gonna care...
---
Them: THERE IS AN OPIOID CRISIS!!!
---
Blizz: Hold my beer.
---
The macro is nice for abilities with dropdowns or resource requirements (Assuming that formatting still works).  If the ability in question can't trigger yet, at least you start auto-attacking.  Saves a button too... I don't remember ever using up a toolbar slot for "attack", even back at release.
---
No. People are either not motivated enough to take full advantage of secondary tradeskills, or there's something they don't yet get about playing a warrior. First Aid, Cooking (w/ Fishing), sharpening stones, keeping on top of decent 2h weapons, and constant spacial awareness are key. They're a class that has to constantly reach out and borrow from other aspects of the game, but when utilized, they're a blast.
---
Cool so people who afk to get a drink or take a piss should be logging out then?
---
I like tanking too bad my work schedule prevents me to MT raids so I will dps. But I will tank all the dungeons. :)
---
It does dilute xp a lot but if you kill enough at a fast enough rate, the rate is still higher overall
---
I know right.
---
.. just last night I was doing a quest south if ratchet and some random dude asks for help.  I'm like uh, fine I gotcha man.  And we cleared the quest, but then I was using joanas guide and I'm a good path so I took this guy with me for 8 more steps on the guide  and we killed some levels....
---
Uh classic got me being all nice and stuff.
---
Lol I always feel bad seeing the health bar get lower and wonder if they think they're taking extra damage. I always throw a renew on after lol.
---
I'm not throwing away my hard earned work. Screw that. The biggest reason why I stopped playing private server after 10 levels. Literally only did 10 levels and was like shit, this server could get shut down by blizzard. AND sure enough it did.
---
They've offered unlimited free transfers from full servers to low pop servers ever since vanilla. Shouldn't cap it at one per account. You were able to move all of your toons and friends if you wanted to for free.
---
I mean I had a halo can somewhere, too, so not that weird I guess haha.
---
People think those don't have any stats on them, but the +10 ninja is actually hidden.
---
Idk, but go search wowhead for leather helms from level 40-60 and you tell me there‚Äôs not one upgrade in there.
---
Hand of Edward the Odd might make that feasible

New timeline time!

this is hilarious.

Today, while questing in Silverpine, a player /waved me after I accidentally helped him kill a mob he tagged.

*It* fucking *waved* me.

As soon as I calmed down, I reported him.

no  worries, I got the addons from this [wowhead article](https://www.wowhead.com/news=294702/best-addons-for-wow-classic)  and this is the [specific link to details](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25068-DetailsDamageMeterClassic.html), it works well for me
---
Had a hunter last night that need rolled cloth shoulders at the end of WC (from the murloc) against 3 casters including myself and won.. he can't even use them for 4 more levels, I was the only one that could use them right away since they required level 22. He said he only rolled because he didn't win any of the rolls for the chests throughout WC.
---
That CPU and "integrated" GPU are pretty basic, but like others are saying the game is from 2005-2006 era so it's not very demanding.
---
No. No it ‚Äòs not.
---
Good luck getting Smite's Hammer on a hordey! Lol
---
They shouldn't. If they do, fuck 'em. I had to convince someone not to kick a druid for needing in cloth in RFC yesterday. People be crazy.
---
Me: *invites warrior killing the same mobs as me for the kill quest*    
---
Warrior: *declines invite*    
---
Me: *buffs warrior with thorns and motw anyway, then start pulling with moonfire*    
---
Warrior: */spits on me because he can't tag any mobs for the quest he declined to group with me for*    
---
    
---
I'm genuinely surprised by how often this has happened
---
There is a reason classic ruined careers, marriages, and lives.
---
Blizzard never should have fucked with the formula.
---
Nope. I enjoy Pvp. I also enjoy doing casual RP.
---
You guys are the most gatekeeping community I‚Äôve seen in a long time. Why can‚Äôt I play on a RP server if I don‚Äôt plan on RPIng all day long instead of raiding? 
---
Give me a good reasion why your in the right to be toxic to others because they want to RP on the side but pve as a main focus?
---
Do you wish to learn about what plagues Silverpine Forest?
---
Do you dare attempt to help a few of the apocatharies there?
---
Have you heard any of the myths regarding Dalaran Mages and their magic?
---
It turns out that "you think you want this but you don't" actually was referring to retail all along.
---
Woah.
---
My point was just that I don't care that the game got more noob friendly, just that all the free goodies took away the enjoyment I got from working for it.

It was never vc that I remember you always asked about deadmines in westfall as you was building the quest chain to get all the dungeon quests.
---
Spawn rates are pretty fucked though. If I had a copper for every time a mob I just killed had an instant spawn on the same place I could buy my epic mount.
---
Lmao rekt
---
Yes they are good.  Afterwards go to barrens
---
Man i met a guy in Loch Modan yesterday whose named was straight up Letterkenny. Hardly any of my friend watch the show but somehow everyone in the general chat. The amount of references thrown around were incredible. Damn I love this game
---
So you prefer half assed servers that randomly crash or stay offline half the day? Or perhaps they could charge $20/month because they offer two games? I'm just glad the price has stayed about the same over 15 years. But let's find some more things to complain about shall we?
---
For 15 dollars I'd say that's worth classic alone. I get two massive worlds for only 15 a month?? I believe you should say "thank you Blizzard!"

To give your comparison context, you need to add that the steakhouse is being rude to the vegan for not wanting to eat steak and the vegan is therefore upset at the restraint due to the customer service rather than the menu.
---
&gt;Removing attunement
---
I'll defend this one. Attunements in Vanilla were mostly busywork, they were annoying but not generally that bad. 
---
But in TBC they were HORRIBLE, they were so bad they were literally guild-breaking. And because they were so bad, they encouraged guilds to poach members from any guild below them, rather than attuning a newcomer. 
---
It's the same issue we saw with 4H in Naxx. The top guild poached geared tanks from thr guild one below them. That guild poached from below them, and so on, with multiple guilds falling over from the drama in the meantime.
---
wonder if that is his 2nd account and he just autoruns while he levels on his real account, 5 head moves.

Ay its working so far and being able to play on my day off is great
---
Dude. I leveled past barrens before anyone got there. I‚Äôm lv 37 right now.
---
You can silverpine until 15ish and then go barrens or simply go barrens immediately. Barrens is more crowded though so it can be nice to have a buffer of lvls from Silverpine so you can skip some quests that are a pain in the ass to do.
---
OSRS is an incredible blueprint for how to correctly run a legacy game.  They would be absolutely retarded to not be fully in-tune, with pretty much everything Jagex has done in the past who-knows-how-long, probably 2+ years they've been considering/working on Classic.  OSRS is so monumentally successful that it has completely lapped the "main" game in interest and general engagement, for like quite a while now (and the disparity has only grown since then).  OSRS generally sits around 20th on twitch, give or take depending on how many of the big name streamers are on, or if there's a stupid view-botted phishing stream.  Pretty respectable for what amounts to a browser-based clicker game from the mid 2000s that's pretty damn boring to watch.  RS3, an updated and fairly modernized MMORPG, sits at like 70th-100th.
---
Well said! Let's forget the real world for a minute and relax in Azeroth. Pretend it's 2004 all over again.
---
Literally one of the best shitposts I've ever had the honor to read, hats off sir
---
If you're in the dungeon doing dps, roll on upgrades you need.
---
If you're healing, let MS people have dibs and then roll if nobody does.
---
I love ZF! I always loved getting the hammer and summoning Gaz'rilla
---
Beast training, page 1 of your spellbook. Icon looks like a slingshot.
---
You really thinking "shareholders" aren't going to be smart enough to realize that classic is bringing in this subscriptions?
---
Really? C'mon dude.
---
Besides, already proven people will pay 15 for this, why would they drop it? Not trying to defend them, but it's a legitimate question.
---

&gt;disengage, and then hit him with a killing arcane shot after landing.

Umm, disengage doesn't make you jump in classic, not sure what you confused this with since you specified the landing part

So much whoosh in the comments xD

&gt; What to learn? Me swing axe, me kill boar, me eat boar, me happy.
---
You are living the good life dude.

Yeah it is. Frog is on my guild.
---
I can‚Äôt decide between Paladin and Priest. Which one is more fun for solo leveling and which one is more welcome into groups, both PvE and PvP?
---
I‚Äôm playing a dwarf.
---
Go for a lower-pop server. If servers start to die, there will be transfers or mergers.
---
Yea? I mean persistence is key right? Wow has always been super grindy from what I remember, I just don‚Äôt remember this grindy! Haha I feel like it‚Äôs nice in doses but like 8-12+ hours a day will cause heavy burnout
---
There were independently-run classic servers run for free before blizzard took them down.
---
yes
---
when they send dungeon goers they're not sending their best, they send rogues, and some i assume are good people
---
Don't know why our posts are down voted when they're more accurate.
---
look for a slingshot icon in your spells book.  click and train
---
That‚Äôs good :) you picked the right faction imo lol
---
Thanks for the input! Very valuable.
---
Wow classic RTX mode, such beauty
---
What is better? Googling all the stuff or adventure yourself in this vast world?
---
Lol I gave away a 6 slot bat today on my way to the AH. And I buff everyone every chance I get. Free intellect for all
---
Ight cool :) thanks amigo!
---
If its not a good twink item, BOE blues aren't actually worth that much. I'd just sell this and see if you can squeeze 2g ish out of it
---
From my personal experience there is. I have been able to close the game for as long as half an hour and come back with no queue.
---
This is good.
---
Im doing a paladin and a rogue. The paladin is sloooooooow. You dont die, but slooooooooooooow.
---
TBC study found 1/3 female.
---
It's because the brain associates a memory with the context you where in when it happened. This is good because it makes it easier to remember relevant information. For example, the memory of falling off a cliff because of loose rocks is good to remember in places with loose rocks, not when you're walking on a field.
---
Since our modern homes have more distinct spaces than a natural environment we pass over an unusual amount of different spartial contexts which can often lead to the situation you mentioned.
---
This also has some other weird consequences, for example if you learn something while drunk you will remember it better if you get drunk again. There's also the quite depressing fact that if you're sad you will have a harder time remembering happy times.

I noticed all of this too, but I think the "niceness" is just temporary. I already notice it diminishing just a little every day. Kind of like the beginning of middle school. Everyone is friendly and nice to each other. Then once high school starts, everyone gets in their clicks (elite guilds) and doesn't talk to each other anymore. I hope I'm wrong though.
---
Deadass 98% of the community wanted classic for community. That‚Äôs non arguable so if you want the elitism just continue in retail because you seem to praise it so much. This is what vanilla was like. People don‚Äôt group in retail because you can just heirloom and pull 10 mobs at level 10 lol. We all just wanted a fresh start without any bullshit with a challenge. What people forget is without heirlooms and LFG it actually take a massive chunk of time to level 1-120. Considering people are already in the upper 40s and mid 50s it‚Äôs not as hard as it once seemed. Even a casual like me will have 40-60 by end of next month. Just relax and enjoy it or continue in ur elite guild.

I developed a Stockholm syndrom towards the queue - I've gotten it into my mind thay playinf the queue is as much part of the game as every other machanic

Did anyone actually finish those? I can't remember if I ever did lol. It would always fail lol.

Learn what your likely result is for DE - find average AH market value. If the items vendors for more than its value in mats, vendor item and buy AH mats.

You eat the cost in these situations. What was hilarious was a few people trying to scam by offering "free" bags with mats. "8 linen and 4 thread"

---
This.

Play what you want to 60. If at 60 you need to change, 1gold to respec your first time.  Stop planning endgame build until you've at least cleared UBRS/Scholo. Look up your pre-raid BiS and if you find one for a diff spec, toss it in the bank for later.

I‚Äôm fine that this is why my queue timer was an hour. I‚Äôll be doing my share chucking out them sweet sweet power words in kind.

---
I understood this reference
---
No numbers were officially announced. We've speculated on other reddit threads that it was about 30k. 
---
From my own observation it appears they increased cap by 10k since queue numbers one Stalagg dropped by approximately this much. That would put them at 40k. 
---
A previous poster also said that it was about 5k players per layer, with 6 layers originally. This now puts us at 8 layers on full servers.
---
Again, this is speculated, and nothing concrete was ever posted by Blizzard to release an exact cap amount.

Yeah, we all saw [the exact same image](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cwqwox/2019_barrens_chat_has_evolved/) when it was posted by someone else yesterday. Reposting is whatever, but why pretend you're the source? Even the title is basically the same. 
---
Come on.
---
The loss of not having tailoring is not massive for robe of void. Winter night robes are slightly worse but still great and are boe from tailoring so you can buy them. tailoring shines with bloodvine set bonus for lock. All that being said alchemy and herb is still a great combination for lock and can net you lots of gold and you can farm your own consumables. Its basically a trade off between doing a little bit more dps from ZG -AQ and being able to make gold/ farm consumables. Choose whatever of those two makes more sense for you.

I agree.  But will I be significantly weaker at 57 to the end of phase one (where robe of the void is BIS) if I can‚Äôt craft it with tailoring?  It‚Äôs BOP so I can‚Äôt have a tailor friend craft it.

Remember him.
---
I agree osrs is definitely healthy, but my point is that the community relations and group content is lacking because of the efficiencyscape mentality. Before Sarachnis, the last piece of widely available (so not ToB or CoX which caters to endgame) group content was Corp and GWD. In fact, the overall tone of OSRS differs widely from most MMOs because there is such a heavy focus on Solo Content despite it being branded as an MMO. Many people don‚Äôt want to interact with the community in that game because doing so is inefficient (besides ToB, almost all group content is outclassed by Solo content for sustainable gp/h). The state of the game is definitely healthy, but it‚Äôs been echoed multiple times that the game can definitely feel lonely despite maintaining a large player base because of the focus on solo content and solo game modes (ironman). Osrs is also a different type of game though, one that can actually flourish as a completely solo game. The same can‚Äôt be said of almost any other MMO on the market, so the issue of fragmenting the community isn‚Äôt really a pressing one in a game like that.
---
In a game like WoW classic though, the game‚Äôs success really depends on the inter connectivity between the community members, because a lot of mechanics in this game actually strongly promote grouping up as the most efficient method of conquering challenges. Once that community bond breaks, the game will suffer as a result. Using your LFG example, people are much more likely to ditch a group after a wipe on a dungeon if they can just queue up for a new group immediately. People leaving is a frustrating experience for everyone involved and it‚Äôs much more prone to occur when anonymity shrouds the actions of leavers. When people are forced to make a group via chat, there is more time invested between all players just to get the group together, which means they‚Äôll be less likely to disband on a wipe because it‚Äôll be even more of a hassle to find a new group. Additionally, since there‚Äôs no cross realm, server reputation is a real thing. You play OSRS too, so you know, people who get a bad reputation tend to stick with that reputation in the community almost forever. A great example is EmilyisPro. 
---
So yea, I don‚Äôt disagree that osrs is healthy, but I think we can both agree that the roles that the community play in the success of each subsequent game differs drastically and that this game would be much worse off if the community was similar to OSRS‚Äôs style of solo/every man for himself mentality.
---
It depends on how much you play, obviously, but yes.
---
i believe you are un-attackable if you are on a FP
---
1 level a day is easily doable but I set time slots. I play 3 hours every work day. ATM I‚Äôm 19 so I can get 2 ish levels but at 55 I may get 1.
---
It's entirely possible to enjoy both classic and retail.
---
My experience today: Level 11 hunter gives my Level 5 warrior a copper chopper and says "someone was nice and gave this to me, figure you can use it too." Sweet.
---
Later I was clearing some gnolls, but they're packed pretty tight and im getting worked. A Hunter comes into the cave and starts killing them. I ask if he wants to group. He says he's in one, but if I tag them he'll help me kill them since he's just here for the copper. After I finish my quest I give him a random piece of copper I had from a chest. He gives me a couple healing potions. 
---
I don't think I've ever really had any interactions like this on retail. I've made friends, but the random acts of generosity and the ad hoc cooperation. I hope it stays like this after the initial hype, but I've definitely told anyone who's asked "If you're gonna play it, play now."
---
Might want to try Etsy ;)

The last ten levels will be looong days

Is it worth running wc multiple times as a hunter for gear? Seems like lots of good drops in there. I ask as I‚Äôm about to run it myself for the first time (in a very long time) as soon as I gather these last couple quests for it
---
Go watch this show now, if you haven‚Äôt.
---
Stalagg what up
---
1 a Day is absolutely doable until around 45 imo, but that depends on how serious you are and how much time you have. If you have a full time job and play casually it‚Äôs going to be a couple months. If you‚Äôre unemployed with guides itll be a few weeks at most
---
I play runescape on my phone and wow on my pc lmao

I went to incendius since they asked to move to new servers, now i have 7k queue.

Why priest gotta be shadow bro? Jeez

Int &gt; hit &gt; crit.

---
Until X, yes.
---
The answer is no. Robes of the winter night is just as good as robe of the void. Robe of the void are sliiiiightlt better but not enough to even notice a difference. You go tailoring for the bloodvine set bonus.
---
You're not wrong, it's definitely a different consideration because of the expansion model.  But I wouldn't call it a WHOLE other beast exactly.  OSRS has a whole full-sized (I think?) dev team of its own - if Classic turns out successful enough to warrant that, then they could do whatever they want with it - rerelease expansions, rerelease modified expansions (like no flying or no lfg or no whatever), or just straight up release never-before-seen level 60 content brand new.  None of that should be off the table at this point, it's just a matter of how much resource the game deserves in, say, 6 months to a year. 
---
Though one thing that should be off the table, IMO, is making no changes at all.  That would be a truly awful idea that would keep some small percentage of "true believers" around for the long haul, playing the #nochanges game they've always wanted, while half the player base becomes disinterested and leaves, and then 90% more of the remainder bleeds away over time either due to boredom or due to the feeling that the game is dying/has no future.

They made retail WoW more and more convenient.
---
LFG is convenient. 
---
Cross server grouping is convenient.
---
Scaling mobs sounded like a good idea, the convenience of being able to quest where you please and do what you want to do.
---
Convenience enables solo play.
---
Convenience makes difficult tasks unchallenging.
---
Convenience is good right? 
---
You think you do, but you don't!
---
Dont really need spirit. 
---
Intellect is great. Some stam is nice. 
---
What actually matters:
---
- Spell damage
---
- Spell hit
---
- Spell crit
---
1-60 if the WSG que is placed there.
---
50 cents a day for a game that I'll play for several hundred hours seems worth to me.
---
Hey man, have a good one.
---
It was because of his own internal struggles not because of the elements forsaking him.

Mana cost too steep to really use in dungeon runs. Just spam rank 2/3 healing touch

---
What is layering?
---
I honestly appreciate the Unending Breath buff while questing in Darkshore!
---
Yes when you're in the bnet store, and you purchase time and not a sub, it will ask if its a gift or for you. Then you input their email and kablam, they have game time to accept.
---
actually I picked the only OCE PvE server and it seems that most of us aussies prefer PvP realms I guess
---
So you are a mythic wow player?
---
Career warrior here. Boycott those people at every turn. The ones who can't tank are only half-men anyway.
---
How's q?
---
Druids can't parry/block which makes them way worse as main tanks in Raid, but for 5 mans or as a offtank they're excellent youre right. :)
---
Its nowhere near that crazy.
---
If you look at the chart, its more like 40-60 is equivalent to 1-40.
---
so good
---
It's normal pet behavior when they don't trust you so much in the beginning. They will straight run off if you aren't feeding them. Get them to the max loyalty level 6 and you won't really have to worry about it anymore. I feed my pet every once in a while and go afk sometimes and he just disappears but I can just easily call him back.
---
If I reinstall the game using my old discs I bought in 2006 will I be able to join a classic server or do I have to go through an entirely different process?
---
Here is the apology.

---
I like the scrolling text, it forces me to read it so I actually know what I‚Äôm doing
---
I have officially left stalagg lol. I'm on Sulfuras as of today. Can't do it anymore. I play with 5 friends, and due to the long queues with varying schedules, can never play together. 
---
We have all been happy on Sulfuras and have all been able to get on during another's session =) 
---
Max queue so far was around 20 minutes for 1.5k people. Definitely reasonable.
---
So why doesn't it sell ankhs for shaman? Lol
---
Rank 1 is only 6 seconds, not long enough to hearth.
---
Unless they're spying on people to find out exactly what they're looking for they have absolutely no way of knowing for sure where the subscriptions are coming from.
---
And seeing as how they could easily attract even more of an audience from not-so-sure fans not wanting to come back at full price for what's literally a remaster of a 13-year-old game they could just do whatever tried-and-true tactics they've used before to lure them into paying for a premium subscription like waving a few days of a free trial in the newer expansions to keep them hooked.
---
Clearly a lot of the people playing this game are more than willing to pay more and more for things they already have so on top of the attention they'd get with something like "world of warcraft\* is now 9 dollars a month" I feel like it's at least worth discussing.
---
Look at the actual value you're getting for $15 a month. Subscriptions are very relevant in 2019. Heard of Netflix? Spotify? Hulu? Amazon prime? C'mon man, stop crying and either play or don't.
---
Awesome glad I could help!
---
Swiftness and FAP never run out of style. Elixirs of all types stack, and you can spam mana/health on cooldown.

Alchemy is the endgame gold consumer.

this looks fun, around what level does world pvp start? where can i learn to play druid before i dive in
---
What servers are you people playing on where LINES are actually formed? I feel like my server is normal in that everyone just bum rushes

did u wife her?
---
It‚Äôs so much louder than everyone‚Äôs stream!

I see.  Thanks for the info.  Bloodvine set would be phase 2, is that right?
---

Is Dwarf Warrior a lot worse than Human Warrior? I rolled Dwarf and I‚Äôm having a great time with it. I want to make sure I didn‚Äôt make a bad choice.

I think priest will have a great payoff by max, but conjuring water is amazing when your water costs 1s each plus teleports and selling portals

Yea, but literally no one has 800g right now.

I've played a mage a fair bit as well, and generally they are pretty brainless to play. I say just play what looks fun. You can always find a guild or group to do raiding with.

Meh, everyone who didn‚Äôt start your sub until the last day, it‚Äôs your fault not blizzards.

mad invite

You absolutely should. And you can technically play from bed right..... so.... where's the problem? :D
---
LET'S GOOO
---
Whatever has a stat boost
---
And they sucked imo stats were screwy, odd tweaks and breaks, hackers. You‚Äôre paying a monthly sub to have a better experience. I‚Äôd gladly pay it. If you do t want to go play a grubby private server
---
Thrall did cheat though. You‚Äôre only allowed one weapon. Thrall used Doomhammer and then used magic. That‚Äôs two. Thrall cheated.
---
I was going to do that yesterday. My forgetfulness saved me!
---
Imagine complaining about 50 cents a day. Get a job.
---
I actually like mythic+, it is a good system and actually gives skilled players something difficult to do outside raids but yeah the system regressed this time, mostly because the dungeon design.  It should stay around as a viable alternative to raiding.   
---
The problem is they don't know what they want to do with it.   They don't embrace it as an alternative to raiding at the moment and because of that gearing through that method ends up being trash as you said.   People want different things from different dungeons and the loot table is so massive that targeting anything you actually need becomes almost impossible.  The idea they used for the azerite pieces honestly is good, but too tied to weekly chests and only helps with those pieces.   Expand that with a new currency from running dungeons would do a lot to help that, just give it a weekly cap while keeping the existing drops about the same.  Then you make the loot drops from mythic+ global so you don't have people targeting specific dungeons.   Then you still get your rewarding mythic+ gameplay but also have a form that you can use to target high value upgrades like trinkets and weapons. 
---
The other problem was the bad dungeon design for mythic+ that caused this very specific meta. If your going to do mythic+ you need to design dungeons in mind for it, no skippable trash packs and more linear dungeons. You need to make it so that clearing multiple packs at once isn't as viable/mandatory so that it is not only aoe classes are taken.  The dungeons this time around were horribly designed for something like mythic+ so if you didn't have good aoe you were useless and the skipping annoying trash meant a rogue was mandatory.  I mean when you practically have to have a rogue for every single mythic+ above 10 if you want to time it just because of stealth and the aoe damage you fucked up.  
---
Honestly though mythic raiders are not running 50 dungeons a day, most of them only run 1-2 a day.    Early on during the first week or two you might run more but generally you are not running that much because the gear cap caps out at heroic level without a titanforge.   All they do is run enough to skip the heroic raid gearing process so you can progress through mythic earlier.
---
Is that a reference to Bully, or am I missing something?
---
lol
---
They need to stop calling it a queue. Call it what it is.  It is a server cap, you only get in when people leave, that isn't a line and the timer is thus a lie.
---
Sometimes it‚Äôs better to be blissfully retarded, that‚Äôs why I stopped playing retail months ago
---
Did someone say remove the gnomes? Because I think most people would agree!
---
There's a couple of new ones about to open up, consider one of them for no queues and your pick of character names:

Am I supposed to feel bad for a multi-billion dollar corporation that literally threw away most of their own work before this because some fans decided to go through the effort of hosting their own servers for free?
---
This is literally the same as defending nintendo shutting down rom sites because they stole their "intellectual property" they refused to even sell legitimately themselves.
---
It's the only way to play
---
&gt;Unless they're spying on people to find out exactly what they're looking for they have absolutely no way of knowing for sure where the subscriptions are coming from.
---
Dude. This is the most press WoW has gotten in years. It's on the top of Twitch. No spying is necessary. There is no way blizzard devs can spin their quarterly upturn on anything but Classic. No way at all.
---
&gt;And seeing as how they could easily attract even more of an audience from not-so-sure fans not wanting to come back at full price
---
And you have absolutely no way of knowing for sure that there are people like that.
---
Just like every other time "why don't they sell X for cheaper they'd get so many more sales" comes up in reference to video games/MtX/whatever, the answer is that you are not a marketing expert, and Blizzard has some of the best marketing experts. It sure would be nice if it was cheaper. But it's not gonna happen. Especially when the game already launched at full price, and servers are *literally* overflowing. &gt;.&gt;

No. Seriously - it‚Äôs that you don‚Äôt have to walk as much. 
---
CLASSIC IS SO MUCH WALKING, HOLY GUAC BATMAN. 
---
At least, that‚Äôs been my experience. Also I like how bonkers the loot is, because it‚Äôs a whole other meta game.

Actually... I think it‚Äôs also that theres a TON of meta games that have been removed over the years.

There‚Äôs quite a few reasons. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Oh my god now I want to join that

With a little farming on retail you can play both for free.  Or rather pay for play with play.
---
I'm like upset I never thought of this epic name. Well done sir

That is more than enough. A true Bag Man makes Bags to make Bags.

Wont I have to re-buy it that way?

Ah, they're showing The Queue at the drive-in.

And once you get to raids all the melee want that sweet true shot aura and wolf buff
---
Idk about other servers but tanks are what everyone is looking for on my server
---
Roll need on anything that's an upgrade, especially look at weapon damage. It is perfectly acceptable to take weapons that will help you level if you're a healer. Shaman wants weapons with agility, spirit, and strength - but you should focus on the weapon damage.
---
Nice I‚Äôve been trying to convince my gf also, so close to!

Honestly it depends on how acclimated you are to caffeine. I can drink a couple within a few hours and feel fine. Honestly just make sure you drink plenty of water, the most important thing imo.

Flamegor, from my understanding, is a Russian server. Could you explain to me how i can sub to EU wow classic? I can have two subs going at the same time, correct? Also I've heard that Russians servers may have been separated from EU ones.
---
The game itself is free, access to it requires the subscription. It's an odd system and I didn't get it either
---
Seriously.  I bounce back and forth between FFXIV and Wow.  Despite it's praise, FFXIV is already starting to lose me with it's brand new expansion.  It's the same thing that game always does.  Just periodically dumps finite amounts of content that you're expected to repeat until it happens again.  For a long time I've been thinking I wanted a new mmo to launch.
---
You can spend $60 on a "AAA" game and get 30-50 hours played and get bored. Then the next cool flashy  game comes out and you drop another $60 but this one is a microtransaction shit show that you need to pay another $20 for the premium bundle that gives you a cool skin. Oh and if you want to change the reticle it's gonna cost you $3. 
---
Or you can use that $140 and spend $70~ for a six month sub to wow. Play as much as your sleep deprived self can take and use the rest of the money to buy some snacks and Mt Dew and enjoy this amazing game.
---
Oh yeah can also play retail...
---
Holy shit, what kind of grown adult complains about spending 15$ a month for something you likely put a lot of hours in?! 
---
Man, go on a private server if that 15$ is so revolting.
---
I‚Äôd rather read and walk, but I didn‚Äôt know it was an option until today.
---
Probably bigger problems if that happened
---
This just shows how awesome this community is
---
I was REALLY disappointed that pallys aren't viable for raid tanking.
---
Sweet summer child
---
Woyer* they am ver smort and know how does spell naem
---
There are plenty of games that offer subscriptions, as well as those that offer cosmetic items or other things for additional money. FFXIV and ESO are two other MMOs that offer a subscription service. It's very common.
---
If you can't justify the 50 cents a day to play a game you enjoy, you may want to consider why you can't justify that, but CAN justify spending money on coffee, fast food, movies, and other leisurely things that you don't need.
---
WoW doesnt have a cartoony style? Its style is well known BECAUSE its so cartoony compared to other MMOs.
---
Likely bad luck. 
---
If it makes you feel better, I‚Äôve done 10 dungeons and never won a roll for gear.
---
i wonder if they'll make more normal servers
---
The hero we never had in retail
---
This is a high quality shitpost.
---
54 Now which is insane
---
VC stands for Van Cleef after Edwin Van Cleef, the final boss in DM. People who call it VC do so because at one time, DM stood for Dire Maul. At this point in classic, Dire Maul doesn‚Äôt exist and people have been calling The Deadmines ‚ÄúDM‚Äù.  It‚Äôs been a daily argument in Westfall chat since release. But my position stands firm. Dire Maul doesn‚Äôt exist, just as it didn‚Äôt exist when WoW was released, when people called the Deadmines DM. Anyone who calls it VC wasn‚Äôt apart of the original wow release or beta.
---
Do we still need all these doomsday posts now that classic is actually out? go enjoy the game instead of shitposting here.
---
the systems blizzard have in place are there to cover that.   
---
in game AFK timeout is approx 15 minutes before you are kicked. This is ample time to get a drink or go to the toilet. 
---
need more time? logout to character screen. You can sit there for 30 minutes. 
---
Anything over 30 minutes and i think its fair to say that you should give up your slot in the queue for someone else who CAN play the game during this period.
---
i agree with you 10000%
---
i main'd a priest in vanilla and it feels so good being back in the vanilla saddles with my priest now. i sit in moonbrook and clutch heal people alllll the time. its a blast.
---
jesus what depressing wiki-how is this base from....

Or a twink, or a battleground to twink in
---
I've been dropping Might on pets, but I don't think any hunters have actually noticed yet.
---
To me it was gear and gold inflation. Last xpac we needed extra bags to hold all our legendary drops. Stupid. Heirlooms completely trivialized lower levels. Woulda been better to just enable level boost to max for gold. The game (for many of us) is about the journey.
---
Thank you for the anecdote. VC stands for Van Cleef after Edwin Van Cleef, the final boss in DM. People who call it VC do so because at one time, DM stood for Dire Maul. At this point in classic, Dire Maul doesn‚Äôt exist and people have been calling The Deadmines ‚ÄúDM‚Äù.  It‚Äôs been a daily argument in Westfall chat since release. But my position stands firm.

---
Just got blessing of Wisdom and now I feel like a baller I can buff melee and casters. You think you can escape my buffs? THINK AGAIN
---
The reason people have such fond memories of Wrath is because of the lore.  I agree with you that the game had already gone to shit by then, but the story was at its peak.
---
The massive drop off after Wrath is not just because the game changed, but because ending Arthas was the end of the story that started in Warcraft 3, which is the story that we all love.
---
If you didn't know, go to the old Lordaeron throne room above Undercity and turn up your ambient sound.
---
i didnt realize they had the guild herald pets in vanilla.
---
It‚Äôs just Deadmines
---
I hate when people think others are playing because of ‚Äúnostalgia‚Äù.....like wtf? I‚Äôve never even played this damn game lol
---
Same. I grabbed the sword on live back in the day. Who cares about maxing dmg at lvl 30? Youll change it by 45
---
I hope Blizzard learns from Classic
---
maybe they do, but they screwed up, it's unarguable. it's probably less fault on the developers, more on the maximising of profits.
---
Just made the journey from mulgore to orgrimmar. Going to do my warrior class quest tomorrow
---
Its packed
---
What level do people usually go for this at? Assuming you dont have a bunch of people willing to carry you.
---
Literally any spec... Could do it without any talents spent
---
You can make enough $ from alchemy to buy tailored robes.
---
People running away before I can buff them...fkn rude
---
I literally sold the cloak off my back once to afford the FP back to IF. (It was a grey 5 armor cloak but still.)
---
Hate on cross-server as much as you want, but I realized with WoW Classic that I never had this experience in actual vanilla. Actual vanilla, you hardly ever got groups and skipped most/all of the elite quests because it was so unlikely to run across people at the exact same point as you. They should have done some sort of mixture, such as cross-server at lower levels, but not at max levels.
---
God this is so relatable. I usually wake up at 6:45am for work (after hitting snooze 4 times), and I've been waking up at 5am on the dot since release. My fianc√©e just thinks I want to get an early start on the day... and I do... killing quillboars...
---
same here thats why we thought we just grind that boss till we all have Corpsemaker. Well didnt happen.

Yeah. By the time you reach the end everything has respawned. Kobolds flee so quickly they just agro mobs back in to you.

You can even just walk off the edge at an angle. No need for jumping on the barrel and such! :D

I still give fort to random people I meet on retail, I wish I had a buff to give on classic but I'm playing rogue, I've been dying to play what I call a barbarian since burning crusade (double mace stun lock orc rogue)
---
No way will I change your mind! It is the best, spooky little town.

I really fear for the internet in 20 years when I see comments like yours so much. You know he's using BiS as a joke right? It's a freaking gray item with no stats on it.

But You‚Äôll make up for the steps by being on the WoW diet!
---
I agree that it‚Äôs the one I miss the most. But I think this is one of the ones that drives the most social interaction. Maybe not for 9/10 players, but I think that the 1/10 players is going to be the one that actually strikes up a conversation with their fellow questing pals. Which may not seem like much but I know once I had shared tagging I probably didn‚Äôt strike up a conversion on 1/100 quests that I did. 
---
These figures are totally conjecture, but seem to be holding based on my own classic experience.
---
this is almost exactly how i feel. i never touched an mmo until ff14 a few months back. ennoyed it... but it never... clicked. dropped it for a few after shadowbringers with no urge to get back in for endgame shit. then had a really good friend get me to try this and - man. no other game has given me that jubilant, carefree base level/from the ground up social feeling that this has. i smiled nonstop for hours. i forgot to finish my coffee multiple times. i made short term buddies with group invites, i texted my friend nonstop about what to do and what i was doing. i made noises at the hares, i enjoyed crossing expansive land for shit, i got lost in the retro art direction for the cities. dude NO GAME in the last like, 6-7 years had made me feel this overjoyed just playing it. legit makes a bitch wanna cry a big

Fuck, that's like an hour faster than his timer estimated, I was just going to head over there.

from what i understand: the platform reformed automatically during standard behavior anyway, and saronite bombs were a standard part of the dps rotation. if i were in their situation it would be hard to make a connection.
---
Not trying to counter you, just adding on
---
Mate, as a druid I always make it a priority to buff warriors with MotW, thorns and I will heal you up if you are low on hp. 
---
Levelling as a warrior is tough as fuck.
---
That line got me so good!
---
I actually offer every solo player I meet a hearthstone because that‚Äôs my contribution
---
i think a lot of the "OG" players are just remembering their private servers.
---
Man this is the pubg life, every server maintenance is USA peak. How have they not learned to stagger it over Geo's off-peak times yet.
---
Did OSRS have similar attempts at baiting when it came out too?
---
My boyfriend dragged me to horde instead so I haven't gotten to play with a Pally
---
Do they still dish out wisdom instead of kings? That used to drive me up the wall in Vanilla/BC
---
Yeah, kind of debating my decision with that... I'm pretty bad with reddit - if you know how to ping an online mod to remove or at least check the post, I would appreciate it.  Will open a ticket tomorrow regardless.
---
Thanks.
---
Im one of those free bag giving aholes. I rudely gave away over a dozen linen bags without even demanding a tip.
---
Is that how you get it? I didn't know. Good thing I'm leveling Fishing.
---
As someone with 2 older, married siblings who both have kids with their spouses, this hits me close to home
---
Classic doesn't have a single quest line that guides you through leveling. You are expected to visit other races territories in order to level. At 12, your options include Silverpine or the Barrens (on Horde).
---
I'm turning 29 next month as well! Lol
---
I used to always do that haha. That and climb to the roof of goldshire inn
---
Which server were you on? I might have seen you! I even posted in general there was an undead skulking around dagger hills.
---
Last I saw this morning he was grinding in the western plaguelands .... by the time they make it to him they would be picked off by the mobs around him
---
I realized WoW was going downhill when tokens came out. I would literally see people with 3/5 tier pieces without setting a foot in ulduar. 2 from conquest tokens and a 1 drop from wintergrasp.  Things were getting too convenient.
---
difference is you'll stay and fight if you're in the group. in retail you just hit them 1 time and move on because you'll get credit.
---
got me on the first half
---
I'm actively looking for ways to break my leg on the job right now. Get some sweet disability.... lol

I love how helpful everyone is, and how having shoulder pads is like a big deal at the moment. Got my first green BoE before , hype as shit!
---
LF2M DPS Dadmemes. Kill ALL the things!
---
I think you missed my point. You were able to move servers without feeling like you were sacrificing anything because you don't have friends on the server you're on. Switching realms means leaving friends behind for people who have them.

Hey u/christophrus do you have these stats?

the site seems to be down atm

Oh wow this was one of the first things I wanted to try because I remember having gatherings down there. However when I read that Classic ran on the BFA engine I assumed that this wouldn't work anymore.
---
Can't even at wow classic to get away from this shit.
---
The comment you're replying to is a little misleading. Priests and Shamans *can do damage* but Shadow and Elemental/Enhancement aren't really super effective endgame DPS specs. You'll generally be expected to heal in PvE group content as either of these classes.
---
You can bring one Shadow Priest to a raid because they provide a buff that's valuable for your warlocks (Shadow Weaving) but generally other than that you don't due to debuff slot limit and mana concerns. Elemental and Enhancement Shaman do okay DPS but don't have the mana sustain to be able to do long fights like you'll find in raiding. You're more likely to see those specs in a soloing or PvP context than endgame PvE.
---
If you get into a guild that raids and is okay with bringing suboptimal dps then you might be able to fit in as those specs. But they're far from "the meta."

Thrall considered Dranosh to become the next Warchief. After the Wrathgate incident, Garrosh was his remaining choice.
---
World of war crack indeed. Enjoy Azeroth and take some time to enjoy the outside world too. Sometimes hard I know. I made grape jelly today. I feel a little better knowing I didn‚Äôt spend my entire day off in Azeroth. Only about ten hours of it lol.

I‚Äôm starting solo on a PvP server. Looking forward to some WPvP while keeping it my main for PvE stuff. Can‚Äôt decide between Mage or Priest or Rogue. Maybe Lock?

There‚Äôs a dwarf labeled ‚Äúlore master‚Äù in iron forge who sends you to bfd. This this the west text:

‚ÄúAs you might know, I collect lore. Old lore. Powerful lore. Lore that opens doorways, and lore that can awaken Those Who Sleep.
---
There are rumors of an old piece of lore, the Lorgalis Manuscript, at the bottom of Blackfathom Deeps in Ashenvale. That place is the old dwelling of long-dead elves. Elves who held great knowledge before their city fell to ruin.
---
Search Blackfathom Deeps for the manuscript. Do this, and I will not forget it. Not even after ... the end days.‚Äù
---
They were hyping old god cosmic horror from day one.

Mines all on Ultra.

As you level up you improve stealth every 20 levels I‚Äôm pretty sure. Reduces the speed upto 70% by the end. 
---
It makes you feel stronger over time

I give might to everyone. I just say it's for when they're oom and need to melee things. Even the blueberries get might. (Too low for wisdom rn.)

Int and stam for leveling, with spirit being a nice bonus but you can make endless food and water for regen anyway. As far as spell power, obviously it's great, but don't go decking yourself out in spell power-only greens unless you desperately want to be a glass cannon with no sustain, especially on a PVP server.
---
I always picked it up. Youll get destroyed in pvp without it
---
Obviously. 
---
I'm just asking where the classic servers are located.
---
&gt;downtime
---
How long it takes between beating something and being ready to move onto the next one. Mana/health regen, sustainability (time not spent needing to heal or recharge mana is time spent hitting the 10% drop rate hearts or teeth out of your next quest target)
---
From your own link.  
---
&gt; A popular misconception among the fanbase is that Thrall cheated in his final mak'gora against Garrosh when he used elemental magic. However, there has never been any rule forbidding the use of magic and spells. Moreover, there is precedent for the use of magic in mak'gora, as both [Shagara](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Shagara) and [Ashra](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Ashra) made extensive use of it during their mak'gora. Thrall had also already used magic in the first mak'gora between him and Garrosh, by throwing lightning bolts. Another misconception is that Thrall became a weaker shaman after Garrosh's death because the elements felt like he used them in vengeance. In reality, it was his guilt and internal struggle that were the reason for him not hearing them anymore 
---
You could argue that thrall having body armor is cheating or unfair, but body armor is not strictly forbidden as they both wore armor in their first duel.
---

&gt;Maybe hes trying to contaminate the auctioneer data, or something... I don't flippin know.
---
There's no TSM data yet (no blizzard API, databases are created by manual scans and people that use them also know the value of a lot of items). No point in doing that afaik.

The last thing anyone needs in a PUG is a horrible tank who has no idea what he is doing. It will just waste everyone's time.  Especially people who are new to WoW, have almost never run a dungeon and don't know the dungeons at all.    
---
Please stay as DPS. I want a tank who knows what to do.
---
Yes its not good for a mage but its rare and people want it. You could have sold it for more gold.
---
xDDDDD
---
Exactly, but if like the top comment said garrosh died at the wrath gate he would be a great martyr remembered with no flaws AND we'd get big daddy Dranosh as war chief and a perfect horde.
---
Exp is hard to come by. Might as well do them.
---
I was looking for a server to roll on, and I was googling like any many would, til I stumbled across this of course. I'm now set on kromcrush.
---
What do you mean where?
---
They are probably held in the same server farms that wow is held in. Blizzard wouldn't hire out different places for this. 
---
Also Blizzard wouldn't tell you where they're located exactly.
---
&gt;1 SP/raid
---
This is still pretty true, nobody will be clamoring for their 3rd+ shadow priest. Admitting this as a hopeful shadow priest. The limit on # of debuffs an enemy can have really pumps the breaks on a class that's so DoT heavy, and even given the debuff slots doesn't perform exceptionally well (DPS wise. Spriests are great at other support things).

it's not about recreating the exact same experience as 15 years ago, we all know that's not going to happen and we DO NOT look for that.
---
I was just illustrating how this game was so  much more than just the clever marketing you reduce it to.  It doesn't matter at all that it was unfinished and a bit rough in 2004 at launch. What matters is the way the game and the community playing it developed in 2005 and 2006.
---
Alliance on Fairbanks here - I'll be happy to give your lovely wife a tour of STV anytime.
---
I've been giving away tons of bags, green drops, robes etc. on Atiesh. I am the self-proclaimed Santa of that server lol
---
Good to know other people are being generous as heck too.
---
what UI is that
---
No, it is not a fair system, like, at all.
---
Just kicking everyone out to character select would be enough to remove most people using AHK scripts. There is no need to put everyone back in queue...
---
Thanks a ton!
---
Does this work in retail?
---
+1 for "how's the weathercraft".
---
My character is Fatthor and I ran by a guy named Loki and I was like‚ÄùBrother! How are you?‚Äù But never got a reply :(
---
Ah i still remember the 1st time I fell for it in WSG, I felt so exposed as a noob , but then felt like I had joined a brotherhood of seasoned vets that would no longer succumb to such tomfoolery.
---
As a warlock main, this is amazing.
---
Nah, it just reminded me of the build that I had heard about elsewhere.
---
It's all irrelevant anyway because I ended up rolling a warlock lol
---
Oh I've seen them even in game, then I just steal the tag and walk away.
---
A group find UI would be fine. No auto-invite, no gear score, no teleport. Just people hanging out in chat with their level, roles they'll do and what dungeon they would prefer and some good search functionality. That is the extent that group finder should ever go.
---
same
---
There‚Äôs a quest line that gives you a better wand. It‚Äôs like a ratchet quest line I think
---
Me too. Especially after seeing the "low pop today = full in vanilla" metric being thrown around.  Low pop servers are absolute ghost towns,  so I'm curious how it compares.
---
AOE farming in WPL to Gachi. Talk about a test of your resolve.
---
I quit the moment they nerfed dungeons in Cata. With the dungeon buffs, I had hope they were moving back towards the TBC/Classic style of play that made WoW so compelling, but they showed me that retail wasn't a game for me anymore.
---
&gt; why roll on an RP server if you dont want to RP
---
Because queues duh this is not hard
---
Would be kinda funny if Classic ends up with the same amount of realms as retail in the end.
---
Really? Warriors used guns for stats a lot in bc and wrath
---
Only buy voidwalker abilitys.
---
Dont bother with imp while leveling.
---
I‚Äôm leveling as Arms. I‚Äôm at 18 now and have tanked a couple RFC runs. Just grab a sword and board and for it. I‚Äôm playing solo and it can be slow, but fun.
---
You don‚Äôt really need to spec Prot to tank instanced  until 60, so don‚Äôt feel like you need to.
---
If it runs its allowed- if they disallow it, they‚Äôll change the api and it‚Äôll stop working.
---
Warriors can use every single weapon type
---
Just dl it even if ot says game ver 8.x, if it shows on curse when you have selected classic folder, it means it works with that both game versions.
---
Not really understanding what being a dick about it is getting you, but you do you.
---
Feeling to poop went away. Had to postpone. Will update soon.
---
Doable at 22 then? Ive seen other people say they wait awhile to do it just because of how tedious it is (never done it myself).
---
Got it, giving arcane intelligent to your pet instead of you now.
---
What version of Bartender works with Classic?
---
Time spent eating/drinking to restore your hp and mana.
---
Yea not many people think before they post üòÖ
---
Damn, i remember this spot when we raided stormwind. Kor kron vanguard my brothers!
---
it'll probably sell for 25-50g thats what it was on my server way back in vanilla.
---
Your link doesn‚Äôt work.
---
Buy new spells but you dont need to buy every one.
---
I love taunting mobs off people in the open world when they're questing and about to die. I even saved a hordie in the barrens as a Night Elf and we /danced while waiting for his friend to corpse run.
---
You believe you are royal treatment isn't being served. This is just a game so stop your complaint and play..
---
Questie doesn't have a guide on the best leveling order, but you can see all quests, where to find the required items etc.
---
Just because you want to use it does not mean the other people don't want to use it also for gold. It's the same for chests. Roll and whoever wins gets it even if you can use it.
---
What is the difference?
---
Some guy in brill handed me an axe while I was chillin on my warrior.
---
What server are you on
---
Mum's cat does the same thing; apparently she needs protecting from the screen. It also makes it harder for her to play because the cat will try to get on the keyboard, too.
---
I'm questing in ashenvale, not a soul around, pretty nice break from westfall madness.
---

I loved this so much.

---
20gold.
---
Downtime means things like buffing(stat boost spells), eating, drinking. Things that make you pause from leveling and take time.
---
Lol ‚ÄúI will be very sad without it‚Äù 
---
Sounds like a good addon though. I‚Äôd be interested.
---
Hey I use this same app. Luckily my job keeps me above 9k+ a day and helps me avoid the queue
---
I mean yeah everyone needs gold, but not everyone needs that item, I guess that‚Äôs where me and my buddy disagree too. I think if someone needs it they should be the ones rolling on it, and if nobody needs it then it‚Äôs a ffa.
---
If it's BOE you greed, simple.
---
As a priest who literally brought the group back up twice after wipes due specifically to soulstones...  
---
At least it ain't a hunter.
---
Or maybe even Hunter, Warrior, or Paladin? Lol jk man. Sounds like you need to play each class a bit and decide which one appeals to you the most.

---
Let me ask you another questiona. If you have a cow that gives you fine Milk, how long you Will Milk it?
---
NE for the jump flips
---
Dude, that‚Äôs awesome! Glad it wound up working out and good to know for the future.
---
classic wow does not adapt to you, you adapt to it. it is not easy, it does not  have 4 difficulty levels, if you don't give it enough ''love'' you will  never see AQ or NAXX.
---
retail is designed for people  who does not like  WoW. for people who do not play WoW. it was an RPG - Action, now it's an Action - RPG. 
---
this happens in other games, like morrowind, as well. you try to cater to people who does not play your game, your own players hate you, players who doesn't play your game still does not.
---
you think you have a ''right'' to see all the content. have a ''right'' to every QoL think you can image. in reality, you don't. wow has apologized to people who do not even play the game, and it is %100 not alone in this regard. just like fallout, mass effect, they all gone to the same way. WoW started hating itself ,and now it's a mini puzzle game.
---
There are stealth only abilities. Stealth lets mobs not see you. Am I missing something? I honestly can't tell if this is a serious post I am sorry.  It seems like you think it only reduces your speed or something.
---
You don't want my 2 min battle shout? SMH.
---
You supposedly stay in the same layer. I encounter a lot of the same people in zones so far too so it seems to be working decently.
---
Dude... How... Why???
---
Yes I'm sure he breaks down and sobs every night drying his tears with cash
---
Your blink was up dawg
---
I think that warning you're talking about is to warn the clueless so they don't get scammed.
---
90% are QoL improvements and very good things.
---
the only complaining about flying, summoning stones (that ruined wpvp) and more casual leveling (i prefer a little harder mobs) . everything else is 1000 much better on retail than on vanilla
---
after i finish Wbosses i go back on retail and never open classic again.
---
What is top rank at this time
---
I made a Target of target macro for the imp to cast it on the tank. Not sure if it knows to always select the tank automatically.
---
I got the Night Watch Shortsword on my lvl 18 rogue.
---
oh okay thanks. What weapons can hunters use? I've only been using daggers and bows is that it? I've seen a meme about everything being a hunter weapon.
---
And if someone needs it because it‚Äôs a good upgrade?
---
Why would you waste time standing in a line when you can check the spawn timer and do stuff while the mob/item respawns?
---
It is casted automatically on a party member that get attacked.
---
But it only works on party members or on the imp owner.
---
I‚Äôm on Grobbulus, which isn‚Äôt classified as ‚Äúfull‚Äù, and even Darnassus is filled with people.

Flying and portals. No more God damn portals.

Boe blues should always be rolled greed. It happened today where a blue 2h sword dropped and the warrior wanted it. I won the greed roll and sold it. 
---
If the person that won it wants to give it to you that's cool. 
---
If you ask the others to pass and they do that's cool.
---
Gonna do this with lesser and greater magic wands

Honestly, the high end game has never been harder mechanically.  Mythic raids are in retail now require planning and execution that are just orders of magnitude higher than vanilla. The difference is that the cost of entry now is extremely low. To clear Nax you had to be a good player, but the cost of entry in sunk time was extremely high on top of that.
---
Is this screenshot edited in any way?
---
I told my roomie/adventure buddy the other day, "First thing I wanna do when we're 60 and geared is join a raid group and stab that bitch Sylvanas right in her stupid face."  
---
I went Alliance after Garrosh and never looked back, but I grew to hate Sylvanas even worse.
---
Downloaded WoW and played for literally only 20 mins before I had to go to work. Made a friend who was totally cool to talk to.
---
They roll greed or ask the party if it's ok if they have it.
---
code is a catch-all as well.
---
being impossible to detect doesn't mean its not against ToS. Hardware automation is executing a code. Old school way to basically say instruction set.
---
2 characters, 1 always in a inn, is the perfect way to level. %100 utilize that rested EXP, it is very powerful.
---
Logically everyone should roll need. Then nobody can ninja...
---
You can pay whoever wins it. I always wait and see if someone rolls need. Too many times in classic I saw people roll need promise they would use it and see it on the AH an hour later.
---
Upvoted in hopes you find your friend.
---
I don‚Äôt judge, I‚Äôm taco friendly.
---
Why wouldn't you just party up
---
Dumbass breeders creating new monsters in compliance with their biological programming.
---
For the horde, friend
---
Serious question, what could you mess up for a player like that?
---
This is what ended up happening unfortunately. Someone always tries to ninja.
---
Had an RFC group earlier with a warrior, priest, druid, mage, and lock. Sooo many buffs it was great. And having to take a moment to say "let's rebuff after this pull" and drink up, it was nice to see that kind of diversity again. 
---
Also having a druid in your group is awesome btw. Offtank, offheals, offdps is what he called it. Plus motw and thorns means druids are utility masters!
---
\&gt; Short of a time machine, how do you expect them to make these requested changes when they basically told us this is the SAME game that was released 15 years ago?
---
They also said that depending on how successful Classic is that they would look into either TBC or even new content. So your argument is dead.
---
Actually had AI on right after getting the crescent staff from WC quest.  Leveled that staff shit quick.
---
Prolly the 1 and only time as a warrior I said ‚Äúfuck yea mages.‚Äù
---
they should be in classic since they use original artsets from 1.12
---
So it's SW AH square with 3 people in it. This is on Kurinnaxx. Here's the thing though:  
---
I was in a SW CROWDED with SO MANY PEOPLE that while standing at the tree in SW AH center I couldn't make water fast enough when just now and then saying that I was giving it away for free. Because I like to and it's nice and classic CAN be so toxic that it makes me feel toxic so instead I decided to give away free food and water for a few hours to brighten things up and maybe help my attitude.
---
So when doing this, I got a tell from someone that couldn't find me. I grouped with them and as soon as I did, I was teleported to a SW that was void of life. With maybe a few dozen people in it. And nobody to give water to! And I went to IF and it was the same problem. It's like I'm on a pserver, basically, pop-wise.
---
All that I'd really like to know is how to choose a shard or hop between them? I thought there was a default interface for that in retail at one point? I am confused by this but the facts as I stated them are sequential and true.
---
The layering has been stated multiple times to be a temporary situation for the first while until they get an idea of how many servers they need to run (i.e. how many people will play classic regularly) and once that's smoothed out they're supposed to get rid of it.  So it's highly likely that you WILL see those people again if they're  still playing when that happens. 
---
As far as guides go, well, that was a thing back in vanilla. As was wowglider, the bot that preceded honorbuddy. You will always have people who follow cookie cutters in any game, but they wont excel as much as the people who understand the mechanics and the game. As far as people not wanting to go off the beaten path to do WC as alliance, well yeah, that was hard to get people to do in vanilla even with Summons and people right now are more worried about getting their mains to 60 instead of losing hours going out of the way for gear that will be replaced.
---
If they dont get rid of layering like they said they would, that may be an issue later but I'm having a blast personally and I'm sorry if you arent.
---
lmaooo
---
Prob wall jump into hyjal
---
I think there's just a plethora of different people here. The first people to comment are always haters and trolls. They just keep hitting refresh looking for anything to bring a smidge of happiness to their lives. The other half of us are pretty cool though and hopefully we've all migrated to the same servers so we CAN have a great community. Most of the trolls probably rolled on Herod or Faerlina.
---
I think you will have to copy both the launcher and classic files over to the usb, assuming that it is like a 16 - 32gb one.
---
If you are able to do that, then you should be able to just run it off the usb however it may put some files on your work pc.
---
I can't remember where but it's something lik either the %appdata or like my downloads. 
---
I may be wrong about the files but if it works then it should be like playing off a cd but it might be slower. 
---
Your work computer should be safe but if the company tracks bandwidth, you might want to be careful, also on a side note, you might not want to do this at all at work as you are kinda opening a door to the company's firewalls.
---
-cheers
---
thank you sir
---
You'll want phase shift for the imp if your gonna do any dungeons as you lvl.  Most of the time groups want the stam buff, and having the imp shifted keeps him from agroing so it makes group wipes due to forgetting about the pet a thing of the past.
---
They are not just positives in classic, but you can take inspiration and help a stranger tomorow IRl or   chat with the guy on the bus stop.
---
Filthy casual
---
Why you showing people our secrets
---
That's a tanking weapon.
---
So this rule carries over from EverQuest days
---
If the item is a cash drop then everybody has a right to it. Freezing band is going to be one of the most valuable items on many servers for a couple reasons. It‚Äôs BiS for mages through AQ (when they swap to fire) I believe and it‚Äôs also god tier item in PvP. Idgaf if you are a mage and I‚Äôm a warrior I am rolling need on that.
---
In vanilla, not pulling threat from the tank is 100% the dps's responsibility.  
---
You never know when the tank has 0 rage, and just got parried 3 times in a row.  
---
Tanks should try and maintain threat on everything and much as possible, but if you over-aggro, it is your fault.
---
Cheetos, Hot Pockets, energy drinks, and Mountain Dew?
---
He spawns at the bottom of the stairs where you hand in. You have to wait until a group is done with him for him to respawn there if he is missing.
---
some of what you said is true, and I did not expect bags to be free; kinda bs and it ruins the initial economy and starter levels in the server.
---
because of this stuff I've actually been playing solo mostly.
---
as a druid, I've always given out a motw buff. I dunno. that hasn't changed me, but what has changed is the number of buffs I receive.
---
last night I had an issue exactly like that is being described. we even group for a while then died and then I walked like 5 minutes to my body, and the person said the quest. they were trying to complete, and I knew there was further away. and I said that multiple times, so then walk there. so fuck me I guess for not noticing that they apparently disconnected when they died. that would almost never happen in vanilla.
---
Walljump is fixed in classic
---
Yeah I had no idea it was possible until I gave it a shot. I wonder if they kept it in as a service to the people.
---
Are the queues still there? Playing on Yojamba (high pop) and there's not a queue in sight.
---
True, I mean you can always say someone can just get another job and fill whatever free time they have but realistically you shouldn't need to spend 18 hours a day working, you could but thats a quite shit quality of life. Poor people want to relax after work too, sometimes more so
---
Hm, maybe I‚Äôll take a look once I‚Äôve leveled some more. Those places have always interested me.
---
I appreciate the stolen mobs.
---
With dynamic respawns, life is hard.  Shit I just killed is spawning next to me.
---
Those fucking barrens deaths are agonizing.  Like the time spent running from the GY gives you time to think *‚Äùit‚Äôs not too late to reroll...*
---
Someone is 54 according too  [https://dotesports.com/news/wow-classic-race-to-world-first-level-60-leaderboards](https://dotesports.com/news/wow-classic-race-to-world-first-level-60-leaderboards)
---
Better than all the korean microsotransaction mmo garbage
---
This jokerd dude seens like a True chad
---
Just a difference of opinion then. If the item is getting used by someone who was there to earn it then its bring put to better use than someone selling it. A blue item in the 20s could stay equipped and relevant on someone for a long time as opposed to someone making 5 gold off of it when money is everywhere.
---
yeah, you only start with training in a few weapons your class can use (usually race dependent, such as the troll being the only warrior race to start with a ranged weapon training, the rest have to wait till 10 to pick one up).
---
You buy training in the rest once you hit 10.
---
Is this faster than jumping in the water and swimming?

If you‚Äôre a working adult, and having trouble with $15 a month, you should not play and get your priorities sought out then.

You make me wish I had rolled horde ^((almost)).

Learn Engineering and get a Goblin Transporter: Gadgetzan.

While the rest of your guild is schlubbing through 30+ minute treks to AQ like absolute suckers, you can be there in 5 minutes.
---
Make sure to also equip your parachute cloak though
---
You have to have a mount I think. At least that's how I did it. If I can remember it right you jump from the mailbox.
---
This is top notch guild with good players... If I didn't find them before hand the experience would be much worse in my opinion.  This guild will be raiding within 1 month.  They only wanted me for raiding after I showed them my vanilla character...
---
If you‚Äôre having trouble tanking, rather than respeccing, try waiting until you‚Äôre 1-2 levels ahead of the recommended dungeon level.  It makes a world of difference.

Doy you have many folders? I recal having classic and retail but I have both installed. If you have classic only - there may be no dropdown

Decided to give my paladin another go. I'll give healing a shot and see if I like it. If not I'm making a hunter
---
Has anyone noticed mass amounts of "huntard's"? Seemingly every dungeon the hunter forgot ammo or is wrestling with their pet controls like a crisco greased mongoose.
---
I'd agree if the game had been out longer than a few days. People haven't sunk enough time into thwir characters for it to be unreasonable to make a new one for better queue times.
---
You. Sir!
---
YOU ARE SO RIGHT!
---
I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs going on. On our German servers, people are so nice and friendly. Helpline each other all the time, talking about their good old times 15 years ago when they left school, talking about their own families today, how life changed, what they think about classic. It seems most of them are in their mid 30-40s. That‚Äôs not an average WoW age. Are they all just blaming me?? They even told me, that they are NOT INTERESTED TO SPEED LEVEL! They wanna make it slow and patient. 
---
WHAT IS THIS SHIT? People are polite, unstressed and helpful. I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm on some trolling fake server and on the next step they are trying to sell gold to me. Or are they all just bots?
---
IT CANT BE RIGHT. IT JUST DOESNT FEEL RIGHT.

#NotMyWoWCommunity
---
There was always a group that envied the time and commitment other players could put towards leveling and gearing and whined about it incessantly. I honestly think Blizzard responded to that group of people because they legitimately thought that making the game easier would draw in more players and gain them more subscriptions. You could argue that turned out to be true, but I think the popularity of WoW in the beginning was so strong from the vocal majority of early adopters repping the game to their friends and spreading the word all over the internet that *really* gained WoW its popularity and subscriber numbers.
---
It's probably the best weapon for rogues for that level. It requires level 19 which is the perfect level for twinking (having a lvl 19 character with the best gear for that level) since the first battlegrounds are level 10-19. It is a Bind on Equip item so it can be sold on the auction house.
---
Look in the classic forums in [battle.net](https://battle.net). Guilds recruit there.
---
Shut up and keep playing, it's classic. You better accept this and move on.
---
Why exactly? They're not goldsellers. Just some dude playing multiple characters.
---
I thought we were talking about r/wow not r/ffxiv
---
Does the add-on work!!!!??!
---
That stuff frustrates me. Instead of blizzard just fixing the bug they go out and punish creative people for finding workarounds.
---
So wholesome
---
Get some perspective.
---
I hope they keep it in. I remember finding someone else in high school that played WoW. His name was Matt and he was much more knowledgeable and higher leveled then I was. One day he showed me around all of the little secrets and cool things around Stormwind, with this glitch being the finale. It blew my mind. I can vividly remember that day exploring stormwind better then most days. Matt passed away a few years ago to a brain aneurism but I guarentee he would of loved to jump back into classic and relive moments like this one.
---
The first time I ever played WoW was about midway through Burning Crusade. I had a blast with that and Wrath of the Lich King. But lost interest in Cataclysm with a lot of the changes that were made. It was mostly the Dungeon Finder to be honest. It ended up making the guild and the leveling process feel less connected. I don't know, it just wasn't that fun. My main regret was that I never got to play during vanilla. Also, I totally rushed the leveling process and was forever behind on professions and gold because I started raiding almost immediately and just never really got to experience a lot of the game. 
---
This time I am taking my time. Leveling all my professions as I go, mostly doing the quests I find interesting and then just grinding for mats and fishing and stuff. I've always been pretty bad at questing so I level kinda slowly. Only level 18 right now. But I am just having a blast. The community is great. It's incredible (also sometimes frustrating) to see the lower level zones so alive. The people I run into seem really into the game and an incredible community seemed to form instantly to band together and handle the harder content ( even just the regular questing content can be pretty brutal. It has been a while since I played a game where pulling two mobs your level meant you are probably going to die). I don't know. I'm having a blast. I think more players might stick around than people are anticipating because you're just constantly getting invited to groups and playing with other people and most mmos these days don't have that level of community at all. Plus the game is fantastic. The graphics might be dated but the WoW art style is timeless and their design is just so damned epic. I signed up like "well, I'll check it out and try playing for a month or whatever" and I am just goddamned hooked all over again.
---
Its a song XD
---
&gt;	World of HowsTheWeathercraft
---
Take your damn upvote
---
Biggest issue I run in to is others pulling, or blowing up mobs immediately before I have any rage or threat generated and I spend the whole time just trying to get aggro back. This isn't retail people! Give me a few seconds before you start going crazy on the DPS
---
I joined Ashbringer when it was new, 1 hour later I got afk disconnected and it had a queue.
---
We used triangle for roots and moon for sheep cc.
---
I forgot how "exploration" was a thing in vanilla.
---
What's wrong with yang though?
---
This is good
---
yeah....but your miss chance is the same...and wands don't cost mana that you can use to heal yourself from the extra damage you're taking from increased crit-chance and potentially crushing blows.
---
The last quest in the chain is a WC kill all bosses quest. I had originally skipped it too, but found out any oasis has the mushrooms, and the stagnant oasis was a lot less crowded so I took the quest again and did it there. The final quest was a sword upgrade for my rogue so it was worth it for me
---
That's the fuckin point glansberg

Is this game $60 + $15 a month or just $15 a month?

The servers will never die. There's too many players and too few servers. Just because it isn't full 24/7 doesn't make it dead.

LindyBeige would be proud mate

Classic is just 15$/month
---
I look at racials as a way to possibly compensate some shortcomings the class may have. Not a huge deal, but the right combo can open up some new possibilities for your plays.

I like if I ding or get to a new area that it's time to stretch, get a drink or something to snack on :)

Yeah I ended up joining a PvE server because I just want to be able to go wherever and enjoy the game without dealing with getting ganked. WoW PvP has never been my favorite anyway.
---
Its gay
---
Eh... What? Level 60s will be there, I mean... Twinks are like ants outside of BGs.
---
Even someone born the day Wrath came out is no longer a baby.
---
Nah u need to git gud aye
---
Hey what server are you on? My group and I played hardcore in Vanilla to MoP. We have absolutely no problem helping new folks like you learn about Classic while reminisce over the old days and act like we‚Äôre teenagers again. 
---
We love to help and group with people, even if it‚Äôs just for a single stubborn quest or helping out in dungeons/helping learn dungeons.
---
I can‚Äôt say I blame them.
---
If you notice someone using it on you when they shouldn't then just tell them. I've never had any problems after that point.
---
I'm dead every 5-10 minuts -.-
---
Hey man I'm about to land in Seoul.  Did you have any luck?
---
Old Blanchy? Or is it everywhere lol
---
That weapon is best in slot for level 19 rogues who want to stay at that level and just run BG's (often referred to as twinks). As such, it's worth a fair amount of money on the Auction House once BG's come out.
---
Universe of Starcraft, not just a world, jeez. 3 factions starting on their own planets then meeting in pvp systems full of different planets.
---
&gt; Even though they said for weeks people needed to spread out due to queues.
---
After the initial announcement of realms, ie 3 US East PvP servers (Faerlina, Thalnos, and Herod) the next server opened was Stalagg.
---
Stalagg was opened 10 days before the servers opened in the US. 
---
https://www.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=255835&amp;region=us
---
You say Blizzard said for weeks that people needed to change servers to avoid queues. Why are you deliberately misrepresenting events that occurred less than 2 weeks ago? Are you a compulsive liar, or do you just feel an inherent need to rise to the defense of your favorite entities, regardless of what it means about your integrity?
---
Weeks.
---
Awesome, thanks. When I was growing up I couldn‚Äôt afford to play. Now I can afford it but am afraid I won‚Äôt enjoy it as much having never played. Is this game just nostalgia or is it actually a good game on its own?
---
In before he cleaves Arthas in half there and ends the expansion
---
Andross won the (if I remember right, a 2handed axe). On the damage meter he appears to be a warrior. Could you explain how he is the healer??
---
But the pattern is mostly identical.
---
I love lore like this. Makes the world feel alive and real.
---
Make a priest friend.  Makes life much better.  Not perfect, but better.
---
You join a guild like that and expect them to be goofing off exploring dungeons that are far away etc? Your injuries are self inflicted.
---
In the same boat. My gf is definitely a gamer and played lots of diablo 3 with me. I'm sure I can convince her! You gotta taunt them with the prospect of being a hunter who gets a pet.
---
well all that work ties you to that and that is normal. classic will take off some retail players, which is why you are here and probably down voting everything to oblivion, well retail made me stop playing wow.
---
so i stopped playing wow because you can continue in the past. now, i can play. how about that.
---
OH
---
What do you do with a bagging tailor?
---
What do you do with a bagging tailor earlie in the mornin!
---
Helicopters were in Warcraft 3.
---
Technically exacerbates the queue line issues on large servers.
---
You mean thouse 4 on main road of barrens?
---
People should just enjoy the game whatever way they want. I suck at questing so if I made it about just getting to 60 fast I would be miserable and still behind. But some people are super fast and that's how they like to play and that's cool. I'll have all my professions leveled and sell them shit.
---
Which comes to think of it when did they get rid of pws rage starving tanks as a mechanic?
---
"Oh legionnaire....ohhhh...." 
---
And just fill in the rest!
---
No, the platform gets smaller as the fight progresses. While you are correct that bombs were a staple, the reformation of platforms was not, so they exploited a bug to gain a massive advantage in that fight.
---
Yeah, I've been bubbling low level (~10) to reduce my heal agro but hadn't thought about its affect on rage.
---
Serious answer, now you're overthinking it even more than I am.
---
Personally ..I think your guild was just unfun
---
I'm having a blast by completely exploring everything.
---
There are plenty of players playing classic for the first time and the exploration and finding things out just by trial and error is REAL. I haven't used a guide, the most I've done is ask general chat for location on things I found difficult. I dunno man, maybe you went in overprepared with a circle of guildies wanting to also be overprepared and it ended up biting you in the romp
---
Just be sure to log out in an inn! Rested XP makes a difference especially during the last 20 levels.
---
If the item is needed by someone then they should roll need on it. If they want to be greedy and use it for gold then they should roll greed. That's why the buttons were implemented. I'm not a fan of BOE everyone rolling greed.
---
If you want power, friends, and women, play tank or healer. I was trolled in a dungeon, but i was tank, he was dps. gg no re kick
---
Or my 50s on a cockroach. Only sells back for 8 :(
---
Holy fuck... I was expecting an enlightening read but but I get to the second point (paragraph in) and all I gather is he's upset over people just in general trying to be nice?   
---
Granted, not everyone wants to be spammed with invites, but dang, kind of nice when you're all out trying to farm mobs around an area where four Gnolls could be pulled at once and not only that, but the shared exp and not having mobs taken or swiped away. But honestly, if you don't want the invite, or the buff? Just decline or take it off, lel.  
---
But post... WooooooooooW. (Pun intended.) I guess 15 years can't erase Elitest behavior.

---
It can be rather significant in PvP. I really don‚Äôt think it makes that huge of a difference in pve. For hunters warstomp can be pretty good. It just sucks because the orc racial is basically so catered to the hunter it‚Äôs hard to resist. Axe skill, pet damage, attack power steroid, and the absolutely broken hardiness.
---
Yeah I did it's fairly easy. Machines are in Korean though. You just indicate how many hours you want to play. Put cash or your card in the machine. You'll get a number you can login with and you'll be able to play on any PC in the room.
---
For wow classic you need to download the English language pack via the blizz app settings
---
Go in and try and if you have to, use a vpn.
---
https://youtu.be/_wTcYVbo0eE
---
This is something I just witnessed. Yea it's not automated, but goddamn 4 characters all wearing identical gear on an RP server attacking the enemy just... damn it doesn't feel right.
---
That is a more pragmatic perspective than what anyone else has given me.
---
I had a really good gun drop in RFC the other night and then realized before I could even use it I would have to travel all the way down to thunderbluff on foot, then fork out 10s for training and then on top of that fork our for a pouch and bullets. Was so worth the adventure though.
---
Lol!
---
It's the most valuable to rogues. It still has agi, and rogues still benefit from strength.
---
Holy shit, this is perfect.  I found this sub just because I was playing and thinking about how I and others just buff random players, group up if it's obvious we're going for the same things (and actually stick around to help if one of us finish first), etc.  I've given gear to people in my groups, simply because I knew it would be useful to them where I would just end up selling it to a vendor.  I've already got one person on my friends list from just grouping up and getting along well.  Trolls seem to be fewer and far between...likely because the game takes work and that scares them off.  This whole thing feels good.  It's like coming home after a long vacation.
---
Just signed up and got on sulfuras, picked a pvp server at random. Tired tho so only played for the first few quests. I don't have the super fond memories of classic, played a little but really not until TBC. Hope I don't get burned out quickly, looking to have fun. Rolled a rogue so I can play ganking asshole.
---
Wake on LAN?
---
It was almost a mill the other day
---
Too late to explore the world
---
Too early to explore the cosmos
---
Just in time to bindg Classic WoW
---
Not to mention they‚Äôll out dps the whole party through lvl 40 dungeons
---
I mean you're not supposed to be in stealth 100% of the time. That's why there's a movement speed penalty. It's to open fights or move through enemies you want to avoid.
---
The worst part of this is I think the class balance made the specs less balanced over time. As a survival hunter in TBC, I knew that I wasn't going to be able to pull the numbers of the BM hunters in the raid, but it was ok because I could CC multiple targets, pull with misdirect, and buff other damage dealers in a unique way with EW. 
---
Shamans might not have been as good at healing as priests or as good at damage as mages or rogues, but they had unique buffs so they were worth it to bring.
---
Then wrath hit and all the class buffs got homogenized, the game became an AoEfest with no strategy, and there was no point in bringing a shaman when a mage could cast Bloodlust and do 2 more DPS
---
Oh the places you will go, oh the friends you will make along the way. 
---
Vanilla/Classic was all about community. There was no cross server anything (until cross server bg‚Äôs were released). You relied on the people of your server. If someone ninja‚Äôd loot or was an absolute asshole of the worst kind, the entire server knew about it. They‚Äôd be put on KoS lists, they‚Äôd be blacklisted from every guild. It wasn‚Äôt every man for himself, it was and is one for all and all for one.
---
&gt; Masque to skin Bartender,
---
What skin are you currently using?
---
??? Vanilla itemization is weird, just because it has strength on it doesnt mean its not a good rogue item. Strength modifies every classes melee attack power in vanilla iirc. Rogues still get more value out of agil, but strength isnt bad for them to have either. Especially considering it has agility and strength
---
Amazing!
---
Also, for example, a bear that was easy to kill at 111 is not as easy to kill at 120.  The same bear.
---
Not sure we can assume it won‚Äôt grow. I think it will actually. Hope so.
---
Im a baaaaagggggg guy. Da
---
*music starts*
---
Which made no sense btw. You fought off the Burning fucking Legion, banished Sargeras, obtained this amazing artifact weapon, succeeded in all theses crazy heroic feats....only to get absolutely fucked at 111 by some stupid witch or quillboar.
---
I was aware of this, but unsure if it is the same case with druid tanks in bear form?
---
there was this circlejerk post hitting frontpage of classic wow about "how classic made me realize how bad bfa is".
---
Someone posted the opposite to /r/wow about "how bfa made me realize how bad classic is"
---
that post got removed because posts which are just made to trigger people are not allowed there. 
---
I kinda wish that classicwow would go by that rule as well. because so many top posts are basically "CLASSIC GOOD BFA BAD"
---
Getting corpse camped is not fun at all and frustrating as hell but it‚Äôs PvP and it is the nature of the beast.
---
I'm sorry is this  r/racismisfunny ?
---
PVP servers a a fucking blast. Especially in Vanilla. There are constant curve balls through your ‚Äújourney‚Äù that are unscripted and awesome. Also in vanilla there is no cross realm BGs and pvp so if you pvp enough you will start recognizing horde names and that is a whole new element. It‚Äôs fun. 
---
Yes you will die considerably more but that is part of the fun.
---
Wrath I believe, first time I remember seeing them in raid at least.
---
Power infusion on arcane mages was fucking sick.
---
You have to learn weapon skills from weapon skill trainers. Hunters can use every weapon excluding all maces and wands
---
My dad's a priest. Unfortunately he doesn't have as much time to play as me. However once he gets high enough level to do deadmines I'll be way over leveled and can tank for him which will speed up the leveling process for him.
---
Filthy horde scum
---
gratz! üòä

THIS. I was just thinking about this today and how fractured the storyline is in modern WoW. It‚Äôs the MAIN reason I can‚Äôt pick up retail anymore because I genuinely like leveling, but retail has made it a nightmare. I don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt just do another cataclysm (I can hear retail fanboys groaning) but honestly; there‚Äôs no way to fix retail without doing a blank slate. It‚Äôs the MAIN problem of the game.
---
Get your steps while you‚Äôre in the queue!
---
No
---
Sorry to bother but maybe you can help, I wanted to ask the same question for the offhand antipodean rod. There's a few quite cheap on my server at the moment and wondered if they'ed get higher
---
If you liked housos check out swift and shift couriers as well as fat pizza.

---
You should have seen the first guild I joined, I bounced after I found out they were true HC during the stress test.  Those players wanted to be raiding in 2 weeks... This was only semi HC... You'd think some could grow an imagination and actually want to experience content.  But I guess they needed guides to tell them where to go next.  Experienced players and Guides are a massive contradiction in my opinion.
---
No, you can't. You have to buy game time to be able to play.
---
I'll have you know i had a full quiver and more to start my DM run, and my pet taunt is married and bound to 3, so it was able to tank when we pulled extra mobs.
---
get a blue weapon fren. life is good.
---
Happy birthday you old fuck
---
How were people getting in during the stress test?
---
LMAO nah
---
You say that like its a good thing... Play with casuals, take ur time. Its the way to go
---
If they decided to grow it, I would never go back to retail
---
Look, I'm 34 and I spent 2004 - 2009 playing WoW and you gotta not post stuff like this because I don't have the time required to properly play Classic WoW.
---
It would be cool if after blizzard would use an alternative narrative story to deploy expansions but keeping the classic mind. Hardcore 40 man raids. An alternative World of warcraft without the bad decisions that led it to bfa.

Good luck üòÉ

That would be my dream. New adventures with the same classic style and community
---
This is the reason I play healer. To enable others to feel great. 
---
Raiding and Dungeness dont really give you that feeling. But I've been handing out bags and food and heals all day and it feels good.
---
so when i summon you, you still think this is funny? All you people mocking our mighty underwater breathing shame on you :( 
---
Atleast we try!
---
Imperfections provide the realism that sustains the players. The more perfect the game tries to be the more it implodes in the human mind like the original Matrix.
---
No you dont. You just need an active subscription.
---
It‚Äôs been 4 days and people already complaining about it being classic
---
Isn't wanding (at least with a good wand) just better dps than smite?
---
Got my greater wand for a mere 9s thanks to this
---
I started a thread the other day asking if people would be into WoW 2 or a reboot and it was not well received. I feel like the lore is getting to a really weird place though, and I think that for new players it‚Äôs a bit hard to follow. I‚Äôm not sure what the right answer is.
---
Warlock buff would be more impressive irl than any of the other ones tbh
---
You joke but I'm friends with someone who wont pug in classic  until they release a "raider.io for classic" his reasoning is since classic is so much harder then retail he will only want to group with the best in these ultra hardcore dungeons and raids
---
You're destroying my warriors classic experience, jerk.
---
For most fights that require resistances they can be a definite boon. Also, the four horseman would have been a ton easier with Druid tanks having been discovered with spell hit meaning you didn‚Äôt need 8 geared warriors
---
It worked until now for me, but nice to read that there is a capable alternative, thx ^_^
---
I'm so proud of this community
---
Technically, when you use a higher rank buff on a low level player, it uses the appropriate version of the buff for their level.
---
This! Thank you so much! I didn;t know weeapon trainers had specific weapons to teach. Thank you!
---
Naw it was called VC when I played in beta/launch
---
I mean... Issue for druids too. The only real tanks use rage xD
---
I think this makes sense. It's really between if you think it's a high valued item then need, otherwise greed. I like the idea of having first rights to gear if you are in the group, but that's what BoP is. I'd definitely want to communicate to the group what the intent is though to clear confusion.
---
This can be a little tricky. As you are leveling up, you will be able to buy new tomes to increase your pets abilities or give them new ones. One problem is that, if you have your imp out and look at the tomes for sale, it will inform you that you have purchased that tome already. If, however, you have your voidwalker out, it will look like you haven't purchased that imp tome even though you may have. If you look online you can learn about the different abilities that you demons have and what levels they learn them at. Some are more important than others, so if you don't want to spend the money, take a look at what demons you will use and what abilities you will need. In the end, you will probably end up getting them all, so don't worry if you get them and don't use them.
---
:( MFW I switched to horde and they don't ever run DM. Feels bad, man.
---
Same. I had sound turned off so I could listen to music and was talking to friends on discord as well so didn't notice myself drowning.
---
OR you staged this photo years ago patiently waiting for the day you could post it. Hmmmmm
---
Lol, they could stop and start on the new server when it opened.
---
As a mage I didn't know that. So thanks for the advice.
---
Great additions! That's for that, sad that because this post isn't a funny meme that it's not picking up more traction on this subreddit lol

I honestly hope they learn from this mistake (albeit it was a very easy mistake to let run for so long). Make Classic+ a world that continues along the same timeline, add smaller content more often so as not to break the world. Probably a lot harder than it seems to be honest.
---
You ‚Äògave‚Äô him the sword?! So it‚Äôs contagious! That‚Äôs it! I‚Äôm not touching classic again until Blizzard releases some sort of lose-your-elitism-protection in the ingame shop!

I‚Äôve played since BC and I‚Äôm more exploring than rushing through. Find folks who enjoy the game as you do. I like a mostly solo experience with the odd group or dungeon so none of what you describe affects my enjoyment. But the game isnt for everyone obviously. It does sound to me as if you are letting how others play the game detract from your game own enjoyment. You might benefit from finding a way to disconnect those two.
---
Never underestimate Hogger

This is an ignorant and blatantly false claim. Any business conducted in a country, in this case the United States, must adhere to the laws of the country. As such, Joana's guides/intellectual property are subject to the protection of the law. US law clearly states that piracy is a felony. It doesn't matter if you are in Switzerland or Spain or wherever, you are still guilty of a crime.
---
Further, piracy is certainly not a victimless crime. The person pirating is stealing money from the person/company the property belongs to. Just because they can replicate their software *easier* than, for example, a car can be replicated, doesn't mean it is free. There are costs involved in hosting servers for the software to persist in. Costs are involved with maintaining a bandwidth suitable for people to download the software.  Maybe your understanding of "the cloud" is limited, or very confused, but the data isn't magicked out of thin air.
---
Further, several of your examples of countries where it is legal to pirate is very misleading. Mexico, for example, doesn't have any laws stating that it is legal or illegal. Spain and the Netherlands have restrictions on what you can download legally. More than anything, pirating in those three countries is overlooked, rather than legalized. Really the only example in your favor is Switzerland. One country. On the other hand there are no less than 10 countries that I could name where pirating is strictly illegal.

Leatrix. It's a QoL addon. Does things like auto complete quests, auto block duels/invites, let's you just play whatever game music you want, etc.
---
Actually with things like axe and sword wounds in many cases wound packing would be more effective. Deadly bleeds can rarely be stopped by direct pressure over the wound and jamming the bandages inside is a very old technique
---
I used to own this! Lolll
---
I think so but from what I've heard people who dc'd ended up in a queue.
---
Head on. Apply directly to the forehead.
---
Retail is made to extract maximum dollar amounts out of people based on focus groups. It isn't a cohesive idea and a labor of love made by a group of dedicated and passionate people who are doing it because they love it. It's all corporate politics and hype but no substance.
---
This happened to me too. Was just about to post about it. Got the quest from the Marshall and then it just disappeared. Not in my quest log and no idea what to do :(
---
stay strong brother, mortal strike and whirlwind will make it all worth it.

I believe Questie Classic has granular settings to turn off mob locations and leave quest givers.

Spot on. But this time I know he brought me smokes.
---
I felt the exact same way as you. Questie let's you do this. You can change a lot of aspects of it. I turned off everything except being able to see !'s and ?'s on my mini-map, since I've basically found it but my bad eyesight might miss the low texture ! above NPCs. I felt this didn't disrupt the Classic experience much at all, but I turned off literally everything else. With everything on it acts like questing in live, more or less.
---
You said the person pirating is stealing money. 
---
Before and after Joanas guide is pirated, he has the same amount of money. What money was stolen?
---
I dont need to replace it, its still on my shelf!
---
There are multiple contributing factors. 
---
* Auto-grouping completely removes the social interaction barrier from dungeons. Before it, if you wanted to do a dungeon, you had to initiate a dialogue with other players. This helped to break the ice in the group.
---
*easier dungeons that don't require any kind of coordination of CC and proper kill order. Just run on in and aoe everything down. This again reduces the need for interaction between players,  which makes other players seem less like players and more like AI companions.
---
* Cross server grouping means you will likely never see these people again, so what does it matter if you act like a dick the entire time. Besides, if people leave it's fine. The LFG tool will provide another mindless servant to help you complete your dungeon.
---
Cross realm grouping and the LFG tool removed the "MMO" part of MMORPG from WoW. As someone who played before and after it was introduced, the culture shift those two ushered in was absolutely massive.
---
you win this time...
---
Can‚Äôt wait to kill ya! Lol have fun friend. Enjoy
---
Questie is perfectly fine. Classic Codex will make your map look like a game of Risk

When you know the games not going to move forward with expansions and it's not a race against the clock, you tend to slow down and enjoy the little things.

---
It's the same with Druid. The only tank safe to PWS is Paladin.
---
I think that's ideal, but I think it's also fair on a high value item that each player has an option to back down and let someone else have it. Need being default then Greed if someone asks for it. That will also help prevent ninja looters (mostly).
---
I can't believe there's someone else out there doing the same thing as I'm doing with my mage.

Goddamn people are so anal abaout clicking spells. Sometimes you just can't bind every single key on your keyboard to a specific spell. I clicked spells on occasion while progression raiding. Time to pop your CD's? Click. Need to pop a lock rock. Clique. Need to throw a Levitate onto someone who failed the elevator boss? Clique. Really guys, it's fine. Just don't click your main rotation and important reactive abilities.
---
Same level im at right now
---
50
---
I really thought this was going to be a huge rant or something.
---
Me too, along with BC, Wrath, and Cata haha. MoP started the new ‚Äúyou could only download from internet‚Äù bullshit.
---
Dont worry the casuals will go away in a few weeks, see u at 60, atm 29
---
That might actually be it. Thanks for sharing!
---
why make a spreadsheet if its not going to get updated? add more people to update it

I believe it's because it's new and they want that new launch money. After a few months or a year at most, they might open it to starter account with lots of restrictions. Also the cap would probably be 10, as 20 is a decent chunk of gameplay. If you're really interested, maybe send a ticket and ask if you could get a free 2 days to try Classic. It might work.
---
The economy's depth really only develops once a big wave of people hit 60 and are willing to finance maxing professions to 300, creating and collecting everything related to consumes and raid, etc.     
---
During this pre-60 age, basically everything is extremely low priced. Even 50g for a random decent epic is a travesty, populous servers could inflate that price to hundreds once people hit 60.
---
What unit frames addon is that? I currently use Elvui's built-in but its hot garbage
---
Sometimes it's a, "Better you than me," situation.
---
EPEENFLEX I got this last night on my 18 warrior! It took something like 4hours of wiping but well worth it. 
---
It was the same as 15 years ago: Lots of wiping, lots of fun and bit frustration at the end but WE MADE IT!
---
HOLY SHIT IM 1 SHOTTING THESE MOBS NOW
---
Did this on accident on my druid tonight, right as a warrior charged. Got a "@#%$ing kys" as a response.
---
So you want to be able to pan the camera with left click instead?
---
Hey I'm on whitemane,! :) Also I play mostly from 7am-4pm eat  and there's no queue. What time are you logging on?
---
Jesus, slow down or you may miss it
---
No one ever believes me when I tell them this was a thing!
---
There's also the problem of the raid having 2 "actual" difficulties before the real raid (mythic difficulty).
---
39 is super far behind
---
Paladins who don't have concentration shouldn't tank even DM. Source: my first DM run of classic
---
I'm 23. Hoping for mid 30s but it's going really slow right now
---
I can always make an alt if I want to level, I can't just make a level 60 you gotta grind for that shit.
---
We warlocks give summons, healthstones and soulstones so we are more useful than in seems
---
This looks like SUCH a blast
---
You‚Äôre wrong. I‚Äôm using it at the moment. 
---
On will it Classic [Bagnon](https://willitclassic.com/view/uVGNoRfFwB0Y2v6TYKt3)  is updated as well.
---
Wait a minute...
---
You don't need a script. A simple macro can be used to mark a target.
---
/tm 8
---
This will mark with a 'Skull'.
---
1 = Star 
---
2 = Circle 
---
3 = Diamond 
---
4 = Triangle 
---
5 = Moon 
---
6 = Square 
---
7 = Cross

8 = Skull
---
YEAH BFA IS SHIT
---
Silverpine forest is at least as atmospheric IMO. :)
---
ME KILL YOU! YOU MAKE ME NOT UNREMEMBER HEAD ON!
---
As a Mage I do this because I was getting tired of Warriors and *shudders* ^hunters not knowing what an outhouse is.
---
yeah, i get buffs all the time, especially AI. mages this time around are nifty. otherwise i had the opposite expierience, so im surprised.

Not classic!   But awesome :)

I'm part of the problem. Been giving away potions to strangers all day.
---
I bandaided a mage while he was getting dicked on trying to aoe farm and I only got a few ticks off.
---
If you're out there, sorry if I screwed you Josh.
---
I wasn't going to do wow classic as I played the original 15 years ago. My friends wanted to try it as they started in lich king. So I joined. I feel renewed playing wow classic. I don't even call it wow classic anymore. It's just wow now. It's what wow should be. Every day I forget a little more the shitshow that is wow retail. It's almost a long lost memory. This is wow now.
---
Very cool! Hopefully we find more as time goes on üôÇ
---
Don't level prot. I'd recommend arms for leveling, it has some decent abilities that synergize with tanking
---
Make bad man body cry more than your body cry.
---
Was exhausting hosting, but the dust is starting to settle. Sleeeeep...!
---
Or ya know, they took some hard earned PTO to play a game they love? Y‚Äôall swear like it‚Äôs impossible to have some free time as an adult.
---
All I can say is you come across incredibly self absorbed, entitled, egotistic, rude, and oh man the list could go on. Basically, you seem like a jerk and I hope you're not playing on Arugal. The community you've described sounds really helpful and seriously, how hard is it to politely say thanks, but no thanks. Quit your negative bitchin and play the game. Geez.
---
Isn't the game like a 2gig download?
---
Hey thanks for the kind words! &lt;3
---
I've seen first hand what effect witch hunts, harassment and doxing can have on a person. It's not pretty. I wouldn't wish it on anyone and we certainly don't want to give that sort of crap a springboard here.
---
Because people grew up, they got jobs now and everything. Wait for the proper time of day or play on a server more appropriate to your timezone.
---
On that note while while you won't get excited for a gray. If it rolls right you will for a green.
---
&gt;jesus christ, I need to get 8 murloc fins and these little blue dudes are fucking me up
---
Dont worry, I have the perfect solution for you:
---
&gt;I quite like the fact that I have to quest with other people to actually complete said quests
---
Steve Warrior here with new shiney. The iMage. For your smarter warrior.
---
No but I can walk up to you and call you a dickhead in game because they same reprocussioms don't apply in a fantasy world as it does in real life.
---
Go to RP if you don't want your feelings to be hurt.
---
Same! My friends are worried it's gonna be a dead server though because it's not full..
---
&gt; t would be pretty easy for bliz to establish whether or not you were using those.
---
[it wouldn't](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cwbsre/turn_off_your_afk_auto_clicker_please_thanks/eyaja7c/)
---
Better than knowing your name is not being used. I haven't seen online the bastard who took my name yet.
---
Holy shit I never knew about this guy. Just watched the ecto cooler video and oh my fucking god
---
I think it takes a certain kind of person to thrive in sales. Many of us are not cut out for that at all.
---
I can level from 55-56 in 3 hours but I‚Äôm a pretty good leveler
---
Ya got to 10 on Whitemane then had to re-roll
---
Yea, but one bag at the time. 
---
Owell,  it's ok. I got some coins waiting for me when I get home from work :)!!
---
No that‚Äôs the ancient version of hellfire peninsula.
---
Probably level 10, but I'll do it three different times across three different servers
---
As a fellow mage, you have your bars set up weird.
---
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember how long it took‚Äù
---
That phrase doesn‚Äôt exist in retail.
---
This is why we love classic WoW.
---
I worried about this over the last few days too, but it‚Äôs just life, i remember a lot of the same behaviour from 13 yrs ago when I started. It doesn‚Äôt feel obnoxious yet to me. There are plenty of people calling those people out and that‚Äôs all the policing we need.
---
&gt;complains about having to get two factions to revered for flying.
---
Boy so I have bad news for you. Ever hear of attunements?
---
Also this but opposite. So where do i enable chat bubbles in tukui?
---
It won't matter much at the lower levels.
---
Just spec for leveling and throw on a shield as needed.
---
What bar addon is that?
---
Great job OP, don't worry about the retail mythic+ dungeon boy salt in here, they're too busy telling people how to play they forgot its about having fun and adventuring your way.
---
Nice, only one thing missing. The 45 pound, 3 foot deep, 800x600 CRT monitor. That's when the nostalgia hits!
---
Couldn't figure out why everyone was mad at faerie fire :(
---
i believe that classic has enough content to sustain me for years. once im out of end game content i can just start leveling alts until the day i die.
---
My first time. I can't get off I can't sleep work hours feel 3x as long. I'm HOOKED.
---
Am almost through 11. I‚Äôll be happy with whatever level comes up as long as I‚Äôm having fun.
---
Rage inside you all along. Mean man stab it out of us.
---
I was rollin with a friend doing quests together and every 10 minutes or so, I'd run off the beaten path to pick some flowers. I hope your regular life is like this.
---
Im currently using one, but I'm not home righit now. If bx this evening you haven't gotten an answer, shoot me a dm and look it up for you.
---
I thought there was, at some point, certain areas of the water that were not fatigued which could only be reached by water walking?
---
And he's never going to play them here. There aren't nearly as many good reasons to multibox on Classic than retail.
---
I came from Horde and this quest fucked me, was looking for a human for a good 20 mins lmfao
---
we group up, because content is hard, it is not all by design, some of if comes from the inexperience of blizzard in 2004, too tight groups, quick respawns with low drop rates, you get trapped inside mines, you pull mobs around corners you can't see.
---
people group together, because this shit ain't easy. that's what ''game does not cater to you'' means.
---
thanks for the insult.
---
Even with account sharing with his brother he still probably wouldn‚Äôt win. The people behind him gave up for world first because you can‚Äôt beat an uninterrupted mage AoE farming 24/7
---
You make body stop crying? *bear hugs* Me not ever ever ever letting go!
---
Nope exact the opposite. I‚Äôm sad that they will eventually touch the Classic and ruin the game again
---
That's... no.
---
 This is ridiculous! Ahahahahah I love it!! &lt;3
---
Eh...
---
The amount of people I have ressed, healed when about to die, or saved from the train they created, just to get nothing in response is starting to annoy me. I actually called out a bunch of people on General chat, after my warrior friend and I saved someone from about 8 mobs he pulled. Bastard just ran off and left us to it, we nearly died! It's not like it was a subtle save either.
---
To their credit a few did 'semi' apologise on general without me at mentioning names, saying its taking people time to adjust to not being in BfA. It's a little annoying though when I am having to chug the very few mana pots I have to save your arse and not so much as an emote /thanks
---
Man the amount of times I got done by the Son of Arugal in Silverpine last night...
---
What do you mean by mob stealers? Do you expect someone to not do his quest in order for you to do it?
---
This spot i dont know, but the way into mulgore at camp t is also a pretty nifty spot to do it
---
Since launch, I have had normal 8h workdays every day, I have made it to lvl 25 so far. Oh, and I have slept a grand total of a bit less than 11 hours and I'm working overtime on Saturday. I might die of sleep deprivation at this rate, but at least I'll get to see where my IRL Spirit Healer is.... Wait..
---
This is just straight up adorable behaviour.
---
Why not me poop in corner. It clean!!!
---
And you know they're spamming LF tank because they've whispered every single warrior on the server that is around the level range of the dungeon.
---
Task manager should show the culprit. Web browsers chew up a lot of memory, do you a million tabs open?
---
Happened to me in Tiristfal glades today. First death too. :(
---
"The market" of seriously skewed prices because nobody has much money to spare and everyone is saving up for their mount, lmao.
---
I remember 100-200g on mine, not quite 800 though
---
i usually invite people bc i want to get credit for the mob they're killing
---
He's being sarcastic
---
He's got plenty of people below that on the list.
---
Ubisoft's been starting to do that in recent games, Like in Odyssey, it's got a "Guided Mode" which is the standard map marker stuff, or Exploration mode, which instead, the characters just give you directions to figure out.
---
If there was then it was in a super early patch. That shit is in far as fuck bumblefuck way off the north west coast of teldrassil. I forgot what the hack was exactly to get there but people would randomly be in a capital city looking like they were walking on thin air but they couldn‚Äôt see or interact with anyone. And then they would seemingly vanish and when you /who them they were on GM island.
---
Lok'tar, brother.
---
This is the correct answer. Did it about an hour ago and had to wait 5 mins or so for him to spawn
---
I‚Äôm glad to be stuck. Naxx will be a good tier to be stuck in.
---
Oh they should‚Äôve tried being funny then...
---
I should shower soon. Is launch over?
---
&gt;good reasons
---
the only reason is fun
---
Horde
---
Definitely a valid fear
---
Probably hit 20. I hit 16 in two days and told myself to slow down and enjoy it.  
---
So got my fishing leveled up. Got my cooking leveled up. Grabbed some recipes and explored a bit.
---
Yes
---
&gt;It‚Äôs wild how many people are in these starting zones it makes the world feel so alive.
---
That's not a classic wow thing.  That's just a launch day thing.  In a couple weeks those starting zones will be just as sparse as the retail ones are. It's the exact same thing with each expansion launch.
---
Kk. Thx dude. Blizzard just made the servers much bigger so the problem is fixed now.
---
I only cared in battlegrounds where you give away your surprise by going stealth at the edge of range. Otherwise I'd hop in to stealth just for an opener or to sneak by something. BGs it can be tedious to hang and wait, but that's the drawback of always getting first strike.
---
(I'm just an alt rogue though so my exp is limited)
---
Same with my spouse and I! We are at 12 years and 5 kids later..  But WoW is still our favorite activity together.
---
Don't have much to say other than roll Benediction if you're sick of queues.
---
Moved from Skeram and haven't looked back. Low in early morning and high without queues during peak hours. Seems like a winner and the entire guild is happy.
---
it is.
---
Incredible, I‚Äôm waiting on my next pay but very happy to wait since queues are so long anyway (id be struggling to not buy it now if not haha) Should hopefully be fixed in a week and so should my fix haha
---
Great! Mark this under resolved.
---
The funny thing about wows elitism and gatekeeping is that I have never encountered a community where the majority of players are actually so bad at the game as in WoW. So many people have basically no clue what they're doing even though they've been playing the game for a decade. Truly visible after m+ came around.
---
im a cs player never played wow and man that shiet had me so confused for a hot minute lol i feel you
---
I respect that. I just hate wasting time, and without my guides, I'd go insane
---
Lollll
---
Korean here. When you launch WoW Classic, you can choose region and server so don‚Äôt worry. If you need help, just let me know
---
I honestly hope we see huge drop off in a couple months.  
---
Trim the fat.

How do I know you‚Äôre not trying to pad your logs with my Battle Shout?
---
This is SO CUTE. I'm sitting here giggling

Calm down corky.

I robbed a bank, had to take a couple days off for the heist but it was worth it.

Gotcha, well that‚Äôs kinda good to hear!

Everytime I wander over mulgore, I can almost literarily feel the breezing wind.

Literally came here to say &lt;weaponised autism&gt; you on Mograine too?

Metzen has talked about it a few times. Read the DMG and the monster manual and its blatantly obvious its a rip off of DnD.

---
I bet she also browses video game forums, yuck.
---
It's a learning experience. The optimist in me thinks so anyways.
---
In bfa if someone jumps in while you're fighting 10 mobs it's because they want the tag for their quest too. You don't thank those people cause they were just serving themselves really.
---
So in classic, people zone out and forget that their is no tag sharing, so they also forget the thank you.
---
Why do you get to decide "how it should be" finding a big boe is tge same as finding a big bag of gold, which everyone needs
---
Sorry but basement dweller offends me, I'm English we don't really have basements, I'd prefer Cellar Dweller if you please :)
---
i was playing at Light's Hope, it was announced servers would be close in 6 months and starting areas were packed with players constantly.... there were a lot chinese as well.
---
wow classic is a better game. the cancer started with woltk, arthas cursed us all.... immersion gone, interaction gone. we got promised an utopia, just to found the talent trees got chopped to half in next expansion.
---
Could you do the exact opposite ? I'm using the addon "monkeyquest" and i'd like to totally disable automatic quest tracking. There's no option to disable it if you wanna use a better custom quest tracker, so you end up with 2 quest trackers on the side of your screen :(
---
Yes and it bothers me a lot
---
Not at heroes wear capes, some wear bags.
---
EVE was the closest thing to Classic for me. Sadly I never got into EVE like I did in Vanilla.
---
I miss producing more salt than Morton.
---
Don't you dare tell their innocent souls
---
BC lore was an abortion. Kael'thas' whole story makes no sense, then less sense, then total nonsense. I won't even stard on Illidan.
---
Always Red, never Blue! But seriously Horde has a Huge PvP advantage because of Orc and Undead. Alliance has a huge PvE advantage and that is solely because of Fear Ward from Dwarven Priest's, some people would not believe that but it is really huge in some Boss fights.
---
Don't even ask....
---
You dont see the name of the crafting player when hovering over mailbox thumbnail :)
---
I live in Korea and use US servers. Lag isn‚Äôt too bag. Long queues die off early evening.
---
Because if you dont want to put in any effort to obtain your goals you should not be playing an MMO in the first place. Entitlement ruined the game. Plain and simple.
---
But then I can‚Äôt see the 4 quilboars I‚Äôm about to pull by mistake :(
---
Re-doing your talents in classic has a scaling cost and is getting expensive really fast. Imo you can just do dungeons with levelingtalents and respec later
---
Guys like you are the reason it's so fun to play this game again. 
---
Thank you for being wholesome and please keep Teobagging the newcomers.
---
Every time I change something on my pet bar I have to reload my ui to see if it changed 
---
It's been real annoying
---
Why does whether or not you'll see them later matter? I talk to strangers at parties who I am unlikely to see again.
---
This is what happens when you play Alliance. :D
---
Man I can't imagine how good this comment felt for op
---
If you are level 26 now you are way past the casuals. Come chill in the Barrens. We have banter and corpse walks.
---
Guys, I'm feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment while levelling and I didn't even pay for microtransactions or anything. I feel like I should report this to someone.
---
We made a queue on Shazz, but there were a few people not giving a fuck and trying to tag skipping the queue.
---
This is pretty crazy. Sulfuras has been fine so far, very friendly people.
---
haha, no, between my friends the WoW diet is playing the game so much you don‚Äôt eat. It‚Äôs funny that intermittent fasting has become a real thing since we played in vanilla.
---
Go arms for leveling until you get mortal strike, then dump the rest into fury. Rolling fury will be rough early levels with a lack of +hit gear. 
---
When you hit level 60 it would be worth exploring a prot spec. Attempting to level with prot would be really slow.
---
Nice warriors finish last, huh
---
Why not? That is what happened with the AQ or Naxx release: World events and new/updated content zones. Then you update a few older areas to respect the new state of events and things are go.
---
Fucking up noobs

West side noggers - noggenfogger server
---
The hype will definitely fall off, but my prediction is that around half of the current players are going to stay. 
---
Some people just don't have the patience or long enough attention span to appreciate the slower pace of classic imo.
---
Yea then dont stress it

What unitframes and action bar  add-ons are those?
---
I can confirm it works now.
---
To be fair cata heroics were pretty difficult, I thoroughly enjoyed them and the early raiding of cata, I didn't get very far in though, my pc wasn't very capable of raiding at the time
---
Not like Blizz could just merge Servers or offer free Transfers....

Which is also stupid. Two is fine.

And isn‚Äôt it 4 now?

if an enhanc shaman and equally geared warrior go against each other in pvp, considering things go relatively well with windfury procs, does an enhanc shaman beat warriors in pvp?
---
I do get confused by this.  Is this going to be how Classic is in end game? Is this just a product of the fact that everyone is leveling? The toxic people from retail are also in classic right?  I just wonder if this is a honeymoon phase response or really the new norm.
---
kek
---
Yeah I never planned on going prot at all until 60, and most people are saying hybrid over protection is better once you hit 60.
---
No I don't think I will
---
Just wanted to know if I'm playing a warlock badly I'm struggling with 2 mobs at a time even if they are lower leveled I'm playing an affliction so using all the dot abilities then wanding or shadow bolt I just feel quite weak I'm lvl 19 and wondering if this class isn't for me or if I'm playing that badly. Ps this is the first time I have played wow
---
sorting by new there is only one post separating you and another group member posting this.
---
Level 1 as am on holiday till tomorrow :-)
---
As horde you can play an orc and do rape RP with your monster orc cock in a tight Night Elf pussy; ruining it for baby dicked night elves forever.
---
I only ran the heroics with guidies, which is probably why I never had an issue with them...
---
Is the cost that bad? What's the first respec cost? I've haven't done any at all.
---
Ever catch yourself try to look at the mini map in the corner, I did that a few to many times....
---
There is one think coming over from retail and that is that people do not roll for chest ;)
---
Boom roasted
---
you should be the director of the next gillette add.
---
maybe focus on positive things and talk how to make things better? maybe work hard for you mob, instead of crying at reddit? 
---
because at late game, people will farm earth elementals 7/24/365. you will see the mob stealing there.
---
you are talking bad shit with good intentions. this is not the way to do anything.
---
Mr. Bagger bagging the bagless lads and lasses.
---
It feels like it
---
Yes there's updates about once a week. 
---
New continents, quests, bosses, raids, equipment, cities, minigames, etc. All the updates are first polled by the players in game to keep the oldschool feel.
---
Serpent's sting is also a waste of Mana. Multi-shot and Arcane shot rinse repeat, AimShot if you have it. Any of these extra spells is just using Mana that means you have to stop, drink and eat, instead of killing more mobs. Look at details, serpents sting deals garbage damage and the amount of AP you get from Hunter's Mark isn't worth the Mana
---
That‚Äôs what I loved the most about it. Spending 4 hours running from one side of the map to the other, then back, then back again, all for one quest. Only to forget you forgot something else and have to go back again.
---
It's because you are not missing or getting parried/Dodge as much in the starting zones.
---
Once you leave them Mobs Will start to evade your attacks like ninjas and goodbye to your rage
---
You are wrong, you actually could download the installer files back then. I did do that because I could only get the german version of the box and I always play with the english client. So I did download that one despite having to have the box. 
---
It just wasn‚Äôt the main method to install the game though
---
Victim mentality like that ruined the retail aswell back in the day. Just quit and go play fortnite, we dont need people like you.
---
Ya they are lame I know, but I thought I'd switch it up as I played horde all through vanilla
---
You will not change my mind on this. I‚Äôve done it before and I‚Äôll do it again. Plus with the number of people around you basically always have people to share groups with. Was farming Ashenvale with a mage last night and chain pulling for about 10 minutes between rests.
---
About 4/10 sure this is sarcasm, but if it's not, you're definitely a pretentious ass.
---
There's a mod that makes the game compatible with controllers. Just put play it on your TV from bed or couch!
---
Me and my Friends are using TeamViewer. No more wasted time in the queue.
---
Level 16, 5 gold and all my professions 100+ except engineering. Feels good to not rush leveling and skill my professions also. 
---
It‚Äôs my third char because of server transfers :(
---
Womp womp, OP's a phony
---
Not on horde oce.
---
Because it's simply not breaking the ToS. As far as I know nothing about circumventing queues by preventing AFK log outs ingame is written in there.
---
It's also not account sharing because it's simply a single keypress every 10 or so minutes that does nothing except for keeping around a dozen spots on the queue. Account sharing is you willingly letting someone play on your account and actually partake in any content of the game. In addition to that it is a huge security risk for yourself plus it circumvents having to pay a second subscription. That's account sharing.
---
What about all those people having their spouses, S/Os, friends or even parents log in to the game to get out of the queue by the time they get home from work?

Is it possible to use a lesser rank if you don't have the mana for a high rank within the same macro? It didn't work for me when I tested it.
---
imagine being that warlock and 90% of people you see are undead...

it gets even more useless :/

You spent time clearing to get that chest all to yourself, sure, but you did it without befriending that other player who's also clearly eyeing that chest.
---
If you had made an effort to interact with a person in an mmo (shocking concept, I know) you could clear the mobs together with less risk and have shared the loot or something.
---
And for the player who 'stole' your chest, well, you remember him. You hate him. You'll probably see him again and warn your friends about him. You can rightfully hurt his reputation.
---
It's like some kind of community based incentive to group together and not be a selfish prick, for all involved.

Thanks for last night

i give it a month or so for when most people start really trying to push for more endgame mindsets.

Your best bet is just to go the frostbite ST build.  Unless you‚Äôre AoE grinding consistently there‚Äôs almost no benefit to going the AoE build.

The zeppelin in Tirisfall scared me a couple of times before I got used to it. Just this massive shadow suddenly coming across my screen.
---
Play any class you wish is my recommendation, everyone is useful, and a player having fun on a non-bis class is better than someone that's having no fun or low engagement on a 'better' class. Maybe try all 3 and level until 5 or 10 and see how they feel. I'd say level until 10, hunters get their pet then and it makes everything a lot cooler, and then decide :P
---
Gotta build up that rage. That's why it seems unending at level 60.
---
While this post was not really needed and came off really whiny. 
---
I'm going to laugh at some or you later who think people are going to remember you and that there won't be lists for people like you. You apparently never played classic, the player base might be huge now, but wait till it trims down and you start not getting into groups because of your toxic and obnoxious personality.  I will definitely be laughing at you.
---
Mandatory updates are the worst.
---
That‚Äôs fire
---
Human for the reputation bonuses, nelf for everything else ;)
---
Windows Update strikes again.
---
True, but when players do know and have real feed back and producers tell you that‚Äôs not what you want and ignore the players, then there‚Äôs imbalance. Which is an increasing trend in the industry. Players give feed back and developers either misinterpret it, ignore it or arrogantly tell players they are wrong and they don‚Äôt really want that. aka, WoW classic.
---
Please stop, this is why warlords of Draenor happened, don't let blizzard do another alternative timeline expansion haha.
---
In the real world you can't "/ignore" them, so I prefer wow over reality for that matter.
---
Dude someone was doing this on my server today too, only she was the Bag Lady.  That's literally what she called herself.  I found her RP walking the path between Razor Hill and Org.  She was going to give me bags in exchange for just the linen, but she threw in a surprise blue shirt too so I just had to tip.
---
Only to hunters? D:  The only leather wearers who aren't gear dependent early game? xD    *jealous druid*
---
My man, of course it is sarcasm. Quite entertaining at that.

Not unless you use a modifier for the lower level, with the new API macros like that got screwed

Dont worry barrens is pretty chill on my server so hopefully yours too!

I think you mean blood rage. Blood thirst is the ultimate fury talent.
---
Good idea!
---
&gt;I feel the need to mention here that the artists and sound designers are pros of the highest caliber though - every expansion the world itself just becomes more and more breathtaking and immersive, and then the 'grind' designers just take a big fat dump all over that world.
---
It's like the game of thrones final season. Some of the best cinematography ever made set to some of the worst writing in history.
---
Ah yes. People have been fans of the world first race for over a decade and yet **they** are the toxic guys.
---
Meanwhile this sub lives on hating literally every streamer and there are probably quite a lot of people sending death threats to the developers for not getting onto Faerlina, the streamer server everyone knew about for weeks.
---
We have a server podcast? Send me a link my man
---
DAE think retail BAD??
---
Very doubtful
---
That reminded me. I need to visit Theramore.
---
Haha one of the best/worst feelings dependant on how you look at it. IMO I would do /who and whisper everyone on the list and form a raid group, then meet up and out number them. FOR THE ALLIANCE
---
I totally agree. All of these garbage classic noobs forced me into making a "/thank" macro. Filthy casuals.
---
The community is really divided on this, but I hope blizzard does the same thing.  I dont see just re releasing old expansions as the right path to mass popularity.  I honestly love TBC and Wrath, probably more than classic, but this feels like a dead end.  Blizz needs to make classic it‚Äôs own branch with it‚Äôs own content pipeline for those that like this style of game.  Classic has the opportunity to become a genuine old school MMO for old school gamers, not just a temporary nostalgia trip.
---
Skinning is the best profession for making passive money. Either use it to help you level, vendor it, or send to an alt to sell. It takes no effort and you're killing mobs anyway. Drop it at 60 though unless you'll be taking LW seriously.

Smh
---
Its a forever thing.
---
some people speak sarcasm and irony so fluent that it makes you wonder if they rly are joking or if the joke just woooshes you

For a lot of us there is no correction needed, at least large one. I dislike almost everything about Vanilla and wouldnt want any of it put into retail. Youll find the same sentiment in game and over ont he WoW reddit by many.
---
High pop usually doesn't have qeues
---
I dont see the problem. People are min maxing and know the game because of information thats been available forever. If they can do it then why shouldnt they? Theyre doing it with the limitations of the game.
---
This is really accurate :D
---
Completely agree for the most part but I have seen some peak edge-lord toxicity within a guild that I was part of it. Lots of "there are only two genders L O L" or "[something something] black people". Left pretty soon after that but it was a tad disappointing; I can't wait till the dust has settled and healthy guild communities have formed.
---
I was seeing a ton of westfall refuges in darkshore. A lot fewer people fighting over spawns.
---
I think its like 1g/5g/10g/15g/20g/... caps at 50g.

Well 50-60 takes about as long as 1-30. Keep that in mind.

Classicthreatmeter seems to work fine, it's not very configurable though.
---
The problem is that everyone needs to have it installed or they don't show up. The description for the addon made it sound like this will be true for any threat meter, so it's just a question of what becomes accepted.
---
I have yet to see anyone in the wild use it beside myself...........
---
&gt; Then you update a few older areas to respect the new state of events and things are go.
---
Then it's no longer classic.  It's now something else.
---
Additionally, neither AQ nor Naxx meaningfully progressed the story. Not to the extent of any XPac since then.
---
I actually didn‚Äôt know this. Looted a chest yesterday and left a grey bastard sword. Whoops.

THIS 100000000000000x this. It's basically the reason I hate retail WoW. I wanted to play and learn the story and all that shit but it just confuses me.
---
So, "Back to the Future"'s a bunch of bullshit?
---
I'm guessing you mean Fel Reaver from Hellfire Peninsula.
---
Death Machine is a pretty accurate description. That noise it made was pretty much the last thing you heard before becoming acquainted with the Spirit Healer.
---
I read that in Eugene's voice from walking dead.
---
Yeah, if your cat's not active enough they will definitely lash out! In this case though, I just think it's curiosity. He's an outdoor cat so he's really, really active. So nice to hear that your cat is doing better, a happy cat is a happy owner!
---
Honestely the daily system in TBC were fine, you didn't need to do dailies, but it was something you could do to make some gold for raiding, but if you preferred to grind mobs or play the AH, you could do that as well, and not bother with the dailies. It was the increasing necessity of doing dailies that ruined the concept.
---
Flying, meh yeah, I liked it at the time, but now, not so much.
---
I gave an underleveled warrior playing alone a stack of minor healing potions earlier today. I figure he needed them more than me, a druid herb/alch.
---
Best game ever
---
yes. With wand spec (5/5 talents in wand damage = 25% more wand damage) it is. Your cast can't get delayed, it is zero mana and it does more dps.
---
I always played on the ally side. It is really a pleasure to discover the game from the other point of view now in Classic
---
I always wanted to feel what I once felt while strolling the first hours through Elwynn Forest and waiting for the next adventure to jump out behind a tree.
---
Found that by starting on the undead side now in Classic.
---
I think the thing I like most is that I keep running into the same people. It‚Äôs not just thousands of random people coming and going every few minutes.
---
Yeah it's pretty cool. It can be nice when tanking as well especially if you run with unbridled wrath 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=12322/unbridled-wrath
---
Personally I never have it since I roll with improved charge. I like it arrive at my target in PVP with an initial 15 rage before I land my hamstring and first swing.
---
Ah I see you passed by a mage recently
---
I only farmed it once during early BC and managed to get like 5 in one 2 hour farm. Since I was Horde, they were going for insane prices on the AH. I kept one for me and the rest sold for like 150-200g each. I remember it going for unreasonably stupid prices but it was fantastic for my ‚Äúepic flying‚Äù funds. They soon plummeted to around 20g and I‚Äôve never gotten that lucky ever again.
---
The guy you responded to said "Classic+" which automatically entails an updated classic.. And he also specifically said "smaller content more often" because adding huge chunks of content does break the world. That is what you initially responded to.
---
Day one saw 1/3 of time playtime trying to log on (never been so happy to queue again), day two spent 1/3 of the time trying to get that shaman totem to drop,  most of today has been spent, unsuccessfully, on Westfall stew.   
---
Wouldn't change a thing. Still loving it. Complaining about a drop rate doesn't so much mean I want it changed... it just means that holy balls.... I have three stacks of small eggs and no stringy vulture meat and bad luck of that magnitude must be shared!
---
There's a check-box in the interface options to disable the  auto-tracking for 5 minutes of quests
---
When I open the launcher, it downloads what it needs to update WoW Classic, then it keeps me at 0 B/s. I'm not sure how to check for launcher updates but I will certainly try in the morning!
---
Beautiful
---
Today I was questing in the Barrens. There was a tauren warrior, named Moo, come up to me and we procceeded to have a whole 10 minute conversation just saying "Moo". No other word was spoken and we said moo to each other and went on our ways questing

Last night saw a low level pull loads of mobs and was running away shouting ‚Äúhelp‚Äù lol then everyone around started pulling the trash mobs from him, he died but it was the thought that counted guys üëèbravo
---
That's great
---
Imagine just how much more money they would get after the shitstorm of banning their accounts and all the poor streamers sobbing for their unfair treatment as well as all the media talking about it. The amount of publicity would certainly be worth it.
---
You character can already jump more that his height, run and swim indefinitely and make several spins, changing direction mid air. And short legs are not a problem either.
---
Wow got me too. I was composing my reply 2 sentences in, ha.
---
My guide actually had me go to Loch Modan at 12, then to Westfall for 13 to 15. Now it has me back in Darkshore.
---
The "kill 20 rabid grizzlys" quest is actually what frustrated me enough to log out at a decent hour tonight. Hopefully I'll be in a more grind-y mood tomorrow

I just remember running in a circle grinding blood elves in aszhara while listening to the dandy warhols between level 52-60. Hearing them now still brings back nostalgia.

---
Slap his ass
---
Me too. Lol. 
---
When wnadering about with my rogue I tend to get in a hit on the mobs people have tagged and I'm always asking myself if they're wondering what that idiot is doing there and if I don't know that I won't get any loot from it.
---
There's so much content that was originally cut from vanilla that can be explored, not to mention the possibility of redoing things like the BC Illidan story to be less stupid. 
---
They could also introduce brand new stories, why not?   As long as they stick to the overall design philosophy that made vanilla good (increased socialization, RPG elements, entire raids not becoming obsolete when a new one comes out, gear mattering, etc)  there's a lot they can do. Even stuff like rebalancing specs like elemental shaman and prot paladin to be raid viable could work.
---
That's the path I want Classic to take, personally. The only question is Blizzard up to the task? 
---
They should poach some Jagex OSRS designers.
---
??
---
U get the AFK tag before being disconnected.
---
Soul stone &gt; any of those buffs.
---
Aliance scum
---
It's so hard to tell with just text. The voice in my head that read it didnt sound sarcastic. But bless you for clarifying.
---
Just wait until the anal thing starts again
---
I have an absurd number of hours in OSRS, and virtually none in RS3 but I can give you my perception.  The things that drive players away from RS3 are art style and tone, core mechanics, and of course, MTX.  
---
RS3 abandoned its roots in mid evil fantasy and went towards a generic ‚Äúeverything has colors sparkles and spikes‚Äù approach.  New art + cosmetic overrides means knights and swords are gone, replaced by wings, fantasy armor, and glowey things.  
---
Second, Jagex changed the core mechanics of the game, namely combat.  ‚ÄúEOC‚Äù or evolution of combat, tried to essentially copy wow and other MMOs by offering hot key based combat.  This departure from the far more relaxed click-and-kill turn (ish) based gameplay alienated more than half of the core audience.  They also massively sped up leveling rates de-valuing the commits a lot of players made.  
---
Finally, the game is absolutely riddled with micro transactions.  Cosmetic over rides, wheel spins, xp boosts.  Achievements mean nothing when they can be bought.
---
Sorry for the lengthy post, but there‚Äôs my take.
---
I was just thinking of the song by DMX "X gonna give it to ya"
---
I'm just cracking up at the arguments over the Deadmines acronym. I've seen like a dozen heated arguments with people ending blocking each other over it.
---
Oh thats great, dont let those fools let you down, bro. I will do this on my gnome warlock. This will be hilarious
---
Legion with the broken promises of a heap of raid content killed it for me, I was expecting wotlk 2.0, it didn't happen, we had 1 side raid and most people weren't interested in running it...
---
I do the same. And I don‚Äôt think this is a bad thing, I love the way this is. these extra little things are what makes hunter great!
---
I went in with the plan of playing ret paladin because I actually enjoy it, but am basically just healing at the moment.
---
Regardless, just enjoying when I am able to play the game at all
---
Don't worry, once a few people get to 60 you'll get that elitism you love so much back, at least in part.
---
Everyone in the clip plays WoW no? I thought it was the whole point
---
is there an XP off command or do they outlevel eventually?
---
Just walk around spamming ‚Äú?‚Äù Turn it in to a meme own this disadvantage bro
---
how do you get to regular outlands to level from 60-70 if the portal takes you to alternate draenor?
---
Either way get a warrior friend and wreck face everywhere. I‚Äôd slightly favor a paladin for that duo (blessing of freedom is godly for a warrior) but both are great.
---
I made one in the thread where some guy was telling Thrall what happens post-Vanilla so he doesn't make dumb decisions.
---
I was playing horde for years so I know all quests there but now Im playing alliance for New experience so I do not know quests .. and after typicall 8h queve which is usually on our server I really do not want to spend rest time searching for some box somewhere in the forest .. so I start using questie .. so I can atleast little bit keep exping around levels of my friends
---
You can do this by default. No need for move anything.
---
Rightclick on your frames
---
Whoa whoa hunters have aspect of the cheetah for all those runs back not to mention hunters Mark. I may be a lock now but hunter will always have my heart.
---
Lol too true.
---
Grab a chair.
---
I usally leave the crap in there, kinda funny to see someone else loot after and not loot it either lol
---
That‚Äôs my bad then. I took it for the posts title. I looked at who won it and made a smart ass remark based on that
---
Ah yeah I'm not a big PvPer I'm mostly into PvE content so I'd probably roll towards deep wounds, mortal strike, and anger management
---
Blizzard got high on the qol changes and making the game easier and the surge of players at the time of TBC,  WOTLK when all of this started happening. thus they figured more of this = even more players = even more money. 
---
Which I assume they werent wrong as the game was still strong, but in the long run it was killing the playerbase.  BFA just shows they took it too far, while reducing money investment in it to maxmize profits.
---
They also mistook it to what players actually wanted when the players themselfs dont know whats good for them when they know they can get everything.
---
Think of it this way, if you gave a child everything he wants all the time without restrictions he would not have the same sense of fullfillment any longer nor would appreciate and enjoy anything you give him, he would burn out fast this way.
---
But if you set out rules for him, and make him work for his rewards he would have that sense of fullfilment of working towards his goals.
---
We are those children and sadly Blizzard suck at parenting !
---
It‚Äôs not just a mount, It‚Äôs a Kodo. Oh how the Tauren used to ride these babies for miles!
---
Same thing happened to me too
---
A random warlock just gave me a green 2H axe
---
Yeah i remember using this in WotLK feels amazing.
---
&lt;Personal Space&gt; is a guild I‚Äôve been wanting to make since I heard that classic was coming out a few years ago. I‚Äôve always wanted to start a guild of my own but it was always so hard to get an active community of people to join so late in to retail, and I figured the beginning of classic would be the best way to do it.
---
We are a friendly, active and helpful group of players and friends dedicated to making the classic experience as fun as possible. We‚Äôre currently looking for anyone experienced or new to the game to give the guild a good start with active members and a helpful community.
---
Toward end game we are looking to convert into a semi-hardcore raiding guild and are looking to tackle all content possible. We understand that people have lives (myself included) so we will figure out raid groups and times and coordinate them around peoples schedules as best we can. Obviously we won‚Äôt be discussing things like raid times for quite a while seeing that it is only the first week of launch and it‚Äôll take a while to get to endgame, but if you‚Äôre interested in joining us for the ride feel free to PM me on here or in game!

Shield before pull. Still gets rage from white damage and give you more time before casting your first heal and getting threat.

Can you check your sentence? I can hardly understand what you are saying.

Sit back relax and enjoy the rain in darkshore. Do the big ~20 mob grinds while traveling between other quests. Breaks it up and makes it feel smoother.

You need your axe before you join the fellowship.  Aragorn always micromanaging the party.

You're not the real bag man, tho. On Ten Storms, a guy named Bag man did this 2 days ago.

Zygor is a thing for classic just an fyi
---
Yeaaah, I actually decided to abandon Westfall Stew and the one where you collect x amount of gnoll parts. They were random (low) drop chance and the respawn was terrible, especially when 5 people were fighting for it
---
I didn't realize just how many annoying quests can be skipped
---
Yeah and this is a fairly recent development.  Scary for those of us invested in the game.  I fully admit that I want RS3 to continue to shield us from the shareholder greed, but it can only last so long as it slowly dies.
---
Barrens chat alone is worth 15$ a month
---
You mean Warcraft? There‚Äôs still a pro Warcraft scene in Russia &amp; online. Sadly not many Korean players :/ it‚Äôs basically a cross between StarCraft Brood War and WoW, but it resembles SC more inasmuch as it‚Äôs a RTS, not an RPG. Still, the lore is rich and the gameplay is fun. Blizzard‚Äôs cinematics back then won many awards
---
Does it even matter?

As comparison I am 16 and feel lile I have played as much I can almost after work and normal RL stuff.

&gt; Wouldn't that mean every boss battle is artificially difficult?

Nope. Read my full post and read in context. Your cherrypicking of sentences is dishonest.
---
&gt; Off the top of my head Dark souls 2 and of course people loved the addition of heroics to WoW.
---
Dark Souls is the least liked dark souls... Bad example.
---
Is a druid a good class for endgame? Ive been getting a very bad impression or a very good impression. However i want to know the general consensus.
---
Bold, but it worked.
---
Still have it. Also, you could still buy a new one.. almost every market.
---
Games still pretty fresh. Just go catch up
---
You feel jipped because u were so impatient that you  couldn't wait a few days to play with your friends or just get in queue?? Lol this is your own fault. Reroll and stop blaming blizzard for your own decisions.
---
Go sit in Crossroads Inn. Quite a few multiboxers in there usually.
---
WoW classic is the biggest middle finger to the casualization of WoW. I hope Blizz and Activision learns something from it, but unfortunately the only lesson they'll most likely take is that old things drenched in nostalgia is worth a lot.
---
Yeah, grinding mobs is an entirely different story when even green loot could be a huge upgrade. Personally I like it a lot.
---
Your current subscription gets you WoW Classic. You need to roll a new toon regardless of which account you use.
---
Does your CPU have onboard graphics? It'll probably run WoW no sweat.
---
I tried to do the same thing in SW. Trying to give Bolivar and Anduin the heads up. Apparently they were even about to hear any of my shit. I was all like, you know Lady Prestor is Onxyia.
---
Yeah, you're right. I've been approaching it with an unhealthy desire to level quickly.
---
I should throw on my 2007 Green Day / Linkin Park playlist and relax.
---
Yeah that shit is creepy
---
In the long run, one attached to emotion, other logical
---
Honestly, everything beats warrior 1v1. Warriors have always been kinda meh in 1v1 situations pre Cata. They are being kited way too easily. If youre good enough you can even kite them in a 5 yard range so they cant hit you.
---
Yup
---
Warstomp
---
Wait till pet draws a bunch of aggro, then bubble pet beats this.
---
Oh shit I forgot about this!
---
"Classic+" could mean a lot of things.
---
I take it to mean Classic Plus New Stuff.  All of Classic is still there, just with new content added on.  If "Classic+" to you involves changing what's in classic, I'm not quite sure that's Classic+, seems more akin to Cata light.
---
So in the light of adding on to classic, you're never going to be able to make meaningful changes.  What did AQ and Naxx do?  Make side quests that didn't really relate at all back to anything else going on in Azeroth.
---
Which if that's what you want, that's fine, but it's not going to be "continueing on the same timeline," it's just going to be some meaningless stuff slapped on the side.
---
Well yea. I mean I got renew and lesser healing right now. I can put you in a warm, protective bubble for a short period, too. Don't forget the Stam buff. I got the Stam buff for you and all our friends!
---
You sure it wasn't a green sword. I gave a level 9? Warrior a stamina sword in Brill , about 3-4pm PST?
---
I see what you‚Äôre saying but that‚Äôs not quite right because of expansions. If you have expansions with increased level caps every 4-5 raid tiers, there‚Äôs never any need for catch up mechanics.
---
Where they went wrong with expansions, however, was to spend ages developing all these new zones and then only increase the level cap by 10 so people blast through the zones in a week. This is problematic for two reasons:
---
1) The levelling experience being so short makes it feel like just a barrier to the ‚Äòreal game‚Äô which is the end game. This is what gives wow it‚Äôs rushed feel in retail and why nobody wants to explore, group-up or wpvp.
---
2) It puts blizz under pressure to churn out new raid content faster than they really can so they invented dailies to slow players down and force them to revisit the zones they developed. Dailies are just chores though and they feel like chores, unlike the levelling experience of vanilla.

Arms. You can tank every 5 man regular dungeon fine with no talents whatsoever. Of course it‚Äôs better with them, but I highly suggest not speccing protection for a long while. I personally prefer arms to level. It‚Äôs also the pvp build, so really you don‚Äôt have to worry about spec for a good long while on the warrior and can save for your money for the mounts you‚Äôre going to desperately want at 40/60 haha.

---
Seen on old blanchy too
---
If people are rolling need on an item they dont actually need for their class, just because it's a high value item. Your a ninja plain and simple. Need what you actually need, greed the rest. Be an upstanding player or you'll find yourself on lists of players being excluded from groups.

(this isn't to OP, just a general statement.)

If i see a corpse i either do /who or whisper the guy if he is still on keyboard. If he anwseres: Wake Up! Here is your res!

I found one bad apple but that‚Äôs been it. I was running copper loops in durotar for engineering and some Tauren wanders up and whacks at my mine, nbd I‚Äôll move on, I clear the mobs next to another mine and he runs over and picks it while I‚Äôm killing the thunder lizard, I end up accidentally picking one he was killing mobs for and dude starts whispering me callling me a thieving retard and that he needed cooper for his warrior quest. 
---
Fucking mindblowing,
---
You mean the Chuck Norris Channel?
---
You never had me going. But I read on just in case. 
---
You're such a good person.
---
That post is cute:)
---
Literally any gpu from this side of 2010 will be fine
---
You sound like a pretentious asshole.
---
No wave. No cave. You're brilliant
---
Werent flight path prices based on reputation with the faction your going to as well as distance?
---
Except they'll all have the t2 head
---
Just did deadmines with my guild and I got Cruel Barb! Feels good man!
---
Same. Chose low pop realm right away and never had an issue. Max had was 2min maybe.
---
Yes, definitely do as soon as possible. A group of several paladins can do this as early as lvl 22 and the sooner you get it the longer you can enjoy it.
---
4 if you count LFR, but I was thinking of the difficulties you actually need a group for.
---
\&gt;implying there aren't *any* viable Tauren available
---
I mean come on, the Tauren are clearly the most level-headed of the Horde races. Hell, even a Troll would be a better Warchief at this point than evil for the lulz Sylvanas.
---
Ain't nobody got enough fish oil to throw water walking on random people!
---
You could get from old hellfire to old emerald dream iirc
---
Just save tmog configuration. If you are an alt and got money from heirlooms, they you can spare few gold on tmog too.
---
But he did make it past 20
---
By pushing on past the 20 mark he has proven them all wrong he is... a hero
---
I have a can or 2 of these too!
---
I use a 2012 Macbook Pro when I'm not at home. I seriously think a fish swimming in circles could run this game.
---
Yes. Not only because the lore is pretty good, but the quest dialogue gives you directions to complete the quest itself. Good luck!
---
bullshit, heirlooms used to be a grind to unlock, 1750 Justice/Honor for ONE PIECE! plus you had to keep track of which character was holding it since you only got one copy of it. god forbid you decided you didn‚Äôt like the class after grinding a few BoA‚Äôs
---
of course this changed a couple xpacs ago, but it was never  ‚Äòeasy‚Äô to unlock (it wasn‚Äôt hard to grind the Justice points, just took a damn long time.)
---
Familiarity is one of the best aspects of Classic. The fact that you **will** be known for being a dick or a pleasant person really contributes to people being civil.
---
It is
---
Same here :D I was like wtf is he talking about, why are there so many upvotes
---
There‚Äôs no achievements in Classic, so why would you want to get stuck in the city?
---
Lol theres no phases
---
If you enjoy reading that sort of thing: Go ahead
---
If not: Why bother?
---
I agree with Blizzard on this.
---
When the hype is gone, many servers will be empty so they are waiting couple of weeks to see the real server statuses. 
---
I know that queue is something really annoying but not every server has a 40k queue, you dont have to play on a server which is full of streamers.
---
When they see the real base population, for sure they are going to bring new servers. But its only the first week yet, you have waited for 15 years, finally you have the game, you can wait for couple of weeks to settle things down.
---
fantastic
---
So if you can buff people can you gank people too?
---
You can put one or two points into imp blizzard and the rest of the points are good for both.
---
Don‚Äôt pick frostbite one because you don‚Äôt want to frostnova the mobs while channeling blizzard.
---
The problem I have is I need to wake my pc up from sleep mode, don't fancy leaving it on all day.
---
But setting up wake up on LAN is a pain in the ass. I need to find my DNS server to set up a static IP for TeamViewer but my ISPs shitty router masks it.
---
Back in vanilla beta, you could skin druids if they died while shapeshifted. This would de spawn their corpse.
---
They fixed this by making druids shift out automatically on death.
---
The more you know. :D
---
Okay. *Barely* past 20. Lol.
---
They're now apparently wanting to challenge him to a duel for honor.
---
I think I died at least six times in Jasperlode Mine and I loved every second of it
---
People are pretty nice in game so far
---
 The guy didn't even check my io or achievements. &lt; And from that moment on i knew this post was bs
---
far less obnoxious than the mechano hog
---
Oh cool, i got called the n word by one person.
---
On my first day we got in a single file line in razor hill because a warlock was making bags in exchange for linen. Idk why I had so much fun standing in line waiting for some dude to make me bags but it was the shit. Game is lit af,
---
The story is excellent and easier to follow in vanilla than retail (thankfully :P) - I suggest you read from the quests. But of course you can do it however you want.
---
For the loots? You can always Hearthstone out of there
---
thats one of my issues, I already have 3/3 Frostbite :( Is it worth a respec if I'm only level 20?
---
I have played a lot, like to the point where I‚Äôve memorized most quests.
---
I don‚Äôt need or use a guide‚Äîcause I‚Äôm cursed with addiction to this game. I am playing with rl friends many of whom haven‚Äôt played family before. They are hyped for guides. 
---
I‚Äôm smashing even the ones who played vanilla. 
---
Most have now turned off their guides and are just enjoying it.
---
Nothing for ME tho.

Using an instant cast when you see me 2 feet from a mob or after Ive thrown my axe to range pull to beat me to a tag.

I'll hit

I also want your addon folder :D
---
Grinding bears for skinning seems pretty efficient to me really. Rather than running around looking for next quest you are constantly pooling in xp.  
---
I have started killing alot on my way to the next quest wether i need em for quests or not. Just grind away
---
How does this relate? Lmao. I too have a tiger though, love it!
---
I dunno about that. I started playing Vanilla over a year after launch, and the leveling experience wasn't lonely at all. Neither was it hard getting instance groups.
---
Also with you
---
Finding a safe spot to res, and as a mage, hope you can drink a bit before being attacked again is sort of tense and I love it.
---
Tnx for the comment if you don't mind me asking how is it easier to follow than in retail wow?
---
I was wondering about which game to jump into. Are both not exactly the same lorewise at the start of the game?
---
This post makes me happy.  In the past 2 days of playing I've met and grouped with so many awesome people.
---
And the great thing is I'll see them again just out questing because of no cross realms üòä
---
I have had quite a few of those moments where you're trying to kill something then out of a corner you see a random mob come rushing towards your position and you can only hope you're not in aggro range.
---
I have also had moments where I won fights with little Hp/Mp remaining and then I see a mob spawning next to me and I know I'm screwed
---
Haha that‚Äôs cool man
---
Nah it was an axe, on bigglesworth, and I was level 12.
---
their children will turn into annoying teenagers and their marriages will fall apart. meanwhile your character will grow stronger with every new item.

Classic lul

What guide are you using?
---
Nah always roll NEED. seriously on BOE roll need...
---
fuck me he's speaking in 3rd person too
---
This is next level
---
They don't separate to that degree, but Blizzard is about 1/3 of their revenue base, and we know WoW used to be a big part of that revenue. I think there's easily 10% of additional revenue on WoW that's not been priced in yet, due to the unexpected succes of WoW classic
---
cool story bro
---
Yet.
---
Exactly,  a few people on my server are already being barred from groups because they ditch halfway through all the time
---
thats the hilarious part of this game in the beginning, ppl find BLUE gear and start thinking "omg im gonna make 200g on this baby!" 
---
yea easy there cowboy, the server doesnt even have a lvl 60 yet, and everyone is broke 24/7 from buying their spells and levelling profession :P
---
Cut your losses now and group up imo
---
That‚Äôs why you cast it right as they go to fear you. Cmon man hydra taught us this years ago
---
It‚Äôs all in good fun, and pretty hilarious.
---
&gt;"...oh yeah.  Uh, I might have skipped some stuff.  So, there's an alternate-reality version of Draenor, and, uh, you have a wife...  Her name? Uhhh, 'aggro' or something.  Look, I skipped the questline where you sailed with her into the Maelstrom to become an ascended god or whatever because the Darkmoon fair was in town and I

&gt;really

Yeah I think I made the right decision to stop during Cata.

I see horde trying to get to DM daily on my server it‚Äôs just a gank fest lol

Some random dude 4 levels above me traded me yesterday in redridge after I finished a mob, put a green 2h axe in it and traded it. For free. That made my fucking day.

Who fuckin knows mate, ask the question in 2 months

Im rerolling my 26 rogue tomorrow in Anathema.
---
post a real link
---
I can play it on a bugdet laptop with a Vega 3 integrated. xD
---
What is the budget? If it's extreamly low go for GTX 1030 or GTX 1050. If it's bigger, get an RX 570/RX 580.
---
I really recommend going towards the RX 570, they are cheap and good cards, but if the bugdet is not there, get a 1050.
---
I think that'd fall under leatherworking not tailoring
---
But then I just think of splatoon
---
Keep us updated lol
---
Rude
---
RP is a fun way to add layer of immersion to the game. If you are into it. 
---
If you are not it's fine. But people often harass RPs acting in process like total douchebags.
---
Loktar ogar!
---
If you are down to start and level together let me know!
---
I guess it depends if you really wanna aoe Grind mostly you should.
---
If not you could try it with this talent and see how it goes. I start to aoe when I have cone of cold and imp blizzard. Imp blizzard is really needed because you need that slow really badly.
---
I reckon there will be
---
As a Druid, I always throw mark and thorns on everyone I see. I love it!
---
I second this. The RX 570 is a great, cheap card and you can find it second hand for really really cheap.
---
There have been very few new servers compared to the queue sizes IMO
---
literally sell your clothes to buy a sub

No toll, no boy's hole.
---
When I came back to BfA after barely playing wow since work, with 2000 gold in my pocket, I had 30k gold in like a month.
---
Vanilla is more "down to earth"
---
You're a nobody, just a simple adventurer kinda.
---
In retail you're the choosen one (along the other millions of player...) and the story is a clusterfuck (the 3rd expansion, cataclysm changed all the classic zone, so for level 1-60 you're in the cataclysm timeframe, for 60 to 80 you go back in time when you're doing the burning crusade and wrath of the lich King zones, it's pretty weird story wise)
---
Maybe capndest knows
---
Gee, i never used acronym for it, it's always been deadmines for me. Gueas that is why it becomes an issue now huh because everyone is used to shortening everything
---
when will they learn?
---
I started out on a "high" normal server wanted to remeber what its like on a populated server since my retail server has been dead since MoP lol
---
on what basis are you claiming that blizzard handled the expansion model wrong?
---
surely not on the basis of TBC and Wrath, which both saw huge playerbase increases
---
so what exactly was the difference with Cataclysm? and...every other expansion following that?
---
I mean, I can name one of the differences, and it's a difference that became compounded with each expansion: player burnout
---
and the only way what *you* did in Classic becomes totally worthless in TBC...is if *you* don't attach any value to what you did in Classsic.
---
"at the same time, the expansion has to be exciting enough for people to keep playing"
---
each expansion...is exactly the same thing. just repackaged. kill mobs. do quests. do dungeons. do raids. get gear. new expansion, do it again. new expansion, do it again.
---
blizzard's job is to keep finding ways to repackage expansion content in order to keep us coming back...but they cannot control how quickly each of us burns out. 
---
they cannot control what parts of their game each of us finds 'value' in.
---
I found value in each expansion, and even when i was running around hellfire peninsula in all greens and looking like a clown...that in no way diminished how I felt about what I had accomplished in Classic
---
if that diminished how you felt about what you accomplished in classic, there's nothing Blizzard can do about that. they're *your* feelings
---
I've played since vanilla, just never a cp class until wrath.
---
What if I smite, smite, shadow word pain then wand auto? Or just shadow word then auto until they‚Äôre dead?
---
I started playing this tuesday with a couple of friends! Made it to level 6 after a few hours and was really fun. The weekend is coming up now and I'm probably gonna be playing every night.
---
Playing as a rogue which was my main class back in the days. So far I'm really excited, BUT I'm kind of expecting myself to get tired after a few weeks as I was never a reaaally huge fan of the game. Either way, I'm gonna enjoy the ride and nostalgia and we'll see how long it lasts!
---
Username doesn't check out.
---
This is when last night 3 pvp EU realms were not yet with queue
---
so Blizz expects a fucktonne more players to play this weekend
---
Zygor's
---
But I'm not really happy with it. There's a few bugs and it doesn't have a faster setting. I'd also like one that incorporates running back and training.
---
Happy cakeday.
---
I think the op means the timeframe for new content releases in classic.
---
Ah yes, loot lag. Nothing like sliding around while crouched to tell you that you're well and truly fucked.
---
I think things like auto dismount when you cast a spell and auto stand up from drinking when you cast a spell are QOL changes we can all agree improve the game.
---
I think a guild bank feature would be a no nonsense improvement.
---
These are the sorts of changes I‚Äôd like blizzard to make.
---
At the furthest, I want blizzard to drop the debuff limit, raise armor (or make sunder, faerie, recklessness, etc. not all Stack) and raise raid boss health. 
---
That‚Äôs pretty much it. It‚Äôs lame hunters are useless. It‚Äôs lame spriest are 1 per raid and locks can‚Äôt dot. It‚Äôs dumb hemo just isn‚Äôt a thing. 
---
I don‚Äôt know the health numbers, blizz has data for that. But I‚Äôm also fine with how it is.
---
&gt; There really need to be transfers to these
---
No transfers is no dice. Noone is gonna leave their lvl 15 - 20 chars now.
---
Vol'Jin wants to know your location.
---
I mean, while I HOPE you're right, at least base your comment off of facts and not opinions.
---
&gt;  and give realms to the Spanish crowd.
---
this
---
do it for the good of everyone else lol
---
When I fist started playing in 2006 people told. Me to grind mobs. I had no idea what this mea T and thought that there was some kind of mafia in the game I needed to kill for copper/silver (I had no idea gold was a thing)
---
Why not just click 6 times. Or 8. Whatever your bag size is. I did this for years when we still had a quiver. You don‚Äôt have to do this often.
---
I remember in BC and wotlk there was warrior with nick GeForce who just won every class in duel. I always thought warriors are really good in pvp if played correctly. And in pve warriors are best tanks and quite good dps
---
The information isn't secret, comment doesn't check out.
---
I forgot about the lack of LOS in vanilla. I pulled 4 frost mages in silverpine and thought, no big deal right? Nope, I got machine gun frostbolted through half a mountain and a tree
---
What's going on?
---
That's totally fine. TBC was probably my favorite expansion, but I'm having a blast with classic and will probably stick around for quite some time. Many specs don't really have a well designed niche yet in vanilla, and were sort of finding themselves still. So compared to retail you'll see far fewer prot paladins, survival hunters, balance druids, demo locks, and others. It's unfortunate if your favorite spec is one of the dysfunctional specs, but that's how they were at the time. It's just part of the whole warts and all spiel.
---
So you sold your clothes already?
---
Same tbh. But I gave them badboys a chance in classic. Let's see how it plays out. For now I've learned that "anal [rage]" is popular worldwide.
---
Rogue Warlock Mage maybe Priest
---
Yeah, sounds pretty stupid for such a pretty beast. Originally, in Vanilla, it was even worse. His name was Holzkopf. We now travel as Doombrew and Brewster
---
Rep from them won‚Äôt hurt
---
Hah! Deathwing is just a fairytail creatute solely for scaring children. This guy is just a nutcase.
---
Why don't we try and raise him right instead of just ending him. Such extremes, jeez.
---
that's a warrior weapon
---
Is that just with the 2019s? I had a 2016 trd-sport and miss that damn thing, been looking at getting another.
---
They are just making the queue longer so more people reroll, making the queue shorter in the long run. They are just self sacrificing for the greater good!
---
Didn't Matrox release some signboard GPU's?
---
A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.
---
Did you just used it once or make an autokey press all night?
---
No I can‚Äôt do that  I need my clothes
---
I haven't been able to get on to play much yet (work plus two kids under 5!) and I keep having this nagging anxiety that I'm MISSING it, like the loveliness of the Classic vibes can't possibly last, like everyone is going to ding 60 and I'll be left horribly behind. 
---
It took me four characters and three years to hit 60 the first time round in vanilla/bc, so I have no illusions of being a high end sort of player really, but I'm worried about the low end of levelling getting lonely.
---
Am I being ridiculous?
---
Roll rouge brother
---
Yea but druids generate more rage from autos. But their attack speed is slow like 2.6
---
its all about efficiency in 2019, get with the times /s
---
I always throw a heal on people as I pass by, or flame shock after they tag something as shaman
---
At least the end of vanilla, considering further is what I heard
---
&gt; If "Classic+" to you involves changing what's in classic, I'm not quite sure that's Classic+, seems more akin to Cata light.
---
And noone has ever made that claim. Go back and read the post you originally responded to.
---
&gt; Make Classic+ a world that continues along the same timeline, add smaller content more often so as not to break the world.
---
What do you disagree with in this sentence? Where does he say he wants to change what's in classic? How does "continuing in the same timeline" not EXACTLY DESCRIBE the vanilla WOW update schedule, which was "smaller content more often so as not to break the world"?
---
Either you totally misunderstood his post or you are arguing just for the sake of it.
---
I'm using Questie but I turned "show objectives on map" off. Now it helps me find new quests easier. Perfection.
---
Open with smite, SW pain, and wand if you wish to conserve your mana
---
You're gonna hate level 60...
---
I have been on Jokerd's stream 3 times in the last 2 days. Not once has his face been shown on stream. He's clearly not playing himself having 24/7 uptime.
---
You need an add on to show this information.
---
I level priest and warlock. One in inn one in the field.
---
Warlocks ftw. We Rez the priest so they can Rez everyone else. Best utility in the game:)
---
I saw a guy log in to BNet who was 50-60 when I was about 12 (I'm now 26), I'll have to message him again, did have some chats when I played during end of WoD
---
I mean when you see a rogue called "Dienoob", or other players like "Bfawasbetter" and the like, that's not compliant with an RP setting. Honestly even "Undeadmage" is a stretch but could be swung as a nameless nobody.
---
Well, I'll be waiting in the bushes to stab your friend in the balls.

Quit trying so hard for attention scrub

BY MY BEARD
---
ASSEMBLE THE THRONG, WE SHALL HAVE OUR VENGEANCE
---
Yes, i also prefer not seeing other people in mmos
---
Best part of the game for me is having all my guild issues give me free herbs and I give them all the pots I can for free.
---
Even my incomplete thought contributes more than your rehash of ‚Äúdepends on what your definition of is is‚Äù.
---
He defined what he conceited classic+ as in his op. Your entire point is just debating some semantical position as to what classic+ means to you.
---
RealMobHealth
---
I never cherry picked at all, I asked you a question on what artificial difficulty would be and you agreed. Now you disagree with me. 
---
But I‚Äôm not even going to bother, you threw away my example and ignored the other because some people disliked dark souls 2 for totally different reasons. You‚Äôre not here to discuss anything.
---
get a lot of gear with spirit and regen potions
---
Can you share your UI ?
---
‚ÄúThey hated him, for he spoke the truth.‚Äù
---
Cant believe how little faith blizz had to start with so few
---
Either it was a personal decision or their analysts suck
---
Don't think I've ever seen people be banned, just given forced name changes.
---
Me on my flightpath: Whats this? Water breathing?
---
He meant to say warrior, not warlock. But it‚Äôs honestly a funny typo so He thaught he‚Äôll leave it.
---
:(
---
Brilliant, which server is this?
---
Orc. Racial is 2gud to pass up for dps
---
It's *Garrosh*.
---
Why no Hunter True Shot Aura? smh :'(
---
50 dkp minus
---
Thats so true.
---
Eh, RC isn‚Äôt that bad... you just get into the rhythm of it.
---
Yikes, UI makes this feel like bfa
---
Is there a way to upload a profile of your settings? Looks sick!
---
We have healthstones, at least..
---
NugEnergy is a good tracker for your energy (also tracks rage i noticed in can you switch to warrior)
---
For Combo points im not sure.  
---
I suppose you could use WeakAuras for that
---
I get that you generally don't enjoy classic much. the leveling is slow. the grind is long. many will drop out and it makes sense but it seems so random to level to 22, suddenly go "wait a minute, I won't get a **raid spot**!" and then quit.
---
Better Play freetoplay pay2win games :)
---
I know a lot of people hate that questing has so much back and forth but man the quest chain where you begin to uncover what is going on with the Defias Brotherhood through a series of notes that has you travel from Westfall to Elwynn to Redridge to Stormwind and back delivering the letters is easily the most engaged I've been with WoW in years. I spent 2 hours tonight just running through the world completing this chain and mostly ignoring the rest of my quest log. Admittedly it did get a bit tedious near the end, by which point I had all the flight paths connected so it was more a minor inconvenience.
---
I started on server with 20k queue shazzarah than after few hours of not being able to log in I tried Morgraine 12k queue and than I decided screw it, I WANT TO PLAY! I started on Skullflame with no queue and its glorious:) Best chat ever !! There were actually few times where I had to stop questing because of conversation and lols. Lot of people questing, fight for mobs and so on so on. In my opinion this server is full of people who were mad on queues but eager to play. I like this mentality and I feel like people are determined to have an epic journey :)
---
yeah, back in vanilla my friend and I made bill and ted PCs on a RP realm and went around trying to recruit people to help us pass history.
---
It was fun.
---
I helped out a total newbie today too but she was a mahe so stuff died pretty fast once she got the hang of it
---
You nerd, "people want to be friends with me and I don't like it!". You were new once, don't be a child
---
I feel personally attacked
---
Your best bet is a druid, but they're 100% the highest skill ceiling class in the game.
---
I‚Äôm 14 now. Have to work the weekend but am off the 3 days after that. Hopefully gonna hit 30 so I can get carried to my whirlwind axe.
---
Old school RuneScape alsof doesnt have one right?
---
f
---
What addons are you using? that UI is so clean, i want that.
---
you have to look for addons to see the hp of your targets.
---
for hostile targets you will get an estimated hp number as it cant simply "read" the hp of the enemy.
---
but iirc you will be able to see the exact hp of friendly targets with an addon.
---
Speed is on my blood son!
---
No they didn't
---
This is on Grobbulus.
---
Friends offline for the night. He'll learn of the duel tomorrow. He will do it or a bunch of his friends will make fun of him forever!
---
&gt; except fade and res.
---
mate... You need those. However rank x of that useless healspell you will never use, you can skip.
---
and inflate the problem of queues when layering is removed...
---
there is no easy solution to this
---
Make a Druid. Just reset talents and shapeshift instead of rolling a new alt. Ez
---
I'm actually playing on Razorgore, I just heard is was good from friends who did't want to queue.
---
I didn't count the numbers.
---
There are about 20 more servers in China atm, still increasing.
---
you can actually kill people with fort. ride a zeppelin and cast it on people who are jumping off, since they normally land with ~5% health left they'll die instead
---
Just wand.
---
i love lore! that was one of the things that called my attention for wow.
---
Troll is def better than ne male. NE and orc female is perfect. Orc male is good. Dwarf is not bad
---
Seriously, I still can't get over the fact Blizzard make her warchief instead of any other horde leaders. she's like the last person you would put her in charge of the horde.
---
3 in a row, nice
---
Grudge...
---
Same here. Together for 15, married for 10 and have one guildy of our own. Have been playing wow together off and on the whole time. We were so excited for classic that we moved the dining table in next to the computer table and put the tv in there so we can play side by side properly(as opposed to me being on my lap top)
---
Couples that play together. Stay together!
---
It is not much, but it is honest work.

If you dont explain it to someone they wont learn and you'll keep sending up in these situations.

Going to start tomorrow and was deciding on being tank or healer... I'll go tank after seeing this because it seems that's what's needed
---
probably got ganked and see the run back
---
I got a wand that glows in the dark and it‚Äôs freakin awesome. I always pull it out just for ambience. I love how they did the slight graphical improvements without changing too much
---
This! I even explained to the dps but they only care for big Numbers........

i make it my personal mission to always toss a mark of the wild, thorns and a rejuv on every warri i pass by.

I got heckled in-game for having my fishing at 150 and it was puzzling. 'Waste of time, you should be getting to 60.' Some people are in rush mode.
---
Get that fishing up, all the way to 300 damn it, you're doing good
---
Eff that. Retail has had the same starter zones for five expansions now, seven for draenei and blood elves, four for pandas. When I level on retail I just want to skip all that.
---
What I'm noticing in classic, that I didn't really remember, was that the starting zones didn't start you off as a hero. On retail, you're immediately pretty powerful, you do crazy things and stop a big bad every zone. In classic, you're meleeing tallstriders for 15 seconds because it's actually a pretty even fight, you're carrying water for old tauren, you're ferrying brew for dwarves. You're just a regular member of your race, and you're a novice. The good stuff doesn't come until 10 or 20, and that's usually after a class quest. That's immersion, going through effort to get your most unique skills, just getting out into the world and doing the mundane. Having to read the quests to figure out where and more importantly why you're going somewhere to do something. Instead of just auto accepting and autotracking and running on rails and alt tabbing out when the zones big bad makes a speech because you haven't been paying enough attention to know why he's the big bad.
---
When you sort of get forced, sort of get guided into learning the world, it doesn't really matter whether you have to replace your gear or whether you can pull one mob or three. And the exp bonus especially doesn't matter. Zones shouldn't be a line of going from one quest hub to another, they should have more quests than you need to outlevel the zone anyways so you actually replay them without just powerleveling it as fast as possible because you've already done the westfall investigation and the silverpine sylvanas worshipping a hundred times.
---
Ghostlands and bloodmyst honestly hold up as some of the best leveling zones because you can do different quest lines  every time you play it, and you're still heavily rewarded for doing everything in the form of the blues.
---
Going to try and explain how you make this UI, its really easy apart from the map which is a little fiddly.
---

\- Turn on the buttons/bars for 1-6
---
\- Check the "button grid" button on each one
---
\- Scale at 0.7 for the bars (my resolution is big)
---
\- Start to position the bars how you want them
---
 2. SexyMap

\- Right click on the map to open the options make sure it's unlocked
---
\- Drag it down to the rough position you want
---
\- We'll come back to this later on
---
3. PItbull
---
\- Too many options to list here
---
\- Basically to make it look like mine turn the health bar opacity to '0'
---
5. MonkeyBuddy
---
\- I just turn all the title and buttons off in the options
---
\- Make it grow from the bottom and align to the left
---
6. Masque
---
\- Type in /masque or just open the options for it
---
\- Skin Bartender (not global personally as bags look awful) to Serenity

---
\- Change the "Backdrop" colour option to black with about 70% opacity
---
7. Align
---
\- Type in /align and line everything up while its all unlocked
---
\- Type align again to hide the grid
---
8. SexyMap
---
\- Right click on your map to open the options
---
\- Hide all the things apart from the clock, make that a little bigger and move it to the right
---
1. On the main options page "User Submitted Presets" select Diable by Zork
---
2. On the borders options page - click delete on the Ring layer
---
3. On the borders options page - click delete on the Gloss layer
---
4. On the borders options page - click disable rotation on the cogwheel
---
5. Recolour each layer to black
---
6.  Expand the scale of the Inner Shadow layer to fit inside the new shape
---
Thats pretty much it, use /align to make everything look good again, tinker around with things until your happy etc.
---
Got an update 2 days ago, which resettet ALL my sound settings.. what a hell configuring them back with all the Reaper+VoiceMeter settings. For a non-audio expert, it's pretty confusing to configure it :D
---
After I finally finished it and finished play WoW.. "Update windows and turn of PC".. am I a joke to you!?
---
Just pictured some green haired Gnome around Elweyn Forest RP walking with this [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5FFDj7vH6E) playing.
---
Not sure but some of those minimap features would be great. I miss current target the most.
---
A pet can aggro a full dungeon, that's just vanilla things. Nothing to do with the player..
---
Lol ya me too!
---
it's also why i wouldn't mind if they re-release BC if they rewrote it to make sense
---
I usually exit bnet a few times, it always helps after a few trys. Feels like the download gets stuck at some point a needs to try again
---
The community didn't magically change from Vanilla to BfA to become more selfish and self-involved. Blizzard changed the game to encourage such traits.
---
Now that we are back where we started, in a game that promotes cooperation and community spirit, it has quickly changed back to how it was 15 years ago. Blizzard either doesn't realize how much game design shapes player behaviour, or they deliberately wanted retail to just be a primarily solo experience where everyone is our only for themselves.
---
Now playing: Chillwave comp by Astral Throb
---
This deserves blue post response.
---
It sorta looks like a map of Hyrule Field actually
---
Shit I just thought they looked similar but one is actually a recolour of the other. I think purple came first and they just blurred it a bit and made it green.
---
This post says nothing about extra layers, which I didn't think were even relevant to max pop
---
That's not just pretend. From a canonical standpoint you go back in time to do outlands / northrend because the cata zones take place after those expansions in the timeline.
---
wow Teo is my name on Whitemane
---
What?
---
What do you mean BASED ON THE EQUIPPED GEAR?
---
Based on *what*?!
---
Vanilla exposed only percentage (though I remember one of the private servers providing the actual numbers). 
---
There's a couple of addons that can approximate the HP fairly well by parsing the combat log numbers.
---
Yeah its the same for rogue, you lose combo points as soon as you change targets
---
Osrs is amazing but you can buy gold with bonds. It's expensive but hey. You can.
---
Typical rogue!!! Nice one!
---
I play mage and my roommate plays rogue. We are the same level (19) and he really can‚Äôt function without me. Yes, while mage can be considered ‚Äúboring‚Äù (fireball, fireball, fireball, drink), I find that I‚Äôd rather be in my shoes than my buddies.
---
Free food and water, portals to make money later on, and tons of cc. And as far as world PvP goes, what could be stronger than polymorph into pyroblast? ;)
---
Tough choice to make though, I wish you the best of luck.
---
I don't think it works like that. I got invited into a group that had already tagged that troll with the journal in the dwarf starting area, and when they killed it I didn't get shit.
---
same. it should be more appreciated as the service will stop once i reach lvl 20..
---
&gt; It was solved by adding a ton of new servers and offering free server transfers.
---
Get out with your good ideas.
---
&gt;The data centre that hosts Blizzard's OCE realms experienced 'no outages' yesterday.
---
Well... that may or may not be true. Data centers and cloud providers like AWS can be \*very\* coy and selective about when they notify of outages.
---
U should keep that one but get a more supportive one to avoid your back going!
---
Cake or death!
---
 I have chronic altohilism. I'm just trying to will myself to keep going on with one toon so far I'm at level 13 w/o a second toon. I feel like I need a medal.
---
Wtf diskette slot?!
---
Retail vs classic is just as annoying as ps4 vs xbox1.
---
Yeah basically I just wanted more ways to generate rage so I can more easily tab spam sunder since there isn't much others other than doing damage.
---
Love this setup!
---
Welcome!
---
I never thought I would be this close to oblivion, but I am a lvl 23 Warrior. I hate everything
---
Happy to have had you, and sad to see you go!
---
THINK AGAIN
---
Taking someones mob is same as punching people confirmed.
---
exactly my thoughts
---
the teobagger is going to become a famous meme
---
It's not gatekeeping when it's towards already integrated and even priviledged parts of the community
---
i have a couple of bags in excess so if you find me ingame i can give them to you^^
---
&gt; For the hoard    
---
Nice try, Onyxia
---
Maybe good if your alliance, but if your horde, you stand on top of the spawn spamming your instant attack ability, with as many shaman and rogues in your group
---
Not if they're wearing decent gear. You don't beat Warriors with physical damage. You beat them with magic damage.
---
Make a macro to equip a 1H + shield when you fight Warriors. Use your shocks on cooldown, keep up Lightning Shield, and drop a Searing Totem. You can even kite them around for a bit if they let you. Don't forget to use a weapon enchantment on your 1H when you swap to it (either Flametongue or Windfury).
---
I think there's some onions behind the counter or something. Yeah.
---
And don't let us kill the big protagonists and antagonists of Warcraft 3. It takes away all their weight if any mediocre guild beats the most charismatic characters in the universe.

I mean, being level 22 is just a side note. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind grinding, TBC had it as well and I didn't mind. It's just that I had two days off work and I could throw myself into Classic and then yesterday I had to go back to the office and suddenly those hours of free time spent on a grind to the end game which might not be as good for me (especially with no PvP yet) felt overwhelming. I'm in a tough spot at work and I appreciate the time at home and then it's like 5 minutes in WoW equals an hour in real world and the feeling is aweful in terms of perspective of next working day coming sooner. On top off that I'm running out of husband points gathered before launch and I might have to take care of my women soon :D
---
Got that last night, awesome.
---
the rarity color of the equipped gear. white green blue and so on :)
---
My god, is this what RPing is? Looks really fun
---
Even before restart Hydraxian is mostly low pop, sometimes medium, never saw a queue. Cool server, do recommend.
---
It's ok man the graveyard is just right there
---
Added a small guide above
---
I'm crying. Thank you for making my morning :D
---
Is there a way to see the rogue specific horde guide?
---
Remember what they said. In every other timeline he was the goodest boy ever. It‚Äôs just retail we fucked up.
---
Heh I met my wife in this game, we raided together before we dated, then I moved in with her and we used to play sat next to each other for quite a long time before we both quit. This time around she's not playing but it's very easy to play with family &amp; friends, that's one of the best things about it.
---
let me guess
---
bloodfang gonna have a fucktonne of rogues and they typically go horde so expect a big horde bias common for pvp realms anyway
---
judgement will get more paladins and allies so it might actually be faction balanced
---
https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25098-oGlowClassic.html
---
Ooooooh, about 32 hours.
---
it's the same here on reddit or any public platform. people keep reposting popular opinions to death because it gets them likes by a mindless crowd.  
---
worst part is seeing the chat and having the surveys in mind. these aren't 13 year olds anymore. if you see a "remember gearscore? OMG retail suckz lolz xD" there's most likely a grown man behind that keyboard.
---
anyway, only thing to do is ignore it as best as you can and find a guild with a bearable chat.
---
It's been done so many times already. The latest effort was a Kul Tiran posted here which was actualy funny because that dude looked exactly like Shaq.
---
Flying didn't kill it for me, because world PvP became utterly pointless once WSG and AV came out. Who honestly remembers doing any of the WPvP objectives in EPL, Silithus or Outland?
---
The following things did kill WoW for me:
---
1. Pruning 80% of the game's abilities
---
2. Dumbing down stats to 1 primary and 4 secondary
---
3. Giving everybody and their mother welfare gear.
---
4. Shoehorning players into the exact same raid on 4 difficulty levels.
---
5. Scenarios. The starting scenarios for WoD, Legion and BFA were tedious as fuck and for some parts couldn't be skipped at all.
---
6. Titanforging.
---
7. Removal of talent trees.
---
8. A really horrible and badly written story. See Garrosh Hellscream's character arc as one particular example.
---
9. The redesigned Crapaclysm 1-60 zones. They ruined some of my favourite zones like Thousand Needles.
---
10. How incredibly easy and IQ-insulting quest mobs are in low level content. Classic has brutal zones and I love it. It teaches people to git gud.
---
This post is everything.
---
If you've explained and they still act like this, I'd say ditch them if you aren't desperate to finish what you're doing. I appreciate you mentioning here, because though I haven't grouped up yet, I've had enough people make me feel self-conscious about dps on retail that I'm glad to know I don't have to keep that up to the exclusion of everything else.
---
Full gangbang goin on in there
---
Wait what server where you on
---
Sounds like a great vanilla experience.
---
I gave a Hunter some meat for his cat and he thanked me and explained I was the first person doing so. I got to name his pet in return :)
---
Thanks for the advice, will try to be as helpful as possible.

If im out farming herbs im buffing and healing anyone I see kill a monster even remotely near me.
---
It‚Äôs my opinion that they don‚Äôt like the referendum on the current game, which is why they‚Äôve been childish about this whole ordeal from the start. Even as early as ‚Äúyou think you do, but you don‚Äôt‚Äù.
---
You can beat everyone if you‚Äôre good enough.
---
When I started playing there was a guy in Durotar advertising his Bag Bazaar emporium. Giving out free bags in return for linen. Guy was a champ, creative and funny. Never knew how much fun you could have on an rp server.
---
I'm never gonna forget Abdul the bag man.
---
Everyone starts somewhere!

Ahhh ok. See I‚Äôm not to sure I‚Äôll be playing to level 60 so maybe warrior isn‚Äôt for me. Thanks for the insight!

I think step 3 is /point, /laugh, /cast Hearthstone :p
---
That makes sense. [The retuned and returned Onyixa was 3.2.2](https://www.wowhead.com/news=114566.3/the-return-of-onyxia-patch-3-2-2).
---
Thanks for the PSA. This was really annoying me.
---
we need people to play classic for what it is, not people who play classic so they can get stuff in retail, the 2 games should not be linked in any way
---
Good lord this is the worst timeline for me
---
&gt;I got pathfinder part 1 knocked out
---
I didn't even make it that far.
---
Everything you said. Really can't agree with it more.
---
&gt;I was not frustrated about getting some random drop. I was rocking grey mail gear and did not care.
---
And this especially. I was complaining about it when I played retail a month ago, and my friend said some words that stuck with me. "WoW has managed to make getting gear incredibly unsatisfying. Even aggravating." Is it the right level? Is it epic? Does it have sockets?
---
So much stuff you get is just straight garbage because of the power creep.
---
I've never been huge on tab targeting MMO combat. My perfect game looks a lot like DOOM 2016. But I can still enjoy the social aspect of MMO's, and WoW shines there.

I logged into my old realm last night, to copy some bar layouts. Trade chat was fucking DEAD.

WoW Classic will be the WoW Killer that has been predicted for a decade!!!
---
Next thing you know they will have a long lived Vanilla age and listen to the people and rerelease Burning Crusade because the people ‚Äòthink that‚Äôs what they want.... like they even know. Psh!
---
It sucks but as a mama user you really have to call out when you need a mana break. I agree it shouldn‚Äôt be like that but it is. 
---
Eventually these people will get used to being called for mana breaks and they will start to just look themselves before pulling. 
---
Everyone is so used to just facerolling their way through retail dungeons, we are in the education phase right now, and the players who know better need to be patient and share their knowledge in a non sarcastic way.
---
Second this. Do yourself a favor and don't roll on full servers. Several hour queues are not fun.
---
On a pvp server never had a single bad experience in over atleast 15 dungeon runs.
---
What if they *like* the pain, and need a full rage meter to finish
---
That's how you get burned out, I learned that a long time ago. I only level 1 character at a time, because a whole day can go by messing with an alt. Just choose the one that's easier to level solo. That way later you can fund the more difficult class with AH gear etc.
---
I can give you some Thistle tea, if you like?  It restores 100 energy.
---
The problem is, and I dare Blizz to admit this, that they listened to the WRONG people.
---
They listened to people who play too much. They listened to the people rushing through the game and not socialising only to get to max as fast as possible.
---
To be fair they also listened to the horde of people thinking you have to be like them and complaining if something was to long, complicated or to hard.
---
To them I can only say:
---
You think you want it easier and without social contact. But you don't.
---
There's no room for the weak in Horde :) Sylvanas best warchief
---
i went into duskwood for like 20 minutes to find the flight path and couldn't  so i just walked back out. classic.
---
Can you share it? I'd love to use that
---
Pretty sure because you all agreed to greed he violated ToS and you can get it reverted. Worth a ticket!
---
Don't these buffs cost resources? Why should people spend them on Rando Calrisien?
---
Look at them during off hours. Then you should see which are low/medium pop.
---
You could create a macro for it right?
---
Oh gotcha...it was a joke anyways
---
Yeah, me too. Yesterday I saw: "LF2M DM: tank, heal". Asked them what they already had: Hunter, Warrior and Paladin. No fucking way I join that group...
---
Aww fuck. You're not wrong...
---
Communicate with your team, not with us.
---
As a tank, you're in charge (don't let this go to your head obv). If people don't wanna play by your rules, replace them and wish them a good day.

We need more of morrowind and daggerfall gamedesign in TES6. Too bad we won't get that, Todd Howard probably would tell us "you think you do, but you don't"
---
Damn how many hours have you dropped so far
---
I was not using questie for the first few levels and I missed so many quests and I was completely lost. Queustie helped me a lot to you know find my pathways in my own ways. What really bothered me was this ! and ? was showing up randomly and it confused me so much. And I learned /reload and now it's much better gaming.
---
I wan to use the questie otherwise i'll miss a lot of quests in the map.
---
You bought a level 29 rogue for 11g?
---
Good tbh we need 100k more like you, the queues are still ass
---
This is amazing.
---
Pretty sure me and a friend got  bag from you.. thanks bag man! your the greatest!
---
!remindme 2 days
---
I can‚Äôt understand why anyone watches streamers? Just play and immerse yourself your own game...
---
Hopefully you picked up the flight paths along the way, then it's not totally lost time.
---
I leveled a disc priest in Vanilla almost entirely through dungeon runs. It took me until somewhere around lvl 35 before a warrior kindly explained that I shouldn't bubble them. I still feel vaguely guilty to this day.
---
&gt; It's not even in the same playing field when we compare classic and retail in terms of difficulty and engagement mechanic wise, could the classic community be real sometimes at least, jeez.
---
I just compared the difficulty. You can afk the content in retail. Just because they add 4 layers of difficulty doesn't make it new content.
---
Yes the mythic raids are much harder than anything in Classic but there is an option to afk the same content.
---

The tabard...
---
Is ghost wolf any useful after you get your mount? Or is it only really being used lvl 20-40?
---
Hunters gain something useful from every single stat, and can use almost any weapon. Add the wonky stat distribution in vanilla, and presto, every weapon becomes a hunter weapon... AFAIK.
---
I wonder if you have an add-on conflicting with the self cast? Might need to go through all your add-ons and make sure the option for self cast is on in them too.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cxdq9m/httpsimgurcom5eufqr1/). 
---
I feel you, there are few changes I would love to have in TBC and because I know they are probably going #nochanges I feel no hype at all for potential classic TBC... WotLK in the other hand...
---
Are they higher level? They probably just want to lvl up asap (considering you are lvl 12) to get some talents and skills. 
---
I'd hate it too if we were in a group and i had to wait for everyone to do their own thing in their own way on their terms. 
---
I had to reroll servers/classes so many times, because my friends are changing their mind so often and we only managed to do almost every starting zone. It's so slow it's getting on my nerves  I have like 4 chars lvl 6-7 (lvling with friends that haven't played wow before so i have to explain everything, wait for them to not get lost following me with raid marks, switching so many servers where friends of friends play or where there is no queue )
---
Are they significantly higher lvl than you ? They probably just want to group and do dungeons or some group questing ASAP.
---
If you want to experience the whole classic wow feel and friends are pressuring you for quest addons, feels like you are leveling too slow (for them), otherwise they wouldn't complain enough for you to complain here.
---
Go lvl solo and explore every inch, do every quest if that's your pace... But if you intend to group up and do stuff together you better hurry up. (Not because you NEED to be as fast as possible, but friends are probably waiting for you).
---
Most of us that played before have jobs now and very limited time, take that in consideration aswell. (Though only you might know how much time they have so it's hard to judge).
---
Just two cents from a guy that has to put up with this bullshit and really considering going solo cause i'm not even sure we'll make it to 60 this year at this pace...
---
Classic wow is in a different timeline btw.
---
New player here, what are Basilisks? Are there mobs that are easily killable for decent gold / loot, is so where and at what level?
---
My friend bought me a sub if I promised to learn the game. It was boring at first but now it‚Äôs starting to get better after learning the controls! I can see why it is so addicting lol.

LOL this is straight out of fascist propaganda. That is not an ad hominem attack, that is the historical origin of the contemporary use of the term (leaving aside 4chan). And yes, it is highly emotive, based on kneejerk reactions of eww. Can you actually define this for me?

If you have to ask if a name is good - it probably isn't/you're not going to like.

I thought it only applied to the soul stone.
---
Otherwise how did all those other people come back?
---
The worst part is, there are definitely people who read this and upvoted without knowing it was satirical.
---
Shoulda called yourself the "bag guy". Duh.
---
Quest was such a pain
---
It's caring about dmg from 30-45
---
&gt; I'm sorry is the World of HowsTheWeathercraft?
---
Good one!
---
Literally the biggest idiot in this community, this is how the good old days worked... Friendly, helping each other, people answering your questions if you got one and stuff like that.
---
Retail got so fckn cold and boring

---
A lot.
---
I cant go anywhere without seeing someone in that guild. And. I. Love. It. BIGGLE BOIS
---
Underrated post. Good read really.
---
If I see some one fighting a mob I usually cast a dot to help them out.
---
That's me. Got a level 10 druid, rogue, and shaman. Now thinking of rolling a mage as well. :(
---
I'm also mostly interested in PvP and can't make up my mind at all. I just want a class that's interesting to play (not like priest in pvp for example) and isn't too reliant on gear.
---
You're gunna have confusion when you're non specific as to what you're even talking about when you title your post. Lol
---
I don't know why people downvote me for this. Yes they are sold way too high but if you get your first bag at 17 the investment would have made you gold or saved you hours of running back and forth.
---
Every time I watch a Deadmines run on Twitch I keep thinking "now make sure you go inside and kill Vanessa too.  Trust me, it'll make things easier in the long run".
---
My friend did this aswell. Then he named his new awesome bear WhitePower. He was given 24 hour ban shortly after. Haha
---
Isn't this an eternity for a company of their stature? If fortnite suddenly had outrageous queues for three days straight don't you think Epic would at least communicate with their playerbase about solutions they're working on?
---
Call me crazy but it feels like either Blizzard lied about having the capability to provide mass server transfers, or more likely they don't want to provide free transfers, and are hoping the problem just goes away by pretending it hardly exists.
---
Is grid2  available for classic?
---
I‚Äôve already decided I won‚Äôt camp Humar again. Too much time. I‚Äôm a Dwarf. I have no business sitting in a tree in The Barrens for 5 days waiting for a rare spawn. 
---
But I‚Äôve had it for 15 years as my main pet. He looks so good and is respected by fellow Hunter‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt have the time...
---
Off to The Barrens!
---
He probably tries to gear for balance, but even that does not make a big difference at lvl 12..
---
Yup, mini Diablo here. I like his random flame off he does.
---
Man I have a 16 troll priest,  I couldn‚Äôt do it.
---
Made a 8 paladin yesterday morning on my vanilla guild from 15 years agos server. 
---
Gotta roll paladin again this morning to be with friends. 
---
Rip
---
A few pieces depending on class. Some items from MC or that are craftable are strangly BiS forever. 
---
Fully decked out in BiS tho? Nooooooope.
---
So any guesses on the next Xpac? Black Empire but with a non black title to keep the SJW happy?
---
No, I meant an MMO based on Starcraft.
---
and if you make a regular Troll, you greet Vol'jin personally, while he shows you a vision of Garrosh calling Vol'jin a nasty Troll. 
---
But new Forsaken and Night Elves start in a version of their area where the cities have not burnt down
---
It feels much less like a job and more like a game lol. To me when I was growing up with WoW these kinds of interactions is what I played for. I spent more time dicking around meeting friends than I actually did leveling up and experiencing the end-game
---
_laughs in Fallout 4 style dialogue wheel_
---
Before it was overall population(offline/online) compared to the highest population server.
---
Now it shows current population online.
---
Both of them have their goods and bads.
---
WoW Classic Classic
---
Should've written: doesn't hurt me* my bad for not being precise enough.
---
But I still believe that many people play for old times sake, and many retail mains just hopped over to take a peek and all I would like is that the whole game bashing stops, it's just weird, especially when both games have their target audiences.
---
And wether classic wow is a long-term success will be seen in a couple of weeks or even months, and not day 3 after the release, such strong statements many people spout here are a little embarrassing. But the release and start was a success of course, no arguing there.
---
As others have mentioned taunt brings you to the top of the thread list.
---
Mocking blow and challenging shout force the targets to attack you for a set amount of time without changing the threat meter
---
if there is a person out there who'd be willing to play classic wow hardcore for a year or more to get an atiesh transmog in retail, we need to protect them from their own madness.
---
imagine a guild leader building up a raidgroup for many months. forming bonds with his players. finally finishing atiesh after all this time and going "phew, finally done with this shit. going back to retail to show off my new transmog. so long suckeeeeeeerz!"
---
Hahaha! brilliant! :) ( I love "World of Hows the Weathercraft)
---
Think about a barbarian class which could be  a mix of shaman and warrior and a bard class that so more buffs and healing overtime than any other support class.
---
Got to feed it or it will just leave. Make sure you feed it everytime you rez it.
---
Lack of communication? Sounds like lack of research. Blizz has stated numerous times on the forums and reddit regarding server transfers and how they won't be allowing them for quite some time.
---
They are using transfers as a last resort but first they are waiting for the hype to die down, they're waiting for the people who will stay with classic before they sort realms out.
---
Please do your research first kiddos.
---
If you decide it, then it will become fate.
---
You need to feed your pet cause otherwise it will leave you. Maybe thats the problem? Look at hte icon under his bar.
---
Ummm are you feeding your pet?  Sounds like its running away due to being unhappy.
---
You can craft yourself the devilsaur set later on that is pre-rais best in slot.
---
That's sick. I love little goals like these
---
Let me make it harder for you:
---
Shaman is wanted in everything, especially ele/resto hybrid. You can also change the tide of a PVP skirmish by yourself by becoming the pivot point for heals/buffs .. etc
---
Rogue is one of the best and more reliable damage dealers. You can also change the tide of a PVP skirmish by yourself by taking out key enemy targets (i.e. healers) and disrupting the enemy's backlines
---
Chuck Norris is dissapointed with you now xD
---
haha!
---
Seriously. My server is the one that a large group of Brazilians have started playing on. After about 12a the server turns into mini Brazil. There is so much toxicity about them speaking Portuguese, and I always remind people that they didn‚Äôt get the same service that EU and US got for their servers. They want a SA server, but haven‚Äôt gotten on yet...:( shout out to my Brazilian homies on Thalnos!!!
---
Looks like your friend died
---
Thats the trade off. Be on a high pop server but stuck q and might have already a high lvl char or just swap to a low/medium pop and enjoy the game but start over again.
---
You call in the end.
---
(We had to force one friend to swap to low pop cause he was already lvl 17)
---
Great but I need this in-game. Been looking all morning for a working version of Cartographer or Atlas Map but to no avail. Anyone know a good working map addon, mainly for dungeon maps?
---
It's rare to see somebody actually persuaded by reasonable discourse.
---
An open mind is a precious thing. Take good care of it.
---
*cries in windfury*
---
Private servers were doing extremely good before classic launch but they didn‚Äôt market it, so that‚Äôs we know a little about them. Boom, fact.
---
Keep your pet happy and raise it's loyalty level. If it stays on rebellious for too long it will run away.
---
Dang. Class would be a dps warrior for now. I think they need quite a lot of stuff from MC.
---
You just made me realize Aff Locks with the final talent can take double-Wisdoms and drain the pets mana.
---
Legion was riddled with random mouse acceleration, speed, and other issues. Since Classic is using that client, it looks like those bugs exist again.
---
You can type console commands ("/console rawMouseEnable 1"), but an easier way to see ALL console / CVars (Console Variables) options is to download an Addon named "Advanced Interface Options". 
---
It has a "CVars" browser where you can search keywords like "camera" or "mouse" and adjust all the speeds and raw enables of in-game acceleration and stuff.
---
Its super annoying but this is what solved the issue for me when raiding in Legion / BFA. You can additionally close any third party program for SteelSeries / Logitech that might use to adjust mouse settings as well.
---
Typically messing with the CVars fixes it. Its a super annoying bug and took me a year to fix it in Legion, hopefully you can fix it much faster than that! :)
---
I love it, it‚Äôs taken a long time to get it to where its at now.
---
Dark?
---
*cries in Shaman*
---
This is exactly what I'm doing to "beat" the weekend queues. Nap time it is!
---
Instructions unclear, cut down on sleep to increase playtime
---
Just offer port the Nightelfs to Ironforge. They will be happy as they can be :)
---
"Luckily" my university is about 8 km away, with about 3 km going up a pretty steep hill. The best motivation for biking each day, is that I can waste a whole day coming home, playing WoW with a good conscience (well, at least with regards to excercise).
---
You can move the ui elements around on the screen, I imagine you're turning your head quite a bit like this.
---
Hey man, that stuff you‚Äôre talking about was added in Cataclysm I believe. Vanilla had no markers/arrows/holding hands.
---
It was all about immersion and thoroughly reading the quest text to know where to go :-D
---
When a quest just has the objective :‚ÄôTalk to person X or Y‚Äô, it can not be tracked. Mostly just collecting en kill quests can be tracked!
---
Me too, we have been thrilled how the community is just like the original days - long may it remain so :)
---
I always make sure to stock my pet up on food to keep them in the green meter. If I were to go AFK would it be better to unsummon my pet or does it still continue to lose hunger while being unsummoned?
---
More or less true
---
I'm a paladin and I don't want to be the God Emperor. I'd be perfectly happy being Russ, though. Or Perturabo.
---
Idk about the autoclicker program but no real way to detect autoit.
---
Haha yup. I was setting my camera to get this photo while he‚Äôs was getting attacked. Then he proceeded to agro the mob and walk them up to me so they would attack.
---
I don't and will never understand people who stayed on high-full realms on launch day instead of going to a low pop like I did.
---
Now my low pop shows FULL but the queue is only 30 mins-1h or a max of 2h at peak hours. They warned you.
---
yikes why do these people play mmos if they are that bothered by people lol
---
Is the writing really this bad nowadays?
---
Paladin?üòÑüòÑ
---
Then join when blizz anounces phase 2 O.o they were pretty clear about how phases work.
---
It released the same day as most college semesters. Why release it on a tuesday?
---
I mean
---
When I'm in my 70s I sure damn hope I'm still playing games like Dark Souls
---
Try adding the rank to it
---
/cast \[pet:voidwalker\] Sacrifice(Rank 2)
---
Yep, very annoying. It fixes itself temporarily by spinning the camera very fast for a second.
---
I‚Äôd like to see them do crazy things. Like weekend events at a disco. Or have an olympics in a non pvp zone that all races compete. But not change the core too much. Just my thoughts.
---
Really? I was looking for that. Yes my head gets sore from the 21:9 ratio.
---
I play resto druid. Its what i do. Ive tanked maybe 2 bosses in 10+ years of wow. Now im lvling with friends and tanking dungeons/huge mob pulls when were in the world. Im having so much fun. Im lvl 30 with 3 points in feral, mostly im balance/resto with the goal of playing resto at the end. With me are a lvl 30 pally and a lvl 30 warlock. When we want to dungeon we take the first 2 people who whisper, we feel we are competent enough. Im certain i could heal dungeons atm im my agi/stam gear if i had to.
---
My one friend whos a beta/vanilla vet pointed something out to me. It really doesnt matter what "role" you play until endgame. Spec how you want, wear the best gear you find, try things out. And have fun; as simple as it sounds, it really is whats important in a long haul mmo. 
---
Tldr - no. just be a warrior and play the game. find a comfortable pace and go
---
Do they accept credit cards? I fucked up and lost my debit card in Japan so I am cash broke for the next 2 days
---
Well assuming they don't shut down the classic servers any time soon then yes, you'll absolutely be able to hit BiS eventually if you want to, however keeping up during the new phase releases might be a bit more difficult. If you're starting now/soon however then you shouldn't be that far behind the curve
---
Saw a person at like 1/10 about to die from a spider when we were so close to a safer area and I just healed and buffed them and kept healing till they were safe. They sent me a quick ‚Äúty‚Äù and I really appreciated that! Also love when ppl know you are doing the same quest and its just killing 1 character they just add you real quick so you dont have to wait for the respawn and get to kill the boss faster. Quick thx and leave the party no fuss. Its awesome!
---
I'm dead serious.
---
Damn dude I just want to have fun (rogue). I ran past an undead priest that gave me fort, I targeted him
---
to thank him but got confused from a lack of title, guild and faction icon, I thought it was an npc, so I targeted the others surrounding him. After shifting between the 3 I realised it was a group of people running on the path and by the time I had the priest targeted again they had run out of my target range. 
---
Now I am questioning whether I made the right class choice. If I can‚Äôt buff my peers WHAT EVEN IS THE POINT? /sob
---
Or... just don‚Äôt play retail. It‚Äôs trash
---
Should have AH'd them. What a loser!
---
I really hope, or at least a permutation of the timeline going forward ala OSRS
---
This game will stagnate hard a year or two into it, I know people really don't really want to hear it, but vanilla really can't sustain a large playerbase over years
---
I know the normal response is "but muh private servers" but they were so entirely niche that their numbers are dwarfed by the success of classic, to the point of them constantly opening new servers that will inevitably die when people start dropping off
---
They need a draw, OSRS took RS and kept what made it special, let's hope that Classic can do the same, and retail can stay retail
---
Who do you go to get past 75 tailoring and enchanting?
---
Yes they do
---
Uh... Well that's actually a good question. I don't know. The stones' logic clearly is a mess...
---
here is a list for you 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/fury-warrior-dps-gear-bis-classic-wow
---
Great for pvp
---
You watch your mouth when you talk about my sweet dark lady. When I see that dumbass treehouse all I can think of is fire.
---
So explaining layering makes me a shill. Got it.
---
I don't think they can do that for a few reasons.
---
1. People would get obsessed with collecting transmogs, hurting the Classic experience. You will have people grinding stupid places at high level.
---
2. Some retail players would get pissed because they spend millions of gold on unobtainable transmogs.
---
i love u, i love u all, i love u guildies, i love u realm ppl conversing and battle all the enemies on every quest, truly cant wait to hit up dungeons with all of u
---
I don‚Äôt agree with the working hard exactly. 
---
I love dark souls and hard old school nintendo as much as anyone. But things in classic make sense. 
---
Flying costs a decent amount to make an impact, shitty items can be useful, etc. in an MMO the community makes or breaks it. Having those comforts indeed breaks a sense of community and ruins it for a game like WoW. But on the opposite spectrum, I don‚Äôt think a game like league of legends would exist without matchmaking.
---
You rock bro
---
Fact?  How good were they doing?  Whatbwas their website revenue?  How many monthly players?  What percentage of those players hit max level and continued to play?  How was their server load at peak times?  You can't say something is a fact just because this subreddit talks about private servers frequently.  The vast majority of us know absolutely nothing in regards to just how popular Classic WoW is and will be.
---
lol i started in wotlk and learned quickly enough to hover over that kick button for hunters, afaik the problem still continues on to this day.
---
Disappointed bro. I continued and did my 7000 steps a day. Even with 5 min computer mouse click breaks..
---
bro üòéüí™
---
So give it a few weeks, then the hype dies down and then you and your irl friends can play with little/no queue
---
No chance
---
Hunters provide that trueshot aura bro
---
Id love this too.
---
Strength gives rogues AP and is a useful stat
---
Your all part of a social experiment, always have been.
---
a friend of mine has a macro saying  "Stamina Koyim" everytime he uses it xd
---
What‚Äôs the bag add on?
---
How exactly is clicking on a button in a menu screen "engaging with the world"? The LFG tool is exactly the kind of thing that pandered to the lowest common denominator. It was literally for people who didn't want to engage with their community. 
---
MMOs aren't giant lobbies. They're social games set in giant open worlds. They aren't as fun when people aren't encouraged to socialize and get out in the world. The lack of an auto-grouping tool encouraged people to find guilds and friends to group up with so they didn't have to just spam chat all the time.
---
The game likes to fuck with me, I kill what seems like 20 boars and get nothing then 5 in a row drop them.
---
The go on a low/medium pop server. Its not too late to change since you're only 17.
---
Thanks. It's not actually easy for some (me) to pick that up in text. Lol I'm a donkey...
---
This is amazing, if you are not stuck in the queue 8 to 10 hours a day!
---
I'm having a blast
---
Doesn't change the fact that the reason this is happening in the first place is because Blizz cheaped out on how many servers they launched.
---
Maybe they could take note of what PoE is doing, leagues that run for a few months, special events, like  +xp and additional items and stuff for each league, do a few changes to mobs let them drop more or different things
---
Download Azeroth auto pilot classic add on. It will tell you what quests to pick up and gives you an arrow that points you in the direction you need to go
---
I am talking in terms of the server‚Äôs density, economy and stability, they were doing just fine and now that classic is out and many switched over, it‚Äôs gonna be even more fine.. It‚Äôs inevitable
---
Don‚Äôt go on a over populated realm! HOLY SHIT people its not that hard!
---
That concept sucks and would ruin classic wow
---
Damn I wish
---
Pretty sure servers can hold 20-30k people. Before they updated population ques were 17-18k on my sever after adjustment no more then 5. 
---
So yeah medium pop is probably like 15k people still lol
---
Hi, /u/MrSatan2
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cxduoz/what_do_you_think_is_the_most_popular_class_rn/). 
---
Wholesome :3 agree completely, all of this makes playing priest so fun for me
---
That is indeed true. They do have an easier time getting first blood though, because of stealth.
---
For a "safer" chance in pvp, a mage is the safer option. Frost mage specifically. You can kite most melee classes and deal nice dmg to boot
---
I am pretty sure there will be server transfers down the line if the populations don't settle on their own. But it's been three days. Blizzard will wait and see, sometimes problems like these solve themselves by people spreading out naturally, "tourists" dropping off etc etc.
---
But why continue to stubbornly level on a full realm and wait for a transfer off the realm, instead of simply starting a new character on another realm now while there's not much time invested yet?
---
This seems up to date: https://dotesports.com/news/wow-classic-race-to-world-first-level-60-leaderboards/amp
---
AMEN!
---
Thx! Is there a list for  arms pvp as well?
---
Those are all perfectly valid points, but at the same time... They kinda also are what classic is all about.
---
If you don't enjoy them, then you have to work around them (play with friends or play something like a hunter) or... Well, maybe classic isn't for you?
---
Ouch...
---
Hope you have it set to random intervals
---
Id guess ashenvale or Hillsbrad
---
nsfw
---
We also open doors, and lockboxes. Am I supposed to apologise for getting you into stratholme, or getting you your first epic? Hell naw! I may not pull my weight in dungeons because I rather pickpocket than dps, but by golly I contribute somehow!
---
Good luck mate! Common sense &amp; knowledge, but make sure to check AH for new weapons every few levels. it matters more than skills if you are really short on money. an up-to-date green weapon with good dps will make leveling a warrior solo much more bareable. and good first aid is paramount!
---
your going to have a really bad time soloing, even questing with 1 person changes everything, its basically like doing double damage and taking half the damage
---
Night Elf Priest solo. I was stuck on the quest to get the 4 relics for over an hour because I kept instantly dying! Thank god a group finally came in the area to clear out so I could actually play the game. Made sure everyone was topped out on health and resurrected the leader so he didnt have to travel all the way back. I love how everyone just wants to add you to parties just to help everyone out and don‚Äôt expect you to stay. They were all super friendly and we made sure to buff each other before we all split.
---
I caved and am just remaking. 3 RL friends are on skeram, I have no choice.
---
Sure. Every zone has a different story and it is kind of nice to read about what is happening and why you are doing what you are doing.
---
Also, without an add on, you have no idea where to go and what to do without reading the quest.
---
I haven't done it myself , but I think you can right click the unit frames and click unlock allowing you to move them around.
---
They already said nothing will transfer between retail and classic besides people the original collectors editions pets.
---
You should try to check out Ashenvale or Stonetalon if you havn't been there already :)
---
A big appeal to classic are the horrendous graphics, really get the nostalgia juices flowing.
---
No one is laughing bro. It's legit one of the BiS for the 20 25 26 range for warriors.  
---
I'm rocking it since 21. (Well, I have another one from a dungeon since yesterday for 1 DPS more, but still a staff)
---
I would look up the pvp sets for the class you want to play. They get released in phase 2. Some are fine and some are shit. None of them other than the warrior and rogue weapons are best in slot however afaik.
---
i played in vanilla, we always called it RS for ripsnarl
---
Streaming for the neighbourhood
---
Virtual legal contracts ü§î
---
lmaoooo
---
I suggest grouping more aggressively. Especially in the 10+ zones you will find a lot of chained "Kill x" quests that might take 30 minutes to do solo and 5 minutes to do in a group. Above that, if you are really stressed, get Questy or one of the other quest addons. No reason to stress yourself out over lack of convenience features for authenticity.
---
I miss this too! I took pride in my dance moves back in the dizzay.
---
My buddy boxes csuse he has a tighter schedule and is gonna be lvling alone. He finds a nice quiet place and just grinds. Hes still present, still playing the game, and not hurting anyone. This isnt retail where he can mine 10 nodes at once or anything. He spends silver on the ah just like the rest of us to gear (each of) his character(s), fueling the economy buying shitty greens and overpriced trade mats (likely sold by players who need the few silver more). Why is it a problem? 
---
Youre more likely to get your quest mob stolen by groups of organized questing friends.
---
I believe so - I've installed it (from twitch classic addons) but not had a chance to use it yet, but it certainly *was.*
---
My fucking throat man
---
Total noob so that ain‚Äôt happening anytime soon lol
---
Ghost Wolf is instant cast, mounting takes 3 seconds, which is a Long time if someone is trying to kill you.
---
 Barrens - Stone talon mountains - ashenvale
---
I very strongly agree with this sentiment.  
---
The fact that some builds are seriously inferior for raiding is a big problem with Vanilla, and one of the reasons I prefer TBC.  That being said, as someone who does not want to play a seriously inferior build for raiding, I just wouldn‚Äôt roll something like an enhancement shaman in Vanilla.  
---
Yes, it sucks that our class choices are so much more limited from this perspective, but I still think you could find a lot of gratification playing a build that is strong in the end game.
---
I'm curious too but I don't think those info are available sadly. I hope they are.
---
Where is the 4:3 monitor you sick fuck!?
---
Doesn't work in classic
---
I tried it on a pserver and for me it was more of a hassle than it was worth. Still lvld the shaman to 60 in a reasonable time.
---
Weird flex.
---
Go on the date, talk about nothing but talent points and kobold candles. If she doesn't get the reference you'll be home playing in no time!
---
The only thing that can fix this, is free server transfers once the queues are gone (if ever).
---
Many communities have split up due to the queues. I can understand why. Not everyone has a chance to beat that queue and honestly, you shouldn't need to plan your gaming 5 hours ahead of time.
---
The Danish community decided along with the Nordics to start on Shazzrah. This took a lot of work (which I can't take credit for!). Then we had to move due to the server filling up. That was the first split. Sweden went another way. Now Firemaw has horrendous queue times and many people have left for different servers.
---
Personally I've lost more than half my gaming buddies to different servers, even-though we were all on the same server to begin with. And it fucking sucks!
---
The only thing that can save it is free server transfers.
---
(I posted this in another thread as well)
---
Wait what? You wouldn't? That's highly upsetting
---
Yeah nah
---
I think this is correct.
---
Honestly, I am kinda into the style of a simple beige design. These days everything is flashy, black, in hard to clean shapes with weird surface textures and extra fluff that no one really needs. All the peripherals and your case shout: "I am easy to clean, and when I get dirty people won't even notice! Oh and also I will last for 10 years without breaking!"
---
25 now but have work so i pray i get close to 27
---
Waow, wish I had a setup like that. Truely amazing
---
I still never fully recovered at how bad season 8 was. What a waste. Good thing I have classic now
---
Go to Fade -&gt; Texture Tint -&gt; Drag the A (Alpha) bar down to 0
---
Old Blanchey is where it‚Äôs at! Lots of fun and ppl, no Q
---
Hahaha..  look at earrior statistics 
---
Anyways, i would roll rogue or hunter for world pvp
---
I dont know how well hunters do, but they are fun
---
Is that working for the whole session? Is it just to remove it right now?
---
I'm pretty sure they will fix the bug, at least the fact that it stays red for ages even when
---
It's ok, the game isn't for everyone. If it brings you more frustration than joy, you're free to quit or go to Retail version which is much more forgiving.
---
I don't disagree with anything! Haha.
---
I help unless they snipe kills out from me when I'm clearly casting on a mob... half the time these people are so gung-ho they charge into a pack and die and I leave them to it
---
You would enjoy Trent from Punchy on YouTube.
---
The problem will go away. People will run out of vacation time, school starts for most people, and people will get bored.
---
Thanks just got it! ü§ó
---
We rerolled on one of the realms that opened on release day and still have 7 hour queues. Every EU server is full.

Lol, I have my outside in the form of running, excersing and office, but when I take a leave I don't see the sun.

Anytime a lock casts that shit on me I click it off. I will not be insulted in that manner.
---
Nah that would be a very reasonable , non disruptive add-on, no hate here.
---
Nope they were were roughly 20g a pop in tbc
---
It is almost worse in vanilla/Classic, to be honest. A guy decked in full BIS Naxx gear is going to absolutely demolish a BIS non-raid geared person, and you won't ever get into a Naxx-raid playing casually.
---
Hahaha so true. And I‚Äôm already feeling the need from people for my sweet tanking ways.
---
I'm really struggling between Hunter and Mage. Hunter is enticing for the Solo potential but I do love casters and I imagine Mage is top tier when it comes to aoe farming. I'm probably going to be doing both PvP and PvE really so just quite stuck at the moment.

You are a good man. Thank you.

I would have thought they‚Äôd go the other way - add TBC/Wrath only on some/new servers (depending on population) and offer transfers to those servers in advance. Given the mixed reaction to changes in the expansions‚Äô clients, I suspect a bunch of people will expect at least some servers to stay on Vanilla indefinitely.
---
I'm kicking this around but can't think of a good answer. Is it better to wait for my leveling partner, or out level them? 
---
He has to work, but I'm at home all day (doing online classes for college and looking for another job, I got shittons of time). I have two characters currently but I'd rather be leveling my Priest rather than an alt I don't want to use at 60. 
---
If outleveling is better, how far ahead should I stop at? I'm just so damned excited to get to the 30s where I enjoy questing the most.
---
I always loved taming inconvenient or rare appearance pets in vanilla; as an Alliance hunter, Echeyakee is both!
---
Depends really what race. Night elves starting zone is full of lore, so is orcs. Trolls don't have much of lore in the initial area but they do have a village. But not every zone has lore related to every race. For instance I won't expect too much night elf lore at the dark portal, but in sylithus they have a bigger presence.
---
So any gnoll quest?
---
Definitely one of the reasons I went to RP-PvP server. The RP part works as a nice filter.
---
Doing both is epic
---
Prettu sure I raided in vanilla with at least 4 other druids. As long as you were healing spec, you were needed. I changed to priest now though.
---
Garrosh was considered one of the best warriors ever. There's a reason they gave Varian anime powers to beat him. He's the warrior hero of Hearthstone. 
---
Saurfang's been ruined anyway in retail.
---
at the bottom left of the list there is a pvp section
---
Earlier someone was poking fun at me for how slow I was leveling my warrior, and a bunch of people came to defend me in chat. I wasn't bothered or anything, just found it interesting people seemed to care having a more friendly attitude.
---
Holy shit, are you training for a marathon on  a treadmill? That sounds like double the torture.

Yep! It's a DIY job I did last month using a Teensy 2.0 and 3D-printed housing.

Looking for some casual EU players to play with. I'm from Ireland and just want to enjoy the game doing professions, leveling, pvp and eventually raiding. I'm actually reading the quests as I go so that may give you the indication of exactly how fast I plan to do this first 1-60. Can only re-capture that magic once!
---
Mind. Blown. I was expecting to have to do some horrible death run to get back to TB quickly when I hit 14 - thanks for this info!
---
Alliance Hydraxian Waterlords player, my experience is Hunters &gt; Mages &gt; Priests &gt; Warriors. I suspect there are more Warriors, but they're all just running back to their corpses.
---
I agree that scaling is super dumb, but I do think that expansions should've avoided raising the cap. It was fun for an expansion or two, but it quickly lead to the power creep and need for catch up mechanics that ruined the game.
---
Thanks! %Target worked &lt;3
---
Thank you! My patience has run out though haha. I would be close to 40 by now!!!
---

Omg that 60% &amp; that music generator thingy. Both love those pheriphials

on Monday and Tuesday I didn't spend more than 30 minutes in queues due to having days off and logging early and then yesterday I just used my remote desktop to queue while still at work and it was done when I came home.. that's not that big of a deal, but you might be correct.
---
You can play the game however you want but with wand spec I literally do more damage than chain casting smite or mindflay for 0 mana, you can really only keep up with wand damage until pw: shield breaks and you begin getting casting interruptions. The only time I‚Äôve ever stopped to drink is when healing dungeons.
---
Same here. Funny thing is, I wasn't expecting a leveling experience that would be more fun than BFA end game, and for all of BFA's issues, the raiding in the expansion isn't one of them.
---
Ok thx heard bear can tank 90% of the content and are better early on because they are less gear dependent than warriors... Have a friend who will play warrior tank, so we would probably fit well together?(in raids)
---
Dont want to go cat because of powershifting all the time sounds annoying for me.
---
So it be probably 80/20 tank heal.
---
Thought about herb/alchi too do that sounds right.

Thx for your insight! :)

Im debating between Druid or Priest. I played priests back in LK i do enjoy healing but i feel if i want to mix it up i will have to re-roll. Are druids viable healers or are they a bit out shined? Thank you.
---
Me too and it fucked up the settings in my OBS. Now I have the Ashvane first kill of my guild without sound... fucking updates.
---
None, ive got full bags and pick up almost anything and sell it which has given me 70ish silver alone, the rest I‚Äôve got from selling 3 greens. It‚Äôs not actually one gold yet it‚Äôs only 91 silver.
---
thanks for the solve mate!
---
I mean, that's a dubious claim. BFA's writing is miles worse than WoD's, but at least it has content.
---
For Alliance on Gehennas it's Mages , Warriors and surprisingly Warlocks. There are just so many of them !!! 
---
Least played is Druids and Rogues.
---
Played wow from the start. Read all the dialogue. Two reasons:
---
1. Otherwise you won't be able to complete the quests. 
---
2. The stories really are nice. They give you a sense of purpose in this world. Leveling actually is fun when you read them.
---
They're real artifacts from bronze age civilizations, usually within the fertile crescent. They were mentioned in the Epic of Gilgamesh as long knives (because that's basically what they were). Although, study indicates bronze long knives were mostly ceremonial and not actually used for warfare.
---
Get and addon, they can point you where to go, what quests to take, where to find the mobs etc.
---
&gt;But I still believe that many people play for old times sake, and many retail mains just hopped over to take a peek and all I would like is that the whole game bashing stops, it's just weird, especially when both games have their target audiences.
---
Sure, many are playing for old times sake and many are retail mains. However, these people are not the ones who would sit in 10 hour queues of 17k people just for "old times sake" or "to take a peek." People just like to downplay it and I get it. I would too if I cared about the future of retail.
---
&gt;And wether classic wow is a long-term success will be seen in a couple of weeks or even months, and not day 3 after the release, such strong statements many people spout here are a little embarrassing. But the release and start was a success of course, no arguing there.
---
It's actually far from embarrassing if you take a look at what happened to Jagex and RuneScape. It's very much a possibility that Classic may become the popular version of the two games, and that it will eventually overtake BFA in playerbase if Blizzard sees revenue in fresh 60 content post-naxx.
---
Classic is good for retail. It's already far more popular than anyone expected it to be. Hopefully, it forces the retail Dev team to realize that they need to make their game for their player base instead of trying to accommodate every single type of gamer out there. That's why their brand new expansion was overshadowed by the announcement of the 15 year old version of the same game, two Blizzcons in a row.
---
It must burn the new developers that people are flocking to the Classic servers and they cant keep the Live game at half pop.
---
Now maybe don't press need on emberstone staff when the priest needs it.
---
Loved this post!! I'm at work with a big, stupid grin on my face, waiting to get back home to play again tonight

Hey old thread but I was in MiK from the very early days. I started focusing on real life sometime towards the end of BWL progression but was in for all the first kills leading up to that.

Are you able to bandage while running? Or is that not a thing in classic anymore

Oh wow, wouldn't have thought of that lol. Thanks for letting me know!
---

---
This is not the place I thought I would find a mention of the Bilderburgs
---
Man that cant be healthy, these guys not sleeping?
---
Yeah because every level 20-something mage/priest/Warlock totally isn't running around with the Red RFD robes and Crescent Staff...
---
Yea up until you get rank 2 mind blast at 16 it‚Äôs barely worth casting. I mainly use it as a quicker way to guarantee I get the tag on mobs and then pw: shield plus wanna means you end most fights at 90-100% hp and 100% mana.
---
Well that's what method did right? They literally stream one guy playing all their accounts. That against tos. I'm not here to argue it, I'm just saying the tos says no account sharing.
---
Yea well, the realm is still pretty fresh and not many are that high, the highest people on Deviate Delight are just now reaching into their 30's. 
---
I have also had both Characters added to my friends list to try and keep tabs and they haven't even really been online. I check very periodically.

God damn.. 60 IRL friends who play WoW as well?

---
My group sat in Faerlina quad for like 2hr or more launch day. We got lucky and hopped on rattlegore like 5-10 minutes or less of it being opened bc only 2 of our 15 actually got in. Those couple that spent 3-4 hours leveling weren‚Äôt too bummed. Everyone is happy and no ques.
---
My best advice as people have also said is Grouping up. If you see a guy killing the same mobs as you ask them if they want to group.
---
Not only is it more enjoyable but the quest will go so much faster and you'll kill more mobs together.
---
Cata launch was the best time I ever had in the game. 
---
Then they decided that the game shouldn't be challenging, and that you shouldn't even need to socialize in order to play (LFR). They had already decided that you shouldn't need to **be** in the world (flying mounts + LFG), so RIP WoW.
---
Why not both? :3
---
Stupid sexy alien space goats.
---
It's aight it happens. You aren't the only one who fell for it
---
&gt;And noone has ever made that claim.
---
No one has ever made what claim?  That Classic+ involves changing classic?  Are you saying no one has said that?
---
&gt;Then you update a few older areas to respect the new state of events and things are go.
---
That's what you said.  That's changing classic.  No way around it.
---
If you're referring to some other claim, then I'd suggest you be more clear in the future.
---
&gt;What do you disagree with in this sentence?
---
I think I made it very clear about my thoughts in the first post.  You cant meaningfully/recognizably progress the storyline.  You cant  "continue along the same timeline."  You're stuck in one point in time for all intents and purposes.  Any progression through the timeline will make the classic stuff no longer make sense. You'll be jumping back in time which is exactly what the (actual) OP was complaining about.
---
You can only make additions that can exist in the same time as the classic content.
---
That's the issue I'm trying to highlight.
---
Enhancement can have a spot in raid with nightfall axe and wind fury upping the damage done to boss, in fact enhance is preferred for this role.
---
Also, most people aren‚Äôt going to be that bothered about having optimal class/specs for raiding, i think many people see it as a casual experience rather than sweaty hardcore like it was for a number of people originally. 
---
You could just find a guild that wants you to come along regardless of class/spec. That would be my advice although I suspect it‚Äôs more than just long queues and enhance shaman not being super amazeballs.
---
Every census data ive seen has put warriors and mages at the top.
---
something big is probably in works for Diablo and it'd be pretty awesome if it was a MMORPG
---
I can confidently say that during classic my top raiding guild didn't even know what IO was. I still don't.
---
But I‚Äôm still getting PMs
---
You just did 2 hours after the fact again :)
---
You've obviously never vised Ashenveil.
---
Just look out for people auto-hitting mobs that are quite a bit below their level.
---
They level their weapon skill, so don't help em.
---
Anyone else? Feuer frei!

Disappointing at all the time wasted but hoping that the move was worth it. I went from Farelina to Smolderweb and now Im on Skeram.
---
I waited for the que on day one on Farelina for 7 hours and then leveled to 16 but the next day when the que was at 30k some of my friends decided to go smolderweb. And then some wen Skeram.

I rolled smolderweb and got to 21 then my friends on Skeram refused to move so we decided to move there because we felt like smolderweb is going to die off.

Only reason why it does is back then a lot of players did not use neat UIs etc. I was little boy without any knownledge of How to Make UI Not Look Like A Fuckin Garbage.
---
How difficult is this to do alone? I'm level 12 right now and probably won't be doing Deadmines runs, but I could certainly go to Westfall and try my luck with the regular Defias mobs. My fear is that the amount of Alliance players will make it impossible :[
---
Lots of us have been playing since launch with a few of us playing on private servers and some of us are completely new to the game all together! It felts too good to be true to finally get everyone in one place, it turns out that unfortunately it was.
---
The early levels are always the shittiest in Classic because gear is hard to come by and you don't have the skills to grind through those mobs effectively.  Don't feel too disheartened if you die a few times because it does get better.  Your character is supposed to be weak at the start, thats the great thing about classic.  The slow transition from weak to all-powerful is a long and arduous journey.  That is what makes leveling in classic so special.
---
Hello my fellow nogger! How do you do?

The only one that I wouldn't even learn is the one where you can see through its eyes. Other than that I would bind all of them other than the resistance ones. But still have them on your bar. And as soon as you got wf totem you don't need the fire totem anymore.

The game thrives on community. If you act a fool then you're likely to be shunned over time. Sure, you can get away with being a ninja looter or a dickhead, but sooner or later karma will catch up to you.

This is one of the main reasons I started playing wow classic. I never played wow before (except for about a week before classic release, just to get used to it a bit).
---
Cash shops are for me the worst things that happened to MMOs. Even if its only cosmetics,  its still gamebreaking for me. The point of MMOs for me is earning the prestiege (mount skins, weapon skins, armor, pets...whatever they sell) by playing. Even though I dont have the time to get the best things, I still want to see other players have them. I want it to be clear who invested the time and beat the hardest content.
---
&gt; Good day everyone, I'm new to the community and just started playing a few days ago and I had a few questions about the game I was hoping you could help me with. Also sorry if the format sucks I'm on mobile.
---
Hi! Welcome to the Classic community :)
---
&gt; It seems like from the videos and posts I've seen most people are trying to make sure they're characters fit specific roles for the dungeon/raiding scene.
---
There are typically 3 main roles that make up a full dungeon/raid team, being the **DPS** (Damage Per Second), **Healer** and **Tank** roles. I think they mostly speak for themselves in a broader scope but for example one Healer may fulfill a slightly different role than another, even though they will both fit the Healer role. Below is an explanation taken from [here](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Class_role).
---
_____
---
**DPS:**
---
* **Melee DPS** - deals large amounts of damage at point-blank range. The rogue is the ultimate melee DPS class.
---
* **Ranged Physical DPS** - deals large amounts of physical damage from afar (the difference between physical and caster DPS is that physical damage can be blocked/reduced by armor, whereas magical damage can be resisted/reduced through resistances, not armor). The hunter is the only class in this category.
---
* **Ranged Caster DPS** - deals large amounts of magical damage from afar. The warlock and mage are both very good at fulfilling this role.
---
AoE (Area of Effect) DPS - deals damage to multiple targets simultaneously. The mage is the perfect class for this, but many others can also do well in this role.
---
______
---
**Healer:**
---
* **Single-Target Healer or Tank Healer** - heals a single target over an extended period of time. paladins and Discipline priests make excellent tank healers.
---
* **Raid Healer** - heals multiple players either simultaneously or over a very brief period of time. The shaman excels at healing melee groups, the Holy priest does very well in large, spread-out groups, and the druid does well in situations that involve large areas with lots of movement.
---
* **PvP Healer** - heals in PvP combat. This takes additional skill and know-how. Each class can fill this role, but they do so in different ways: druids are able to sneak and heal on the run; shamans can armor up with a shield and self buffs, making them difficult to take down even if they aren't moving; priests utilize magic shields and multiple healing techniques to survive; and paladins are able to survive extreme damage in many situations due to their shields and protective buffs.
---
* **Support Healer** - heals when needed, supporting other healers in the raid/party. Again, all healers can fulfill this role, but often the druid and shaman are considered best.
---
**Tank**
---
* **Single-Target Tank** - tanks and holds threat on a single target in a group setting.
---
* **Small-Group Tank** - tanks and hold threat on 2-4 targets in a group setting.
---
* **Large-Group Tank or AOE Tank** - tanks and holds threat on 5 or more targets simultaneously.
---
* **DPS Tank** - deals high amounts of damage while tanking.
---
____
---
As you can see your Night Elf Hunter would fit the Ranged Physical DPS role and that will be the only role available because Hunters are not capable of being a Healer or a Tank.
---
_______
---
&gt; Is this something I should be concerned about now 
---
This is up to you. If you read the above and have decided that the DPS role does not fit you then I would recommend changing to a class that can do something else. The Druid is the only class that can fulfill every role in the game, but they are never (grain of salt) the best at any of them.
---
&gt; is it possible to ruin a character by picking wrong skills and stats? (I chose a night elf, Hunter)
---
It is and it isn't. This game is 15 years old and people have had plenty of time to figure out the most optimal skills and gear choices for every class and playstyle. Does this mean you will have to start over if you don't follow this to a tee? Definitely not. They typically are the best choices for min/maxing but anything will work as long as you're having fun with it.
---
If you make 'wrong' talent choices, you can always reset them at a class trainer for a fee. This fee isn't too much but it can stack up and it is recommended to avoid doing this as much as possible.
---
&gt; Should I be concerned about joining a guild now? I've been just taking my time and doing quests and then when I get bored with those I go fishing or work on skinning/leatherworking. I've joined a few groups to compete quests but not actively looked for a guild. It seems like a massive part of the game so I was wondering if I should start now or if it will be fine to worry about it later.
---
Guilds are typically what you would join for a more tight-knit community and is also how you will mostly organize raids in the endgame. They are not at all required to join but a good guild will definitely make the game much more enjoyable.
---
There are many ways to find guilds. The most intuitive way is to simply find one ingame. Many guilds will be advertising and it isn't uncommon for people to be invited to guilds through playing with them in quests and/or dungeons like you said you have done. Being social in-game is a great way to make friends that might lead you into a guild. There are options outside of the game too:
---
* This subreddit has a [Looking for Group (or Guild) Monday](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3ALFG%2BMonday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) thread that, as the title suggests, opens up every monday and allows people to find others to play with.
---
* The official WoW Classic forums have a guild recruitment area where you can take a look. [EU]https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/c/wow-classic/wow-classic-guild-recruitment) - [NA](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/c/wow-classic/wow-classic-lfg-lfm)

---
&gt; Will I be able to enjoy the endgame raiding/dungeon content of I'm a more casual player? I can really only play for 3 to 4 hours a day on weekdays because I work and have a life outside of the game. I'm worried about that making me less useful to a guild.
---
Personally I think one of the best things about Classic is that you can go at it entirely at your own pace and not fall 'behind'. Of course there will be people who complete all the content way before you will, but there is zero pressure to speed up. Blizzard has not officially announced any additional content to be released outside of [these content phases](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346). They will be rolled out over the next year or so. People will be racing to get this content done first, but there is no incentive to do so other than prestige or getting to a new economic market before other players do, maximizing their in-game profits. 
---
I am in the same boat as you and have reached level 14 so far, falling behind most of my guild mates and friends who are sometimes as much as twice my level already. Luckily this doesn't matter in the end and a good way to look at it is that you will be able to enjoy the game for much longer than the people who are fast :)
---
&gt; I have so many questions about this game and I've been really loving it but I'll stop here because this post is already very long. Any information would be greatly appreciated.

If you have more questions you can take a look at the weekly [Simple Question Sunday](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3AQuestion%2BSunday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) thread that is posted here every week (on Sunday!) Maybe someone else has had the same question answered and otherwise you can post your question again next Sunday. You can also ask questions anytime on the [subreddit's Discord](https://discord.gg/classicwow), this is probably the quickest way to get everything answered.

No.

Yo is tarren Mill vs westfall (or whatever the alliance base is called ((I never played alliance except for beta))) still a thing? I have old memories of just logging in to fight for hours on end and not even touch my experience bar.

Yeah, the same happened to us. Rolled on Whitemane on name reservation launch, got all our names. The guys that took the week off got in on launch and were able to level just fine, wake up early when there wasn't a queue, and make it to 30+. Now all the guys who had to work haven't really been able to play, so rolled on Thunderfury and the rest of us now need to decide if we want to abandon our 30+ characters that we've been leveling all week. Really not fun. Really wish Blizzard would at least make a statement on if they will do xfers and how they would work.

Those of us who are playing on razorgore said that if we could get onto firemaw we would restart. But now there are a few people on razorgore that have played 30+ hours so it's become a little more difficult to manage.
---
Thanks for your sentiment! I feel like our best hope is if blizzard decided that in order to reduce population from the full servers they allowed people to transfer off them to the new servers. Though I don't imagine that would be soon.
---
Can't track beasts + herbs/ore as a Hunter, either.
---
We tried this approach with razorgore the day after release but unfortunately our friends on firemaw where not as eager to leave their characters behind.
---
As a warrior I realky prechiate your underwater buff soecial in westfall for that damn prirate quest
---
Yes it did. Lol
---
Agreed, that music and setting is just wonderful
---
on fairbanks its 15s  lol  i had  3g by then due to the AH
---
Whatever you will enjoy. Pick one.
---
Which addon are you using for player/target frames? Is that ShadowedUnitFrames?
---
Sorry mate, I am doing my best. Just woke up and I hope I can be here when someone ding 60.
---
That sounds exactly the same. Fingers crossed blizzard help us out!
---
Then how will people know how great this community is? We need to constantly shit on retail so that they know they're all gatekeeping elitists, and we're all altruistic, selfless, humble philanthropists.
---
I found my grey cloth shoulders on a murloc in Redridge. I shouted, elated with pure joy and then ran to shore to take a screenshot. I haven't done that in retail in years
---
For Pala it doesn't mean that much. Unless you really want to min/max then Stoneform is considered pretty good in PvP mostly.
---
Personally just go with whatever you think looks cool. I personally think Humans have better melee attack animations than Dwarves.
---
Plenty of theads by the way, please use the search bar.

Thank you very much :)

You shouldnt have been stupid and sat in that damned queue and rolled yourself a new character on a LOWER populated realm, what is even the issue, its been like this on the biggest realms since 2004 and here you are in 2019 NOT experiencing classic cause you are being stubborn about a perticular server, you obviously care since you are on here ranting, just stop being a strongheaded idiot and make a new character, your 4 hours 16 minutes spent getting to lvl 5 and goldshire is so miniscule compared to what YOU are doing to yourself
---
&gt;Retail has very difficult end game content, both raiding and mythic+. Classic has that OG feel, community, and leveling experience.
---
The same content that my dog can afk via lfr or I buy a wow token (legally off Blizzard) and pay for my dog to afk mythic+?
---
I remember playing in WoW‚Äôs beta thinking to myself how Everquest 2 was going to blow them out of the water. I guess we all know how that turned out
---
It is yes.
---
I'm also pretty happy with my holy paladin, HueJackman
---
Ha that‚Äôs a cool idea, I‚Äôm deaf too so I totally support your idea, alliance on mirage raceway tho, currently in a guild called asthmatics lol üòÇ
---
I feel its easier using a Guide as warrior. They route the quests perfectly for you. The one time I really struggled was the cave next to og. Use classicwow.live guide. Pretty nice.
---
"Giving them out" in return for linen means he's the one getting free skillups though, normally they sell for less than the material cost.
---
41.40** sorry tired lol
---
Hillsbrad or 1k. Should have ashen and barrens done
---
you're right, they've made retail for the special ed
---
Haven't seen Athene at all nor his followers anywhere. In the evening there's a queue of about an hour so I wouldn't call it an empty server. All the zones are packed with players, it's hard to get anything done tbh.
---
We got Healthstones and Blood Pact. We are invaluable :(
---
&gt;Some audacious motherfucker was literally giving away bags. He open traded with me and didn't even ask and just shoved two of his name into my inventory and now I have to look at him every time I open it. 
---
My favorite part.  This made me laugh out loud!
---
You should note that my discussion of what classic+ is came 4 comments removed from the OP and after some other dude added in this
---
&gt;Then you update a few older areas 
---
and this
---
&gt;"Classic+" which automatically entails an updated classic.
---
Where exactly in the first post does that guy discuss making changes to the areas of Classic as opposed to strapping new content on to Classic?
---
Very true, if I got ninja‚Äôd for 50-400g on launch i‚Äôd be doing a bit more then that though. Heck i‚Äôd probably level a character on the opposite faction to spawn camp him with my second acc.
---
Nice work, what's the story?
---
With the buff you can get your weapon skills faster.
---
With 40 it's getting a lot easier especially when you get mortal strike and sweeping strike.
---
Anyone know if theres a Bag Man in Bigglesworth? Would very much appreciate not dropping herbs when im full.
---
Play druid
---
Takes longer than mind blast
---
thats very creative, lol
---
Oh I'm just memeing, at one point there were Chuck Norris style jokes told about Saurfang pretty frequently that revolved around him cleaving the shit outta basically everything. Just saw something about an orc cleaving the shit outta somebody and wanted to make a joke about it
---
On the serious side though I totally agree, despite his faults Garrosh is straight up one of the strongest warriors in WoW history IMO
---
Same here gentlemen, on Dreadmist.
---
1-59:
---
Warrior &gt; Mage &gt; Rogue &gt; Hunter &gt; Others  
---
60:  
---
Mage &gt; Hunter &gt; Warrior &gt; Rogue &gt; Others
---
oh you misunderstand me. I play horde there, which is reaaaaally active. Wondered about alliance side :)
---
Spent an hour in Jangolode mine last night killing gnoll's and Defias, and my lord the drop rate for gnoll paws was atrocious! I'm tempted to just not pick up 'gather X amount from mobs' quests but then I think i'd be skipping 40% of WoW
---
Druid might not be designed around endgame, but luckily, neither is the entirety of WoW Vanilla.
---
Overwhelmed as one would be placed in his position, such a heavy burden now to be the one. Born to bear and bring to all the details of our ending, to write it down for all the world to see. But he forgot his pen, shit the bed again... typical.
---
Exactly. As far as I remember from the servers I played Dire Maul was always more often DME, DM east or DMW, DM west. DM has totally always been Deadmines.
---
AQ will open later p3 or p4 I think. For opening AQ you need the whole server to contribute (which you experienced back then). Before that you can't raid AQ since the door is locked. Raids in classic are dope. MC and Ony are fairly easy. It got rather difficult back then with Razorgore and Vaelastrasz the guild breaker back when BWL released.
---
Oh alright, but it is populated then :)? thats good to hear.
---
Yeah as someone already said, there is an expert trainer to get past 75. In SW, the tailor expert was in a different building than the journeyman trainer, still in mage district though
---
Man maybe I should come back I got really good at gold farming with mineral routes in classic, of course I would holding onto those bars for a while until some level 60 guilds geared up.
---
"No it doesnt" - warlocks
---
Did you not read the post? Everyone in the group agreed to click Greed and then he didn‚Äôt..
---
Can you do dungeons regardless of how high you level? I convinced my husband to pick it up and I wanna be able to run dungeons with him without being locked out.
---
haha epic
---
I understood it lol gj op
---
"IF you're good at something don't do it for free"
---
Hey all. Back in vanilla I mained a dps and it was a blast but now I'm thinking of rolling either a tank or healer. Which is more in demand? I played both in cata but stopped shortly after. Loved playing both warriors and priests though so I can't make up my mind. Buying a subscription tomorrow.
---
And then there is my experience around the hogger camps yesterday. I pulled a mob and little did I know that there was someone cast behind a tree to pull the same mob. I just got abuse from the player even after I apologised and went to help dot his next target. 
---
Can't win them all.
---
In general, just play what you want. Every class is viable for a casual player. Also, every class will have its place in dungeons and raids. Only when you're talking about min-maxing when the whole - "We don't need class X" comes to play. Same with the race-class issue, not that relevant unless you're mix-maxing.
---
As for guild, you will find one either by just teaming up with random people (and they will offer you a spot) or you will see some offers on General or Trade channel. Either way, you'll get into one at some point. It does make things easier to be in a bigger guild as you always have someone around your level to quest with. If you're in a tiny guild the second they have few levels on you, it will be hard to get them to stop their leveling to help you. I'm not saying that this would not happen, it might be just slower. That being said, the second you hit 60 you'll all be doing the same content so that's only a leveling issue.
---
Don't worry about putting a skill point in the wrong place either. It really doesn't matter that much until the late game at which point you should have a better understanding of your class and you can just respec.
---
One thing I would advise it so spend some time and try to figure out your quests by yourself before you go to google or install an addon. I would give all my money to get the whole "wow factor" back when I found a secret or figure out something on my own. It was a great and rewarding feeling. Same with exploration, just explore and enjoy.

I saw plenty of wipes in LFR, can't say it requires no effort. Besides, LFR is like a demo version of raid that helps beginners to learn whats going on. People who die in LFR, are they really ready for normal raiding?

I'm gonna carve my own way or get help from friendly peeps instead! Much rather rely on people or my own ingenuity than a guide.

Nice shortcut out after we kill the alliance scu... I mean thank you smelly dwarf us Green humans appreciate such knowledge!

A fellow man of culture and class I see
---
Yeah same strat for me, level hunter now, get my professions up, after that i can save a bit of money and fund everything my alt needs.
---
It is. You'll want to find a buddy or someone in game to level with preferably so they can heal you whle you tank. its still doable without a healer, but you'll be fighting things one at a time
---
12 Years I've played Alli............ 12 Years And I'm learning this today.

Lmao thats some petty shit, I love it

Could you elaborate a bit about the "lock is super easy for pvp"?
---
Easy to play? Easy to kill? Easy to kill others?
---
Cat durid is 4 fite
---
-_-
---
I feel like they could open 3 more servers and just add server transfers to all the servers that are not full with queue times from all the servers that are. Doesn't sound too crazy right?
---
Until retail dries up and they need cash somehow.
---
If I‚Äôm tanking as arms while leveling what points should I put in prot?
---
Every class has their own niche to fill in a raid group. There'll always be druids needed to heal but generally there will be more priests and paladins in a raid. This works out fine, however, since there are usually fewer druids anyway. Focus more on what you want to personally play. Some might have it easier to find a spot but there will always be a place. But if you're playing pretty much priest/pally/druid you'll be expected to heal
---
I did this with teamviewer because i was already familiar with it. You only have to download the app for your smartphone and teamviewer for your pc, sign in with a account and the computer to your my computer library.
---
And take all your clothes off so tou save on repair costs.
---
honestly pick whatever
---
if it was me Id pick dwarf just cuz its cooler and human paladins are a dime a dozen
---
Eh, scroll down past the first 10 or 20 streamers and hop into a stream with &lt;50 viewers or something.  My crew and I have been having a blast. I‚Äôm just chilling through all the zones, taking my time and making some new friends along the way.  :)

"You'll have to toss me!"

Exact same thing happened to me, had to reconfigure my audio settings for an hour straight, because I use so many virtual cables to seperate ingame audio, internet browser and voice comms for recording :D
---
Nice! I also had bjarn as my pet years ago, never changed his name though, just couldn‚Äôt do it
---
I would advice not to get quest addon. Read the quest text, quest addon is breaking the immersion. You just end up following yellow dots or arrow on map and zone out. Also do you have highest rank spells equipped? Did you even by them from trainer or only the first spells in alphabetical order?
---
All of these posts makes me wonder if I‚Äôm doing something wrong when I never get any buffs :(
---
I believe I know exactly why. Many players have sunk years or even more than a decade into their retail wow account. Classic releasing feels to them like it invalidates all that ‚Äúprogress‚Äù etc. So they lash out against it.
---
Runescape is the real OG for reverting gamestates.

Yeah a good mineral/gem run stored in your bank space could make you some gold later on.

bet even 10storms will have a big queue
---
Please just log out and let someone who wants to play in.
---
This is what would happen to the world without major corporations and franchises!
---
ITS FUCKING CHAOS AND INSANE AND I LOVE IT.
---
There are people, running around, helping each other in low level zones. Hell, I've missed the 'LFG FOR HOGGER!' being asked, without a touch of irony, sarcasm or anything! The  naivety  and innocence is refreshing and beautiful.
---
Also, I have to read the quest text to find out where I need to go to kill shit. That's both weird and fun. Granted I am only level 10 so by level 40 it might be super dull, BUT I FUCKING DOUBT IT.

Oh yeah

A newborn sleeps like 18 hours a day, so you have an excuse to avoid people and 18 hours a day to play WoW, ahhhh I love having a newborn :D

Yea it hasnt been steadily losing players for the last ten years or anything /s.

Yeah its so simple and doesn‚Äôt  affect the gameplay at all. I‚Äôm sure lots of people would be willing to pay also. I would have easily paid 10 dollars to not have to restart

Cant tell ya, didn't go that way for me. After trying out Hunter, rogue, priest and warrior, im definitely going to keep playing on the warrior.
---
I like dealing respectable amounts of damage and also having a lot of armor.
---
Wow this just reminded me of a memory from vanilla days.
---
I used to grind the centaurs for experience in Desolace, and I would wake up before my paper round in the mornings to do it. The couple weeks I did that for I met a couple who ran a pub and would play before bed :) Wonder if they are playing classic also.
---
I could just be dumb but I'm finding it really hard to aoe with the correct talents at level 23. Some people are saying you should wait until cone of cold (26), otherwise controlling mobs can be difficult

Server?

Exp bonuses should have been crafted items for each profession, not a gold dump.

Thanks a lot for your time!

I've never once played Horde but I was properly pissed off when Vol'jin died. Seemed you lot couldn't catch a break in terms of decent Warchiefs for a while. Still haven't, by the way BFA looks to be panning out
---
Ignore list them all and make a forum post telling other to avoid
---
Depends. Skinning could net you a bit more money, which will help saving for a mount at 40. Or would you rather begin leveling tailoring so it's not so much work later. Like you said, you could benefit from it already too. It's also fun to be able to make useful things while leveling.
---
As for vendoring/selling, personally I've just been vendoring. The prices of things are really strange so early on and right now it seems people are selling items at or even below vendor price, not to mention theres a selling and listing fee... maybe check an item, if it doesnt sell for much then just vendor it
---
No, Todd, pls T_T  even modders can't fix that shit
---
Where can I ask nooby questions like so? Also I'm new and I'm super into the game and I've been playing the entire day since launch I am 17 Shaman rn. Questing is so slow because of walking + mobs spread out/drops rare, I kill slow. How can I speed up leveling? I am questing in the Barrens.

You cant mount in combat, and mounting has a long cast time. You'll find it's often more useful

That's ElvUI bud
---
I always do that myself part of the thrill of the game is surviving on my own, but I am also what you might call a Blue pvper, I like to hunt the hunters and I need to be free roaming to do that. If I did not have to do dungeons I wouldn't but I somehow manage to make enough friends to manage.
---
Not really? If you're talking about Article 13, it doesn't affect memes.

It's just something people made up, and everyone believed it.

Zandalari Tribe EU RP-PvP here. I gave it a shot to join a few friends in their guild. Some guys tried to "calm down the Barrens Chat" by reminding them of Etiquette. Turned out as well as you expect it would. I do however find a lot more people emoting (e.g. Wave/Proper greetings when passing by) which I do find really refreshing, and reminiscent of FF XIV.
---
My issue is more with wanting shadowform and no respec. I‚Äôm happy to pick up wand spec from 41-45, and recognize it being good, but I‚Äôm also completely happy with my pace of leveling with just shadow talents until 40.
---
Look in device manager and make sure the driver installed right.
---
Also if it's a laptop make sure the gpu is set as primary video outout.

Oftentimes laptops have onboard graphics and a GPU and GPU will default to being on the HDMI output and the laptop screen itself will run off the integrated graphics.
---
One you get bartender and open the menus for it (left clock highlights the bars to move them, right click opens the menu for options) you will see every bar listed. Turn on the bars you want. Start with number 1 and play around with that bars setting. You can size it, put padding between the buttons, make them vertical or horizontal. Each bar can be made individually and all the options for that bar are in one place. You can make them all look the same or you can make some look different. It's a really easy add-on to use.
---
I mean, we went 10 levels IN THE LATESR FUCKING EXPANSION without learning a single new spell, too. Honestly I‚Äôm not one to be too terribly concerned with immersion or some of the classic rpg elements. I‚Äôve always played wow as a pvper, which kind of takes you one extra big step removed from the lore and kind of from the game in general, relative to a pveer. But even I had to stop for a moment at like level 118 and think to myself ‚Äúwhat the fuck am I even doing right now?‚Äù.  Zero new abilities gained, and with zone scaling, you‚Äôre deliberately not getting a single ounce stronger the whole time. Level up? Everything‚Äôs scaled to your new level now. Got a good drop in a dungeon?  Lol nope everything‚Äôs scaled to that ilvl now too. 
---
Like... what the fuck?  WHO the hell signed off on that?  You‚Äôre literally not even playing an rpg anymore.
---
Ok thank you for the insight. Yeah I've been using WeaponSwingTimers for Hunter and I actually kind of love the shoot/move/shoot playstyle. But I do love Mages haha.

cant attack children. never could. still cant in retail.
---
If you think you can handle doing it as aoe, yes, respec right away (i suppose you know which talents)  shouldnt be too detrimential to you
---
What i'm gonna do is improve arc missiles and arc concentration, then get shatter, thats the way i'm planning to wreck in single target (yes, slower than aoe, but its what i want, im in no rush)
---
I am playing it now. I also played vanilla WoW, though only briefly.
---
There is plenty of incentive to play retail WoW currently in a social environment. Unless you play super casually, in which case there is not. But you can't raid solo, you can't do mythic+ solo (especially pushing). The guild I am in does WQ together, and Sundays during the day are 'alt leveling days' where you can team up with guildies and level together.
---
It makes leveling way better. Is more fun. That's incentive, isn't it? You know... enjoyment... the entire point of a video game.
---
1g.

---
Yeah but that's just because of how the spells work. Macros don't stop at off-GCD spells, and the ranges Charge and Pummel are pretty mutually exclusive. There's no actual logic decision taking place there.
---
For me it was that spirit straight up isn't a thing anymore.
---
Like, I get that it's the least useful stat for most classes, but wtf, they just removed it entirely?
---
Priests are s tier 1v1 in PvP as shadow, and they arent too difficult to do well with. A lot depends on gear too though
---
We gotta kill the king of stormwind.
---
I hate it... It's big...and flat...It's hot in there too
---
What is this about? Some clarification?
---
I did let a guy die once on purpose because he exploited that behavior. Like he kept overpulling without being in my group and quick tagging mobs so I couldn't take the pressure of him and have at least credit for a few.  
---
So I let him die, grouped him, rezed him (he didn't want to group at first), and we finished this together.  
---
But yeah doing the quick tag thing of 5 mobs several times was an ass move so I thought he deserved a lesson. Lesson learned he now is more open about cooperation.
---

---
I (warrior) was doing wc yesterday with my friend (priest).
---
I'm always watching my healers mana, so that was never a problem, but literally noone cared about threat or pulling back to not add more packs.
---
I've tried my best to tank those mobs, but it wasn't really possible.  
---
Single target with enough rage was doable, but multiple targets is just impossible.
---
I didn't get enough rage, because they started dpsing like crazy and i instantly lost agro. "Best" group member was a shaman spamming earthshock like crazy. I've had 4 SA on a target and he used one earth shock and i've lost it.
---
I've told him, yo earthshock generates huge threat, please don't use it (at least in more dangerous fights). His answer was "but it deals the most damage".
---
Needless to say, the shaman was tanking most of the dungeon.  
---
We eventually cleared everything, but only because i've pulled extremely save.
---
I mean everything worked in the end and it still was a fun run, but this showed how important a group setup is and everyone knows how to play. We had 2 rogues, 1 shaman, 1 priest and 1 warrior. This was absolutely not optimal. We couldn't sheep the beasts and the rogues got detected when trying to sap the humanoids.
---
What sort of moronic answer is that?
---
Saying thanks, isn't 'something in return'. It's basic human etiquette.
---
Come back to discord?
---
People using scripts or things like he said to stay logged in forever to avoid the AFK kick, blizzard can take actions I think
---
Guides like that are min-maxy.  Human Paladins have an advantage over Dwarves due to racials and whatnot.
---
That being said, Dwarf Paladins are just fine, just like you wouldn't be making a mistake by rolling a Priest who isn't a Dwarf.
---
Saved me a run back to Stormwind, he'd been there for hours too.

Ok well maybe saying it doesn't exist isn't really what I meant, what I'm saying is that it's not really enforceable which is necessary for a social contract to be effective. If you break the social contract there, people get pissed off and flame the thread itself but there are no lasting consequences for you so long as you don't identify yourself later. Where as in WoW, your character is unique and identifiable, so the social contract can be enforced by ostracization
---
I might do it for the adventure. But also, I'm doing engineering and if I put the same amount of time into that I could get the Flying Tiger Goggles instead, which are actually better (but not as cool). Dilemma!
---
Name and shame
---
go retail then. cant do in classic
---
I work weekends, ready for Monday and Tuesday though :)
---
Nah, you are just being real.
---
Anytime someone goes "Oh I wish I could have X but I have no money right now" while someone else is around is trying to make that person feel guilty.
---
And with it being a public post with plenty of viewers there will be one sucker that falls for that shit.
---
This is out of control. Stop being nice immediatly !! You ruin the game !

It‚Äôs $16.50AU. I bought it a couple days ago.
---
I didnt know about it and know about most of them :D
---
I hated the damage scaling in WOTLK and what they did to my perfectly unbroken Winfury lol, but honestly Wrath was the beginning of the end CATA was bad, MOP was the coffin. The success of Classic is the ultimate failure of Ghostcrawler and in some way Kalgan as well.
---
No ques on our server.
---
If you're hunting for buffs to take on some harder enemies, and you aren't getting any from people walking by, spend a second to help someone with a mob they're fighting. Everyone seems to always try to reciprocate when you help them out.
---
Was already there in the past, but have fun exploring the world dude, best part about classic
---
On the flip side, it feels so good when you get some good drops from a dungeon and can breeze through mobs. I'm at the point where I can cleave down two mobs at least two levels higher than me pretty regularly and it makes all the suffering worth it.
---
Been on Zandalar from the get-go. On the Horde side, the community is wholesome, active, mature, and helpful. 
---
You'll often find yourself competing for spawns/mobs with other players, but more often than not, you can form a quick group and fly through the quests. 
---
I've been playing my UD mostly, Tristfal despite it's condition is super lively, people offering bags for mats, trading, offering free items and advice. 
---
I ran an Orc from the Valley of Trials to Deathknell and briefly encountered several RPer's and plenty of players questing about. 
---
Overall - I couldn't be happier with this server.
---
I can't speak for the alliance side though.
---
I've got the names and the guild. Don't want to post here directly for witchunting or anything but at the same time, if there is no recourse for his/their actions then I want people to be warned. None of that was remotely OK. The healer in the group definitely reported him but who knows if that will do anything at all. He's likely still doing the same thing to someone else right now or will in the near future.
---
time to remember this
---
Capture screenshot and post.
---
&gt; Used
---
&gt; not my fault!
---
wat
---
At start I didn't buff: It was like half my mana and only 3 vitality, it's so not worth it, and I had to drink afterwards...
---
Now it's 20% of my mana, I got spirit tap to refill and it's 8 vitality: When I'm travelling I throw them around with a renew and swp to help killing on the go, it doesn't cost me anything so why not :)
---
They removed walljumping though so the majority of exploration is now null and void.
---
Ty
---
Singles on the ah isn't inherent to using an auction house add-on. That is people actually choosing to list singles.
---
I am not talking about fucking Varian, why do you keep bringing him up?
---
But okay fine, both Varian and Garrosh have ZERO magical talent. They have literally nothing more than their physical strength, weapon of choice and in Varian's case his intellect.
---
What does any of that matter against someone who has a sword that can drain life and reap one's soul? Or can encase you in a block of ice?
---
What the fuck does Garrosh do when he's frozen inside a block of ice?
---
Well, two groups working together made it much easier.
---
Actually afking and auto walking will afk you to the character screen, and then DC you afterwards once you sit in character screen too long, script jumping doesn't. Don't worry if you fall asleep :)
---
I met KeanuLeaves (Tauren Druid) earlier.
---
Not a bad idea per se. But i also enjoy "bonding" with my character. I enjoy playing a character, exploring, doing everything in my pace.
---
If you reset the worlds every couple months it would be good for economy but to me it would be such a turnoff..
---
Well, you tried to circumvent the queue and got the hardcore queue instead.

saw duskwood in thumbnail and already knew it was Stitches lol
---
the most annoying part about him is when he kills Watcher Dodds so you can't do the spider quest
---
Alrighty, thanks!
---
Mosquitos ahoy
---
Maybe on some mobs and terrain LoS and wonky, but it's been working just fine. Every caster I fought LoS worked very well.

# install gentoo
---
Since u cant play anymore ill trade ya 2 osrs bonds for 30 day wow sub
---
Does classic wow have old art/models or new stuff?
---
Omfg I love you for this post, THANK YOU
---
I bypass this as an enchanter by already having a lot of materials on me.
---
So I would enchant the gear in exchange of the materials, no "stealing" possible that way.
---
Words got out pretty fast, I spammed by vendor macro on /1 and was the most famous enchanter of the Alliance for at least 2 years.
---
Never to farm something else than the AH
---
Literally your fault.
---
Ah, yeah.. true :D
---
That's what I'm asking! Who's the tank?! I don't know where the hunter is, you're the party leader you tell me! We're not waiting for the healer, this dungeon run should have started 15 minutes ago.
---
They low balled by more than 25% on their first guess which is fine, but then come launch and you have literally more than a million dollars sat in just the EU English queues (nevermind the other regions) completely unable to play and you don't fire up the required amount of servers day 1 then I'd call it cheaping out.
---
Got downvoted last time, by all means take care of your responsibilites as well. 
---
Don't fail at life, for a virtual one.
---
why not use elvui? I just exported my profile string from retail Elvui to the classic version and never had to setup a thing.
---
Staged video, didn't even use evasion. :)
---
Tons of people in your position. Fomo is a real thing but there will always be people who have other priorities and are leveling at a slower pace. Plus people will have alts. You'll be find just enjoying the journey
---
Don't forget that layering is a thing at the moment, so it will seem emptier than it is.
---
This logic is so silly. WoW doesn‚Äôt play by the rules of magic = instawin. That would mean that varian would get destroyed by a Defias pillager. I digress with this nonsense lmao. Frostmourne can only reap your soul after you‚Äôre already dead, by the way.
---
Should've named EndWin for that imo
---
I remember this guy from when I played 15 years ago. Running around Duskwood as a complete noob, seeing this guy in the distance and then reading this in general chat: "BIG FAT C\*NT ROAMING AROUND, BE CAREFUL".
---
You mean consecration? But yeah tank class without a way to hold aggro is pretty sad. You're lucky it was mages pulling off and not the healer.
---
oh hey, we might prevent Sylvanas from going full stupid villain this time then
---
We still have not seen a single queue on my server. Still tons of people everywhere to quest with.
---
i'm ashamed of and for you
---
If you see a priest, jump twice. That's the wordless "buff please"
---
I got it in the first paragraph. However, the unasked-for party invites made me unsure. Because that happens. At least introduce yourself before inviting me, yo.
---
Yes, I think I do. Because I have the technology. You being so butthurt about it is a nice bonus.
---
laughs in shield bash
---
To be fair the only reason Varian was that strong was because Thrall was just as OP and blizzard probably wanted it to be "fair"
---
Also, for some dumb reason malfurion and tyrande are mentally challenged on wow.
---
heres a clip of it in action: https://clips.twitch.tv/FancySlipperyCookieKeyboardCat

*Laughs in low pop server*
---
Number lock = auto run
---
Yes you need that :)
---
Use "/who" and the region name and you will find it
---
Congratulations, you just found out that the great classic community still contains assholes.
---
Just put them on ignore and maybe note for what. Just so you might not have to deal with them again in the future.
---
That's what I came to post
---
Hey same stuff, my routeur somehow stopped being able to get the correct IP and i fixed it right away but i went back to a 40 min queue at peak time. 
---
Glad they improved servers or it would've been a couple hours lol
---
basically me.  eldest sister has a 1 year old, other sister has been married a year and is probably gonna have a kid soon
---
meanwhile i'm playing wow and despairing of ever finding a woman my age who isn't a nihilistic wino with a weird obsession for cats :))))
---
I'd be fine with that. TBC and WotLK are basically the pinnacles of PvE group play in my book. Especially if they also restructure raids to the 5 (dungeons) - 10 - 20 - 40 man principle (with Naxx as 10-man, Ulduar and Colosseum at 20 and ICC as 40, for the WotLK example) and introduce attunement quest lines for them (eg. Colosseum requiring a tourney invite, which you can get from exploits in Ulduar, or Naxx requiring a flying mount from the HoR or Soulforge instances.
---
There's shitloads of opportunities for proper progressions.
---
That‚Äôll afk you.
---
Did Bag Man strike?
---
What is the movie who this from?

or you could walk 10m and buy it from a vendor

Yikes, only knowing LoL community can be rough. He‚Äôll probably always remember that positive feedback now lol

I was on a zeppelin to Org and a priest buffed me so I turned around, waved and said thank you. The dude then trades with me gives me a whole cloth set, 4 bags, and 20 silver... I was in shock. He just smiled and left.
---
leveling an undead on thunderfury and i've see quite a few warlocks
---
Thanks
---
It's also horrible for mana efficiency
---
Wand projectile has a travel time, mind blast is instance. I have beaten out of a ton of mages casting fireballs same time as me purely because the blast will instantly strike while the fireball is still in the air. Same goes for smite but you gotta use rank 1 as the cast time gets too long on higher levels.
---
Fiddlesticks
---
Really? What choice exactly did the people had, who play on regions with only 1 (one!!!) PvP server pre-launch, which literally everybody knew would never be enough.
---
There's one called AmmoReminder which doesn't actually restock but tells you when you're low and near someone who sells ammo
---
I decided after a few hours in tirisfal on the several characters that were born in the naming concepting, I want to experience the game through the perspectives of newer people and those who reach out for help or need it.
---
 Here is my message out to server when I am just pursuing something off on my own - - anyone like help with quest / run, or help with advice on the game - or life in general?  i am looking to experience the game through perspective of what others' experience here is like right now 
---
This is zen adventure gaming.  A year of the waiting room has kind of brewed this in me, during that time I created my concept of what I am trying to create. I grew to want to meet the people in this world of wow 1.
---
Ashbringer seems good so far.
---
I get the same issue on a rtx 2080ti I think going in window borderless helps
---
On both nostalrius and kronos ive found it to be most effective sbout the time you enter tanaris to the time you can do Zul Farak. But this is in my experiance. Hope it helps none than less
---
No dude. VC was Deadmines, for the final boss - VanCleef.
---
how much does it cost to mail something to another character?
---
Oh you mean the third party software that will actively click buttons for you that Hardware Macro? The one that has been bannable for years because people use it to anti AFK during BG's that Hardware macro?
---
There‚Äôs also that talent in prot to increase threat, but a common arms build takes those talents (31/5/15)
---
Gonna check it out while questing tonight. Got some beer and blunts rolled too tonight shall be epic
---
Unfortunately (well, not really) addons can't manipulate anything in the actual 3D game world.
---
Classic, where us warlock's feel useful with our buffs again.
---
Alrighty
---
Are you trying to troll, or are you just mentally challenged?
---
No of course it's not magic = instawin.
---
it's ***POWERFUL*** magic = instawin.
---
Anyway, you've refused to acknowledge any of my arguments and instead twist and avoid them.
---
So, try to focus for a second and answer this very simple question: What fuck does a warrior do when he's stuck inside a block of ice and freezing to death?
---
Tool sucks.
---
Resto shaman here. Don't worry, I always ress and heal stray warriors. We're in this together.
---
Literally no one is being toxic what are you on about
---
to be fair you're not gonna be asked for io on live either for a lvling dungeon and people will ask for you to come bank / bridge for inspect for the harder dungeons ;)
---
Jeeze, I just /played and I'm at 10 hours..... Level 11 lol
---
Fullscreens borderless*
---
Heard some talk about melee leeway that would make mage aoe farming impossible.
---
"I broke the rules and got banned wtf?!"
---
Oh, that‚Äôs a no no. You don‚Äôt call people you‚Äôre arguing with retarded. :)
---
I don‚Äôt see why they‚Äôd need to tank right away unless they play with dedicated group. Probably easier to play solo warrior as damage and respec later?
---
Or you just don't see all the rogues that are sneaking around you constantly.
---
Shocking! Absolutely shocking! You should run up to people when they are fighting mobs and bandage them out the of the blue! See how they fucking like it!
---
Vidste du var dansker, da det s√• meget ligner en DSB station xD

got two of it dropping on my warrior. thought i am rich now. realized it is soulbound. cried.

lmao the lengths ppl go

Yeah that definitely is a huge factor among many.

You can start AoE grinding as soon as you get Improved Blizzard, but it drastically improves once you have a mount and can round up more mobs. 
---
Search Mage AoE leveling or something on youtube and you will see some guides.
---
No thanks. I'd rather they add content to classic similar to how OSRS went with their game. As soon as they cave into TBC, then you'll ask for WOTLK and we'll be back where we started with a shit community, LFR, 4 difficulties, and homogenization.
---
Tailor here, I just make them for mats, or for 8 linen cloth (which is 6 for the maths, and two for me to buy the coarse thread.
---
&gt; What fuck does a warrior do when he's stuck inside a block of ice and freezing to death?
---
Flex?
---
Actually I am proud of myself, I love the game and I enjoy it very much, but as I am aware of the life-ruining, it keeps me in check and I always do chores and extra stuff to make my life better before I turn on the wow!
---
You could disable NPC names if it's causing trouble.
---
Party member names should be a very bright sky blue, almost white.
---
I hope their next press release mentions subscribers in some capacity. I don't think they will release hard data or numbers, but it would be nice to know a ballpark figure of players across all regions.
---
Currently lvl 18 and can‚Äôt wait to hit 20 on my priest!
---
Feels like a mini-milestone.
---
Actually pretty funny. We move so slow - "don't move, don't move!!"
---
Only EU got shafted, full servers all around even the rppve
---
Ah well. All in all, at least I learned something tonight. I know now to not join groups with 3 guild members because they can act as trashy as they want with no risk.
---
I'll be stuck at work where we have generators and I can use my phone as a hotspot so I may be good.
---
A mage memeing about getting out tagged, learn fireblast as ain't noone gonna have sympathy for you.
---
cuz it is wow and retail isnt. retail had some shred of what wow is in mists and very thinly in warlord but all deleted following that.
---
there is a happy accident of the deep attention that went into each element of the game experience and how they all fit together in a mind expanding educational way. its Slow adventuring. Extremely cognitive.
---
That's a disingenuous argument, there are 70-80 people in my guild across about 6-7 timezones organising changes is quite difficult and again, why am I being shouldered the blame for a billion dollar company not being able to launch a 15 year old piece of online only software? This isn't the 90s, they're not running out of production lines theyre quite literally saying that they are happier with 100k people being essentially unable to play because they don't want to spend 10s of thousands of dollars to allow them even if those 100k have paid them about a million.
---
PvE is more challenging than ever but thats a mixed bag. Gear is more random than ever. You can run a mythic dungeon and a mythic raid and the mythic dungeon might drop a better piece. Pvp is in a really good spot tho. MOST specs are balanced and they streamlined it (imo) for the better. You dont have to remember 40 skills per class, ita been reduced to the point where outplay is skill reliant and not just available hours.
---
In vanilla my brother played shaman and I tanked as warrior.
---
I would mark a skull, and he (as a shaman) would tank that one mob. My responsibility was the rest of the pack.
---
It works well. Shaman can take hits from one mob until it dies, because they kill things so damned fast. And you can't hold aggro off them, don't bother trying.
---
While I don't suggest this for the average user (updates, especially certain ones, should be done ASAP to fix certain vulnerabilities) you can disable auto-restart through the Group Policy Editor (Win-Key + R, type gpedit.msc). Computer Config &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Scroll down to Windows Update &gt; Find "No auto-restart with logged on users for scheduled auto-updates &gt; Set to Enabled. This won't stop Windows from occasionally nagging you, but at no point ever will the PC automatically restart. Some people say it doesn't work, resets itself, etc, but on both Pro and Enterprise I've never ever had the compute auto-restart with this policy enabled. The only exception seems to be major feature updates which sometimes do reset group policy settings.
---
Unfortunately you will need Win10 Pro or better; I run Enterprise + Volume License using some gray-area tools that I won't mention, but Windows Pro is doable for the average person but you will need to go the sort of not legal way or buy a Pro license. (MS are fuckheads and intentionally disable these features on the Basic/Home editions that usually come pre-installed with computers).
---
Microsoft don't give a fuck and they know and are okay with most people pirating their software to begin with (the vast majority of their profits come from selling volume licenses to OEMs and large corporations, us average users provide virtually no profit to them in the grand scheme of things. 
---
If anyone does do this please do restart your computer and update at least every 2-4 weeks. I have a few servers on Win10 that have over a year of uptime but those are special scenarios. "Mandatory" updates are highly encouraged for good security reasons, but I will never forgive MS for implementing a draconian auto-restart for the Basic and Home versions of Windows which most people use, just the wrong way to go about it and has caused people to lose work (that they shoulda saved to begin with anyway) but also can rarely "brick" the bootloader or the OS to the point the average user can't fix it beyond reinstalling windows.
---
Jesus too much coffee... hope that helps some people though.
---
&gt;In retail, every xpac was a rush to get through the next 10 levels/new level cap so I could start doing "endgame".
---
This is your personal choice, nobody is rushing you. The BFA leveling has been quite enjoyable, coherent stories, nice themes, voice acted quests. As usual I took my time the first time around and read all the lore about the zones, quest texts, small little envelopes, secrets, etc ... You don't need to be in a rush.
---
&gt;On retail, you just have so much stuff already it really diminishes each new xpac leveling experience.
---
Might be something with you tbh. I'm not blaming you or anything, but I still have enjoyment every time a new expac drops and I can run into new zones.
---
How bad is ganking and graveyard camping situation?
---
streamers arent a thing in yurop
---
u can pick between dreadmist 10storms and skullflame for the lower pop ones they barely had any queue during the week but the weekend will add queue I think
---
they adding 2 new pvp realms tonight btw at like 5pm gmt
---
I wouldnt join tonight maybe wait and see how full the newer realms get
---
Thank you so much! This worked perfectly for me.
---
You don't need Tim
---
Alliance? or Horde?
---
One of the worst changes in gaming. Period.
---
Because I‚Äôm not really a fan of most of ElvUI. The basic layout I like, hence taking inspiration from it.
---
Love moonfire for this, especially when a warrior is mid charge lmao
---
Heh. I started a mage with tailoring and enchanting. Wanted to play solo, be independent without any friends with me for the first time ever. I got tailoring and enchanting so I could make my own bags and gear, and enchant it - if I was going to solo this game, I could at least have *bags* dammit.
---
Within two days people I've played other games with for years were joining me due to my stories about people *needing* me. As I've said in other posts, I've felt like batman at times - running in to save the day with my mage CC, and giving anyone who wanted it food and water.
---
And so now, I'm making bags, cloth gear, and enchants - for my friends I did not expect to have.
---
I am bag man too.
---
yes i would love this to become reality in the future.
---
I started playing also from BC onwards and i agree that without flying it would be even more awesome ! i think flying just destroyed the original feeling of wow.
---
I think we might just see also tbc servers in the future
---
Hell no. In fact it's worse unless you're raid tanking. Go Arms.
---
&gt; Fireleash 
---
iirc its Russian or something
---
we rogues struggle a lot #prayforrogues
---
I LOVE auto attack based combat... is paladin my only option here? If so, I‚Äôll definitely make one!
---
It's fucking magical dude.
---
Thank you so MUCH!!!
---
Just exploration
---
Exactly.
---
OSRS only has bonds.
---
absolutely ignorant advice
---
Why is his name wood plank ?
---
German is funny
---
you are a genius
---
Nobody asks for DM because nobody does ALL of DM in one sitting
---
DM + Wing = Diremaul
---
DM = Deadmines
---
Still funny though.
---
On my realm every tailor offers bags 4 mats. I don't know whether it'll keep up, but I still have some in my inventory I'm willing to trade away...
---
You can just set a button for it in your keybinding settings, since it's the legion client.
---
This is true. It was lowered later..
---
Instant between own characters still i assume
---
It feels like people who complain about the addons only played Vanilla for like a week or so (if at all). Addons were a thing, quest helpers, AH stuff, they were all there back in the day.
---
They either can't remember or they on some weird purist flex. Odd...
---
How can people have Windows update on? Get some software to disable it permanently!
---
what time tho? people gotta mention this
---
also, glyphs were a cool way to personnalise further the character without breaking the balance
---
I'm running a single target build since everywhere is so busy (and work means I wasn't able to get ahead of the pack), but I'll be putting at least 1 point into Imp Blizzard incase an opportunity arises to pull a few.
---
I had to read the first one like three times because I couldn‚Äôt for the life of me figure out why that would be a negative thing... Then I realized and felt really stupid
---
Im joining saturday night prolly, so ill see how the New servers populate. I played on bloodfeather eu on retail, but that server ended up beign a ghost town. So naturally im a bit scared for the server pick for classic, since Leveling a New character doesn't take a day
---
That's like... insanely low lol.  I'm a pretty sedentary fatass and I don't think I've ever seen under 4k even on a day where all I move is to eat and let my dogs out back lol.
---
I'm on ashbringer and play everyday at 5pm.
---
* 20 minute queue on tuesday
---
* 30 minute queue on wednesday
---
* no queue yesterday
---
I can live with this.
---
Truth be told its a ton of invites for kill quests and atleast 30% is not even saying hi. Thats the modern bfa way. Only difference is you gotta invite manually. HOWEVER. The ones who talk those groups just become sooo much fun. Sometimes lasting for hours cause of questchains.
---
[https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info4275-PerlClassicUnitFrames.html](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info4275-PerlClassicUnitFrames.html) how about this? i know xpearl later renamed to zpearl
---
Anyone have any idea what the pure horde equivalent for this is? I remember westfall and it was a horrible slugfest of low droprate quests (and the defias messenger...)
---
Not that many I would presume. Private servers are for 'special' people who are really into the game, classic wow has a much more diverse mix so you won't see as many minmaxers
---
Yes, seems reasonable
---
As much as I loved BC, it introduced the three things that killed WoW:
---
\- Flying. As soon as you're above the world, you're not in danger, and safety should be rare in the world of warcraft.
---
\- Dailies. Enough said.
---
\- Multiple content difficulties. Recycling the same dungeon with multiple difficulties is insulting when a game is making billions of dollars.
---
You are my hero!
---
Prospectors axe dropped in loch modan (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12975/prospector-axe) and my group all need for it and I won it. I was a hunter and figured I didn't need the strength so I gave it to the paladin in our group. Looking back idk if I should have kept it and sold it later seeing it's a. 0.0025% drop chance lol
---
No. Mine was completed in a second or two
---
/r/woosh
---
its a perfect game greatest adventure game of all time although there are a couple extremely close contenders in vivid/emotional indie adventure games but none at this size, scale, and social gameplay / problem solving scope.
---
from my deepest heart, i say to you, welcome.
---
That comment wasn't there when I saw the thread but I guess you gotta have something to be pedantic and rude about.
---
log in at night, reach character screen at day
---
Well we‚Äôre going to have to agree to disagree here. Blizzard haven‚Äôt ‚Äúliterally‚Äù said anything like that though have they? I think you‚Äôre just upset and posting whatever to suit your agenda. 
---
My advice is to just be patient. The population will inevitably thin out and you can play to your hearts content. Gl &amp; hf.
---
This is beautifull...
---
Make a mouseover macro for buffing, save a click, so you can buff more people.
---
Okay mods, which one of you plays a rouge?
---
Hold up, I'm killing something, I'll ask the question when I'm done
---
Okay but what‚Äôs up with the troll face over your level OP
---
I just find it sad that so many people never knew this. I was shown this pretty early on by a same age friend (like 11-12) back then. I used to see a lot of people use this. It still works in retail aswell and I've always been using it if I can't fly.
---
Just make a second character on the realm your brother plays on. You might not have the time to juggle two characters, but at least you can play with your brother from time to time.
---
One small demand at a time. Raid finder made finding raids easier. Then travel was found annoying, so it teleported you to the instance, ...
---
It's QoL improvements that have stripped away the soul of WoW. And while I think they found a great balance during WotLK, too much of a good thing can be bad.
---
I don't think cancelaura works in classic, I think it's a different name but I can't remember it.
---
Usually its fine, unless its like harpies lol, they move so much
---
&gt;I'm sorry is the World of HowsTheWeathercraft?
---
I fucking lost it.  My coworkers demanded to know what's so funny about the projects I'm working on... oops!
---
The first three things that started killing wow*
---
So many more things that killed the game even more. While it was still playable in BC IMO.
---
I also hated flying and dailies. Content difficulties - meh if People like it IDC tbh.
---
But Transmog, Heirloom Gear, Literally epics around every Corner, flying thriugh Content and Mobs... everything went down.
---
i'm a lore person, it's the primary thing for me to consider, in MMO's replayability and fun grinds are the secondary thing for me and gameplay is a high third. 
---
The lore and the story of the zones was so monotonous that i had no enjoyment leveling, most of the endgame i played was fun once and the grinding felt hollow. The gameplay might have improved greatly, but that is not enough for me to trust in modern wow ever again.
---
Ta Fok happened to the best cloth class. Mr Supreme Demon Lord Warlock?
---
It was 60, bc 70, wraith 80, cata 85, mop 90, wod 100, legion 110, 120 bfa.
---
lol I had the exact thought yesterday
---
If they go the expansion route over classic+ that'll be the day i quit
---
I feel like I would hate my dad if he did that though and doubt I'd be exactly happy to see him when he returned.  It would be work to trust him again, where I'm assuming his point makes it a magical return.
---
The good ol' film Jeremiah Johnson - get it up on your second monitor as you quest forward
---
#HarpyProblems
---
Laughs with feral Druid talents (30% increased speed by lvl 21)
---
When ppl say classic+, what do they mean? Are you saying like Classic with some stuff added? In general, are updates gonna come to classic the same way they do for say, Old School Runescape, or will it remain largely untouched?
---
I love noobs, thanks for coming. I'm not even looking at an XP progress bar, I switched it off. I turned off damage numbers and the XP font with a little mod. I am just here to do the gameplay of teaching and guiding other around and through this world's challenges and experiences.
---
Just copy all the files and the launcher onto it and launch it off the flash drive, I did this with retail a while back
---
There‚Äôs plenty of videos on YouTube showing you how to do it from 22 onwards, from my experience on retail classic, you need a decent mana pool (some gear from dungeons) to be able to group 4-7 up nova&gt;walk distance(not blink) double blizzard&gt; arcane explosion while kiting/ waiting for nova
---
laptop treadmill mapped to W. Man you are gonna be fit playing classic
---
This is all speculation that loads of people are using guides. Yeah there are people that rushing their way through the content, i remember most of it from when i played back in the day but im still leveling fairly slowly, enjoying all the content at my own pace, some of it planned out (i had a general leveling path in mind before i started) but majority of it is just me exploring places i thought i remembered but turned out had been tainted by the many changes over time to the game.
---
Yeah I miss Toy Story when I'm at work too
---
I have. They either ignore it or just say the tanks shit and keep doing it anyways.
---
It's been a tradition for me too since vanilla. Somehow it feels better knowing your character is tucked neatly into a bed instead of camping by themselves out on a cold windy rock
---
Silverpine has weird flow anyway, you're going to overlevel the first step of a quest and then end up needing a squad and a prayer for the next because respawn and drop rates are cruel. I wouldn't worry too much.
---
Thanks for the suggestion, I'll look into it!
---
But with a wand you can nuke em to death! I'm a holy boy myself!
---
How did you know?! :o
---
Love this keyboard, been using mine for 10 years, it's going to be strange when I eventually have to go to a regular layout.
---
because your using the addon real mob health or whatever.
---
I thought that was cuz I was using ElvUI. /reload seems to fix it for me tho
---
Can I group with y'all?
---
So. True.
---
Agreed.. so you agree then lol
---
Thanks for the answer. Wasn't there a Google drive spreadsheet doing the rounds at some point on this subreddit? Maybe that'll give me some information on where to roll.
---
You kust need 2-3 people to focus on that while the rest gears a bit more
---
Like a joke?
---
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
It works for whatever you are doing. Youtube, twitch, surfing, any games.. You run their software called "Philips Hue Sync" on the PC and it all works like black magic.
---
So I have to delete the addon?
---
On my server it was VC or DM.
---
Did you also tell them that the 'rested area' (zzz) icon means their character is tired and needs to sleep?
---
Zandalari was 6000 queue 2 days ago. Only 79 when I logged on last night
---
should I stick to Seal of Righteousness or Crusader before I get Seal of command?
---
Most of the guilds going for it are now in the 50s. They need one more full day to hit 60 and then getting Rag down won‚Äôt take more than 12 hours. He‚Äôs dead on Sunday. I‚Äôd get a small hat.
---
There is 4 lvl 55 APES on gehennas atm, Rikh,Tatter,Tribe and uhdx.
---
Oh God, Westfall stew. I rolled Horde this time and still feel an existential dread at the thought of Westfall Stew.
---
Found this bad boy in a chest in Redridge Mountains after the training mishap in SW.

&lt;Addiction&gt;
---
Last night me and my friend (levelling a warrior and a priest together) got up three levels from 11 to 14 and that was over about 5 hours. We could have been slightly quicker but that was a long slog and i wont be doing it every night.
---
&gt; but Cata was one of the primary reasons that we got private Vanilla servers
---
You do realize that private vanilla servers have existed and been tremendously popular since vanilla, yes?
---
Retail at this point is largely dumbed down to minimize the **required** interactions between people, to cater for solo players without a lot of (continuous) time on their hands.
---
I still remember buying a bag out of the AH back in the day made by a guy namen Gucci (some variant on the "i").
---
Yes, someone leveled a tailoring twink to 35 just to sell mooncloth bags under that name.
---
lemme just message my nearest chinese wow gold selling site real fast
---
Yesterday i was in queue for about 6 hours, thought it would work this time.
---
Man i was wrong. Got disconnectet 20 minutes before i could get in.
---
Looking forward to going under Kara and Org. I've been saved by GM's after being stuck in crazy areas quite a few times. I'll always remember a GM messaging me after finding me past some waaaay far out mountain on the coat of winterdfell saying "adventuring without your rope, I see?" Before teleporting me out.
---
Anything you don't have the HP data for shows as 100hp, until they take damage and you get the data, same how mobs work.
---
Unless I put a fork inside an electric socket before lvl 30 this is something I look forward to
---
SoR. SotC is only judge-worthy for mobs that live &gt;30 seconds.
---
I'm one. I only ever played Paladin once tauren were able to and I fell in love with the class.
---
The one benefit I get out of this is that I never played on the alliance until now so it really is like I'm playing and experiencing classic for the first time again.
---
If you don't want them to show 100hp yes, then they won't show any hp at all, only 100%. In vanilla/classic you cannot see the HP of other players unless you are grouped with them. I don't think there is an addon that shows their real hp, but I could be wrong.
---
I play on Mograine and can already say that the community is great and lovely!
---
According to the Reddit poll it has the highest percentage of English speakers and almost a 50:50 faction balance.
---
It's great here.
---
What the fuck does that mean
---
Of course I just want to talk with them about maybe acquiring the names somehow. I mean it'd be awfully hilarious if it was another married couple with the same names as us ya know?  By my own surveillance I don't think it would be too much of a set back, last I seen either of them online they weren't that far with leveling only like level 3 and 6 and I havnt seen them online enough to speak properly with them.
---
I wouldn't want to let them go uncompensated if they were to be gracious enough to help me out though. I'm not that immoral.
---
Idk then sounds like something is corrupted

yea tho it seems blizzard is really conservative with new servers so the chance for anyone to die is kinda small
---
That's awesome I'm going to add that to the wish list for later! Looks like with hub and all it would cost almost $200 bucks to get started... That seems a tad high so would you say it was worth it? Obviously money spent/value changes person to person but thought I'd ask.
---
Maybe because he doesn't read it? I'm not gonna go to some shit sub and tell them to make better posts if I don't intend on reading it.
---
The major complaint of BFA in comparison to WoD is that while BFA has plenty of content, no one wants to do it, especially with the state of many classes that just don't feel fun to play. Meanwhile WoD had a huge content problem but at least a lot of it was enjoyable and there was some fun specs.
---
May I ask why you think so? It was possible to kill the bosses without good equip in the past, why should it be impossible now?
---
As far as I remember timers where no thing in MC at all. So why shoulden't it be possible cause the most people will have more expierence in raiding since!
---
In "classic" a world first isen't a thing and those speed races mean nothing. This is the spirit that killed the game and the devs listening to those who like it.
---
Why does this sub of all subs not know how to take a screenshot
---
!RemindMe 4 Hours
---
many things to swing! ~~largre~~ Big axe, small axe, big sord, small sord, big mace, small mace. 
---
Need smart thing to learn fast!
---
Haha, was waiting for someone to notice. It is my Discord icon which is trollface. So when we speak it lights up.
---
Never played private, played a lot in vanilla. VC was new to me as of seing a post last week. Everyone on my servers called DM.
---
That was my initial thinking of goto server. Nice. So ill have to think between Mograine, Ashbringer and a few others
---
TBH Method didn't really seem to be taking it very seriously at launch, i mean most of them appeared to log on as the game went live expecting 0 queues.
---
I think the post 60 race to MC will be more interesting, i wonder how many guilds will have their shit together.

your wall is lit bro  
---
what led to this decision?  
---
hue hue hue
---
yeah this makes sense too.
---
Unlucky then lucky AF. Was thinking when the fuck am I going to get a polearm to use. Fuck.
---
I replaced my 10k steps with 10k yards between each quest
---
Are you a Tauren or Night Elf? I am a Druid and there are very few on my server, but in Mulgore there are plenty of druids as only Taurens can druid.
---
Thats good news
---
Asian guilds aren‚Äôt good.
---
Ah yes! Sorry... forgot that! :) you are right.
---
I am a Night Elf. I wanted to level in Westfall, so I had to go through Wetlands.
---
How many times I died? Not many, just 200-300 times I think
---
The only thing I want from expansions are the new races (not classes).
---
I would like to make it in a way that the new classes start in the current starting areas (for example, goblins would start in the orc/troll starting area and would follow that exact story line).
---
I don't want blood elf paladins and draenei shamans. Keep these classes unique per faction. I don't care about panda race.
---
I don't think this would have any impact on balance.
---
Regarding death knights and demon hunters, those are classes that were never tuned for level 60. Don't want those.
---
Pallypower is currently under re-development, cant say anything about FoL since i honestly dont remember it anymore and dont want to give out false adverts.
---
Ok I will admit. I chuckled. More than once.
---
Nah, druids are least played. If you are seeing many you are likely in NE or Tauren territory.
---
You can easily farm the livers at the entrance to redridge to the right, me and my friend found out and got all livers in 20 mins or so
---
all this time he was playing with a different child and only comes back now cause his new family left him and he needs money.
---
this sounds accurate
---
What would you do, play the same faction as back then for the nostalgia and the moments of recognition, or play the other faction to reproduce the feelings of wonder and to discover everything again (from the other side)?
---
Should also mention I also got consecration early, so I get oom easily, should I even bother judging when I'm aoe pulling or just keep SoR up?
---
I'm a sucker for new tech toys, so I think it is worth it. It works with everything I do on my PC, and I'm on my PC a LOT. Opens up my office a bit. Its a perfect mix between a black room and too much light. Feels just right. Also would be 60 bucks cheaper if you already had a Philips Hue Hub in the house.
---
Yeah I'm ready for queue simulator
---
Except it never was.
---
think I'd go fire
---
the warrior holds the mob in place and u nuke it
---
frost would be kinda pointless when the mob isnt getting to the mage anyway
---
imagine giving Sargon-watching neckbeards this much legitimacy as a boogeyman
---
rofl I see what you did there!
---
18 seconds is not enough.
---
They are offline ATM, the latest video from their stream shows that they dinged 52.
---
Are they playing off stream? Can you provide any proof?
---
You can finish up Ashenvale if you want. At 30 you can start either Hillsbrad or shimmering flats, though from experience the latter is a gankfest for alliance players
---
Instead of taking 10 minutes to come here and complain you could've downloaded Auctionator addon and make your like easier. But #nochanges and #pureclassicexperience will be your doom :).
---
God it was so satisfying to see. If i remembered the windfury proc can proc ANOTHER windfury !
---
Reading the quest descriptions is just more fun than looking everything up on thottbot. I have broken down and looked up a location twice in 16 levels so far.
---
Yeah for sure but is still long th0. need that shadowform
---
How pimp do they look though
---
Because using "auto-do-something-macro" is against EULA, TOS?
---
Well, then gear shouldn't look like clown gear, yes I am talking to TBC gear artists.
---
Imo Plainstrider Beaks in Barrens
---
Havin the same problem my friend
---
Priests is mostly Wand leveling I think, you don't want to kill all your mana on smite and stuff, its probably an efficiently thing so you don't have to keep drinking, and maybe the other talents just suck, and the 2 points is needed to reach another row futher down
---
Who cares about what they do in BFA, it will be handed to you next patch anyway
---
This perfectly describes me.  Just for reference I woke up at 4AM today.
---
Cause the powerlevellers must feel the exhaustion now and there is more to ragna than just entering. I might. E wrong i just think its gonna be week two. I dont care for speedruns personally. I really enjoy the pace of the old azeroth.
---
lmfao
---
Hahahahaha, alright alright alright
---
*laughs in endgame viability*
---
Deadmines in westfall.
---
is it  Ragefire Chasm  \`?
---
&gt; Duskwood ( final elite quests left)
---
If you want to be fast, do not backtrack for the final elite quests. The EP reward alone is not worth the time spent traveling. I'd only finish them if you want for story or completion reasons, or if they give you a nice reward.
---
I have literally never seen someone in game call it VC. Is this an American thing?
---
In case of linen cloth: bags have a ceiling of 4s, and an expected price of 3s, and require an input of 30 copper and 6 cloth. 10s for a stack is a guaranteed profit for the tailor, so you'll sell quickly.

---
$10 says the next retail expansion they reference someone going back in time to save things like this, creating an alternate timeline and paving the way for WoW Classic alternate expansions.
---
this is the wrong version i think, it needs to be for 1.13.2
---
There's nothing preventing you from entering and completing this dungeon, no, but getting to the entrance might be a problem. So technically, it's possible, but realistically, you'd be better off going to the Deadmines around level 18.
---

---
Longest queue I've seen was 4 minutes.
---
Dude by time ur in duskwood theres an entire chain of you following clues like a detective for like a half dozen quests, having to check basically lil lore stories in your inventory for hints. 
---
Shit like this is completely ruined when you use a addon/look it up. Im not saying dont look it up, ive looked up tons already. Im just saying give quests a chance before just looking them up!
---
Wut?

The detail in the UC is amazing. So many little things like this to discover...

It was because the old gods were them-self tweaking the timeline. There were some distortion that caused this. The oldgods hijacking the big demon portal was a timeline abberation

Does int/spell power increase seals and judgements damage?
---
Me and my brother-in-law are leveling together and I decided to go pally (which I had never done in vanilla) and I'm thinking of going a holy sort of build (also trying not to look at builds, wanna enjoy the game in all just exploring options). I'm just curious if me getting int will be benefiting my damage output from seals/judgments, consecration, holy shock, and my heals.

You are very lucky indeed

Method is bunch insecure betas that blames cheating when someone is better than them. After Red Bull world first they were on high horse but now looks like are pretty the same like RB team.
---
&gt;  I just want a class that's interesting to play (not like priest in pvp for example) and isn't too reliant on gear.
---
Sounds like Druid to me, if you dont like healing though, I would go rogue.
---
Super lame
---
Oh I haven‚Äôt seen that but from what I‚Äôve seen most big servers/streamer are nearly double the amount of horde compared to alliance
---
wtf is VC
---
Yup, but tbh you'll probably only hear two of those song. One for when you hit 60 and one for every level before. So you'll probably want to put your favorite fanfare in the "Minor Level Up" slot.
---
I seriously despise the asian market for games. They can make such great games ruined by microtransactions

I will warn you that getting on after 5pm may be tricky right now ! Mograine is a great server however ! Thoroughly enjoying my time there
---
Naw man. Every Tacoma since 2016 (the year they completely changed everything) has this problem with the automatic trannies
---
The sad part is you can have the dealership ‚Äúreflash‚Äù the automatic transmission (essentially, forcing the software to forget all the ‚Äúmpg-saving‚Äù algorithm that Toyota put in) and it feels AMAZING. 
---
But then, because of machine learning, it eventually regresses back to the mean for mpg-saving. It‚Äôs really a headache. 
---
Crazy, lol. Things absolutely gorgeous though. I love it. Just that oooone thing. Luckily I don‚Äôt drive that often (out of town every mon-thurs) so I kept mine.
---
What's the addons for your actions bars and frames?
---
Do you need to switch to defensive stance in order to hold aggro/survive? i feel like since you can't thunderclap, charge and you lose rage switching it's fairly annoying right now
---
Oke boss :D
---
I think it‚Äôs easy to forget because there isn‚Äôt the green explanation mark on the mini map, so you gotta run around a bit to find it.

What build are we all leveling as?

Know that feel mate! I'm not back until the 6th and hit 22, it's a bad time when i'm contemplating whether I really want to go now!
---
He doesn't patrol, he has multiple spawn points, and looks like a normal mob, hes a troll. make a macro /target Tazan and run around spamming it, once you target him, mark him with a marker and hope you get the tag, the area is usually a little busy.
---
I'm 19 and about to do the same on my Mage.
---
The hard part wasn't getting it going, but now I feel like I have created a monster....and this monster needs to be fed daily.
---
i really wanted to do fishing this time as i've never done it in all my chars... but my god i got to level 5 and gave up.  waiting like 20 seconds to MAYBE get a skill point is just aids!
---
Pretty sure they fired 800 employees and advertised the same positions right after, so that'd be just to make sure they don't have to pay seniorities
---
I would imagine the latter, those three stats will largely impact your leveling experience while the first item will only boost one of your stats
---
Nightborne
---
I've only ran into one asshole so far at level 25. Everyone else has been great! And I haven't been this nice to other wow players for a long time because I haven't needed to. It feels so good to interact!
---
**Autoclickers, and other shady methods "Race".**
---
but paladins can heal themselves, so you can auto attack for longer before a random wolf kills you cos you keep getting parried, dodged or miss...
---
honestly Classic is a fucker for the first part until you get the skill set to deal with more than one mob. If you are having major trouble pick a class with healing abilities and learn to manage your mana, its much less forgiving than retail.
---
Druid\\paladin\\shaman are all easy mode at the start as its all about managing the 5 second rule. burst out some spells, do some melee until mana is back, rinse/repeat.
---
You can do the same with the hue led strip, it should be cheaper. Also the hue hub is not needed, you can use an amazon alexa as hub, tough it should be verified if the hue software requires it to function
---
THEY HAVE WRONGED US! FOR KHARAZ ANKOR
---
Maybe not for small groups, some it is though. I've got 60-70 people in my guild split across all of Europe, some South Africa, NA, there's a lot of timezones to sort here and to just say that all we have to do is say "Go here instead" and it's all sorted is letting Blizzard off with the greed that caused the issue in the first place.
---
Kk ty
---
It's basic group selection, at this point every ones un the same boat power wise, so the main selector is personality.
---
So you can take the dick mage or the nice mage, there effectiveness at clearing is the same but it's more please NT with the nice mage.
---
At end game that's when it started to change, at lot of the people in my raiding guild were complete knob gobblers and elitist jerks, hell "elitist jerk" was a common stereotype of a high end raider by late vanilla, but at the point the blacklists based on personality vanished in favor of blacklists based on gear and skill.

Jesus. It's like he spawned when I targeted him. Thanks a lot
---
Like, is it really like that? I didn't decide to play yet because i thought there is no way WoW can be that way again :O
---
Somebody has been buying my terrible greens off the ah...
---
Really unbelievable
---
I dread tomorrow, making plans to wake up at least 7am to enter the queue lmao
---
You sir, are a saint. :)
---
There are 16 of them on 14 servers? What was your point?
---
LoL it is gimli jump from lord of the rings two towers.
---
I have another main, but I'm thinking to play alongside my wife'is druid with a pally. Extremely casual and so that its fun and solid. So what spec would work better? Holy or Retribution - who would better at duo play with druid to easily go through content?
---
Just has to be your internet connection getting interrupted I think,
---
That's because it's a way of leveling Tailoring for free basically! It's very effective for most profession, enchanters for example do the same "Enchanting x on your y, just bring mats, no fee". It's a win/win situation
---
Some have guilds that have a semi-hardcore time-frame to work within. For example my guild wants out raiders to hit 60 within two months of launch, which isn't that bad. My plan is to get 35 the first week, because that allows me to do what I want for the remainder or those two months granted I at least grind half a level a day. So personally I'm rushing now so I can chill later.
---
haha, i literally have the same lambo there in yellow
---
At first I was like "Where the hell do I go?!" and it was borderline frustrating. Then I remembered to take my time, and explore the world, and find unexpected world pvp while trying to track down quests and I freaking love it.
---
stockades gnomer smgy do them with all quests
---
u can try some hillsbrad u can stealth around the hordies
---
In the meantime i was ganked by Adolfhealer.
---
Sorry i dont min-max my movement
---
Anyone who plays wow this week should know how to spell queue or they are literally unteachable or the least observant person ever
---
Y'all played yourself. The Bronze Dragonflight gonna come send some players to stomp your ass for meddling.
---
You know, rogues have it pretty tough
---
Now if only his name were Doomsayer
---
Other faction for sure
---
golemagg, power went out, queued at 10am-ish and got a 5k queue. Not sure what you're talking about
---
Had this exact thought last night outside crossroads. Druid under a tree getting hit by a lion, not even facing the right direction. The lion had lost health (presumably because of thorns now that I think about it) but I shot at and killed the lion on my way past to save the guy then wondered if he was levelling his defence skill or testing heals or something.
---
Weirdly he healed up straight after, turned around and went into the attack animation... targeting a mob too far away and in the wrong direction. At that point I was done trying to figure out what was going on.
---
The point being..? That you're soft as fuck trying your best to sound hard to people you don't know on the Internet for the lulz? Remarkable. Truly outstanding. Wow.
---
If they don't need healing it's fine to wands, but how's that relevant to paladins is beyond me.
---
This is why I go out of my way to buff and heal any warrior I see fighting mobs
---
we all know we're gonna need you guys once everyone starts hitting the big dungeons and raids.
---
Increasing population caps is the worst you can do... everything in Vanilla is build for a max population of 6k and now we got 10k and all quests are fucking broken unless you are one of those people that like to only do 1 quest an hour.
---
I think I remember this questline but nothing specific.
---
i did that in prohression raids too tbf, im a warrior i have to charge in to wipe us all and piss the raidlead off when he blames the wrong people for fucking up
---
A new start, that‚Äôs really clever
---
Get a lure
---
Intelligence/mana pool trumps almost everything on the early levels in my experience. While pure damage is better for later levels and dungeon runs, I would easily prioritize spirit/int and partially stamina while levelling.
---
Post your server for starters :)
---
But if he was the one sending all of those shoulders
---
Then who was phone???
---
YOU THINK YOU DO, BUT YOU DONT
---
Didnt too shit sadly. They told us in EU to move away from shazzrad. We moved to firemaw, and ques there are 9 hours +  
---
I know some people are using Remote desktop, teamviewer and shit like this to start the que when they have been at work for like 1 hour.  
---
But Blizz needs to open 1-2 new realms that are CLOSED, only open for transfer to begin with. because this is really retarded, we told them 2 pvp servers for europe wasnt even close to enough. and ppl that are lvl 20+ isnt going to reroll fresh on a new server, so adding new servers are fixing anything im afraid
---
Because paladins are the ones crying.

What addon is that for your health bars?
---
From a social societal perspective it definitely says a lot about how your environment shapes human behavior.
---
&gt; I'm stressed and confused.

If this stresses you, go and find some serious help.

Huh, it didn't work for me

Damn, starter mistake, thanks!

Retail bad Classic good

I played a troll rogue a lot back in the day, and I thought the stealth mechanic was so much fun in world PvP! You can run around in any alliance zone not being noticed, only striking if you feel you will have the advantage. For example when they attack a difficult mob. I also had a lot of fun just stealthing through Ironforge or the tram with a couple of other rogue friends, baiting single alliances to attack one of us, and then all of my friends pounce on him. (That might have been in TBC, but I think it should work fine in vanilla too). So if you're thinking about world PvP, I would definitely recommend a rogue! They are also pretty fun in PvE, you often have to move around more in PvE raids than casters I think.
---
But I am sure a mage would be fun too, I am leveling a mage myself now :)
---
&gt; ps. I dont want to change servers since my friends play on that server 
---
That's like complaining you are sick while refusing to take medicine.
---
I considered that, but they look more different to each other than the sons do, and the sons look like the father.
---
Of course they could be their sons and daughters, depending on how messed up you assume the picture is! At least it would give lonesome Joe a more understandable excuse for opting out!
---
&gt; What is this nonsense?
---
Idk either, but it seems somebody doesn't know how to screenshot.
---
you go for a slow (3 seconds plus) dual wield weapon + fury spec 
---
here is a good wrap up : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtxX1WQILnM&amp;t=885s
---
Wait for the next trendy battle royale style game to pop-up. It‚Äôs obviously still popular with the younger crowd since it‚Äôs at the top after all this time.
---
Ya, HoT is just an interesting utility only druids get to use.
---
Athene best paladin
---
oh okay. Well I guess that means you win then. :)
---
How do you get the names to colour coordinate is that an addon or just setting?
---
I bet his mate sent him a conversation between himself and his girlfriend, probably.
---
Holy pally and a feral druid is an incredible combo.  But play what seems like fun, I bet ret pally and boomkin is fun too
---
Hi there. It‚Äôs not a macro, I am just clicking on the players and then casting Fortitude with a single keybind (it is bound to the ‚Äú0‚Äù key). 
---
Welcome to WoW and good luck!
---
JokerTV is almost 56 :))

---
Ghost Wolf is also very useful in dungeons and raids. With the right talents, it can be instant cast.
---
Any mobility that can be used where mounts cannot (especially in combat!) is very useful. 
---
Suppose you are healing for your dungeon group. People will have to wait for you to regen mana. As Ghost Wolf, you can easily catch up. Instant Ghost Wolf is also a great repositioning tool in fights.
---
For me, Ghost wolf would be the main reason to play Shaman, not only pre 40, but also after.
---
Hmm, I never thought of that, fair point.
---
Oh lord that cave was a blood bath 2 days ago. 5-6 groups clearing the cave simultaniously meant that the whole cave could surprise-spawn on you. Think we wiped 6-7 times before getting that darn insignia.
---
What's the addon you used for those frames? I'd like to see the hp of my targets.
---
what does "best" mean ?
---
 its 6 talent points that change thats it
---
I'll keep that in mind, thanks
---
I think people believe this is a thing, so they‚Äôre not being toxic. People don‚Äôt want to be toxic like in retail because they think it‚Äôll impact them later on. I‚Äôm not convinced it will. 
---
We had what, a few thousand people per realm back in vanilla. There was a realm census floating around on discord earlier this arvo for my server putting it at around 22/25k. Maybe in like a year or so when a heap give up/quit, server reputation might matter. Now when at any time the bigger realms have upto a 10k queue? Doesn‚Äôt mean shit, your one of too many to keep track of.
---
Weird it works for me. Did you put it in the add-ons folder. You've got to extract the winrar
---
Free up some bagspace
---
Hell yes!
---
NAGGERS !
---
That bitch...
---
Alot of players has been playing it on  private servers for years.
---
Exactly this and even more.
---
I don't want ANY expansion (because you know if they do TBC people will want WotlK) WITHOUT MAJOR changes !
---
Classic WoW is #nochanges but expansions should be #dochanges.
---
From either no flying or maybe make flying extremely slow so they're only used to go around obstacles and otherwise inaccessible places and keep grounded mount preferred for travel.
---
To drastic changes following what the community want(ed)...but also balance changes and some minor QoL changes (like add the retail calendar in TBC)
---
Even as deep fury you can tank all 5 man dungeons, especially the ones in levling zones, without any problem. You don't have to spec prot to be able to tank.
---
I turned 28, have a job, healthy diet and I was slaving in the gym the whole summer. During this week I have been living on sugar and caffeine, I am sleep deprived, have not been to the gym or eaten healthy, constantly checking teamviewer on work, can't focus on anything and yet I'm only level 23 (:
---
My body is ready, last work day today and next week I took vacation üòä
---
I did it tooo!! Congratz bro
---
Oh I thought you were using all those buffs at once, it‚Äôs not possible? hahaha
---
Thank you, I don‚Äôt remember the last time I had that much fun playing something.
---
It's just demand and stats on the item. If it's "Of the Eagle", "Of the Bear", or "Of the Monkey" it could usually be sold as a leveling green. Blues have either really high demand or really low demand with the latter being far more common. Low level blues usually only start getting expensive at the bg level caps for twinking (19, 29, 39 etc.)
---
Is that useful in world pvp and general world questing? Seems to me that holy pal can only damage undead, and there will be a full reliance on the druid for dps. Is this not so?
---
sleep?
---
IIRC SivHD called out to his community to join him there to chill on a low pop server so you might not have too much rp to begin with, but once it settles down it should be better

Common consensus is that the bulk of pop will fall off in 3~4 months leaving the dedicated playerbase.
---
Haha neeeeeerds
---
Almost time to wake up champ. Rise and shine
---
Care to explain to someone new, what's this buff and given by which character?
---
holy shit this is the meta
---
Surely a mage? :p
---
Legend of Stalvan!
---
Jesus can keep his heaven, the developers gave me my own.

Yep, was having this issue at my friend's for the last couple days. And once I came back home it's been fine.
---
Idk, dxdxdxdxdx?
---
I dont think a single WoW character has been killed as often and as cheaply as Sylvanas has.
---
I don't think she's ever had even a single plan actually work.
---
Everyone she's ever trusted has stabbed her in the back (or literally shot her in the face) except for Gary Stu and Im3 pretty sure he's going to be the one to kill her if the pattern holds.
---
Blizz turned her into a plot device in BfA the same way they did Garosh in Cata/MoP and Anduin in Legion/BfA and it isn't really fair to judge a character by their actions after the writers blatantly hijack them into doing Chaotic Stupid things to drive the plot forward until they turn into a loot pi√±ata at the end of the xpack.
---
----
---
Tldr BfA sylvanas is flandarized fake news and getting pissed at a plot device and not the awful villain-writing is childish.
---
Well cone of cold is not needed. But it improves your gameplay a lot because you can close some gaps with it. What you normally do is:
---
Shield up - body pull - circle them - frost nova - turn around walk bit - blink - 1-2 blizzard - CoC - frostnova ( here it comes with CoC sometimes you have still a cd on frostnova and there comes CoC it saves your life with the slow you get like 1-2 seconds and your frostnova is ready) - blizzard/arcane explosion 
---
If you haven‚Äôt heared about ‚Äúin frost we trust‚Äù check it out highly recommend it to see some gameplay
---
What is quickly mean to you? The game will not die anytime soon. I think everyone in this sub will recommend you to try out the game as it's only $15 a month. If you do not enjoy the game then you only spent $15 which is equivalent to a cheap lunch or dinner.
---
Seriously try out the game and read through this sub where there are so many posts saying this game is amazing.
---
Wow. 1 Gold 2 Silver, that‚Äôs like my balance ingame.
---
Eeeeewwwww
---
I do this often.  Not every time, but I enjoy it!
---
So you decided to post on reddit instead of going to sleep?
---
Deadlock
---
I'm trying to enjoy Classic but there is way toooooooooooooo much walking and not even Level 40 mount won't cut it for me. I was planing to level a lot of characters but with vanilla being walking simulator, sorry i won't. 
---
Game is great after que, tabbing the mob u must kill if you can before everyone else and of course walking, walking, walking.....Too much time consuming things happening right now, i started to question if it's really worth it for my time. I mean hours played with actual play ratio is very bad right now.
---
Yes please lemme know what addon is used herr
---
Remember guys: You can go an sleep for 4 hours, or you could do something important and level your character. Sleep is for the weak. While you sleep someone is leveling past you.
---
This post gave me life.
---
It‚Äôs a buff which lets you breath underwater, and it‚Äôs cast by warlocks. It‚Äôs so situational that it‚Äôs basically worthless.
---
The second he saw darkshore, he knew.
---
And this is why ques are so long ... and people dont get to play it ... hope you get banned
---
Diddledicks likes to fiddle with my dicks.
---
You should be trying to kill the traitorous bastard
---
Retail is that way ----&gt;
---
And the people voted for bonds
---
Yeah dude join the Horde,
---
Yeah that's what I thought, at least with with trolls being able to be priests and starting in duotar I assume there's a priest trainer somewhere though, it's just the priest racial abilities where I might have to go back to undercity I think
---
MadSeason has a great stream, StaySafe is also avoiding dungeons I believe
---
no way is it getting better with the weekend crashers
---
Heya I wrote [that guide](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/mage-dps-pve-guide) you mentioned, the problem with perception is that it will only allow you to detect Rogues **when you already know they are nearby**. Most of the cases you will be chilling and taking a drink and BAM get ambushed from behind at low Mana!
---
In this type of situation escape artist is much more likely to allow you to eventually polymorph the Rogue and escape / kill him after evocating than Perception, which is essentially useless :) that was my main logic behind never recommending Human for min-maxing Mages, and this is not even considering the 5% Int and Engineering skill bonus.
---
Still, any of these differences is nothing compared to the fashion meta, so if you like Human's looks much more go for it!
---
The only real difference is the inclusion/exclusion of imp blizzard and the talent that gives your chill effects a chance to root (frostbite?) You either want the blizzard chill and NO rooting or Visa versa... that's the only difference between AoE frost mage and single target mage.
---
Heartwarming to see someone experience the contrast and pull through. Hope you guys get to run a dungeon together, that usually cements investment pretty well
---
This is the solution to your problem OP
---
No class can DW axes at level 19 and very few people are going to be interested in twinking a tank.
---
I agree with that although spells like tricks of thief helps a lot avoiding aggro
---
What's so special about 25? Execute is 24.
---
Arms at lvl 30 is actually a better tanking spec then prot because it allows you to easily keep aoe threat, allowing you to pull 3-5 mobs and having your casters AoE them down. It's something you should give a try if you're questing a lot. Can also 2H tank with it relatively easy if you and your healer are appropriate lvl for the dungeon.
---
WC still a fuckin maze lol
---
Garrosh kills Bovar, Tirion becomes the Lich King.
---
Currently level 33 as a holy priest and I dont want to kill myself
---
not an expert but imho consecration costs too much mana to be worth it early on, especially since most of your mail gear wont have int.   
---
getting earlier to holy shield is probably better, as the reflect damage should help with aoe tanking also.
---
Yesterday when I was doing that quest I formed a mage hit squad.  4 mages lighting up troggs doing dangerous big pulls for no reason other then fun.  Everyone stayed until all quests were completed. 
---
Another great classic experience.

if u dont see a quest at ur trainer at level 10 for rez or whatever then u may have to return to tirisfal tho
---
Paladin works best as a multiplier. They turn warriors into unstoppable killing machines with BoF.
---
Just one more lvl and you get an Execute, which basically speeds up killing by 20%.
---
Right, my point was no cash shop

She reminds me of [Merlwyb Bloefihswyn](https://img2.finalfantasyxiv.com/accimg/74/e4/74e42f812ffe5330cb106f1fd5e95d8601553c14.jpg) from FFXIV. I love this character.
---
Great job!
---
Alliance fear puts a smile on this old tauren's face
---
Or you could turn off automatic updates.
---
In my experience, Fury + Tactical Mastery is an almost universal solution build
---
Okay so basically..
---
Higher Rank, get better gear? Seems fine.
---
Eng + blacksmithing.
---
First should be self explanatory. Second gives you a trinket that grants fear immunity for a few seconds
---
I‚Äôd be more happy with the first one tbh.

O-M-G i can not believe that i have used PWS on all tanks so far and not knowing about this. Warrior tank i healed in dungeon asked the group why the rage gen was so bad and we had no clue. Now i feel bad.  Thanks OP

I've barely paid attention to my girlfriend.

All I've done is play this game and sleep in 4 hour chunks so I don't have a queue. I haven't talked to a single person in a dungeon since wotlk and in the past two days, I've already talked more in party chat and made more friends than the past 10 years in retail.
---
This is the best game ever fucking made. Please take hints from classic / tbc for the next expansion.
---
I'd pull out my laptop in an instant.
---
Yea js big difference between microtransactions that fuel quarterly earnings reports and ones that more than 75% of people wanted so they could play free

I COULDN'T SLEEP BECAUSE OF THIS. People speak other languages mate and at least they were kind enough to give you a reason why they don't want to group.

Seriously what's wrong with you LOL
---
Heya, I'd like to recommend that you read my [Warrior Leveling guide at Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-warrior-leveling-guide), it has detailed answers to all of your questions and will surely help you get to 60 as smoothly as possible for a first time player :) let me know if you have any remaining questions after going through it!
---
Like others have said, classic isn‚Äôt for everyone. It‚Äôs personally not for me. I see myself getting to maybe level 20. I didn‚Äôt play when it cane out. I started in Cata. A few have talked about quality of life in retail and I personally like those things. I wish they would take ideas from classic and bring to retail. 
---
During the time classic WoW was out, I had all the free time in the world. Now that I‚Äôm older, I don‚Äôt. I appreciate what retail has that allows me to catch up due to life. I‚Äôm also really happy for everyone enjoying classic. I started a rogue and then today switched to hunter and got to level 10.   Much more fun experience.  What ever you decide to do, enjoy your time playing and have fun with friends.
---
Depends on what your playstyles are and who likes to tank (or not), any combo is viable. For the sake of not beeing super frustrated, i'd recommend not fully speccing heal during leveling though. Retri/Feral or Prot/Boomkin are both really good combinations and will bring you a lot of fun.
---
how do you not know about shaq? i dont watch basketball and i still know shaq :D look him up just for his size :D
---
I need to level fishing so I can make deviate delight..... It has no other purpose for me  =]
---
A very valuable item too. Do you know what a twink is?
---
I'll be honest with you shroud's stream has been really entertaining so far, his group has had good vibes when ive been watching and have been chuckling a fair bit.
---
What kind of god tier heresy is this!?
---
Would you say there's a variance of Varians?
---
Honestly, I would rather a heavy hand continue to fall on those abusing all systems.  The more people that are banned for it, the less likely others will get into it, and the less likely I will encounter exploits later.
---
Why this Reddit is doing that I haven't a clue, but more power to blizzard in that regard.  Exploits for unfair advantage are pathetic and users deserve the hammer.
---
That's just silly. I had a great WC run yesterday with two hunters.
---
I loved the red. They occasionally bring it back unbranded. But now they rebranded Game Fuel as it‚Äôs own beverage. 
---
Mountain Dew Amp Game Fuel
---
I like it.
---
oh cool, good to have it confirmed by someone who has done it, thanks :)
---
If you equip it, it will make your levelling experience marginally easier for a couple of hours. If you save it, you can sell it for hundreds of gold a few months down the line.
---
God No...
---
I don't know if you're being sarcastic, but no... Just no... It's not even funny
---
Yeah because they will melee
---
he asked for paladins weaknesses, not is strengths
---
Need the addon. Move anything
---
I need to see if these work in Linux, I have wanted them for a while.
---
Going Fury first for Cruelty and then into Arms until level 30 where you respec to Sweeping Strikes seems to be the best play for speed. Check out the details at the [Warrior Leveling guide](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-warrior-leveling-guide), got some updates coming up to recommend this talent swap progression!
---
My group was two rogues a hunter and a mistweaver. So all 3 of my dps had a threat assist and on large enough pulls they would still rip afro with me doing 60% of their dps.
---
Well, it's value in a few month doesn't mean shit today. Or at least, it doesn't mean it will sell for the same value today.

Lateralus was my favorite album of all time before this no joke. And this album reminded me of Lateralus at times but they really fucking killed this album I have to say it‚Äôs my favorite by far.
---
I think tool albums are made to be listened to all the way through, as one song. As a full album this kicked ass on so many levels. Pneuma was everything I wanted the second song to be in every way and everything that followed it was gold. Anyone who hates on it never liked tool to begin with, I think all fans should be grateful for this gem.
---
while running through ashenvale a horde warrior ran past us. he had the ghost character animation, and we were able to see the ghost debuff. the tooltip was even the same as when someone is dead.

Careful!  All the hunters are gonna want you as their rare pet!

10 min cd :/
---
&gt; Hi, I only played paladin prot during WOLTK and would like to tank in classic (so go warrior), is this class and specific role easy to learn/perform in vanilla ? Thanks !
---
Paladins can tank raids, but its all a matter of how much effort you put into it to make it work. I don't suggest it for new new players to wow classic though.
---
Would have been lvl 4.
---
Lvl 2 you would have gotten arcane intellect. You dot get abilities at odd levels, only even ones.
---
Truth!
---
Not on eu
---
I can confirm mage and warrior are a bit tough especially before lvl 20
---
Hey where did you download Luna? Mine isn‚Äôt working

All I heard was Cartman's voice screaming, "NO STITCHES THAT A BAD STITCHES!"

I think SoC also has a 20% spell dmg coefficient correct?

I was about to buy a pro license but the purchase button wasn't working. The I realized I need to switch region to the one I'm currently in, and after doing that the price increased by 50%. Fuck off M$.

Bummer, and weird imo.

I already have hue lights in the rest of my apt and this hella convinced me to just get these for the PC. Excited to see them irl!!!

Whenever you decide too, if you go form natural zones, you prob wouldn't meet up until like level 30ish

Hey thanks for the reply!  That's exactly the type of information I was looking for.  For me trinkets have always been a thing, so I am clueless as to how pvp works atm.  Those are excellent things to take into consideration.

Imagine being a salty little shit while we're all having a fun wholesome time reliving classic WoW.

Now that I‚Äôm back for Classic I may level a couple of my toons in group finder, just to experience the new dungeons. I always preferred them. Now with the heirloom gear it would move quickly. I logged in the other day and my main had 300k gold. That‚Äôs probably not a lot by BFA standards, but for Cata economy I was rich. I‚Äôve got a bench full of 85s to choose from. I can probably buy all the heirloom gear with 300k.
---
 ¬ø por que?
---
Glad to hear it's being recreated. Helped a lot with multiple buffs to multiple classes and monitoring things.
---
In dungeons you only need to press frostbolt
---
Well you have to tell us the name
---
I SAID ONLY DRUIDS GET IT, STOP USING THAT SPELL OR ILL REPORT!
---
They've had 16 people on 14 different servers, not over 14 different servers, so they have tried 14 different servers to find a server that can accommodate 16 people and you're trying to say it's the consumers fault.
---
My point is that suggestions of "Just move server it's easy!" Is a disingenuous argument.
---
True. But it's worth keeping in mind. Paladins work best in a group, when solo they're significantly less capable, more so than any class, besides being tanky as hell they can't do much without other people.
---
Our you could just update Windows instead of ignoring it until it force updates
---
&lt;We PvP IRL&gt; was a bunch of military members in one guild. The amount of fuckery was legend.
---
I don't mind it.
---
I remember in Vanilla/TBC, there was a macro for auto-shot, which paired it with Arcane Shot so you would maximize damage output.
---
This would combine it.
---
Otherwise I think you can't remove the auto-attack in the interface somewhere, I am 50% sure there is a option for it.
---
Fuckin bill Gates got eem
---
Don't you have a phone? Just use that
---
Tanking feels awfull, I skipped deadmines cause I just did not have enough spells to want to pull it off.   
---
However, I made a macro where i can fast mark a skull to the mob I am attacking. Makes it alot easier!
---
I used gold to get gold
---
I'm leveling a warrior for the 1st time, at 21 currently, what rotation do you use for AoE, at the moment all I'm doing is tab sundering and revenge when procced
---
Get spirit tap 5 and the increase wand dmg for easy lvling
---
I am a proud member of this mountain clan, he should look outüòÇüòÇ
---
Atrocious idea in a game with this much investment per character.  Alts are cheap in diablo so it works there.
---
 Isn't that a lot like asking if you're going to like the the food at a new restaurant without ever trying it and also wondering if you'll want to go back there after? *Without having actually gone.*
---
I thought there was a free trial. It's basic. I'm not sure you could use it in vanilla though.
---
Deviant Delight has been delightful
---
I have it too I just click and hold then move it where I want. Not sure why it's not working for you :(
---

It just is ^^
---
White savior complex huh, I hope you don‚Äôt plan on stealibg their land and hunt down their kodos for profit.
---
So you would say pick uo the 5 points in cruelty first and then go arms?
---
Thank you for this post! So good!
---
You can disable any kind of updates if you need to. I'll update it when I see fit, not when my computer decides it for me.
---
Individuals haven't, it's TRUE. But convincing groups to move (and lots of people play with gdoups), much harder. And if you cant bring your group, switching servers becomes much less appealing
---
Def picking staff over sword
---
Hahaha. Meme level over 9,000. Well played.
---
Loved these dragonlings. I remember on a pserver i ran past and figured 'ill just kill about 5 or 10 in case the pet drops'. And it dropped. Those moments feel so good.
---
You can't keep blaming retail for your problems
---
Thank you for the reply. The guides that I found already had differences in the first few skill points. Would you mind sending me a talent tree of the two different trees?
---
It's a great little detail alright. Loads of details like that all across the world. It fries my brain to think of them doing this back then, working all out to ship this product - not knowing if the game was going to succeed. Just designing things for the love of the IP and of gaming. &lt;3
---
How long do you think it takes for 7 people to kill 1800 mobs?
---
Cool story bro
---
I don't know the exact talents but I'm sure you'll be able to handle most instances and 20-mans as a feral/resto druid. You'll just need some good gear, especially for healing.
---
I just gained half a level from 25 to 26 going for Satyr Horns in Ashenvale
---
Idk if alliance get a similar quest there though
---
Yea, and only gets worse from there lmao
---
Best. Route. Ever
---
True, but aren't there often things in place that detect a repetitive keypress at regular intervals?  Space bar every 5 minutes precisely could trigger something
---
That show is a god damn treasure of early Youtube. Duel wielding shields still not being a thing is very disappointing to me
---
How would that work exactly? We are already at capacity, why would it hurt the game if blizzard added 6000 more slots (as in logged in simultaneously) to the server, as well as a couple new layers? It‚Äôs not like 10000 new people are suddenly welcome on the server; the server cap stays the same. Keep the cap as is, increase permitted simultaneously logged in characters and increase layer count for now. 
---
Problem solved. 
---
This won‚Äôt affect Phase 2 at all, unless they actually DECREASE server capacity down to half (don‚Äôt quote me on that, just to make a point) of what we have now in case all the players DO stick around long enough to still populate the servers as bad as now. However, if half of all players now quit playing before phase two, then in my utopian scenario above they could probably just reduce layering without a problem, as well as player slots if that saves some RAM in their basement wardrobe, for Christ sake. 
---
Rant over. 
---
Please prove my solution wrong if I am, I don‚Äôt want to come across as a douchebag. I‚Äôm just a technologically ignorant father with little time to play, but a huge urge to do so.
---
But isn't timber wood you use to build things? Genuine question. Am German.
---
i have been doing 12k+ steps per day ... end up doing over 70% of the stops during work lunch, and fresh air brakes etc
---
Hopefully your on my server so I can corpse camp you while your crying under a tree
---
no problem, just remember the 5 second rule is key, in combat you only regen mana after 5 seconds of not casting, use that fact to the fullest, i.e heal up to full with the last bit of mana so you survive until it's regenerated again.
---
Druid is may fave for this since after your mana is empty you switch form and DPS\\tank for a bit. All the way through leveling and PvP you feel like a power house compared to other classes, and hardly ever have to drink when you get the mana managment right.
---
Its just a pity that druid is not given love outside of resto when raiding starts, but you can play any role through all the dungeon phases, and if you are a good tank, all the way to AQ40.
---
Man one time I was questing and was getting pounded by two mobs at once... was about 1 hit from dying... out of nowhere suddenly a priest drops in, heals me and helps me kill me mobs. 
---
y‚Äôall are bros lmao
---
Can you read or are you just new to the game?
---
Ninja Looting was a large enough problem that Blue Posts had to be made addressing it and providing official policy on it.
---
If an agreement is made in-game about how loot is to be distributed (*as in the above case wjere everyone agreed to roll Greed on the item and the scammer waited for everyone to roll Greed as was agreed upon so he could roll Need and ninja the item*) and that agreement is violated, then that violation is actionable per GM policy.
---
**Every Ninja knows this information.**
---
This is why you'll never see ninjas agree to anything in game about loot distribution or they'll weasel around the rules so they never state outright that they agree to a rukeset that prevents them from scamming people.
---
If they say loot rules are X and do Y and get reported, they get actioned by GMs.
---
If they are told loot rules are X and agree, then do Y and get reported, then they get actioned by GMs.
---
This has been common knowlege for over a decade.
---
Im the same way, I invite someone because there doing the same quest as me, always leads to checking quests with each other, playing for hours together, and then you add them, I had a guy told me he added me, and I already added him to my friend list like over half hour ago.
---
Kurinaxx
---
I tried to do something similar a few hours ago, but I don't have too much silvers on me, so I was asking for 6 linen and 30c for the cost of materials per linen bag.
---
People just made fun of me... really discouraging...
---
It was well known and documented 10 years ago.  People still played servers with Russians and Chinese for years and STILL came back to classic.  Gameplay loop is fun Bros.  Most people are casual and will not run out of content for years.
---
I literally made a draft of an e-mail I will send to Blizzard if I get banned, about how much I love the game and I just want to play all the time... I would NEVER use a bot/script if it gave me an advantage in game, but I literally cannot afford to sit in queue for hours after work (: I know I'm part of the problem, please no bully.
---
We disagree on the context of the statement.
---
You dont know how good paladins are in world pvp do you?
---
People keep saying "seasons!" Because it works in other games without stopping to think for 14 seconds about how much more is invested in a classic wow toon than any of those games
---
&gt;I used to main paladin but something felt so hybrid about it and that it doesn't peak in any area that a healer or warrior would! 
---
That's exactly how I feel about it currently. I mained priest in vanilla and loved it, but it always lacked the damage and heavy armor I loved from warriors. And when playing warrior, I never felt strong on my own or like a real protector of the group (without healing and bubbles). That's why I chose paladin it perfectly combines what I love, sadly he never excels in any of it though. No way to deal good damage, no way to outheal other healers and can't tank either. I will probably lose all motivation in endgame and go back to retail wow paladin.
---
druid is fantastic end game, probably even better in pvp than pve. Up till the end of phase 3 they absolutely will be viable
---
why is it in your offhand?
---
Imo unless you can get a good cash infusion of 20g-30g for it right now, it's beter to hold off and sell it for 100g+ in a few weeks time.
---
Using it to make your questing 5% faster for 2 levels is not worth it, compared to 100-200g. That item will be worth about 2-4 hours of very efficient gold farming later on..
---
Interesting.. I definitly will try this out!
---

Hey - just in case you hadn‚Äôt seen, Auctioneer for Classic was released last night :).

How about unlock more layers as well as increase player slots! The net sum of people you meet could be the same, but queues could be gone.

Some Paladin general tips:
---
1) Bind your auras. Specially for PvP, you'll want to swap between devotion when a warrior is on your ass, to frost resistance when getting kited by a mage and/or shaman and fire/shadow resistance for warlocks, priestes and mages as well.
---
2) Bind your blessings. You'll want to some way to monitor every party member of what blessings they currently have. Blessings are some of the most powerful buffs in the game and is what makes Paladin so useful in group play. Being able to save a Mage using BoP and rebuffing BoW afterwards, same for Warrior using BoF and rebuffing BoM afterwards.
---
3) Blessing of Sacrifice. Same as other blessings, you'll want to have this one binded. Using Blessing of Sacrifice on an ally before getting hit by Polymorph, Blind, Frost Trap, Repentance, Wyvern Sting or any other type of incapacitate will help you get free of it when your BoSacrifice gets hit.
---
4) Healing: If you have plenty of downtime and mana for it, buff yourself with righteousness and throw some auto-attacks to help your party with damage, or use Judgement of Justice in mobs running away if your DPS is low and the dungeon is tight. You might save a coupe wipes with Judgement of Justice. If you don't have a lot of downtime, try to always be casting Holy Light and interrupt it if your about to overheal, what this does is when your tank actually needs a heal you'll probably be in the middle of a cast, instead of having to start it from the beginning. Also this "always be casting" technique is useful in PvP as you can bait some interrupts with actually being interrupted if you cancel the cast in time.
---
I understood it instantly, sadly most people seem to just downvote you if they can‚Äôt understand it.
---
The holy trinity
---
Fuck me. Just stopped playing 10 minutes ago. Got home from work yesterday at 3pm. Played till 7am next day lol. Thank fuck I have tomorrow through Monday off. I feel destroyed.
---
He is gorgeous
---
It‚Äôs 2019, i don‚Äôt see too many players staying more than a few months. 
---
Fortnite will release some extra skins and the new FIFA and CoD will be released, many people will move on.
---
In 2005 - 2010 not much could compete with WoW. Things are very different now and even though i intend to stick around for the long term i highly doubt the majority of people currently overloading the servers will.
---
But ye, time will tell.
---
Happy leveling!
---
I remember you :) 
---
I left after we got the CThun down. Are you playing Classic?
---
Haha why that route? I'd recommend taking the ship from darkshore to wetlands and run from there to dun morogh. That's the natural second soon for gnome/dwarf and human man just take the tram from stormwind to ironforge and run from there with his short friend.

pretty sure you get it at 2, just like every other class quest...

Im a horde player. I didnt even know you could take ship from darkshore to wetlands haha. 
---
I tried to pretend to be an alliance, but was found out!
---
The absolute best game ever in each one of those expansions
---
I finally put my own finger on why it's so much better than BFA wow.  I was running around the city preparing my bags at the bank trying to decide what to bring with me.  If actually felt like a camping trip, and adventure that would take hours even days.  It isn't the same when you can just flying around popping 5-8 mobs at your level without even worrying about dropping below 50% HP.  I feel accomplishment cutting through beasts and quests on my warrior.  Every ding I get a point that slowly progresses my power
---
I just want them to develop new content while preserving a lot of what made vanilla great, community interaction.
---
Have you checked to see if your direct x is up-to-date
---
Reading this as a none wow like, well all these things sound delightful
---
DO IT, i used to do this back in the day (:
---
So true
---
Noob question, how do you send stuff? I'm training blacksmithing and once I get to higher levels and get better recipes, I want to make equipment like this and send it to people as well. Also do you have to find recipes for above "white" quality crafting? Or can you buy them from npcs?
---
the old republic
---
question: Whats the difference between the different ranged weapons and thrown for warriors for pulling purposes...
---
I thought adults played classic
---
Have you removed any -master endings to the folder?
---
The .toc file should be 2 levels below the add on folder.
---
Unforuntately, it's not possible as we have no way of knowing which orders have sold (other than our own).
---
\&gt;  **The game has no fucking soul!** 
---
That's super subjective, define "soul"?
---
\&gt;  **What a fucking grind that I don't care to complete, I even looked for a option to pay for it.** 
---
Yeah, grinding for epic mount in classic is way easier /s
---
\&gt;  Questing in Elwynn I hired a mage to take care of some mobs while I took out the named guy to earn a green sword. I payed him 2 silver and he said thanks.
---
Helped a hunter in Nazjatar with a fight against 2 enemy players, he said thanks.
---
I get it, you don't like retail. But these arguments are subjective and strange. Ofc if you like questing you will enjoy classic more. I am personally having huge amounts of fun in both games.
---
Does it last for higher levels?
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt keep trying to recreate TBC just call vanilla TBC waiting room‚Äù

underminejournal disagrees
---
Mythic what? this is classic wow
---
I think ‚ÄòTimber Wolf‚Äô is a type of wolf, and it‚Äôs just funny that it‚Äôs been translated the other way.
---
For years I wondered what mmo will release that will finally be big enough to kill off wow.
---
Turns out it's wow.
---
It's going to be ironic if player's just don't want to return to retail after this and next expansion dies a death.
---
No need to apologise. This game is amazing!!
---
I play on Pyrewood Village and I‚Äôve always met friendly players here so far on the alliance side :) it‚Äôs PvE tho so not for everyone
---
Guildies that plow through.
---
I am Undead.
---
Hey that's my ping right there. Absolutely playable.
---
Same coming back 8th and managed to hit my mage to level 20. He is resting in OG now...god we are sick
---
Maybe they will notice a properly engaged game will also make more profits? If classic wow keeps people paying it will lead to more things, Im pretty sure theres a lot of people like myself who only subbed to pay classic and not retail.
---
Pretty stupid. Absolutelt impossible without automation client side, yet blizzard allows for it. Meanwhile they are  banning for scripts to prevent afk.
---
For me its simple, i need gold, if an item can be sold/disenchanted/vendored thats gonna be a need.
---
Are you gonna equip it now (or soonish) or can it be sold on ah? If so you roll need.
---
the early bag man gets the worm
---
I enjoy deviant delight.
---
Absolutely, hate that damn thing.
---
Got dc'd twice today. Golemagg EU. I'm in 8k queue right now but it seems to go much faster then I am used to. Either they did something or it is due to ppl disconnecting.
---
I agree with the other guy who commented. I think that layers are crashing.
---
At what level should i go out of the barrens for the next zone tho? i feel like the quest for really random requirements and scattered for inconvenience at this point, doesnt seem to lead me to somewhere beyond.
---
Stop flexing on my bare lvl 13 ass
---
Hotw/NS hybrid is great for something like this, you can do solo stuff and leveling, pvp, flag carry, tank, heal, dps about as well as a Druid can(well, not quite, a full feral build with omen of clarity and power shifting would do more damage, but still)
---
The true Druid experience you can do anything, but none of it as well as a dedicated class(or spec in this case)
---
Coochie Cove
---
some stats are better for others
---
How clueless are you that you make a topic about 'stuck in leveling limbo' if you cant use your guide. Just play the game
---
Yeah. If it's an upgrade to you then you're in your full rights to roll need.
---
Exclusivity and hard work being the key factor to getting good items is a big reason everyone loves classic. It's not the snowflake everyone gets the same stuff because we are all winners - you EARN it and it feels fucking good man.
---
The guild fits perfectly
---
didn't know if it was a taboo to talk about, started a month ago
---
Try using lutris, works like a charm :)
---
It‚Äôs the hero we didn‚Äôt know we needed.
---
Just be ready for everyone to expect you to tank. It wouldn't be bad to learn to tank, you'll be very popular
---
Wasn‚Äôt Archage the first ‚Äúwow killer‚Äù?
---
You don't possess the mental acuity to grasp the nature of it
---
I am still awaiting that glorious 2019 picture of you in the suit for reference btw. Don't you think I have forgotten!
---
Cartman?
---
Van Cleef... it's the boss. It used to be confusing because people had to use the lookingforgroup channel back in the day and DM was dead mines
---
Yes.
---
If I "need" an item like in that scenario, I'll wait for everyone else to roll, if everyone greeds then I'll take it, if someone needs I'll let them have it
---
&gt; People literally just invite me to groups without asking.  
---
On a serious note, people used to complain about this all the time, calling it ‚Äúrude‚Äù
---
You think you want that, but you don't...
---
Update: 140 mv is too much undervolting. My pc was fine until 6 hours of wow on ultra.
---
I dropped it to 130, but I'm thinking 120mv is the way to go. Just wanted to make sure if you used my post you got the right info.

---
My hero ! :)
---
Yeah, there are a ton of pages already in the Mage guide including a specialized one for [Classic Mage PvP](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-mage-pvp-guide) so feel free to browse around, will be updating even more information as I level and learn more! :)
---
Yes this relatiom between me and my character is so scary lol. NOTHING lile retail character (if its not your char since vanilla)
---
Ikr, should just go play skyrim, witcher, dark souls,whatever.
---
Nothing like a cool dry crypt to rest in
---
Except it always was. DM is deadmines you ignoramus
---
Nope, the amount of subscribers they will lose would not balance out cash shop income. Vanilla players arent retail players. This tactic wont work in Classic. Even blizzards terrible analytics will have figured this one out by now. Hence why classic is not theyre main focus.... yet.
---
I see it mainly as elitist talk really, druid is extremely fun, versatile &amp; useful in both pvp &amp; pve and these days people are much more open to raiding with a bunch of classes than just standard warriors mages and rogues. Considering the class is not too popular either, its easier to grind out for gear compared to majority of other classes which will have that same class x6 in each raid group competing for the same items. Tell your buddy if there's a will there's a way :)
---
In the meantime everyone tells you that you dont really want to see your dad.
---
Yeah...no
---
Yup think its the optimal leveling talent path! Get Cruelty and Improved Charge + Improved Overpower as soon as possible :)
---
As a priest there seems to be lots of healers. Lots of tank shortages.
---
Ok this seems the best compromise tbh, I‚Äôll do this in future. Thanks
---
Really? Where do you see sales data on undermine journal?
---
I am on Alliance (because I was alliance back in vanilla). Reddit voting showed 50/50 between Horde and Alliance, so I guess it is well balanced.
---
Only a few classes in EQ could effectively solo, and of those classes could only solo in the hands of someone very good with them.
---
Enchanters for example could solo better than any other class (except maybe Bards), but only REALLY good Enchanters could pull it off. I literally solo'd current raid bosses as an Enchanter. Most Enchanters didn't have a clue how to charm solo though, and it was extremely dangerous. Enchanters were designed as a support class. EQ had a design approach that included a lot of support classes that would significantly boost a group's power, but those classes would generally be fairly weak on their own.
---
In EQ, trying to take on a same level mob solo for most people was suicide. You almost always stuck to mobs that were about 3 levels below you. Light blue or blue con (short for "consider") to you in the parlance of the game.
---
Enchanters were just the most broken class ever created if in the hands of someone who knew how to use them, so I regularly steamrolled red cons (3+ levels higher or bosses).
---
That‚Äôs easy then. Just forget about the shit show that has happened and pretend it never did.
---
Nah that was rift archeage is a Korean mmo I played a while ago that honestly had the best crafting wpvp and specs that I've seen and was totally ruined by rampant p2w
---
Yeah, I understand people's enthusiasm but this stupid religion war (it goes both sides) is getting old.
---
It's perfectly fine for people to enjoy both games, there's really no need to shit on each other.
---
The only saving point for me is that currently I have 0 money in any of my cards to buy a subscription. I had to withdraw everything last week and now all my money is cash and I won't be arsed to go downtown to buy a gamecard. I have eliminated my chances of giving in by not being able to! The only reason I'd like to start now rather than later is to get on the hype train with all the people who have logged in now (who might have given up by next month)
---
&gt; ~~addons~~ expansions
---
Same. I instaquit because the return of challenging dungeons was the one thing I returned for in Cata.
---
The 1-12 parts of his guide are free on his site?
---
The Countdown to Classic podcast has interviews with a bunch of former devs and they're a great listen. This game wasn't a lucky accident, a lot of talented people put their all into this game
---
I am not sure to be honest, while what you say is true I also think the game now attracts a lot of people that have jobs and families. I don't really care if the 12h a day people run out of content fast, I know that there is enough for me to progress through.
---
As a hunter, I always make sure to help a struggling warrior with a few shots and some bandages when clearly in need. 
---
I have no buffs to give, 
---
but I still want you to live &lt;3
---
Should have matched heart with warlocks was the perfect opportunity
---
Most certainly can be, I honestly just cant see people making twinks on launch. Id assume BG's are dead. haven't Q'd for one though.
---
Undead Rogue FTW

This app will have them sorted by rating and how much it could interfere with game play etc.

---
Warriors are the best dps by late endgame, but are heavily gear dependent. As for pvp, they shred people but are pretty easy to kite and have no self heals of course, so good support is incredibly helpful

I get it, was more a projection of disgust that people would even consider calling DM VC

I haven't been able to log in yet because of my working hours. When i arrive at home there's always 5h queue and i feel dirty doing the remote thing. Let's hope queue times get better next week or so.
---
I guess im going to feel dirty next week tho...
---
Yeah you can easily tank as fury or arms, but with a shield of course. Once you hit 40 and can get shield slam, that's the earliest I would consider going prot to be a better tank.
---
Oh dam yes I remember rift! Fuck whatever happened to it?
---
So true! Its a Titan in itself, this game.
---
It's the best item available to level 19 Rogue twinks.
---
Just stop talking if you have zero idea what you're speaking about.
---
If you don't know the significanc of anything in question, why do you feel the need to contribute to the discussion?
---
This particular item is notorious AF for getting ninja'd due to how incredibly valuable it is, especially for a character at the level bracket to see it drop.
---
Having this item **guarantees** that character can afford all training + their mount at 40 without requiring any supplemental income or grinding.
---
It is *that* valuable.
---
I've bitten off more than I can chew...
---
this comment saved me from making a seething comment of my own, thank
---
BG's aren't live until phase 3 I heard.
---
Bgs don't get released till phase 2 and even then only WSG and AV
---
&gt; I.e. less people buy potions in morning than in evening, more people buy potions on wednesdays than on sundays, etc
---
That's literally why OP wants the data he's asking for.
---
You can tank as arms while leveling no problem, just equip a shield and 1H.
---
Remember 6.2 arms though? Lol
---
That's greed level, not need. If you continue rolling need for stuff you just sell and can't use you will get stigma for it.
---
If I wasn't on Herod, I'd probably have my mount by now.
---
I rolled warrior, but I started levelling a druid
---
Happend to me four times. When you are log back in fast enoigh u get your queue position back.
---
That was one of the reasons i switched to a new server with no queue.
---
Basically playing warrior..
---
First time in vanilla and decided to choose warrior.. and kept thinking how hard classic was.. But seems like warrior is just hardcore for lvling.. fuck me right?
---
AbraCadaver: An undead mage.
---
I'm sorry to say you are wrong, I assume that is what people are referring to because I am using an ingame lua script to do exactly that, without any external sources needed. I dug really deep to find it and didn't find any evidence that it is against ToS. 
---
It works and I've tested it myself. When I use it, I would log onto my computer about 3 hours before heading home from work, and I use the macro on my way home incase I get into the game so it doesn't boot me within that brief period.
---
This deserves some gold.
---
&gt; Just stop talking if you have zero idea what you're speaking about.
---
This really seems to apply to yourself in the first place, and yet you're not doing that.
---
There is a vast difference between something forbidden by the TOS and something some Wikia says think was fixed once by a GM; and there's also a vast difference between said situation described and the the situation described by OP here.
---
&gt;Having this item guarantees that character can afford all training + their mount at 40 without requiring any supplemental income or grinding.
---
Not on an opening server. You just verified that you are, in fact, talking when you have zero idea what you're talking about.
---
He had me too, this was definitely a risky post, good job!
---
I was never a hunter before, so didn't know that, however I know from streams that your pet can draw aggro quite hard so wondered about that
---
Im EU so not sure about US, but my server is Medium population and while i had a queue 2 days ago (20mins) yesterday i could get in right away on Dreadmist.
---
Its ok luv i just bought game time
---
I have run into this myself. I notice the type of people who play this way generally dont wanna listen or give you the time of day. Which sucks cause i really dont like kicking people in a group...but sometimes....
---
Warcraft 1 was actually originally meant to be a Warhammer game, not DnD...
---
Oily blackmouth will be high in demand for the rest of the game's natural life because they're used to make Free Action Potions.
---
Stock them up, send to a bank char if you don't have the bank space and wait until they go for 10-20g/s
---
a DPS build is probably your best shot, frost mages were great at PVP back then, and had a good demand as raid dps, you can manage the same build for both.  
---
healers can also work. Restro druids and holy palas were the best pvp healers back then, but healing in pvp is a thankless job, and is not for everyone.
---
Oh alright. I've only ever had dogs, and I felt anxious just looking at the picture.
---
I'd rather read through hundreds of posts like these than piles of boring memes!
---
I had the same issues, found a different ui which is really close to elvis which has everything working, glad I made the switch in the end.
---
If we make an char on a server before population fills up, will we have to queue as much? Or how does that work? I don't know how it works. Can someone fill me in?
---
Could you link where you found the discord? I‚Äôd like to join as well
---
At its heart, a running simulator.
---
&gt; Can you read or are you just new to the game?
---
Alright, two comments I'm seeing of you where you're not only flatout wrong but rude on top of that, so I'm not going to entertain a troll. Have fun flaming people on reddit my dude, I'll be farming stuff.

How dare you! *Stares through cold blue eyes*.
---
I do think they are keeping it longer than intended but the intent was to get rid of it in the first few weeks, so they may end up keeping it up to the beginning of phase 2.
---
Which sucks imo, but hopefully they begin collapsing layers in a week or two.
---
Lol that was me asking all the time what the server was getting all my hardcore wow friends to switch. So thank you if you answered my question in chat!! Ended up recruiting a solid 8 of my friends over who all are the best types you want on your server
---
Of course you should seek help. These harpies destroyed me yesterday
---
Frost mage here. Someone buffs me I buff the shit out of them back. XoXoXo
---
I also put thorns on hunters pet as well.
---
Heard it helps them handle mobs much faster and keep the threat of the pet high.
---
Whats in a name?
---
&gt;	If they now simply add another 3layers to the server then there would be twice as many people there
---
What if the locked the server, so no new people can create characters there, say after this weekend? People have had some great opportunities to choose which server they want to play on, and for now, most people just want to play. 
---
Lock the servers for now, and increase layering. Idk
---
So happy I switched servers lol. QOL &gt; 20k queue.
---
1:15:50 wait? what? does he mean better TPS on some bosses or in general?
---
You can either have a slave job and predictable routine-based life OR you can go out there and do something that really matters.
---
No idea :(  If it helps, I'm on Verizon, East Coast, Northern Virginia area.  I typically don't run any programs in the background but Discord (and I've tried playing without that, no help).  I'm on a pretty old laptop, but it plays the game fine when it's not having problems.
---
Off topic but... This, I've been tanking dungeons non stop, as usual there are never enough tanks, everyone is trying to pull and be a hero, no body waits for threat, no one tries to CC a mob off to the side, and for the love of God the groups apparently have no clue about LoS or healer threat.  So I spend all my time running around on taunt CD because threat splits 4 different ways die to jackasses ignoring the rules.
---
You're right, it seems that it can't be used in dungeons. My bad.
---

If you think I could be fucked tabbing out to post to reddit via pc rather than the phone already in my hand you crazy üòù
---
Warrior dps is amazing, but to gear your way there can be terrible
---
Still got like a 4 hour queue on Mograine unfortunately. Back at work again now so my char is stuck there. Got a level 8 started up on Ten Storms atm but it's frustrating having to start again.
---
That is orange tang
---
Do you automatically have the IF flight path from there? I remember in vanilla I walked from Wetlands all the way to IF as a night elf...
---
bonds
---
But aren't you now also talking to 22/25K people in city chat instead of just 1-2K? It seems like it should be just as easy to spread the notoriety to the larger group of people.
---
Wtf did you do to your ui
---
So many peopwe saying wegwowd is too expensive... I wondew if dey evew actuawwy wevewed a dwuid beyond wevew 10?

In addition, de wowew up-fwont heaw means dat yuw can dwow it on de tank eawwiew wadew dan watew, instead of waiting untiw de wast possibwe second to be efficient wif heawing touch. wegwowd is wegit one of de best pawts of a cwass dat has no showtage of amazing shit. uwu  
---
 tag me to uwuize comments uwu
---
8-10k queues already at 12pm, wow.
---
One of the most impactful cutscenes for me growing up. The moment it happened, I knew I was going to love this story. Always felt kind of cheap to end it via wow instead of another Warcraft game but whatevs..
---
People are already making and preparing thinks
---
A lot of the things they added to the game took away a lot of things too. All the immersion was stripped a way, the community, the sense of adventure. They made the game less of an mmorpg, and more of a dungeon runner. Maybe that changed since it had been a long time since I had played current wow, but the formula of sitting in town queueing up for dailies became way to static. The thrill of the world was stripped away in favor of convenience.
---
Yeah the last few levels take a long time, but the ones currently in the mentioned level range should hit 60 tomorrow regardless. It's doable but it's gonna be close to kill rag in time. I wouldn't say it's impossible though.
---
Well i just found out warrior is hardcore for lvling.. So im thinking about rolling another class.. Maybe rogue or mage
---
Hi, /u/yeeeeeeaah-nah

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cxfkmm/your_average_cant_decide_on_class_post/). 
---
druids are a great class, yes, you wont top DPS charts, but you can set up your build to be able to dps, tank or heal just fine for most content.
---
They are viable, rank 4 healing touch is the most efficient heal in the game so there‚Äôs that, and they bring lots of utility and such to a group, not to mention as you said you can easily swap some gear around and shift and do another role too which is fun and useful.
---
The one issue with druids for 5mans is the lack of a regular Rez, they only get their brez which is great utility but limiting, usually preferable to have someone else who can Rez in the group
---
I've been playing for a couple days and already I've been buffed by random players more than I have probably during Legion, WoD and MoP combined. I play warrior so I have nothing but I chucked a spirit scroll on a priest.  Feels like a tight community.
---
Yeah but at lvl 17 without aimed shot this isn't a strategy I can move to myself
---
The golden age of MMOs
---
Surely there is and if you cant find a way you should make a ticket.
---
Its tirisfal
---
Nope sticking with Warrior. I always wanted to be a tank in WoW but never committed to it first time round
---
I've leveled both horde and alliance in classic, so maybe i'll try a new race (never played troll before, except occasionally on reddit )
---
Oh,rich guy over here has shoulders it seems.
---
I imagine the oppulance of the one gifting the shoulders so willy nilly.
---
could you all put some more lotions on your hands? my dick is getting raw. don't forget rule #1 of a circlejerk, keep well lubricated!!!
---
i‚Äôm a priest, lvling with a warrior. for the most part deaths have been minimal but sometimes we get unlucky with spawns and end up in a dicey situation where there are one too many mobs and not enough mana for me xD
---
Yeah it is but your one of so many, if you have a bad interaction and try say ‚Äúoh xyz did this bad thing‚Äù chances are nobody will remember. Where as in vanilla with a smaller total player base you would remember the bad names
---
hunters for that true AFK playstyle
---
Forbidden Fanta
---
It's a bis 19 twink dagger, late vanilla it was upwards of 1k. Wrath i remember seeing it for multiple thousands. It's rare AF fam like 0.01% drop rate or something from memory

Last night before I logged off I was able to get into any server I wanted with no queue (230 am EST) 
---
I don't know why that was working out so well, did they update realm capacity again?

It'll get worse tomorrow.

Every day we stray further away from god.

Alliance
---
Early game , roll if it‚Äôs an up.
---
I‚Äôll take agility/str and stam in a cloak, ring etc if I have nothing equipped on my casters.
---
The next time your in a cave you will love the extra hp.
---
Thank God vanilla doesn't have ~~furries~~ worgens as a playable race.
---
this is great content. real high quality submission. an overdone meme. thanks for making this subreddit suck OP
---
What the fuck? I thought this was Zach Galifinakis anytime I saw this
---
I know your life, stranger. But, the three day weekend she comes.
---
I played on misha for years. I transferred to zuljin in mop (3rd highest server count for horde at the time). 
---
I'll never play on a dead server again.
---
Aye.
---
And Spirit for downtime reduction, particularly if you‚Äôre a Troll. Their regen racial works really great with some stacked spirit levelling gear.
---
+attack power gear is also very useful. The Devilsaur set for example is the BiS pre-MC gear you‚Äôll be aiming for.
---
In general though, Stack as much agility as possible, even if you‚Äôre mixing mail with leather (there‚Äôs no bonus in classic for being all of one type anyway). Then ain‚Äôt is a nice bonus.
---
Then if you‚Äôre on a pvp server you‚Äôll want stamina.
---
Tirisfal*

Good riddance!

Netflix and grind the Pally livlig story.

Nice trolling. This thread lit up

Long treks for stupid stuff very relatable

It shows how many items are currently listen and the high/low + average they sell for I think
---
You brave soul , took engineering early. How do you fund this fabulous look?
---
Ah, I know what you are referring to. Hooking the PLAYER_CAMP event. Yes, I am familiar but have not tried it myself. Fair point. 
---
However, the discussion is clearly regarding antiafk ‚Äúmacros‚Äù that preform client inputs a la AHK, synapse, etc
---
For some reason people is giving me things cheaper or free for beeing nice, disgusting...

This is what hit me as I was backtracking across stonetalon for the third time after running all the way to desolate flight path so I can get to maraudon quicker in a week: they are just selling time.

I do understand that, it's just that my pally will be played with 2 friends so i want an alt to play when they cant play, but the Hordie would never get priority, the pally will get all the effort

Yea actually rogue is harder than warrior

"Get a hammer or any heavy blunt instrument of suitable size available.
---
Lie on the side with the chosen leg to be broken upwards. If that choice is given to you, choose the side of your dominant hand i.e. right side up for right handers.
---
Feel the bony prominence on the outer part of your ankle. This is the lower end of the fibula. Break it here and your ankle becomes unstable. So choose a point in line with the prominence around 15 cams above it, at least 10 cms. Going too much further up can injure the common peroneal  nerve and cause a 'foot drop'.
---
Lift the 'hammer' and take it all the way back as your shoulder allows you to.

Take a deep breath. Do not hold it. Holding breath for too long can knock you out.

Not the technical answer we deserved, but one that we needed
---
Excellent!
---
Loving your UI set up too! Looks ace!
---
You can do Tunnel Rat ears, and "In Defense of the Kings Lands" then some westfall.  Then come back to the Loch for the higher level stuff over at Ironbrand's Excavation.  
---
Thats what I did at least, worked pretty good.
---
At first I did not even understand what this is about. Thought this was regarding the colors in the game..
---
After the second time watching I finally noticed, haha!
---
Might be just focused too much on the game itself ..
---
100% the moms name is Karen. Look at that hair
---
Get serious about wrist and hand health, like exercises and ergonomics. You can stave some of that off. Seek medical help if you can.
---
Yea I guess shaman is a different enough playstyle. You could also try druid, their jack of all trades nature lets you pop around and fill what‚Äôs needed.
---
it also sounds like a stereotypically Jewish name, and given the way people hate on the Jews for dominating the banking industry it's not a stretch for some touchy person to imagine it's meant to be an anti-semitic joke :\ in this day and age i could easily see someone reporting this
---
... i also read it as "banken-steen" rather than "banken-stine" so that pun soared miles over my dumb head haha
---
Send in the goats!
---
Memory plays tricks. Blizzard are using the actual source code of the original game. Private servers had to make that from scratch and guess for a lot of the values based on nothing but research. The code isnt wrong, your memory is.
---
It doesn't always. At certain levels smite is the better opener.

It‚Äôs true man. I log in to play classic and then feel the pressure to log out and play retail in order to stay relevant. Then when I‚Äôm in retail I know there‚Äôs so much to do in classic I feel obligated to log out and play classic lol. Then I just end up logging off

How do you properly use thunderclap? You lose rage when you switch stance, I've tries some things but it doesn't seem to work well for me

This actually is very motivating. Thanks alot.

I love buffing people - and pets/minions get a fort too!
---
It's the same stuff that has gotten to you 15 years ago and made you into the person you are today. Depending on the state of your current real life situation I would- or wouldn't worry about it.

This looks like something gaming circle jerk would write

Did you learn nothing from dealing with the infinite dragonflight?

yeah.

wait, why isn't it alt friendly?

Who controls the past, controls the present. Who controls the present, controls the future.
---
Loch modan is quite small area for lvl 10-15 (its only the left side!!). I would reccomend doing loch till your sick of it and then go westfall.
---
Thanks. I was horde in vanilla and didn't know that.
---
Not ideal for raids though if you had a guild to support it you could probably make it work, but druids are fine for tanking 5 mans, debatably even better than warriors.
---
In my group I‚Äôve been the dedicated tank on Druid ~~though I‚Äôd rather play dps or healer tbh~~ because we‚Äôve found that I‚Äôm just the stronger tank than our warrior really, and we‚Äôve been leveling almost exclusively through dungeons
---
The hard part is aoe threat, swipe only hits 3 targets and does pretty pitiful damage honestly, and with a mage and lock we sometimes do big pulls. Otherwise, had no issue with anything really. Can do ranged pills yourself, some self or off heals to help out your healer, and some good damage, I can sometimes top the chart single target while tanking

It's a video enhancing minigame, you just watch Netflix on your second monitor while you fish, also with lures it's about every 15 seconds

One of my favorite things in WoW used to be 19 twinking.  Had a Hunter and Rogue who were both awesome, but my favorite thing was my Warrior, specifically for killing Hunters.  When they made hamstring a lvl ~30 skill... so sad. :(

---
The goblins. Fuck those guys.
---
Yeah, yeah. I know I played then as well. I just don't like this bullshit image people are spreading on-line of it being a magical friendly place. It's still an on-line game. People are still people. 
---
That doesn't mean I haven't enjoyed throwing MotW on anyone who wanders past me.
---
I'm looking forward fishing for Deviat fish instead of leveling
---
I don't think it makes a difference when you make the character but correct me if I'm wrong
---
I just did the same with low level potions.. a stack was selling for 75c might as well give em away
---
I think you're right actually. I guess I can make do with the average price of all prices for an item, and trade when the standard deviation is large enough.
---
RemindMe! 24 hours
---
My understanding is that you need the pro edition to disable updates entirely, and a lot of people are running unlicensed versions of 10 since it's basically a free to play service that makes money off your telemetry.
---
Fuck yeah! Let me guess, layer hopping to the rescue?
---
It is hard when all your friends are playing on a high pop server and won't switch.
---
Have a classic summer
---
Can you elaborate on this? Like what is layer lag? How is it related to ping?
---
What level was your warrior when you decided to reroll?
---
Disc isn't a thing in classic.  Both because you are less effective and because you rage starve your tanks by playing it (or are less effective in healing for no reason).
---
Leveling one now and it is very painful to solo any mobs you don't outlevel even with dungeon gear as even with spirit tap you've gotta drink or wait after every 3 mobs or so just from needing to heal yourself after a fight.
---
You know what...
---
Fuck you for putting that sound in my head.
---
Ahh gawd, get it out!
---
A separate card. A lot of em were onboard. I had an emachines P.C. that had graphics on cpu. I upgraded later in 2009 with an ati 2400pro. That lasted about till 2011 when I had to update because sindragosa in ICC mythic was painful at 8fps. I managed to get behind every ice block surprisingly
---
Warrior is killing my hype. 
---
The leveling is killing me and I cant tank dungeons with retail-minded dps's. 
---
But, any other class isn't so appealing. Im very down right now

take the lvl 20 quest from the troll, do that quest, the mobs are quite high level but you should be able to easily find help, they seem high level but ambush does bonus damage to them
---
I'm the same way (started early BC) and can agree with him. BC was basically vanilla with 10 more levels and flying. The death of vanilla didn't happen until Cata, with the final remnants (talent trees) leaving with MoP.
---
So far, playing Classic is the closest I've come to playing that old game I truly loved.
---
He has been around since day one too, surprised he has made it to lvl 20. He should be allowed to stay now.
---
Method fanboy right there. Please go back to your doritos and Esfand stream, thank you.
---
You need to clear both zones Westfall and Loch Modan for proper and comfortable leveling. I would highly recommend you to level in Dun Morogh and Elwynn Forest before you hit at the very least 12-13. Im finishing Dun Morogh right now and about to hit level 15 before entering Loch Modan and Westfall. But thats a little overkill, you dont need to
---
what realm are you on. Blemaux here... or however tf you spell it
---
I got an ergonomic mouse. It just idk I got long fingers and no one makes a mouse that fits and is also ergonomic.
---
It is a struggle lol
---
Can you get banned for doing this?
---
What aren't you enjoying?  Have you focused on a talent tree yet or just dabbing around?  Certain trees need different playstyles.
---
Once doing this, got "wow, I'm a gnome, I can't jump that high"
---
Not to say that content requiring a lot of time investment doesn't exist in retail, but tbf it's a bit ridiculous to compare the literal endgame of the highest difficulty to a full clear level 55-60 set of dungeons.
---
Yeah sorry about that OP. We‚Äôre had been planning an epic cyber session and needed a troll with zerking to complete our group. We thought spanish-walling you would be the least awkward way to brush you off without killing our horny.
---
Alrighty :D Well a ton of people on pvp servers will play pve only xD so its basically the same thing
---
Why would it do that all of a sudden? Doesn't make sense. Been playing without problems since launch.
---
as a warrior yesterday I was killing boars when a priest came over grouped with me and we just didnt stop. talked a bit about the old days when we first started and now I have a new friend.
---
The really weird thing is, now that it‚Äôs going to take me 10 minutes to walk across Elwynn Forest, I‚Äôm enjoying the place *way* more. I‚Äôm taking my time, exploring and looking for herbs, killing some wolves for cooking ingredients, organizing my inventory, talking in chat, looking through my quests to make sure I‚Äôm not missing anything nearby. I‚Äôm making bandages and potions to give my warrior some healing ability. I‚Äôm actually paying attention to what‚Äôs around me so I don‚Äôt pull an extra mob. For all the ‚Äúconvenience‚Äù they added to the game over the years, they made it so much more stressful. Just sprinting from quest to quest is not fun at all.
---
I‚Äôm going to be a zombie tomorrow meeting my friends parents but hey, I got two drops from BFF and hit 25!

Was doing dead mines run as a mage and the warrior and rogue asked why I don't just aoe down the 5 elites he's pulling at a time, mind you I'm pulling agro with a wand. Oh the best part is I'm apparently pulling agro because I'm not twitching by strafing left right left, I couldn't tell if they were trolling
---
When they do i'll leave
---
Cowfolk
---
I was having the same thing because I was downloading retail
---
That‚Äôs good to hear! It‚Äôs just I never see any allience when I want some action!
---
Im not sure but my country have 4best streamers on golemag so all Czech players are mostly there (Im in that streamer guild with 1000 members) so we cant go anywhere else if we want to play together and speak Czech ingame .. so I do not think that golemag will be better soon..  if something like that is on your server with other communities .. 
---
But after those top players hit 60 hype will be gone and servers will be empty again .. I think it will be about 14 days .. but no patch before christmas so u have tons of time ..

Try to enjoy not being able to find the answer right away, and exploring for it. It's the spirit of classic.
---
I feel you
---
&gt;stuff like this is why classic is amazing
---
But you need 40x of 60s. That‚Äôs the problem. 
---
Few people in their 57-58‚Äôs is nothing unless everyone else can be 60. 
---
Unless of course they will start the clears at 58...but that‚Äôs a lot of gimping...healers will be pressure to the max.
---
You don't need to stance dance. I was arms stance when soloing and prot in dungeons and it was all piss easy. Arms was alone also pretty good in pvp = topping charts on regular basis. Just because some meta play exists, doesn't mean it's needed at all.
---
On the page I linked, it says: "Improved Ghost Wolf will reduce the cast time of your Ghost Wolf by 1 or 2 seconds. Fully talented, this will make your Ghost Wolf spell instant cast."
---
But maybe that information is wrong.
---
The tags make it easier for hunters to shoot them all.
---
Are you on the manKirk server?
---
I saw that but I don‚Äôt see the scan function to start collecting market data.
---
Yeah. I made it to the gym yesterday, can't quite tell if the pain in my arms is from gym or RSI from the game though...
---
You know.... that would be a cool little story if they wanted to continue classic wow so they dont have to release the exp and make a new story but with the classic gameplay.
---
Exactly, and Molten Core is called RG for Ragnaros
---
Way down tinker town
---
ask people where the zep is
---
Its a meeting stone, cant summon with it, need a warlock to summon. Dont worry I did the same thing.
---
I mean... As a warrior I feel like the guy who's always bumming cigarettes off people.   
---
I offer you.....  
---
Random bandages!
---
Put a treadmill in front of the computer =D
---
Take your fist, shove it way up your ass, and literally fuck yourself.
---
You never know, we may get classic+ servers. 
---
I‚Äôm hoping we do and they can keep the no changes servers but let us copy our characters over to classic+, so people can play both classic and classic+.
---
Also for their short legs.
---
A girl has no name
---
your best bet is sm/ruin warlock, you do a couple % less dps then a full pve specced warlock but the trade off is that its good for all content without respecing.
---
No one else gonna comment on his character name Bigoledoink?
---
Anything else you can think of that I could look for tomorrow?

If you want scrolling text telling you incoming/outgoing heals/damage mikscrollingbattletext addon is working for classic.
---
I just tanked Deadmines as a Paladin last night with absolutely no problems. It does require the group to pay attention to wait for Consecrate and kill prio targets, and that's about it. Easy and smooth.
---
Honestly people will still come to you.
---
Yes and make her a Gnome with pink hair
---
Yeah it has a spell power component as well but in general you want the slowest highest damage weapon you can find preferably with a proc on it as the SoC attack can also proc it
---
There's a few weapons that give extra attacks on proc and those are the best dps weapons for pally
---
Diclofenac mate, it's amazing
---
Log on with Teamviewer 2-4 hrs before your trying to play (like at work), by the time que is up your home. No que before 2 or 3pm est on incendius
---
Lol. I'm an avid fishermen. This weekend will not be spent fishing in real life lol
---
"Enjoy" and "your"
---
One can argue Human is overall superior to Dwarf.
---
Mace and sword specialization is arguably a huge advantage and human spirit is great for lvling.
---
Dwarfs gun specialization has 0 value for Paladins and Stoneform is not as valuable for Paladins as it is, for example, for rogues.
---
Imagine having an OS with bloatware/adware preinstalled like the Xbox app that you can't just uninstall. Or not being able to set custom shortcuts, or change the desktop environment or login screen or swap out the file manager, or window manager..
---
Windows is fine for most people but let's not pretend it gives you as much control over your system as an open source solution like Linux.
---
I have a highly customized DE that's stripped away most of the UI elements and menus, and window decorations, where I access everything through custom keybinds that run a script to bring the application into focus if it's already open so I don't have to use a clunky and unorganized alt+tab to shuffle through a randomized list. I've got it running at 700mb of RAM idle, which could be lower but I have to admit I like a few bells and whistles like window transparency, wobbly windows, and having conky system monitor embedded in my desktop.
---
The power levelers (single and multiple players) are sad... its not an achievement, its just wierd.  Who gives a shit?
---
Peak hours and "full" on my realm? 126ppl in queue, 5 min wait.. thank fuck!
---
Yeah but this is only for the partymembers to summon other partymembers. there is no automated LFG system.
---
What if they released a ‚Äúskip the queue‚Äù MTX..
---
&lt;Midlife Crisis&gt; seems fitting for a lot of us at the moment lol
---
I hear garrosh comes back as well as other dead guys like arthas when the void, death god is revealed.
---
omg I forgot about that term until now
---
I bought a 2h with a proc for my hunter twink for fun once, was funny seeing everyone flip out about it. Totally worth losing 30 agi.

We're having a sale on Super Peon Vitality right now...
---
That 1O str is deadly
---
manlets, when will they learn?
---
That is amazing. How did you find out that the duration was 5 minutes?
---
Just turn on your auto hotkey script like everyone else in the inns.  Just when you're done for the day log out.
---
Why, these people at least play the game when they get through the queue. Why does it matter where you are when you queue? The people with scripts who don't log out are the real issue (right after obviously blizzard who should've added more capacity)
---
Thanks! And I just download and extract into the addons folder? Been a decade since I‚Äôve installed addons manually lol
---
Penguins of classic wow unite!
---
Layering is applied right now because so many people are in the same areas (low level questing). 
---
Once Classic has been out for a while, layering will be removed as most people will be spread around the map more evenly. 
---
Layering doesn't have anything to do with queues.
---
If you have faction loyalty or a fantasy/aesthetic preference I'd stick with the same side but it was over ten years ago so unless you've played private servers, it's going to be pretty fresh either way. It's also worth mentioning that it's not going to feel exactly the same anyway because you're older and the Internet/community is different.
---
The more I play Classic, the more I want 1.13...
---
The spirit of Classic WoW is beautiful and worth preserving. Instead of releasing the expansion packs that pretty much cancel the entire previous endgame, why not build upon it instead? Keep the progression as it is, just add more options and a more difficult continuation.
---
And for the love of God, don‚Äôt add the flying mounts. Ever.
---
Jesus christ and it's frakkin prime time in eu, looking forward to the queue if this ever gets resolved.
---
They're the same company. You know that, right? It's not one company that owns the other and is forcing an evil agenda down over the good and innocent one. There is no Blizzard and there is no Activision. There is only Activision Blizzard Inc.
---
Too real!
---
No, we don't get salty, we mostly sigh about what SC2 could have been should SC1 was a 40k game. Because, sure WC has a great lore and a great story, but, I mean, comeon, how can you beat the Horus Heresy?
---
If your "friends" have a bunch of their "friends" that can't get in to the game and they won't switch then that's on them.
---
All hail the bagman. The one true bagman.
---
This won‚Äôt work because it‚Äôs built for the vanilla client not the classic client. 
---
OP check out nugrunning on curseforge. Make sure you download the version for 1.13
---
Honestly I just looked up what realm had the least amount of streamers since I didn't want the /1 /2 chat to become a Twitch chat.
---
That's my suggestion.
---
# F
---
The strange thing is that i can't access any website by Blizzard. It's like i'm blocked or something?
---
Its sucks cause all your no life friends have been logged in since server reset and you just want to play after work.
---
Couldn't agree more, plus it makes the game playable in early zones as I think the hype is only going to grow.
---
Well you're there to heal them. A warrior solo is corpse run central haha.
---
The amount of proffession training and gold farming they can do will give them a massive head start.
---
Great looking UI.
---
This macro for the Hunter's Mark,
---
/targetenemy [noexists][dead][help]
---
/cast Hunter‚Äôs Mark
---
It does not seem to work? Is there change it needs or can you not acquire a target and Hunter's Mark it?
---
Get Chrome Remote Desktop app. Sign in queue at work from your phone.
---
Yup! You might also need the OmniCC add-on to get the countdown on the debuffs to display properly.

Garrosh with time-travel hax doesn't count!
---
There is a chained quest in desolace that requires fighting Nagas under water, the water breathing buff would come in handy!

Do you need to reg mana often? Just curious because im not smiting and have sometimes mana problems?

i use [lightshot](https://app.prntscr.com/en/index.html) for quick snap of a specific area of my screen

---
If that's actually true, it's horrible design. Even if it's largely irrelevant, it basically incentivizes/rewards people for having character names beginning with A.
---
# YOU IGNORAMUS
---
You can only tame beasts your level or below. If that's the case, you just cast "Tame Beast", a 20 second, channeled ability. Once it's complete, the pet is yours.
---
I think it made up for people resubscribing
---
I love how Druids and Priests can hot, dot, and buff just as they walk past
---
Layering is the only reason stopping blizzard from multiplying the number of layers by 10x and letting everyone in. They are afraid for when the layers are removed, the server won't be healthy
---
Are you the guy that was standing in Crossroads on Stalagg calling himself Oprah yesterday?
---
Join a guild to help with the corpse camping as you level, will make it easier to respond and fight back.
---
Roll an alt when you get stuck/camped on one character. 
---
I do a lot of my bank/AH stuff too on my bank alt when I'm stuck like that.
---
Can you explain what a bis 19 twink dagger means?
---
Good work dude
---
I have been feeding them to my pet. Oh my god what have I done
---
The original models are darker/ more gothic like and better if you ask me
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking. So easy to overpull in that place.
---
Still no excuse for licking out people who haven‚Äôt done it before. That priest was an a hole.
---
This is the most classic wow situation that‚Äôs been posted on reddit to date. Nothing says old wow like a hunter not only ninja looting but then also equipping it because ‚Äúall loot is hunter loot‚Äù.
---
blizzard is probabling gaging how much harder they can make the next expansion, if they see so many people not minding Classic grind type and RPG. We could get a really interesting expansion that goes back to Classic roots.
---
Trivago.
---
Its exactly as I remember it and everything I wanted.
---
Rogue benefits from the Agility, and the intellect kinda helps, because he will skill up weapons just a tad faster. The Intellect gives you mana. You both recieve minor armor/dodge from the Agility. I'd say it's both to roll for it.
---
I also want them to "continue" with classic adding content just like osrs, but only if they change specs, because spamming 1 spell for 5 years is going to get tiring
---
Undead have priest, so you can travel to him and quest in his zone.  
---
Just quest on your own for a bit, by the time you reach level8-10 you should head straight to Org (its at the very top of the map) and outside of the city is a Zeppelin tower.  Talk to the goblins up there and they will let you know which zeppelin goes where.  Wait for the zeppelin that goes to undercity.  Your friend can meet you there.
---
Honestly I cringed as much at you replying.
---
Funnily enough, that's what I was doing since start.
---
If you can benefit from AI &gt; you're getting it.
---
If it's not too crowded even cast it on melee classes (gotta skill up faster yo).
---
If you're passing by me &gt; HEYO AI BUFF++
---
Keep being awesome. Don't make me shed tears of joy again here now :p
---
Cause megatron knows he could own starscreams add wherever he feels like throwing down lol
---
Wand is just first 5 points in disc, not whole tree
---
Oh cool, that's good to know, but is there a UI mod close to what I'm looking for available or no? Just because I didn't see one when I looked but other people would likely know better than me
---
You didn‚Äôt elaborate at all?  
---
Where is this lack of infrastructure you speak of? We have a resource-based economy so we don‚Äôt exactly need to import..
---
Though you can't do scatter shot + freezing trap at lvl 60 so that will be rough :/
---
Used this last night and showed my buddy. Appreciate the help!
---
That's pretty short sighted, Shamans dont have lay on hands, bubble, blessing of protection, divine intervention...
---
Lol, someone downvoted you but it truly is the fix. A good blue 2h, close to your level, is the single most effective contribution to a warrior's success. The class is an extension of their weapon.
---
omg is this a real wow screenshot
---
There are actual ghosts in the ruins of lordaeron above undercity,  in the courtyard, presumably ghosts of the humans inhabiting the city long ago. you can see them with potions or as warlock with Detect Invisibility. If you don't have a way to see them you can trigger them with aoe abilities like arcane explosion. you'll enter combat but you can't see who's attacking you. They'll eventually kill you.
---
You can also read the plaque on King Terenas Menethil II's tomb in the room that splits leading to the elevators
---
While I appreciate the post, I have run into at least two truly toxic people who whispered me some of this kind of stuff. Literally, priest telling me to uninstall and I'm the worst b/c I can't thank and hold aggro of 5 enemies in WC as a 17 fury warrior.  Mind you we didn't die much and we're progressing, but I was just spammed with "go back to retail" and "uninstall." I hearthed half way thru, got more hate, reported, found a new group, and they were like everyone else playing, courteous and nice. And we fucking face rolled it.
---

The party boxes are great as a resto shammy as I have clique set up for 1 click heal casting.
---
Well why not. Players prefer to do things easier than they have to be. If they had a better geared tank ready it is no wonder they replaced you.
---
I've been getting that for scripts I've found too. Wasn't smart enough to use macros back in the day, so I figured they were written for private servers.

---
Interresting, we must delve deeper, I have not heard of beings with such low intellect that could still communicate through typed letters.
---
grind a dungeon my guy
---
I mean it‚Äôs pretty obviously a caster ring. 6int is the main stat. That‚Äôs more stats than any other piece I have, should definitely go to a caster first.
---
For cooldowns im pretty sure those are actually in the game.  Interface options, i think its the same page as auto loot, near the bottom it will say ‚Äúshow numbers on cooldown‚Äù. If its not, you can ise OmniCC
---
I had a post before classic came out. Was when my monitor came in.
---
Everything in classic is Situational and if you are not an undead you need the underwater buff for some quests because of the downtine between mobs and the respawn/ amount of mobs.
---
Wow that‚Äôs news to me. I never did leatherworking in retail so I didn‚Äôt know that about being able to do mail. Thanks so much!
---
If less people did this and take slots from actual players the queues would be better.
---
Was dead set on Paladin for launch. Got to 14. Decided to make a Druid to level with my gf (she chose night elf hunter) and have enjoyed the Druid a whole lot more. Druids are known to not be great at anything but good at a lot of things. I don‚Äôt really care about the stereo types, druids are a ton of fun. And with a pocket hunter even more fun haha. 
---
Just hit 15 with the Druid last night so being around the same level as the paladin I can say it‚Äôs clearly my choice going forward. (Druid). 
---
Good luck on your class choice haha
---
It's between Hunter and Mage. I actually got a Mage to 25 but decided to switch off a Full PvP server (getting camped + 10k queues are not for me anymore). 
---
The issue for me is only whether I can really do another 1-25 as a Mage but I really do like the class. On the other hand i always wanted to lvl up a hunter and im doing Horde to switch it up so it will be a bit different anyway. I know hunters are best levellers, they are good in PvP and I am good enough that I will find a spot in raids no matter my class.
---
It just comes down to whether I want a different experience. I am open to all anecodtes, advice, etc. What professions are best for hunters? Hunter race for Horde? Thx!
---
Forgot about the prof buffs! Thanks!
---
300k in bfa is like 300g in cata economy
---
Source: was rich in cata and am now poor :(
---
That's a tall order.
---
except they didn't have one ready. they spammed for like 30 more minutes in chat.
---
It still does lol and the health bars look weird, plus I don‚Äôt even have to look at my skills I memorize my rotation and abilities to the point where I just know what button I have to hit haha but I get it, just not my cup of tea
---
If you're not taming The Rake at level 10 you're doing it wrong.

#nochangesforfree
---
First time poster, 
---
I've been an altoholic since Wrath. I started playing the very end of Vanilla, deployments had me miss most of TBC. 
---
I've always "mained" a tank class. But endgame, I enjoy PvP and pve. 
---
I feel like it I stay in the same mindset, be able to tank, then I'll get to 60 and switch to a different tank.
---
I play horde. I'm torn between warrior and shaman, with druid coming in at a distant 3rd... I'm lost. Falling further behind with the guild and leveling... Thoughts on endgame PvP and pve would be appreciated!!
---
-Viz
---
Thanks for this. The one on wowhead doesn't update regular enough and it's cool to see a trend
---
I feel her.  My classic name is pretty popular and I missed my reservation. Rerolled another server due to queues and lost it again.
---
Did she compromise on something similar?
---
This kind of behavior is what makes classic great.
---
Your interaction with others through game is what makes a difference, and often improves ones view of the game.
---
It's the little things!
---
Why are you laughing?  
---
Yes (smug)                                             Yes  
---
Maybe later
---
Maybe just go outside or hit the gym I dunno. Rushing to 60 is the best way to burn yourself out and quit the game in a month time. Vanilla doesn't have that much content when you hit 60 besides the few raids and pvp
---
If you want xpearl, Google xpearl vanilla or something, if you can't find it in twitch app
---
I think it can get more fun with a reckoning build, but it's autoattacks all the way to 60.
---
Can‚Äôt beat em? Join em.
---
This this instead.  (script commands are very limited in what they can do)

/stopcasting  
---
/cast Shoot
---
The solution is to use sick time after vacation is exhausted.
---
Nah, last time I checked they bitched about the classic community bitching about the unplayable launch (10k+ queues) like the retail crowd had never bitched about an unplayable launch before
---
With the new macro system, can't you just write:
---
/Stopcasting
---
/Cast shoot
---
Or am I being an idiot now? :D
---
Perfect thx!
---
I have my buffs on mouse overs so I can just mouse over people as they run by without having to target them. 
---
I'm also a paladin so the buffs are generally gone by the time they get to their next quest.
---
Do you want the Keepers of Time? Beause that‚Äôs how you get the Keepers of time.
---
As a brit I never can wrap my head around how Americans say the phrase or similar phrases. It should be said with couldn't not could..
---
How do you get to the other continent? I keep hearing there's no dock or zep, but haven't really checked.
---
Oh I know. I have never used a unit frame they all look too utilitarian and amateurish.
---
Yeah, too bad lots of adults are stupid too
---
I'm doing it as long and often as I can, but I'll likely have to stop tomorrow, which is also when, I suspect, these queues will increase.
---
Yup!
---
make sure you /bow to any horde you pass to show them you respect them, they will not kill you after this
---
Yeah, they have other things.
---
Makes me a little emotional tbh
---
Level 11 takes a few hours, you could have passed this on a new realm in the time you‚Äôve been in queue. 
---
Unless you have a guild or group of friends keeping you, you should just bite the bullet now.
---
Shaman or paladin fill that role perfectly, much of the old party setups would have one along as a DPS and then you would switch to healing for short bursts when things get hairy. Typical setup would be druid/warrior tank, holy priest, mage, hunters paladin!
---
I got through the first paragraph then decided to stop wasting my time on this grump nerd.
---
nothing about hong kong? or did reddit delete that part ?
---
I've seen more hateful, inappropriate names in Classic than I've seen in retail in a long, long, looooong time.
---
This is how they ruined wow retail, let's leave it be.
---
its so beautiful
---
it is right but look at the hour it updated
---
Yup^
---
For real. Replying to someone obviously trolling is always pretty cringe
---
I wouldn't bother with it unless you plan on tanking, it is super mana inefficienct for the damage it does. The time spent drinking will probably outweigh the time it saves you killing.
---
well, there are 2 medium servers left, ill chose out of them. thanks
---
7k on gehennas, been in que sinxe 11.30
---
" **Haven‚Äôt played since WOTLK** "  
---
" never playing retail again "
---
Man you've never played retail. WOTLK is close to vanilla, retail is nothing like it (And as you've stopped playing since WOTLK, I have no idea how you could form an opinion)
---
I'm glad you told us your GF sent you this. Otherwise this post would not have worked at all.
---
If you're consistently with friends dagger build is fine. Might suffer a bit when you solo. But in all honesty it's about what you as a player enjoy doing!
---
They said I thought I did but I didn't. Then I did and turns out I didn't.
---
Will definitely try this. Thanks!
---
I think it's fair to roll there. I wouldve passed if there was str on it as well, since that makes it a "clear" warrior item even though it would be an upgrade for you, but stamina is somewhat equally relevant for everyone on leveling.
---
Vanilla anecdote inc:
---
Kinda reminds me of an old story from vanilla. Early MC raid. Our very first Lucifron kill. I was a mage, an epic necklace dropped with bonus to spell dmg and heal, and I rolled a 100 (no DKP system yet \^\^). The raidleaders then decided that "this is not a mage item, because it has dmg and heal, but you only deal dmg and don't heal, so you don't fully utilize it". I tried to explain to them that I do dmg 100% of the time so I use the effect 100% of the time, and that it is really the opposite because there are items with only heal bonus (but more of that), which are for healers, while these are actually for DPS only. Well, I didn't get the necklace. I then became a raidleader myself not to deal with such stupidity anymore, and after a long while of raiding, the only non-epic item I was using was, of course, a blue necklace :D
---
Underwater breathing? Not in *my* Barrens.
---
I may have been wrong, and was remembering Outland Nagrand. Sorry
---
Layering has everything to do with queues because the number of layers determine the maximum player cap of the server. Not from a technical standpoint but gameplay-wise. Sure you can put 500.000 people in a server is the hardware and connection can't handle it but then you need a shit ton of layers. And they're planing on removing those at some point. And you have to make sure that at that point you won't have 5000 people farming ungoro at the same time...
---
I was doing WC and I ended up having to  fear some mobs because our mage wasn't polymorphing anything even when I asked. This is the big leagues now, friends. Ain't no free loot in this day and age

ONLY LEVEL 23, cause my friends want me to come help them through their zones... SIGH.
---
I‚Äôll get there eventually.
---
Yes but even at 00:55 0 people in queue seems very little no?
---
Can confirm. I toss revives on random corpse's I pass by and sometimes they accept. The ones that don't I assume rage logged.
---
Where were you when I needed bags, begged for bags, had all the linen for bags but couldn't make a bad :(
---
To be fair, I'm playing on a 2013 iMac.
---
Haha nice edit
---
I I said hi to someone, and they said hi back. Scary stuff.
---
Amen
---
Shhh dude come on
---
I tried to go without addons but caved in for bartender and bagnon. Hopefully I can leave it at that
---
if you're getting tinder matches you are too hot to be playing wow (if you're a man anyway)
---
New season of Archer out.
---
I know, but where there 0 people at 00:55 then? Seems very low
---
Wow thats terrible, so far wand crafting has been a blessed business
---
Pure gold
---
I‚Äôm running on a potato from like 2008..
---
11k on gehennas
---
I would keep in mind that many won't keep to that mindset and will be levelling professions at 60 as it does soak up a lot of time while levelling. I'd hoard those mats and sell them for a premium when the market is stable. Lots selling for near junk prices on the auction house right now.
---
What's your position now?
---
Nobody has gold/silver now, the class trainers took it all!
---
Can confirm. RIP Halo 3 Mountain Dew and all the books that were on shelves below said can of Halo 3 Mountain Dew
---
God this one stings
---
It's not my fault I have a regular 9-5 human job now wtf it's not fair!!!
---
I've been saying Retail feels like you're playing the game with cheat codes active. It's fun for a few hours but then you get bored because it's too easy.
---
&gt;Levelling as a warrior is tough as fuck
---
Can I ask why? I play a Warrior and nothing else so I don‚Äôt know the difference
---
XD
---
So true!
---
I do know that. It's not hard to get a new toon to 11.
---
I haven't been waiting in queue. As soon as I see massive queue on Golemagg, I give up (don't even bother). I'm playing a warrior on Ashbringer (already 18).
---
I just don't want to waste more time now getting a third char to level 11. I will focus on my warrior for now. As soon as they give me the option to bring the shaman, I'll take it.
---
If they don't, I'll get a shaman on the new server once I'm 60 on the warrior.

---
Well there's your problem, Jangalode has kobolds not gnolls.
---
As far as I'm concerned the classic experience is what you personally make of it. If you want every add-on possible go right ahead because that's your enjoyment and time spent, not anybody else's. 
---
My partner and I started with none but have now diwnloaded questie, bagnon and a coordinates add-on. I have around 2 - 3 hours I can allocate per day to play so I'd rather be more accurate with my directions.
---
I think there was a hardware store - weird Al video centered around Gadgetsan
---
I think they say that the bronze dragons clean up crew   does that.
---
Never go to a place that limits your options
---
Adding more layers doesn‚Äôt increase player cap.
---
This happened in Vanilla. We wasn't adults 15 years ago
---
I (NE Druid) went to Westshore at lvl 7 from Darkshore; much prefer the quests in Elwyn etc
---
Endgame makes up for it though - as you get better gear, you stomp faces
---
Communicate. "I'm going to attack and then hide behind the wall to get the casters to come to us. So don't DPS until I have cast demoralising shout.

Priority is skull, X, circle. Polymoph triangle.

Great job Magepants, nice work on the polymorph
---
Stabbingtonbear, wait a little longer before you start DPS so I can get aggro.
---
Favorite gif of all time.
---
I seriously hope they don't release tbc. Resilience and flying spoiled the game for me.

The following is copied from this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/r4edh/eli5_linux/):
---
Linux is a modern version of an old computer control program ("operating system") called "UNIX". UNIX was invented as a simple, easy to use answer to a very complicated operating system called "Multics". About 35 years ago, UNIX started to get very popular because it made computers easier to use compared to the operating systems people had in those days. (Back then, of course, computers were as big as your living room and a lot less powerful than your phone. Hundreds of people might share a single computer to do important work!). UNIX was sold as commercial software, and it cost thousands of dollars to get it.
---
As computers got cheaper and shrank into desktop machines, a lot of people wanted to put UNIX on their own computers, but it was still very expensive to get it. A bunch of people set out to write a UNIX look-alike from scratch. One group actually succeeded -- they called their UNIX "minix". But they still wanted to charge people for it. They just wanted less money than the owners of UNIX did.
---
About 20 years ago, a student named Linus Torvalds wrote a very simple version of UNIX that just barely worked. His roomate joked that it should be called "Linux" because Linus wrote it. Linus gave the code to anyone who asked, but he made anyone who used it agree to share any changes they made. A lot of people started working together to improve it. After a few years, Linux became the most widely available operating system ever written.
---
If you want to speak precisely, "Linux" is really just the very central part of the operating system -- the program that controls how all the other programs in the computer run. If you liked the movie "TRON", Linux is a kind of "Master Control Program" (but not evil like in TRON). You need a lot of other programs, like the "C" compiler that can translate people-readable computer programs into computer-runnable programs, to make Linux work. But a lot of other people just bundle all that stuff together into a big package (like "Ubuntu") and call that Linux.
---
Are you mages going aoe spec or single target to level?

Wild to think they created it by having individual players act out the scene.  Their in-game cinematic team only had the same tools as any machinima creator.

Hi I'm Ray, cousin of Jay.
---
I was doing Miner's Fortune, farming for a cat's eye emerald. It drops from overseers and enforcers. Last night I spent about 40 min farming in the wrong location (the pond with the structure in the middle). When someone told me the right location, I proceeded to farm for another 40min before finally seeing that gem drop. I ran all the way back to turn in, before I realized that my bag was full and I never looted. Its ok though, I hit 20 today so now I have Ghost Wolf. Make those runs a little less painful... And as a wolf.

And thats why my girlfriend is a gnome.

---
Even if that was true, losing the rage a white hit would gain you is an net loss in just about any situation you aren't close to capping rage. Heroic Strike should really be avoided like the plague if you're trying to do anything but damage.
---
Wood Head?
---
It‚Äôs a ‚Äúme‚Äù day for mental health.
---
Yes and no. A LOT of people buy gold in MMOs. And many never get punished. People bought gold in WoW back in the day too. Buying gold in MMOs is a tale as old as time. 
---
This merely offers something that people already do illicitly, but gives them an official channel to do it. Doing it that way, Blizzard gets the money that would otherwise go to gold farmers, the player selling game time gets the gold that *they would have gotten anyway, through illicit means*, and the users in game get to enjoy their subscribing to their favorite game without paying real life money, by merely using currency that they get from playing the game naturally. Everyone wins with buyable game time. 
---
The only time that it's not a successful or ideal model is in a game where there is no real life market for that game's currency.
---
Oh I see, fair enough. I‚Äôm on the boat of half my group of friends has evaded the queue on Herod and we‚Äôre pushing 30, the other half can barely get on and play. 
---
Thought he queues have gotten better, it‚Äôs still not good enough. 
---
It is only day 4 after release, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll get better in time.
---
Don‚Äôt teach the cows things, next thing you know they will think they have the same rights like all the other races.

Not that I actually think this, but...

Saurfang could have been lying. It could be that he DID lead the assassins to Go'el's home and family. Possibly even on purpose, to drag him into the conflict.

Expected these to be bad but they're actually great. Nice one.

That's...WoW tokens.

Hahahahhaha!!!!

Everything on low sucksaaa

I want them to release BC and Wotlk eventually, and then instead of Cataclysm let‚Äôs have a split in the timeline, and Blizzard can just develop brand new expansions with the heart of Classic.
---
seriously. this guy only has 2 ribs if he hearths out and buys food hell be fine but good god i hope he kept his treasure

Oh, I forgot the /s

I see what you did there

I‚Äôd be happy up until Wotlk, but I would totally understand why it wouldn‚Äôt go that far or even to BC.

The only companion app that would benefit classic would be a queue function where you can easily start the queue from your phone

Sword is better because in theory ambush spam is really, really good, but in reality/practice it doesn't make sense efficiency wise to stealth for every mob. With a big fat sword or mace and improved Sinister Strike, you can just flow from mob to mob and kill them in seconds without having to stealth at all, let alone worry about having to be behind them or missing your ambush etc. Besides, you can only backstab behind an enemy, so for questing this is obviously very bad because you'll be standing face to face with 99% of mobs.
---
IF you are ONLY leveling with a group, then sub/dagger isn't nearly as bad. But you have to be in a group 99% of the time for that to matter. 
---
That said, if you're dead set on using a dagger/sub build then it gets much better/practical at lvl 30 with Hemorrhage, which is one of the best abilities a rogue can learn. Ghostly Strike isn't bad for solo questing/grinding when used on every mob too. You can also use Hemorrhage with a mace/sword MH if you find a huge upgrade, and spamming it over Sinister Strike does more damage.  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fZZx0es0h0o](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fZZx0es0h0o) 
---
But still, it IS indisputably better to go combat for leveling 99/100 times. But play whatever you want.
---
Their customer service sucks in the way that you can't get a hold of them. 
---
Thought I would get another phone nr to customer service when I got a commercial subscription, but nope. It just costs a lot more.
---
Now, this is what makes this truly classic.

A twink is a character that is locked to a certain level to exploit certain gear and either dominate in bgs, solo mobs several levels higher or similar.

---
You know, retail is still nothing like BC and wrath.  More similar yes, but I don't think adding a separate BC server two years from now that you can copy to, or progressing to one and offering a classic server you can copy to, is a bad thing
---
I‚Äôll fucking do it again
---
I disagree, simply because outlands as a region was so bland and boring.

They already discussed this. Blizzard said that it will all go based on the fans.

They have couple of ideas. One of them included similar ideas to what you have just mentioned. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúClassic+‚Äù It will be new content, but totally different than what they have now.

Lvl 19 battlegrounds character. It's the best item for that lvl for destroying in pvp
---
Take a screenshot
---
Some are kyoya kun and mori senpai
---
7 int and spirit is enormous at that level though. that's a lot of extra mana and mana regen so that you don't have to stop anywhere near as often. Comes down to personal preference, really.
---
Whenever you search armory now it says "Profile pages for WoW Classic are not available." so i am wondering if it will ever be available for classic.
---
The point is that it will be on every spell you use, so that it will automatically cancel itself
---
Even if there were transfers, they would be high -&gt; low , so there's no chance of you going to the other realm.
---
Yooooo what‚Äôs good with all that gold my friend? ;)
---
Well, you *did* call him 'short legs'.
---
I tried it for the first time yesterday. Holy shit it was awesome...I mean, I wasn't very good, but it was still a breath of fresh air.
---
So a business that relys on a subscription model incentives long sub times? Yeah sounds pretty logical man.
---
Your GPU needs and or rma
---
Tanking is HARD. Three Sounders and demo on target, mage crits and still pulls agro. People will learn to be patient when dungeons get harder
---
I should've thought about it tbh. And it doesnt bother me if people complain about a phone picture, posting it almost feels like I'm in the moment again. But is it really 2006 if we dont have low quality pictures?
---
Bloodlust is not in Classic.
---
You don't even need to wake up at 5am to play. I've gotten onto Herod at 8am, no queues.
---
Is this a naughty word I'm unaware of?
---
Sunder and demo. Don‚Äôt bother with rend and only heroic strike if you have excess rage. It‚Äôll more be on the dps to spaz out too early
---
Its hard to argue that the game wouldn't be better off without them in a traditional old-school MMO sense. Its essentially pay-to-win. You can just keep buying them and stocking your character up with the best items and materials to progress through the game as fast as you damn well please. It seems almost antithetical to the philosophy behind creating the game in the first place.
---
Dis is truely gud! Great work, Bag Man!

I've just logged on when I got home and by the time kiddos are in bed I'm g2g
---
Druids get 2AP per point of STR in bear form and (I think) cat form.
---
Rogues get 1AP per point of STR, so it‚Äôs not as good as AGI, but not worthless, either.
---
Until you get sword specialization it's only important that you mh weapon have the highest max damage possible. Early on (through the 20s) this can often be a dagger because of how many good blue daggers drop off of bosses in dungeons, and how much competition there is rolling for blue 1h swords. But once you have the sword specialization talent you want all swords all the time.

I wonder how many of the "Let's add tBC!" People are saying that because Classic is't as enjoyable as they thought it would be, and are convincing themselves "My memories are from tBC. That must be it."

Most guilds don‚Äôt care too much about mc/ony. They‚Äôll be a joke compared to future raids

For context, back in Classic, you could take the flute outside the tram and annoy people with it, as long as you didn't hand in the quest.

Which is why blizzard can't be bothered to have a tauren as horde warchief. It would end the faction fighting. Thus the game is over.
---
Was horde for years .. So I and my friends are playing alliance now for New experience (know all horde quests already done them manytimes so switching to alliance is more fun .. now helping to same npc which I was killing for years)
---
Staff is better. Hits harder and the int/spi boosts your mana pool
---
Yeah I got Crossbow now but silver was a bit tight at the beginning so took a bit.
---
Daggers are too fast. You should never use a dagger in your MH as a Combat rogue.
---
Ur not part of the secret volcano club.

That was a big sarcastic post lol

Because you picked a bad server
---
I think agility increases crit chance for warriors too.

I stop and heal people who're clearly struggling and on the brink of death. It's such a great feeling.
---
Queueueueueue?

For those confused, I believe it's a European version of door dash kinda

Then play anything, actually ANY class. Choose what looks cooler or sounds more fun and go play around.
---
You're trying too hard thinking of a good duo comp. Every combination will work better than playing alone.
---
Does help, much appreciated!
---
When you leave a queue you have a lil grace period to rejoin. Since you‚Äôre only at 11/12k, I assume it‚Äôs the very beginning of the queue. As such, people are likely checking the queue time and then other servers and then coming back and taking their spot back.
---
OMG I FORGOT you had to feed your pets!!!
---
I think you're 100% right. With alts and rep grinds this game can and will last for years with a respectable population.
---
Being a dps is way easier in classic tbh. In retail unless you're doing dungeons you're hella overgeared for you have to pay way more attention, way way more positional mechanics and interrupts are a must.
---
In retail you basically just don't walk into pats and deal damage. Possibly CC something.
---
I was wondering about that. I recall talk about Joana being at the forefront, and yet he is nowhere to be seen on the leaderboard. What gives?
---
I get off work at 430 pm est, in queue by 5, and by the time I'm through its 11 pm and I only get to play an hour before bed.

I think it‚Äôs advice for people that work 8-5 then can‚Äôt login at all after work.

Perhaps that last line was a unnecessary. Sorry.

What if he just jumped as he hit disengage. It counts
---
They have stated in a bluepost before launch that a keyring was coming a few weeks after launch.
---
Just an opinion, I think the industry is crafting their games appeals to Asian gamer(mostly Chinese) and that is one of the big reason games have changed
---
I don't know when this would have been changed but we are playing 1.12 so it isn't exactly the same as day one vanilaa
---
Riiiiiiighhtttt...
---
i was never a big fan of archer to be honest, i watched a few seasons and found it fairly enjoyable but it wasnt enough to keep me interested.  not sure why i didn't like it that much, it should be right up my street
---
No. If a server is full, it's full.  Doesn't matter if everyone is in one zone or not.
---
Spirit is pretty bad for shaman at 60 as they don't have any talents to allow regen whilst casting. So they want MP5 instead.
---
Classic is shit
---
So the low pop blizzard means is the classic server low pop and not retail server?
---
You have a gift for shitposts sir.
---
Easy solution: forget Cata-BFA ever happened. Now you have 1 set of lore
---
At this point i forgot the real last name of Keanu.... Please?
---
isnt there something like this for raunchy books in like the tbc ... or was that another game ?
---
People are going to sleep and no more people are logging on...
---
Yea and in the ama that meant tbc or no tbc. Not a whole dev team making new content.
---
They can do TBC without flying or resilience
---
You have to boat then run all the way to iron forge. Or you can take the 5 minute death skip in barrens.

You're so cool

you might want to double check your auto correct
---
hahaha love it

I died to on of those harpie matriarchs in Mulgore as a hunter yesterday. Damn things kept healing and i wasnt quick enough to stun them :(
---
Mace and sword spec will be very useful for leveling or if you want to play ret. Free rep gain is useful in endgame, just saves you 10% time on some things. Spirit bonus is also nice for leveling. Seeing invis is ok, but you don't have a great stealth break and you aren't super worried about invis classes.
---
Dwarfs have stoneform, but you can already remove poisons. Small armor bonus maybe useful if you want to tank. Frost resist is ok, you already have an aura if you want that. gun spec does nothing.
---
Really neither is standout

Retail low pops are.  I was under the impression that's the low pop everyone meant,  not low pop of the current classic realms
---
I haven't hopped layers a single time unless grouping with someone on another layer.

Sharing forces you to hop frequently
---
Thanks! Hope I wont find you on neutral grounds... if available name will be Bauduco!
---

---
I‚Äôd need that item in the same situation. Like others have said stamina is a universal good stat while leveling. And you had an empty ring slot. Is it more useful for a warrior? Sure. But that‚Äôs why he was welcome to roll need as well.

They tried to fix it once .. it was awefull..

Hope you can swim.

---
That's a bit naive tbh.  The tourists and twitch roadies will leave at some point and there's a lot of them!
---
You know that it's not Blizzard that wanted to re-release vanilla WoW, but mostly private server community? No problem with them making money, but their statement was "You think you do, but you don't".
---
I don't think you can honestly salvage retail, it's too far gone
---
thats what i thougt but its been like this for like 40mins..
---
My server! This is why I play RPPVP lol
---
It's already got a cash shop on release that includes pay 4 convenience features like inventory expansions.  Don't trust that game with even the simplest tasks.
---
Same with my wife.  And she's fucking hooked.  I'm so jealous cause I could only take a few days off but she's a teacher so she's had all week!  If it had launched earlier in the summer I would have been green with envy as she outlevelled me!
---
I tp to moonglade for traveling. That flight path is so handy. Do it all the time while hearth is down. But, if I want to get back to eastern Kingdoms, I wait until hearth is up
---
That sounds really fun, keeping everyone alive
---
As I remember it, even back in Vanilla on my Hunter I had to Feign Death to get out of combat while in a fight to drop a Freezing Trap. I don't think it's changed.

Had a hunter win the need roll on a int/spi ring at the end of an hour long WC clear over a mage and priest.

Starter Edition (the 20 level tryout) only works for the normal edition of WoW.

Classic is free (no need to buy a game) but requires an active subscription.
---
You do not have to play the normal game to play classic.
---
Dreadmist became a "full" server at times last night, I didn't see Skullflame or Ten Storms do that.
---
I only use QWES plus mouse for movement.
---
Then bind A,D, F, G, T, C 1 2 3 4 5 (plus shift variants of all of the above) plus shift+space bar and then mouse button 4 and 5 plus shift variants.
---
Flame him on the forums!
---
that's what i got
---
I'll be the one to defend his idea and suggest he most likely meant a new server with no transfers rather then wiping your server
---
Because rage from white damage is very very low. We need to be hit in the first few seconds in order to build aggro and shield prevent us from that. NEVER. SHIELD. TANK. WARRIOR. (unless they are about to die :) )
---
TBC was the beginning of the end. Flying mounts ruined wpvp, having another zone killed the first two zones, heroics shattered the community between the tryhards and casuals, more focus on class balance made every class viable but ruins the rock paper scissors style pvp. It's funner to me that I'm scared of certain classes but can pwn others. It feels more like a classic rpg rather than a competitive  game. I wouldn't mind a classic+ if they kept the vanilla spirit but let's not ruin what makes this game great
---
I mean, you can just stay on classic then.
---
People that want TBC can go there if they'd like.

It's just another choice.

Use 'Tab' to select enemies instead of clicking them and making sure atleast all your frequently used spells are on keybindings is most important imo.

CoH too.

There‚Äôs a flight path....straight to TB.
---
I don't understand the people promoting Human for strictly holy paladin.  The 5% spirit is super tiny and paladins strive to have as little spirit as possible.  
---
Stoneform is extremely strong in pvp.  It can be used to break blind and wyvern sting.  It is also useful when you have multiple poisons that are difficult to cleanse through such as a stack of wound poison.  It can be used to bridge freedoms against a rogue if you are kiting them.  It can be used to immune important poisons such as viper and mind numbing without having the burn a global.  
---
With your high armor warrior, feral, and rogue already struggle to kill you.  Being able to remove their dots that normally bypass your armor is a major survival increase.
---
Can we keep it like this until the end of times?.
---
(They will add character transfer, but whatever)
---
When I‚Äòm logging on on the second device I still got the same spot on the queue tho. Been doing this since release.

Demo Shout is in Battle stance no (don't have it yet)? So I should be in battle stance, pull with ranged, use the shouts, switch to prot stance, and then distribute sunder armor/rend, and use revenge in between when i get a blocked proc? Also taunt when aggro switches to healer?
---
Oh sorry. It's more of a fighting game term. Missing.

As in, your pole arm skill will be so under leveled compared to your usual weapon that you'll miss a ton of attacks until the skill level catches up

Blessings, auras, heals. Basically you push the warrior up to 11 and let them cleave murder things and then split the loot.
---
I liked watching streamers to some extent but now that WoW: Classic is out I don't watch them at all. I guess with Vanilla/Classic I always only cared what happened on MY particular server. I never paid much attention to personalities, firsts, etc on other servers... except that Orc that camped the crap out of Southshore in vanilla and made everyone absolutely lose their minds, that was a good read.
---
Just messing about, thought that the rest of my post may have affirmed that. I was trying to tap into this weird feeling that - lulz - everything in the world was better back in vanilla days.
---
That said, Classic has been super fun and friendly so far, but then might also be due to me being on an RP-PVP server...
---
"DESTORYED"
---
I guess yeah
---
ohh i gotchu. And "white power" was way more "ha ha" 15 years ago when "white power" meant like, all 15 west virginians who thought that was a badass slogan. Then twitter changed the world...
---
Oh that's right, abilities count towards this

wait wut?

Its finally out and everyone is going nuts

Trying to do lakeshire quest. People are falling over left and right.

So ... what is the problem ? Are you a neurotic person ?

But im not talking about the queue. I mean when you are already playing

Yeah that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking, I don‚Äôt wana get used to sub-optimal controls! Thanks!
---
What I have missed most with retail is the sense of adventure. 
---
cause everything is just a speed run and most of the time it is even singelplayer even though its supposed to be a mmo.

Fake news.

They followed him and Saurfang made that up to piss Thrall off and get him involved.

That's a great start. Warrior and mage are both very difficult at first.

No blood elfs around to yell "cast it into the fire"
---
Im enjoying myself yes, and they haven't done anything wrong.  Business is business.  Its more like they are taking advantage of the willing because we are all so desperate to cling to nostalgia.  Their marketing is on point.  
---
My only complaint is the massive overpopulation during peak times which prevents you from doing anything and artificially extends the length of time required to complete a quest by about %500.

You'll find just as many helpful people in-game! It's a day and night difference from bfa. I saw one person in chat making fun of someone calling them a noob and what not, me and a few others put a stop to it and reminded him that's not how we do things in classic! He apologized and all was right in the world again.
---
Please delete this, there are flightpaths for both factions
---
Nice. Take my upvote
---
No problem man
---
What do you mean by recorded hotkeys?
---
 What class are you playing? If you haven't invested a very high amount of time you could reroll into a class that is better at solo play.
---
 Hunter is the best. You get aspect of the cheetah as well so you run faster which is great before mount.
---
 Another strong solo leveler is feral druid. It's a bit rough until you have lvled up a bit but after that it takes off. You have travel form which is faster than a mount unless you mount for like 15s or more( reason is 3s cast time for mount, none for travelform even though it's slower % speed gain). Also get faster runspeed in cat. 
---
 Warlock is also good but you have no extra speed. If you miss teleport perhaps better to go with the first two classes.
---
yeah it's basically the same tho. Works both ways.
---
What is the best addon for guiding me through dungeons? I have been doing WC and every group seems to get lost or miss a boss.
---
There is a cooldown to hop layers
---
Stop being offended on behalf of someone else. It's not worth getting worked up over.

It‚Äôs really hard to follow even as some that has played on and off since wotlk and cares about lore!

Dogshit streamer montage in a nutshell
---
It's not a waste of time. They'll be paying you big money for those stone scale eels when they need consumables at endgame.
---
Exactly what I was trying to get it. Classic has plenty of it's own issues but it did a lot of things right that the current games don't do. I'm hoping Blizzard pays attention to this feed back. Statistically subscription numbers have been trending downward and that trend is expected to continue. [Source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276601/number-of-world-of-warcraft-subscribers-by-quarter/)
---
Most of these things sound like how it was back in actual vanilla as well, so I guess they did a good job of preserving the authentic vanilla experience.
---
Game isn‚Äôt for you if you don‚Äôt enjoy a challenge. Read quests if you don‚Äôt know where to go. That‚Äôs what we did when we played classic first time around. That‚Äôs why we know where everything is. Actually there‚Äôs times I don‚Äôt remember. And I just read the quest. And I love it. 
---
This need for addons or easy mode just annoys the crap out of me. That‚Äôs what drove retail into the terrible state it‚Äôs in today.
---
The hype will die down but I highly doubt any of these servers are gonna be empty wastelands anytime soon. Private servers have had consistent populations, some still growing, for years. I highly, highly doubt we‚Äôll see the massive drop off in the coming weeks that a lot of people are predicting.
---
If they added new content I‚Äôd be so happy. I don‚Äôt really want them to go the whole re release BC.
---
Oh!! That‚Äôs great! I would like to have the money haha
---
in America, not in Europe, most dont even know whats that around here
---
It takes a huge amount of investment and capital to try and corner an item market. And the profit margin can be disappointing. At least for trade goods.
---
Like every normal human being. 
---
Also do you really expect people that cant even keep their windows up to date until it forces updates to switch to linux?
---
I thought BC was great: awesome dungeons, cool factions, amazing zones. To me that was peak wow because it didn‚Äôt alter the core experience.
---
I left during WotLK. I wanted to get into it but couldn‚Äôt. I thought I‚Äôd like dual talent builds but to me it took the uniqueness out of characters. I had other gripes but for some reason that was a big one.

MAN! maybe this is what happened to me this early morning. I booted up to play wow and BOOM blue screen and pc was turning off. no clue why since 3 hours earlier i was playing wow no pc troubles and all addons working.
---
Booted back up then tried to play and it did it again. This next time i deleted ally my addons and loaded fine.

please let me know if this was similar to yours. Cuz it made me think downloaded a virus from an addon.

Other games work fine but had to delete my wow files and re download the game twice this early morning.

They should leave Classic the way it is.  People fought hard just to get this. Don‚Äôt think blizzard will ever add new content that wasn‚Äôt originally there.

All of this could be done in retail. Players choose not to.

&gt;	You can‚Äôt teleport anywhere and everyone seems to know where to go because they played the original. Nothing is marked on the map. Even the noob monsters seem to be able to kill you. Does it get more fun at higher levels?
---
That is the fun. 
---
Trust me. We all went through this back in the day. I got all the way to level 30 with my first character with absolutely no idea what I was doing. My character was so useless I gave up and started over. If you‚Äôre stuck there are plenty of resources online. Guides and quest databases.

Oh baby, then you have to watch [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ja1j7xWpB3w). Vanilla Shaman with Sulfuras just deletes people for 15 minutes. It‚Äôs a classic PvP video with the music and editing cuts.
---
Downloading addons through twitch is unclassic
---
Cheers for the info. I'll have to look into the crit rates vs mp5. I'd guess gearing becomes quite simple for holy in raids (aside from stealing cloth loot).

Are holydins usually in demand? We used to use ALL the shamans for Naxx.

---
Everyone saying go to a different server... Well get back to me in 2 months with your complaining about being on an unpopulated server without your friends. I've been around, I know how this works. All you rookies will learn the hard way. Guess you can always server transfer at 60 right? NOPE.  
---
LOLUMAD

I should also note, I have been lucky enough to not have to experience any Queue times longer than 20m this week.

LOL
---
Are you referring to that random drop quest item from the oozes in wetlands?
---
When did all of that stop being normal? I stopped playing after Lich King and all of that still happened.
---
Best idea. I bought 2 deviant delight recipes for like 30-50s. On private servers those recipes were going for like 500g. I'll give it a month or two. At worse, i'll most likely get 50-100g for it or i'll sell it on blackmarket board for a few 100g.
---
Don't think any of these new servers were around in 2004.. so yea world firsts would be a pretty big deal..... seeing as these are new worlds.........

No, but your armor goes down by 100%, so attacks hit harder

The faction war is hot garbage though.

I think he was a jedi, but he didnt last long.
---
Stonefist?
---
I think Burning Crusade still stayed to the core of Vanilla. I started playing BC and after playing Classic I don't see many differences! BC would be a welcomed addition to this roller coaster of nostalgia. Additionally, if they just continued end game content I think we would see a lot of players fall off. An expansion would be great, or perhaps an alternative timeline?
---
Having 5 kids sounds like there is another activity you enjoy more than wow.
---
Did ur grand kids type this for you?
---
I am very surprised I had not problems getting Gwenny. I am sorry her name got taken :(
---
It's amazing how many friends I made back in vanilla (and BC too) from just grouping for kill quests. I fondly remember questing with a random Shaman waaaaaay back in the day. He had just learned Windfury totam and my Warrior felt like a god amongst men.
---
It's crazy that that was literally 13 years ago and I still remember it. I'm pretty certain he's still on that characters friends list.
---
Well what group are they named after?
---
Every guide I have seen has talked about a macro bound to your scroll wheel up that sends your pet to attack, applies hunters mark, and starts your auto shot. Scroll back is bound to your pet recall.
---
Classic can pull 3x the subs of retail and will still be making 1/3 the profit though.
---
BFA thrives on horse shit, forced microtransactions that for some reason people feel blessed Blizzard offers. The cosmetics are whatever, but the server transfer fees and character boosts just PRINT money for them. Race changes, too. I've known people who race change several times a month just for the luls.
---
what they'll really take away is that they need to figure out a way to introduce MTX that classic players will swallow. I'd guess we'll have, at a minimum, tokens some time before phase 6.
---
At 20 afaik
---
Dos2 was the only thing keeping me sane while I waited for classic wow to release. I‚Äôm glad baldur‚Äôs gate 3 isn‚Äôt going to release soon so I can focus on classic. I‚Äôd hate to have to pick between the two.
---
Is it usually better to tank with S&amp;B while leveling or to just stick with a 2H?
---
Well the only reason that anything below Legion exists at all right now is to convince players to spend, what, $60 on a character boost. In that respect having players annoyed by the chopper actually works in their favor.

BS is a waste I feel. I'm going mining/tailoring on my priest. Several BIS items come from tailoring and people always need bags.

Ah, here is a fine example of a fortnite kid.
---
As you can see, very little heed is paid to grammar and sentence structure.
---
Also excessive use of slang is common. Often ghetto slang is used by fortnite kids (whether black or not) in order to sound older / tougher.
---
These are just some examples of red flags to watch out for in your prospective party members.

Of course I tried everything but that. Thank you!

Both German PvP Servers have queues like this, lucifron even &gt;7 hours if you login in the afternoon.
---
Crafting
---
So you‚Äôre not unique or original. Why are you taking credit for this?
---
It sucks! I was thinking about pulling some late nights and only getting a couple hours of sleep but I just knew I'd regret it so much trying to get up the next morning, and possibly take the risk of over sleeping and being late to work. I can't wait to get off at 2 today and start the weekend!
---
Mind telling me what addons you are running here to get those unif frames?
---
I'd go combat even in groups (with enough into sub for the stealth goodies). I'm sure you wont ALWAYS be with them which makes the other spec better. Not to mention daggers is super bursty even at low levels which makes it so hard for tanks to hold agro.
---
This exactly, blizzard was against it. The OP doesn't understand that the initial queue's are going to be shortlived. Alot of people will go back to retail or whatever they were doing. OP is being super dramatic.
---
You don't need to wall jump for that one i thought?
---
Can we actually have this happen? do TBC and WotLK servers with this as one of the few changes (as well as not adding dungeon finder/LFG systems), then have new expansions with Dranosh (or Vol'jin) as Warchief and Cairne still alive. No crazy ass Garrosh, fucked up timelines or genocidal Sylvanas, ah what a world it would be...
---
While you two were deterred, I promise you, that is not the norm. I don‚Äôt want to go too much further into it, but you can just google it if you‚Äôd like. It‚Äôs a very popular black market and nothing will stop it from growing except things like osrs bounds, which ruins the profitability of it .
---
This was the funniest post I've read on this sub to date. Over the last few days, I have experienced every example given and it is honestly unbelievable.

Emerald dream is the first thing that keeps popping into my mind when it comes to alternate expansions.

Healers use less consumes generally. You'll be able to sell some.

---
What's the alternative? I can't think of another piece that is better for a druid as the set does give a 2% bonus to hit.
---
Where would you draw the line though?  Because eventually we'd end up at BFA again.  Maybe if they reworked each expansion with a classic ethos it comes to mechanics?
---
Even during prime time, I've never seen more than 4-5 people in there, this is not normal for a high pop server, something is fucked.

We actually called it VC on Arthas long before Dire Maul was heard of.

I remember at one point feeling super rich because I had like 20,000 towards the end of burning crusade. I ended up quitting before WotLK.
---
It was crazy when I returned years later to see how much gold was in the economy around Cataclysm.
---
Oranges to Apples. You cant compare a restored VANILLA server to the main-line game that is WoW today.
---
The entire concept of Elysium Project was that they wanted to play the OLD version of WoW which was not physically possible until the project was started.  It predates the  official classic servers by years and years.
---
Cant compare them at all.    All I'm saying is that suckers buying into this after all these years have always had vanilla available anytime they wanted it,  for free.
---
As an outsider to WoW, what's the context here?
---
It's funny how something brings up so many different kinds of memories for so many different kinds of people, someone mentioned here that they were "2 months older than WoW" and that put it into perspective for me, especially since I was 19 when WoW came out :0
---
*spams quicksave quickload*
---
Is it repeatable?
---
Except people are trapped in different versions of the same zone, gathering nodes end up on the unreachable side of the new zone area... prevents vet players from helping lowbies in those areas. When it came out through Cata it was basically garbage.

Can someone clarify for me: do % healing increases from talents also increase your +healing?
---
Scenario: my healing touch heals for 200 and I have 200 +healing. Does 10% increased healing from talents increase the amount by 20 or 40?
---
If % healing doesnt increase +healing, then reductions to mana cost (moonglow) and +% healing (gift of nature) would stop scaling once you train the spell. However, the +20% intellect from HotW would continue to increase your mana pool and crit chance as you obtained higher and higher level gear.
---
Dungeons, world pvp and battlegrounds. Thats what I did!
---
Had a rogue try to snag a tag on Maggot Eye (I think it‚Äôs name is) from a group I was in that had waited for the respawn. We let he him get the mob down to 10% but die. We got aggro immediately and got a nice easy kill.
---
We had room, he declined, fuck‚Äôem.
---
"i'm kind of just walking around and trying to pick up quests have monsters that aren't too tough" but starts with "I log in usually to a death screen cux when i die i just rage and alt+F4". but for real someone said classic is like the survival or hardcore mode of WOW. ive died to some stupid fights i feel like i should have won, just autorun to your corpse and move on, getting better gear will make you feel like your getting better.

---
Ok thx no we not forming a HC guild because we are all adults with jobs etc xd
---
Try a Lock, when you DOT it, It aggros and you have to wait that 1.5 sec until the first tic. literally anyone else sneezes on it and Tags it, Alternative is shadowbolt. 2 sec cast, just before it goes off someone tags it. Yep, thats what i was trying to do, give you some extra damage. On to the next mob.
---
Its the same idea as obsessing over a celebrity / band except for geeks because it involves video games.I think its less about the games and more about being part of a tribe.
---
Makes 0 sense to me personally, watching someone play WoW is probably one of the most boring things imaginable
---
I'll be pretty casual. Intending on doing a lot of the dungeons/UBRS, with a goal of getting the Tier 0 set and fully upgrading it. And with the casualness combined with altoholism, I'll certainly not be getting there quickly. Looking forward to it all.
---
Said beef/frog/corpse or troll face.
---
Depends on where in Asia, but typically yes
---
I remember the mini-map only working for battlegrounds back in the day whenever they added it. You'll probably have to grab an add-on if you want to have a map visible while out in the world.
---
Technically all that means is "My Struggle".  That guildmaster name though in conjunction with it... dear lord!
---
I'm not too into RPing but I still picked Grobbulous and it's super fun. You dont have to RP and it's usually specific guilds that are in to RPing all the time but every now and then you'll run into a few players that only RP and it's so much fun
---
Who knew so many people were going to want cake eh?
---
&gt; I wonder if they ever actually leveled a druid beyond level 10?
---
Have leveled a druid beyond level 10, still think regrowth is too expensive, the only time I find any value in using it is if I'm ~80% health and I can regrowth to top myself/hot myself before pulling another mob.
---
Rank 2 regrowth(18) costs 205 mana and heals for a baseline maximum of 364 in total.
---
Rank 3 healing touch(14) costs 110 mana and heals for a baseline maximum of 244.
---
Rank 4 healing touch(20) costs 185 mana and heals for a baseline maximum of 446.
---
I don't see how regrowth is more mana efficient than healing touch and why it would be used outside of the following situations; Tank will die before healing touch cast can get off, pull hasn't started and you can mana regen after using it.
---
I expect to have rage problems still by then :(.

Hey, I have 2 main questions, hopefully some experienced Pallys can help me out:
---
1. While levelling to 60, without any dedicated group play, how should I spec? Do I go straight holy for healing dungeons, or should I be ret to be able to solo quest better? A combination? 
---
2. Mods, does a ret pally need an auto attack timer to weave in spells or something at the right time? mp5 ticker for healers? Any other pally specific mods that are almost a must have?
---
Haha get a fucking life and a heart. No one cares how good you are, not everyone is playing for the same reason. Some people have JOBS they are focused on and only have a hour a day to play. Grow up OP!
---
Low server in classic is same population as full server in vanilla. Thats official from Blizzard. I wouldnt worry at all.
---
They can make a path up TK....................... You know they basically can change anything right?
---
That worked like a charme. Thanks!
---
actually, messaging players suspected of botting is one of the GM's method of confirming there is somebody there. again if I report somebody, it is investigated by GMs and blizzard, so no, I don't need better proof than that. That onus is on Blizzard, I'm simply reporting a POTENTIAL case of botting, which is not only permitted by the ToS but encouraged.
---
Mounts are an item that goes into your bag and is specific to that character only.
---
I have a /thank, /bow macro just for this kind of situation.
---
Everyone is LEVELING !
---
We need... pet tab which don't take bag space!
---
I already see where it's going...
---
Put 4 spaces before your code block and Reddit will auto format (unless you use the fancy editor).
---
Yeah, I mean 6 int for levelling weapon skills is not worth anything close to 6 int for a caster, especially a ring. Sorry man
---
Personally I've always healed with Grid, mouseover macros, and Decursive.
---
I like Quartz for my cast bar as it factors in latency.
---
Titan panel is nice to consolidate information coordinates, how long till you level, durability percentage, and many other things)
---
Recount because I like to see numbers.
---
ElvUI as it's highly customizable.
---
And then several Weakauras to track CDs/procs.
---
There lies the problem, I have a mage friend I am leveling with. I don't know if Consecration would be worth it to grind with him or just got ret because I won't be with him half the time... It also might be better to just heal him while he aoe pulls, haven't done much research because I thought I didn't think I would be leveling with a mage.
---
You can‚Äôt do it right away without a group.
---
That tiny mousepad would drive me crazy in a matter of minutes 
---
Just looking at it gives me anxiety 
---
Nice setup tho
---
On one hand this is true. Although the bonus isn't massive it will remove some time required.

On the other hand, as soons as you have reached your desired reputation with the factions you want it is a dead racial that no longer serves any purpose.
---
Son it‚Äôs a long weekend most of us have 3 days off
---
I can also use wikipedia. Yes, they are far, far right, but a legal organisation. Why should Blizzard ban the guild?
---
The bright side of this, is that it helps weed out the shitheads you don't want to play with. The ones that respond and are nice add them to friends list if you ever need someone for a dungeon.
---
That's fine, then it matters even less. Just stick to which one you like looking at.
---
Would recommend to not level holy though. You can heal dungeons with just int gear, and without the DPS talents you will level slower on an already slow leveling class.
---
I think there's gonna be a few people on here panicking they've been spotted abusing the system, this madman is proud of it.
---
No luck :/
---
Alright! Thanks. :)
---
A horizontal progression system would be amazing!
---
To what? I could have been leveling in thousand needles for all you know.
---
I'm not too sure.. The reason that the private server community stayed alive for so long was that all private servers eventually die, and then a new one would emerge. So the whole thing regularly started over, and there were new races to first 60, first raid clear, etc. Classic won't suddenly one day shut down. We're very close to a world first 60 already, and then that will never happen again. Then everyone will be 60, raids will be cleared, and gradually (over some years) I think there'll be little to motivate people to play unless there's some new challenge introduced.
---
First tine shaman. Love it. Realy suprised comming from a dk/warrior main.
---
I am about to start playing and was wondering what the best class is if I plan on leveling solo. Also are there still queues for the most popular servers?
---
These might seem like gimmicky to some people, but even just having a solid color behind your monitor will help your eyes especially if you play in the dark.
---
As a rogue from vanilla that went through Vaelastrasz when he was progression, I know my place.  Posts like this make me feel like my experience in game means something.
---
Wonder if threat meter is still around?
---
Im saying that i might be waiting for a spawn but not standing around doing nothing meanwhile.
---
&gt;The EDL stated that it was not racist,[205] and took an "actively anti-racist and anti-fascist stance".[116] Robinson stated that people of "all races and faiths" were welcome to join,[58] and it employed the slogan "Black and White unite: all races and religions are welcome in the EDL".[116]

These neo-nazis are getting more and more extreme by the day, damn scary stuff

Well,if I get it I know for how much I should sell it then.
---
Thanks for the info!

I love your UI man! What's that add-on ?
---
This guy sysadmins
---
lost count of the warriors and every other class saved while traversing the barrens
---
appears you are lacking mow, thorns, and are low on health.. bow and tremble before your god!
---
pretty much stop and help every time I see a lower level struggling.. usually it ends with me chilling for a few seconds to ensure they will live (dd/dot on mob, tagging extras, throwing out heals, etc)
---
Damn hunters and their multi weapon skillz
---
Mark Kill Skull, Learn throw, ranged pull, Bloodrage (rage generation generates threat), Battle Shout (Battleshout provides far more threat then demo shout as it gives threat based on who you buff, so in a party of 5 thats a lot of threat, this will get all the mobs to come to you), Shield Block to proc revenge, Revenge whenever its available.  If have extra rage sunder.  Taunt is a little strange in vanilla.  It sets you to the top of their threat table and forces them to attack you for only a short time.  To actually utilize taunt properly be sure to hit that mob with a revenge or sunder to keep you on top of their threat table.  
---
Using things like Demoshout/Thunderclap at lower levels will decrease your rage (mobs don't hit as hard so less rage for you), so I generally don't use them unless its a pack of 4+ mobs.
---
Yeah that is exactly it. Last night I grouped with a healer and tank for a quest but after just stayed with them for dps+blood pact+hearthstones
---
Thanks for the stats, really interesting to follow!
---

---
Good. My buddies got skinning, fucker better not out level me by skinning
---
My biggest fear for Classic is that they're going to release TBC Classic 6 months after Phase 6. Naxx will once again be overshadowed by the expansion and Azeroth and 40 man raids die a second time...
---
I think a minimum of 1-2 years after Naxx would be nice.
---
Personally I'd prefer a "Classic+" alternative, but I think we all know it's going to be TBC Classic.
---
Do you add to blacklist based on stories? Or is there some kind of proof required? If not this seems extremly toxic.
---
I don't see it as a bad thing in Retail, because gold is meaningless.
---
It would be a bad thing in Classic imo, as it would make gold "not important" for payers
---
Oh ok, I just read that. Since we play in a party, I could kill the other two wolves and he could focus on Timber.
---
Same here logged in yesterday at 6 only 25 min q
---
Mom, I am in TV!!
---
I do think they dropped the ball on the initial launch. My guild was set to roll on whitemane and after people were waiting in 12 hour queues on launch many people, including myself, rerolled to a lower pop and ended up in a split guild. 
---
I do wish they had at least this many servers prior to launch. 
---
I can‚Äôt speak for the EU but from what I‚Äôm seeing with every single server having 10k+ queues it‚Äôs insane they haven‚Äôt added more servers.
---
paladins awesome I've gotten to play more OSRS this past week than most weeks
---
Best of luck!
---
But it doesn't stop the gold buying market from growing...
---
Well it just so happens to be the title of the book that made hitler famous just sayin lmao
---
This is interesting, what if a big reason Blizzars brought back classic was to continue the story and create and alternate timeline of expansions
---
\*Target explodes in a giant fireball\*. Mage: What, no liver?
---
You would sour relationships with your party over 40 silver? If you ninja loot a BOE just for gold that could be an upgrade for your party, they will remember that.
---
For optimum rep gains do all the starting zones for each faction: bloodhoof quests durotar quests and tirisfal glades.

Got him Wednesday night. Happiest boy alive.

We are at day 4. Wait and see what servers are like in the coming weeks

These are the details you miss when you've been flying over and rushing through areas :). All hail Classic!!
---
"Who?"
---
How do you know all of this?
---
Man, i am not using any software and i just afrain to log out to stand in queue again..as almost all these people...a few using software
---
My prediction: You will be in bed by 11 because of exhaustion of the whole week. :)
---
I have skinning as well haha. It‚Äôs been a money maker so far. So many dead mobs every where to skin.
---
F L A V O R
---
#F
---
It‚Äôs because of weapon skill. When you learn a new weapon type for the first time and your skill is low, you miss consistently and get more blocks/dodges/parries/glances.
---
Hey. Your name seems very familiar. You don't happen to have been a GM of the dwarf only guild &lt;Dwarven Overlords&gt;?
---
This means doing God's work
---
I'm offended that you think fathers in southern America sell there daughter's virginity.  Bro everyone offends everyone, best thing to do is mind your own business.  Unless the group advertises for the hate of muslims you are just being a "karen".
---
You mean to automatically mark each mob in a group? It‚Äôs only providing information, not playing the game for you, so this being scripted and automated isn‚Äôt a issue.  Example: There‚Äôs weakauras in retail that with automatically mark all mobs in a group when you engage them in combat and nothing has been done about it.
---
Thank you :)
---
Then the hunter goes and tags all the mobs you need right after.
---

---
I read this in Taliesin‚Äôs shit show voice.
---
They never said that.. they said they'd consider it as a population balancing tool.
---
if your regretting your server choice just reroll dude. its been four days, the game has a two year content schedule. You SHOULD NOT count on server transfers happening.
---
RIP, Florence hit my home last year. Good Luck
---
free realm transfer
---
I was going to do shadow/disc build.
---
Debating whether I activate a sub after watching streamers play for the last few days. Been really fun to relive the classic experience through their perspective, so far. I really loved playing classic WoW when I was back in high school. 
---
Also, I‚Äôve been considering playing as a paladin, which is something I never did. Then I stumble upon this thread today...

I‚Äôve been loving leveling my hunter. Having the pet definitely makes for faster mob killing / saved me from sticky situations. I don‚Äôt mind buying ammo either, haven‚Äôt run out (yet) and my limited inventory space has me running back to town to sell / restock often.
---
I‚Äôm on Herod. Still long queues (15k+) during peak hours. I have friends on less populated servers with only 15min -30min queue times, tops.
---
Poor guy deleted classic after this
---
I didn‚Äôt really care, I haven‚Äôt been playing in forever. that was all glyph sales that I managed with auctioneer, so it was minimal time spent, buying low and selling higher. 
---
I missed the actual challenge that vanilla and BC brought. Wotlk has some great content from the lore side, and some halfway interesting mechanics, but the easy button was too much for me to bear by the time Cata was in full swing. 
---
PvP success was more gear-dependent than skill dependent by that point. Arenas and BGs became flooded with welfare pvp gear, bots and watered down for kids. It was too dumbed down for 8 year olds by the time Cata was getting new raids. 
---
I didnt mind rep and gear chases, but it was too easy mode after the first couple xpacs. This week I‚Äôve leveled my priest to 20 in a couple of evenings (about 1 lvl every 30 minutes of hardcore questing), and have died more times than I probably did in all of cata. 
---
If there isn‚Äôt any chance of dying, there is no challenge to the system, and you‚Äôre just walking through for the storyline. That‚Äôs just my take on it. Some people don‚Äôt mind that, I just became bored with a walkthrough.
---
Ok? But they haven't done anything.
---
Like how kicking and screaming about wanting the guild name apple gone would amount to nothing.
---
You rock thank you!
---
Thanks friend. Good luck in azeroth
---
They're still fine xp in the end because of all the XP you gain killing the mobs. Grinding isn't very interesting but it is an effective way to gain lots of exp and resources like cloth
---
They just like the whine.
---
Same here! Just hit 20 earlier, been definitely taking my time and been leveling fishing, cooking and my primary professions as I go. I honestly find it so much more enjoyable like this.
---
In classic, they cannot.
---
Hang up a sheet or something and you can get rid of those lines.
---
No they definetely love money more now. Back then they wanted to make money while still having at least some pride in their work.
---
Praise the light.
---
No .. I cant if I want to be comparable and keep with those who use them ..
---
I played a Retribution Paladin.
---
A **RETRIBUTION**. PALADIN.
---
Thank god I don't make mistakes like that anymore... \*rolls Arcane mage\*
---
If you want easy mode leveling while still allowing for big dick crit combos, Hunter will probably give you a good shot at that.
---
Late game hunter burst combos (bow shot, aimed shot, bow shot, multishot) can 1 shot lots of cloth wearers in about 4 seconds.
---
Your pet is basically an elite mob once you get your beast mastery tree going, and before that you can still basically chain pull all day without ever stopping besides going a mob or two without casting spells to let your Mana Regen.
---
You can handle 3 or 4 equal level mobs at once by level 20 with proper preparation,  and with skill you can also solo red mobs 5 or 6 levels higher than you and elite mobs up to and just above your level with kiting. 
---
Hunters feel amazing from a class fantasy prospective as well. Tracking skills really do make you feel like you're hunting things, and pets and I really become like real life pets by the end of the game considering how involved leveling and developing the skills for them is. For extra hunter feel, you can go skinning / leatherworking and make yourself pretty reasonable gear as you level from the mobs you kill. 
---
There's probably going to be way too many hunters, so group prospects aren't great and raiding futures aren't perfect either, but it sounds like the only two downsides of hunters aren't really an issue for you.
---
If you have questions about hunter I'm happy to help too! I've researched it to death and I'm level 26 on classic now.
---
Make sure you carry around an int set for those first few pulls after you level.
---
But I‚Äôm a hunter :(
---
There's no difference between using something like that and standing in a city or the general area of the dungeon and spamming it. The difference came when everyone started getting auto teleported to their dungeons and put right back where they were as if it never happened.
---
ICC had some of the coolest boss mechanics and items tho. I hope we get the raid in some form
---
The Kurzen medicine men.
---
Public service announcement:  You do not need consecration or prot tree to tank early content.  
---
Bonus public service announcement:  You do not need holy tree to heal early content.
---
I just skip them if they are being overdone.  There are plenty of places to quest, you don't have to do every one.  Even without Silithus I'm pretty sure I'll have no trouble hitting 60 without too much grinding.
---
The debuff i had (cleansed it with anti venom now) is stealth breaking, that was my problem. But i think i'm good now :)
---
" But this could have a lasting impact on the game in terms of what it could do to the amount of players (if people quit because of this, for example). " 
---
With the context, it seems more correct, no? I clearly said that was annoys me isn't the act of cheating, but rather the consequences of this particular instance of cheating. If people bear through it, fine, but by exacerbating the situation, it could drive people away from the game permanently, ultimately having a negative impact on realm size/health etc. down the line. I know a lot of people will quit pre-60 anyway, but this is preventing a lot of people that wouldn't from even starting. 
---
I get that queues are going to be there, I was expecting it from the word go. but more than 8 hours because people refuse to log out? that's just shitty.
---
Crap sarcasm
---
Basically trash vs treasure experience.
---
When you have insane gear and everything is cake, you hate the game because it's boring.
---
When you're a random shitter with wooden planks for armor, sticks for arms and gang up on a slightly strong enemy, finally bringing it down after getting your ass beat feels like you just won at life. I fucking love it haha
---
ALL DAY!!!!!!
---
You get a bufff! 
---
Here I‚Äôll taunt that off of you. 
---
Such a fun part of this stage of the game. So many people so many spawns. It‚Äôs pandemonium!
---
Is there confirmation on no patches before Christmas?
---
Whos Arugal?
---
Right now is the euphoric honeymoon phase. A lot of it will fade, but I hope the community exiles those who are toxic. Based on this 'humor', the toxicity is alive and well, just being directed elsewhere at the moment. People will eventually treat you the way they treat others, and OP will be awful towards classic players eventually.
---
Everyone is stuck in phase 1 for months. You have plenty of time. Plus now you have a bit of gold to help your warrior buy weapons early on. Huge help.
---
When one of my NE wanted to join us pexing in westfall, I said to her "have a good run from Menethil" and she replied "What are you talking about, I'm just gonna take the boat to SW" ho boy was she disapointed. 
---
(But I linked her a video showing how to skip the palun, so in the end, happy end !)
---
They've increased server capacity and are adding servers, and it's still 20k+ queues on primetime (8+ hours wait). If you were to not resub, please let it be because it's far too crowded.
---
That's a grudgin'

Is there a purpose behind these other than being neat? Do you find they increase immersion?
---
Almost as satisfying as being a mage, being able to counterspell them, but just using fire ward and letting them cast anyways while I absorb 100% of the damage.
---
They really are
---
Westfall might end up being my home. Pagle is off the table because of the queues. I‚Äôve been playing on Incendius but that one gets bad at night too. Westfall seems pretty solid so far.
---
That's how I feel too but I also need to remind myself I have 1 day 10 hours /played already with no time off this week, and the girlfriend has been very understanding of my no-lifing. This might be a healthy break lol.
---
I‚Äôve played through Cata-BfA, so absolutely not. I haven‚Äôt had as little interest in a game ever as I do in playing retail.
---
DROPS BASED ON SKILLS ACQUIRED???? 
---
probably not but a guy can dream
---
I'll probably play both when I hit 60.

You aren't going to last long in the big bad world

Are you in Fairbanks by chance? I heard rumors of your kindness in my crew‚Äôs discord

There isn't. They intently locked the distance to what was max during pre-BC
---
No appreciation for druids :(
---
/r/loweffortmemes
---
I don't think that the mana is worth spending for getting a 10 % increased chance -i'm guessing- of getting a weapon skill increase that you're going to have maxed 15 minutes after you leveled up.
---
I believe they released classic to stall development on retail. Maybe something bigger will come after BFA, i believe a new engine could be on its way
---
Cries in shaman

You must not have seen any of the cloth gear

Definitely hillsbrad

---
Either transfers or keep expanding the capacity of the servers.
---
Blizzars screwed it's core of classic players by not having enough servers prior to launch
---
Adding servers post launch was too little too late for much of the playerbase
---
But then you have put time into a toon on a more manageable server that it's entirely possible none of your friends are on. Sure you can make new ones but do we just tell irl friends "I'm off to play without you, GG"?
---
Didnt all the night elves consider him a great threat and shit in wc3? I thought it was just a continuation. Illidan vs LK vs Us FFA.
---
Wait a week, remote into your PC to queue. Make an alt on another server
---
Haha I think even gandhi would have been asking for rogue nerfs after a few days leveling in stranglethorne.
---
I think a lot of us remember things like this, and it's quite fuzzy because you were genuinely thinking you're running for your dear life at the time, but somehow the memory of it is still epic. I still have fond memories of tarren mill and that first feeling of dread when you encounter the opposite faction.
---
I think in classic there is still potential for cool pvp because of the more social experience, I've had my share of opposite faction players helping with quests back in the TBC days!
---
I don't get why there's such a big discrepancy with Polearms.  There's less of available (as quest rewards and boss drops), it costs 10x more to train, and you train it much latter
---
Hell, it's position in the talent tree also makes it unfavorable for Arms Warriors
---
I got to Hyjal on one of the stress tests, so it is 100% doable. Wall jumping isn't required for Hyjal or Caverns of Time. Also technically wall jumping still exists even in BFA, it's just REALLY FLIPPING HARD and nowhere near as good as it used to be
---
I know, no changes
---
But I wish horde and ally could buff each other.
---
No you first. /hug
---
I think everyone is focusing on your name only and not the 420 HP and 666 Mana. Do you OP do you.
---
Ya I understand that but even same level mobs are damn ninjas. In vanilla, standing behind the target takes away the chance to "dodge" correct? I can't remember if that was something that was implemented in later expansions or not.
---
Preaching you Faith is a volunteer position.
---
Being a member of the church means pay The Light it's tithe.
---
Bruh.  People know.  It does make the problem worse but people still gonna do it
---
Lol the fact I have to explain to you is quite funny.
---
It's obvious WoW has lost its popularity and MMORPG in general in the past 4+ years now. so they are trying to "Cash in"  on the old WoW nostalgia with classic server now they are seeing their chance.
---
Meanwhile the people who were DEDICATED to playing classic have already been doing it on EP.  which  was the only way prior.
---
What I'm saying is that the fans here are coming back to a fad. when the real people who are excited about classic have already been playing it for  7+ years on EP.
---
There is nothing to be excited about here at all.  Just a fad.  bye bye.
---
Nah dude, spend gold on a proper weapon and make sure you have a healing pot or two in the inventory in case of pulling multiple mobs. 
---
Also learn to use a ranged weapon so you can pull a single mob while questing.
---
Make sure to have a shield so you can shieldbash mobs that cast healing and you'll be fine.
---
In all fairness, this was the standard warrior REEEEEE during BC at least, as I recall. War hate displine shield. Metal shield good, sparkle shield bad.
---
i tried doing quests my lvl but couldnt find more quests in elwyn forest when i was 11. So i went to westfall and the enemies there are like 10-15ish mostly 13-15 so it was quite annoying
---
No, that non mythic wow players are retarded. Ugh, dude. Do you really have to dissect everything?
---
While technically true, this does not account for player drop off.
---
I'd love to play BFA while waiting for queue...
---
It definitely does, thank you. I'll go ahead and play on NA :)
---
They give that breadcrumb way too early, it's kind of funny. I went there after finishing all of Elwynn and still felt too challenged as a Warrior, that explains why most leveling experts spend some time doing Dun Morogh to 13 I guess!
---
75-125 was a GRIND. As a Horde I had to travel to that cave in the Wetlands with Incendiarite veins. Finally past it now and I can do Iron.
---
I'm laughing so hard right now.
---
From my 30 hour experience of doing a few quests with random warriors, their attacks feel super slow.
---
I think that if they miss a hit or two, they could be in serious trouble because it's a huge loss in dps for them.
---
And since they're slow, trolls would help with the racial skill to get that necessary speed i assume ? Also, regen baby.
---
Funny you say that when for the last couple of years every blizzard IP is tanking and making a lot less money than the rest of the actiblizz brand. Blizzard is the worst performing part of activision blizzard, King being the biggest.
---
On Pagle [H] there's people in the 35-45 level range as of yesterday.
---
This is some wise gnome!
---
Everyone gets Arcane Brilliance on my watch. Everyone.
---
Correct, people have gone to the dancing troll village during the stress tests
---
I‚Äôve been having great luck with mining on my server as well. Was able to get to Journeyman engineering just with a couple sweeps of the zone borders.
---
I actually like that it's more of a rock, paper, scissors format instead of a rock, rock, rock balance. Having specs that do better in pve or pvp has some fun incentives, and the cost of a respec being so high makes people learn to play better. 
---
I know we aren't quite there yet, but I'm convinced we are going to see meme specs clearing raid content at some point. Player skill/knowledge is just so much higher now. I dunno maybe I'm wrong, but we will see.
---
I play on PvE because I don't want to limit my already limited game play time by dealing with getting ganked. I still put my PvP flag up sometimes and I've still gotten to do world pvp as well as raids on capital cities. I killed thrall multiple times back in the day.
---
I think that weapon's master is scamming you.
---
If that was my wife, I'd very kindly remind her, that I'm too busy.  And that I've told her about this 8 months ago, and that I've continued to remind her about it up until now.  If she gets mad, she gets mad....
---
Why would people be standing in front of Ironforge right now? There's a lot of leveling to do.
---
Pretty much, it's a good way to humanise professionals.
---
Yes they're tough but they're not impossible.
---
Try out-leveling content so you get the added bonuses to your attacks and defense - you have a higher chance to hit and crit mobs that are a lower level than you, and they have less of a chance to hit and crit you.
---
Normally yellow means an even-level enemy but for a warrior you should consider it green.
---
Also spend more time in dungeons getting a piece of blue gear or two. This will gear you up and help you get more levels so questing becomes easier.
---
It's definitely not fast though.
---
The eternal Westfall discussion
---
Thanks for properly explaining, yes I', not from the UK, and from the wikipedia article it sounded like a proper organisation, with official leadership etc.
---
Well yes he's got that demonic thing going on, but he seems to have it under control and doesn't really pose a threat.
---
You deserve it for not being able to spell *queue*
---
Yeah. I haven't openly shared it with anyone unless they ask me for it.
---
Well, picture this:
---
It's 01:00 during weekday;
---
Classic WoW demographics showed most people are within 25-32 years old range (probably work);
---
Humans need sleep;
---
Fuck yeah.. Yesterday, I was doing the Samophlange questline and randomly a warrior invited me to group and he pulled all the aggro while I was doing all of the steps for the both of us.
---
We finished the quest and just said goodbye to each other, it's really nice to have this kind of interactions happening.
---
TBC's endgame content was eons ahead of wrath's joke of a 10/25 man system
---
My buddy's retail raiding guild hasn't been able to get enough people on to do raids this week because they're all too busy leveling in WoW Classic. The guy who created the guild is the only one that refuses to play it because it's effectively killing his guild.  
---
This is one of the many examples of the impact that classic has had on retail this past week.
---
That's because it is lol
---
haha we did the reverse yesterday and ran to SFK. Killed a sad little rogue and watched the rest of the horde stop as we ran by :D
---
Could be he has a healer out of group ?
---
Ive heard of that tactic used before at least
---
ricardoFlick
---
You can taste the peace in that land
---
Wtf lol
---
Hilarious to me watching Jokerd and others AoE farm their way to world first after hearing this sub bitch and moan for months that leeway was broken and made AoE farming unviable etc.
---
Bloody commie, I've been selling those bad boys for 8-25s depending on the day
---
Dude you just always say Blizzard wants that money.  
---
OFC they do it's a fcking company. Still they can't just do everything they want to get it xD  
---
There won't be Faction changes.  
---
Realm Transfers quite certain no idea about race idc tbh.  
---
If they were only about the money they could have milked it far more by now. There also won't be any Gametime Tokens although "Blizzard wants that money" because some things they just can't do without people completely going wild.  
---
God put some fkcing effort into your answers always just copying "Blizzard wants that money" let's you come over like the biggest prick around
---
Oh boy this mage needs to get a life. haha
---
I think it'd be a little weird in classic, though. Saving for your 40 mount, and perhaps not even affording it directly at 40, and later on your epic mount, are seen as somewhat notable achievements.
---
If you could just buy a token at 40 and get the mount, well, it would be pretty different. You wouldn't need to be stingy with money up to that point either, so you'd afford to kit your character out in some better gear if available.
---
People can just buy gold as it is (or will be able to once the sites get going) but at least there's risk involved. At least some won't take the risk. I'd prefer it if they kept actually putting time into the game as the only official, 100% safe way to get gold.
---
If blizz does their best at banning people who do it, even if that is very hard to do, I think it makes for a better game.
---
Man, I just kill everything in sight. I¬¥m not sure but I think the quest exp is a nice bonus but isn't worth enought to keep me camping a respawn.
---
If I need a drop and the mobs aren't there I will kill stuff around and go back later. I may take 45 min to finish a quest, but when I finish I never stopped leveling during the wait.
---
If I had an addon telling me that I needed to do X, Y or Z I would get real anxious about those objectives hanging there forever.
---
I think you should update the map with the one from the game that atlas uses/used. Just more visually pleasing to see the little details imo. Good stuff either way!
---
thats how it works xD
---
Terrible, yes.
---
Holy F that‚Äôs crazy!     
---
But grate on the karma blue drop!
---
Absolute top bins. 10/10
---
You ain't kidding!
---
Upvoted, this is awesome. Look forward to the next one!
---
Meth: not even once
---
A video game is meant to be entertainment. You pay to watch a movie in theaters, a beer with friends, etc. You spent all this time and money being entertained. No other form of entertainment lasts forever. Neither should this one. Be present
---
Im level 23
---
Im very slow. Considering the amount ive played...
---
Yes. But it's still not unreasonable that there is someone with an access to them in Europe.
---
It was VC for a LOT or servers in vanilla.
---
First time rolling Alliance, you blew my mind
---
Gosh I hate min-maxers ;)
---
There are low pop regular PvP servers too this is even not harder
---
fck off
---
Mornin'! Nice day for fishin', innit? huha
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say they are hard but they require attention.  If you not full health and you pull a mob that may be 1 level higher than you, that fight might kill you if you miss an attack or two.  They are unforgiving.  Right now my warrior is level 18 and it not that fun because the only thing I do to do damage is a rend if I have enough rage otherwise everything goes into heroic strike when I have used the shouts I needed.  The only real damage is heroic strike which is a glorified auto attack until 40 and execute.
---
Their payout is huge and the light at the end of the tunnel is nice.
---
Playing as a troll will help you a bit with the regen of health but it won‚Äôt be too crazy.  
---
Another thing to note, warriors are very gear dependent.  Which is nice and annoying.  When you get that nice weapon upgrade you feel it and life is great; however,  when you weapon is is in need of an upgrade life is miserable. 
---
Earlier I said right now it‚Äôs now fun I do wanna say I still enjoy it as I have my moments when I two shot a mob and that always feels nice.
---
Who said anything about quitting? Making new friends doesn't mean or imply leaving old friends behind. You can always get back to the server when the queuing isn't a problem. I'm just saying that between playing on a different server and not playing at all, the choice seems obvious to me.
---
Anyhow, I've also been remote queuing for days now and it works just fine unless the server goes down at the wrong time like Stalagg did yesterday around 3PM, but I still rolled a toon on a low pop server (Benediction) so if I have to pick between a 6 hour queue and playing my alt, I'll go with the latter. Chances are I'll level him to 60 on that server and transfer him to my main's server a few months from now.
---
Asmon makes like 25k a month from... i dont know what exactly...
---
i want to join faerlina to play with asmon
---
Idk then why did he care so much how prepared i was lol? 
---
Jk, maybe ill have to go refresh myself on the story to see if its actually stupid. I always though illidan and Kael Thas were good villains
---
Definitely Krug's
---
Imp AOTH is a huge DPS increase and Endurance is barely noticeable. If your pet is that close to dying something went wrong anyways.
---
Grobbulous
---
I haven't had a proper sub since late Cata. I'd just buy 30 days when I felt like playing. Now I know I want to play so I could comfortably buy a real sub again. Long live Classic!
---
According to this:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/formulas-spell-coefficients-classic-wow
---
It does.
---
Seal damage has a 20% spell dmg coefficient.
---
Seal judgement has a 42.9% spell dmg coefficient.
---
If you want to teleport around then play mage. If you want quests marked on the map then install the Questie addon, otherwise read the quests. Yes, enemies can kill you. They'd be pretty shitty enemies if they couldn't.
---
Aim for the balls next time
---
Yea i was hanging out on another site which seems to have kinda lost it's way when it supposed be an "mmorpg" site and a reviewer completely missed the big picture with classic and trashes the game because it doesn't have wow retail hand holding features and the graphics suck? How that ever was approved for publication is telling in that, yea it's not an mmorpg site anymore i guess.
---
I mean one can be a little off, but when you're several galaxies off as an "mmoRPG" site with little to zero understanding what classic is at its simplest core, that's extremely disconcerting to a reader. Too bad too allot of great posters, people running the site, but as a mmorpg player, reader, time to bounce.
---
So yea, ended up here and yea... OMG RIGHT!!!, not only is everyone in game helpful but this reddit thread is as well, incredible for sure specially in this day and age, totally understand your appreciation, i feel yea, so happy to end up here. Not only that the guild i'm in is huge, own discord ofc, but own website, calendar, forums, and starting to hang out on their private forums allot as well, it's all good :)  
---
MMO +RPG players unite and rejoice!
---
And the talent doesn't do much for it either. Druid master hots
---
Some people like min max, some people like casual leveling.
---
Let everyone play how they want
---
I agree with Shaman - great utility, excellent single- and multi-target heals. Totems are super helpful, too.
---
I would also recommend Druid, too. They have a lot of utility in-raid (battle res, innervate, HoTs), and they can capably perform any of the three main roles: tanking, healing, and DPS - cat form (physical) and Moonkin (casting). Most guilds will want you to heal at 60, but - if you are lucky to join a good progression guild - you can easily accrue enough items to be an excellent off-tank or DPS. 
---
Alright, my druid shilling is over. I'd say, based on your description, you can't go wrong with Shaman.
---
I was doing this today. Some random spanish dude called me a retard for spamming /chicken. Guess I'm not telling him about the quest.
---
just answer the question if you are so smart
---
Great part of it it's the nostalgia.
---
If you hadn't played back in the day it won't feel so epic or have the same "coming home" experience.
---
I used to love buffing people with water walking as they jumped from great heights in to water.
---
Oof, and I felt bad when I accidentally mis-spent my first talent point. Still a lowbie, so I at least still have time to make money before I know I‚Äôm gonna have to spend 1 gold. 
---
At least you got a blue?
---
This picture proves absolutely nothing besides some people are AFK in the inn.
---
And claims that he will turn in Scourge tokens for 59-60.  So once 59 hits, he's basically there.
---
Not sure on the downgrade question, but i also am facing the issue on it not showing active buffs.  it'll show weakened soul, but not renew/pws etc.
---
But everyone knew they had too few servers and they didn't listen.
---
Having to merge low populated servers later on seems like a better problem than having hundreds of thousands of people unable to play the first week.
---
They gotta save up for their mounts
---
This is what most leveling guides and world first warrior levelers recommend as well. You should try to stay 2 levels ahead of the mobs. It definitely helps. 
---
Also make sure you train a ranged weapon to pull mobs. Most warriors issues come from using charge with mobs that are way too close to each other. 
---
Also, if you haven‚Äôt learned about it yet, look up hamstring kiting because it‚Äôs absolutely essential for warrior leveling.
---
All about the rare elite black version
---
Cause hunters can't train maces?
---
I am glad you like it!!
---
I will never forget the time I was about to get ganked in Zangarmarsh in TBC. I was awful at PVP and my shadow priest was getting owned by a paladin or something. Suddenly my DoT I had on a mob finished the mob off, I leveled up, and was able to finish the guy off instead of dying a couple seconds later like I would have. It was amazing especially since I lose 9/10 PVP fights even to people a couple levels below me lol
---
Always wished I could have seen his reaction.
---
After about 12pm PST the big servers start getting queues, all the way up to 5-10 hour queues. Starts to die back down around midnight.
---
Happened in vanilla, nothing new
---
I got home today early at 2 pm so I only had 4 hour queue. Only 2 more hours!
---
For me personally it is also that after the second expansion I quit (due to just life being what it is). Like 3 expansions later I felt incredibly out of the loop and I didn't feel like playing catch-up was any fun. This feels like a chance to get back in on the ground floor, to experience the game again together with the community - as it is best enjoyed.
---
And here i was, thinking about what i am overlooking that a veteran player clutters his castbar like that. :D
---
The shadowbolt in the middle of the castbar really got me thinking
---
I have so many sick hours saved up. I‚Äôm trying so hard not to burn any of them because I‚Äôm trying to not act like this game is gripping me!
---
I spent all this week writing a plot summary to a book idea I had.  I was planning on writing the first few chapters over the weekend, but... I mean... those Troggs aren't going to kill themselves, you know!
---
Yep.
---
Yes, a GM's method of confirming. You are not a GM.
---
There are doubtless other methods a GM uses in addition to "You there, bro?" and unlike you, a GM has a number of abilities and player controls they can use to confirm their suspicion.
---
I don't see you as any sort of crusader.
---
Your precious time would be better spent playing the game, imo. It seems however that you've made "catch the afk'er" a game of its own.
---
Let me ask you this. If I install remote desktop on my phone, then go to my daughter's "meet the teachers event" today, and move occasionally to keep myself logged in for the hour to hour and a half it's going to take, but don't respond to **you**, some random scrub walking by demanding my attention, does that mean I deserve some GM up my ass? Am I not allowed to play the game remotely? Am I not allowed to dictate how much attention and time I spend in game?
---
What if I decide not to move? Just pop a LifeTap or Demon Skin from time to time?
---
What if some kid is home from school, sitting in his room, doing their homework, or sketching or multitasking in some fashion, and doing those same actions? What if they're just chilling and chatting with their guild? Along comes some rando who demands their attention like some "let me speak to your manager" Karen. This was literally me in High School. How people spend their time in game, really their business.
---
You're wasting GM time having to read your B.S. tickets and reports.
---
&gt;Fuck these guys using the bots to inflate the queues.
---
The statement implies intent. The intent to inflate queues. While the inflation of queues may be a consequence, it's just a bunch of folks, like you and me, who already did their time in the queue, and would like to be able to take a break without having to worry that they may not get a chance to play again for another day or two.
---
In my case? I queued up in my car with my phone's hotspot before I even left work yesterday. 45-50min travel time, got home, plugged in, 2.5 hours later, still in queue. I didn't get to play last night. Am I pissed that some small fraction of the population is afk'ing? Not at all. They did their time. They got in. More power to them, and godspeed.
---
They aren't trying to shit on me, they're just getting theirs. They aren't the asshole here. 
---
I'd like to say this attitude and viewpoint won't make you any friends, But I tell you what, there are plenty of people in this world - I'm sure you'll find some folks who are just as vindictive that agree.
---
Rattlegore baby, low pop in the early early mornings, low/medium throughout the day, high/full at night.
---
Maybe I will!
---
don‚Äôt listen to him, you can stay inside if you want.
---
You mail them via mailbox in towns. Usually near the inn. Recipes can be learnt from trainers - first journeyman, then expert, ask a guard in capital for directions. Some recipes drop, you can check ‚Äúrecipes‚Äù/blacksmithing section on AH to see if there‚Äôs anything you might like.
---
Would have been better if you made Warlocks the Heart ring guy, the most useless of the rings.... not anywhere close to the others.
---
He's a frost mage, so he's able to gather up a bunch of non-spellcasting/ranged enemies into a small group and then use his chill/slowing effects and his AoE to kill them all at the same time.
---
It's mana intensive, but the payoff of being able to kill multiple (10+) in one go is worth it.
---
Also, Joana was around 4d20h, Jokerd is probably going to hit 60 around 3d.
---
Worth
---
In TBC they put Kael as the one actually working for KJ which makes him a villain, while Illidan was just hiding from his former boss.
---
God damn it Todd Howard not again!
---
thanks for the answer, i'll just sunder away then :D
---
You think you do, but you don‚Äôt.
---
I agree with all of this. My main is almost always a druid (and my alt is always a warlock), and I opt for engineering to get the jumper cables.
---
As long as I can role play a cargo vessel captain, mine ores, do shady deals, etc id be happy
---
Same! Ended up being a fantastic idea. So many people got tired of waiting in queues on high pop servers they rolled into servers like Rattlegore. Great server so far!
---
It's not better. Do you find it better? Sure, that's very possible. Is "it better"? No. Every single MMORPG dies for the same reason: People get bored of it. The same will happen to classic. And that's OK.
---
Nah. This isn't happening. I could see them adding stuff like name changes and server transfers, but you won't see a cash shop with mounts.
---
i kind of want to switch servers but im lvl 15 i really dont wantnto do it again :( someone please help me i need help
---
‚ÄúVery kindly reminder her‚Äù hahaha that‚Äôs the funnest thing I‚Äôve heard all day.
---
It's ok if it's not for you. But many of us have been playing in private servers for years. It's not just nostalgia.
---
Now look at that picture and tell me which person has the biggest smile on their face.
---
how many mobs do you think you need to pull? aoe is pretty weak, so pulling extra is just making more work for little gain.
---
I never suggested that I did. But it's pretty simply in the very descriptive names that are used for Need/Greed/Pass. 
---
Need implies that you NEED it.  
---
Greed implies that you want it for greedy / monetary purposes.   
---
Pass means that you dont need it nor do you want to sell it.   
---
Finding a BoE isnt the same as finding a bag of gold, as you cannot equip a bag of gold, but you can equip a BoE.
---
I was giving my vision, knowing if I impose choices on myself it won't be fun and I won't last long. 
---
Have fun then ! Good luck !
---
I played around with the Android remote desktop viewer yesterday and it worked decently. I had to do a few things to make it more manageable (turned on click to move, left-click to interact, auto-loot as well as enable the windows accessible keyboard) but I was able to level several characters through their starting zones up to level 8 or so.
---
Granted this was over Wi-Fi (my pc is downstairs), but I used it this morning at work (to check queue times) over LTE network and there didn't seem to be much delay at all.
---
You lost me at requesting a refund.. da fuq
---
I rolled a warrior when I played vanilla. Had no clue what I was getting into. They are, by far, the hardest class to level and farm with. No real AOE, no CC, no "oh shit" escape ability, no way to heal up other than eat/first aid.
---
Playing a mage in classic and holy shit the difference is incredible.
---
That said, warrior is fun as fuck in endgame when you do raid tanking or PVP when decked out with epics. You gotta pay for it though when you do 1-60.
---
Hi, /u/philthy144

I need to stop watching shit like this, I can‚Äôt stop flip flopping between classes because they all have something unique and fun.
---
I almost rerolled at 12 too. Stick it out to 16 first. Your 12-16 sucks bad bc you don't have any bear skills. It gets better.
---
Thank you for sharing this.
---
This is how I feel for the most part.  I've been on PvP servers since I started in TBC, but once i experienced being able to turn it off with warmode,  I seriously considering swapping to a PvE realm for classic. I do hope planned world PvP events happen occasionally on a PvE server though. I assume city raids do sometimes at least.
---
yeah sorry my bad wording
---
Damn it all I'm going to do for 20min tonight is UI related now haha
---
Where did you find all the classic versions of the addons? I might copy yours mostly....
---
In short, the idea is to centralize your screen. Think of it like your car dashboard. The important information is available at a glance, and the rest is hidden; you need to know how much gas you have in your tank, but you only need to check your oil once every few months.
---
Smite is always available. Heal is always available. These are your oil. You use them all of time, but they also (should) always be in use and available. Abilities with CDs are your gas. They allow you to speed up or slow down, and it's easier to glance down slightly from your character than it is to tilt your head down and check bars at the bottom of your screen.
---
Likewise, it's easier to glance to the left or right and view your and upper target's health bars than it is to look in the top left corner.
---
The idea, ultimately, is to focus all of the information that you deem as necessary in the center of your screen.
---
I'm a level 20 human Rogue. 
---
Your a dead undead man! 
---
different server :(((
---
No because the ports used for WoW are only seen in my home firewall. Not my work firewall. Also I‚Äôm using google RDP so it‚Äôs a different port than 3389.
---
Are rogues only sought after for raids/pvp?? Are they good for farming mobs for levels? Just curious because I honestly haven‚Äôt seen many rogues on my server, however, it is a normal server opposed to PVP.
---
It reaaaaaally depends. I worked in a bank and never have become an e-mail or had to talk to the security department. Maybe its different in smaller companies ü§î
---
I could have taken the whole week and another day next week, but then I'd get roasted by my family for taking no time of for christmas. . . .
---
Omg op please deliver! I want xperl in classic so bad!
---
fucking nerds
---
No, while people are nostalgic, a large number are playing it because it is in our opinion the superior WoW. Retail WoW is for casuals imo. It holds your hand and people only care about end game. 
---
Classic is about the long journey of leveling up, not being leveled up.
---
You really gonna ignore the contact name? not going to explain this at all?
---
Unable to watch currently.

1. Layering is temporary
---
2. Hopping layers has a cooldown. If he is bypassing that report it. It is a bug.
---
Buddy and I did rfc. Mage kept going afk and a rogue kept offering to sale his wares. Hope to find competent players soon. We finished but it was a chore
---
Yep.  Spend all mana, switch to form while it recharges, switch out to heal.  Very satisfying play pattern.
---
Do yourself a favor and unbind W as your forward movement key. It‚Äôs only going to negatively impact you if you‚Äôre tempted to use it.
---
thanks man. I'm gravitating towards warlock anyways, I like the "flavor" of the class better than other dps classes.
---
You're generally not going to get interaction without cause. If it's just a matter of sharetagging and it happens quickly, that's pretty normal.
---
It's not really "dungeon finder" because there's a lot that can be seen there, such as groups that steal and you can see those people again.
---
ngl its kinda cute to assume everyone is american considering how small portion of actual americans there is in the world  330 million out of 7.7+ billion
---
Yes, this. I bind the raid markers to my numpad, makes tanking a breeze.
---
Might have all week off next week 
---
But...might also have no power/internet for a week.
---
‚ÄúI should take a break, but I don‚Äôt want to requeue. Might as well keep playing‚Äù
---
So tired of seeing this guys face. Also that manga hoe.

Try to get your hands on the slowest 2hander for SoC procs. You want 3% hit in prot and maybe the raw stats the first row of holy gives
---
Question - what would be a better Horde choice for Hunter? Troll for + bow skill, or Orc for + pet damage?
---
I vaguely remember being involved with this feature. You're welcome :-P
---
Why level prot when you can dish out more damage leveling as arms? The survivability you're getting from the prot tree is basically negligible
---
Stopped reading at the first sentence, night elf rogue. I may have not played in years, but fuck the alliance.
---
Wait.. They removed talent trees??
---
Is that a thing like LoL and RuneScape lol?
---
Not all heroes wears capes.
---
Some are just dead boi helping our bois in red.
---
I've read around that the best way to level is Arms until the late 20s, then you go to 2h fury because of talents like Enrage. But with whirlwind axe you can just as well stay Arms for sweeping strikes and Axe spec. As long as you don't go dual wield or Prot
---
It's a gnome guys, chill.
---
If Blizzard put a mechanic into the game, then using it can't be called "abusing". It's their own fault for not implementing layering properly.
---
Yeah, I've turned everything down. The whole bonfire/mist framedrops seem to have been introduced in Legion what I can tell with some quick googling. Shame they didn't use the 1.12 client...
---
I plan to level a second character very slowly. Can I start him in the starting zone or do I have to move him to an inn to start getting rested xp?
---
I'm going mining + herbalism
---
Rapid swap those detection while running aimlessly looking for mobs
---
Mad money boys!!!! Can always switch over to engineer or tailor or alchemy once I have my epic horse...
---
US realms go to kurinnaxx never a queue even at peak hours so far. All ranged is fun but locks and Hunter deal with more inventory issues due to soul shards and ammo
---
Meanwhile Asmon closed his stream last night admitting is was boring as fuck because all he's doing is grinding the same instances over and over.

Golemagg is cancer 12k queue atm

My personal healing addon preference is VuhDo. It's simple enough to configure and I really like how it works.

Is this the original text? I'm sure it is, but this is crazy accurate in the context we know lol.

Thank you random dwarf!

I'll remember this when we raid Stormwind and camp the flight master.
---
I‚Äôve been jumping in the water since Nam.  You are a saint.
---
Varg was saying "It's a Hunter's Weapon" as a joke.
---
On top of what everyone has said, when you are that far ahead you have literally no competition for anything, the world ahead is empty, every mob is yours.
---
Man...  gotta say Skeram was one of the biggest let downs. We were told by blizz we should get off herod and move to stalagg to avoid queues. Then they said stalagg was getting full and to swtich to the new server Skeram... now I'm still waiting in queue haha. Love my serve, but damn if it doesn't feel like a slap in the face.
---
Hey, it‚Äôs not a game for all. It might not be your thing. It‚Äôs definitely a grind but that‚Äôs part of what I enjoy out of it, it‚Äôs challenging. You‚Äôve got to also consider you‚Äôre at the beginning part of the game, you‚Äôre performing the most basic tasks and it is going to be extremely easy for anyone to do. Things start changing when you start introducing professions, dungeons, raiding, PvP,  etc. I enjoy running through the world and exploring. I‚Äôll sacrifice some time to avoid being spoonfed information/ported to wherever I need to go.
---
I had a hunter pull nearly every time in sfk last night. I told him to let me pull, this was reiterated by other group members, and he said "it's a 15 year old game it's not rocket science", and then persisted to pull.
---
Thankfully the other group members were ok and the healer was great.
---
Toxic charity!
---
True, but you dont know when the market will be stable. Better ride the early wave and sell at the market prices imo.
---
The game itself really opens up at 10, I‚Äôll give it to ya that it‚Äôs a bore 1-10 but you can get that process down to 3 hours.  Afterwards it‚Äôs whatever you want, questing, dungeons, pvp, crafting.
---
For me I tried out retail this morning at level 1 (Same class, Same race) after putting roughly 24 hours into classic and I‚Äôm almost sad to say I prefer retail.  The smoothness, QoL upgrades, the feel, the only thing that sucks is the lack of social interaction.
---
Hey no problem, i mean tbh, at first i kept looking at the radar and chit, for the arrow to follow, and thought lets try this reading thing everyone is talking about lol, and yea i'm loving the option to to do i that way is all.

Unfortunately i don't know the name of the addon, but a couple poscasts i listen to mentioned they use one and works, i'm sure you'll find it, and may your feet find good trails. Enjoy!

&gt;if he‚Äôs bypassing it that report it, it is a bug

We reported these bugs in beta, but received the exact same answer.
---
and how about for DPS? I can't imagine I'd ever fully plan on being a healer or Tank. I'm still a really lol Lvl due to the Que time so I'm only Lvl 13.
---
I love the Lore and look of the Druids but I've heard from people while playing that Druids don't really get picked for Raids much?
---
I'm also tempted to roll Shaman but again I'd like to know if it's a good option for doing Raids and PvP.
---
Idk it's still on trions site so I'm wary but given they just hired Jake song [archeages daddy from before the game sucked] I really really wanna believe

I thought enrage was just good because of the /sit macro?

WoW Classic:  Slowly undoing all the progress made by Pokemon GO
---
You should also touch up on the "everyone only rolls for their role" thing that people love to spread around.  It's obviously good to communicate if you're entering the group as a healing druid that you communicate that you will need on feral gear, but for leveling dungeons below BRD I'd say it should be *expected* that a healing or tanking druid will need on kitty loot, and should even have the same prio as a rogue. The person who is tanking or healing the dungeon is doing the group a favor by doing that instead of their true leveling spec and should be allowed roll on the gear that they actually came for, the gear that will help them quest and level.
---
Yup, not much has changed since then. Still just as effective today.
---
Why are you here?
---
So my current strategy for leveling my Paladin is to go in Ret until I get Seal of Command and Pursuit of Justice, then go Holy until I get Illumination, then go back to Ret. I figure this way I'll be strong when I need to be solo or duo, but I can also be a top-notch healer in dungeons.
---
I played a Pally in vanilla, but that was 14-15 years ago. What do you folks think of this plan? I like the way my talents look with this spread at 60, it does seem to give me the best of both worlds.
---
People have been playing it on private Servers for the past 12 years. So it has to have some Appeal.
---
I feel like you didn't give it the shot it deserves as you only got to Level 4!! The 4 fastest Level out of all 60. 
---
I like that you gave it a shot and if you don't like it it is your right to have that opinion :)
---
I like that you actually have the Feeling of being in your own world.
---
You have to run distances which actually feel like you have run it because it takes time. You are slower in killing things and you don't get 6 quests which are all in the same cave which you can finish all together within 5minutes.
---
They rather send you there 3 times with one quest each time :D
---
You don't get everything handed to you which - I can totally understand that btw - for People that only know modern games (especially WoW) and have never experienced something like Classic in the past - can come over as tedious and annoying.
---
I just love it :)
---
Hey thanks for giving it a shot. If you ever feel like it try a different class/race and try the quests there. But it won't Change from mainly having to run around, kill stuff, collect stuff and repeat. 
---
Besides Professions maybe but you have to actually Play the game a bit in order to get there.
---
You also have to Play a bit in order to feel the character progression
---
Hope you reported him...
---
I have had a really shit week and little things please little minds, I thank you so much for making me chuckle this afternoon with this clip ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Warrior goes 
---
1 str= 2 attack power
---
2 agi=1 attack power plus higher crit chance 
---
Dps warrior should prioritize as such
---
Strength 
---
Attack power 
---
Agi 
---
Haste 
---
Stam
---
Yeah, that's the best. I know I wrote an english essay about it at the time, how all the "internet anonymous people evil yadda yadda" can be easily proven wrong with a scenario like this where random people can literally not communicate and will still do cool stuff for no other reason than feeling good about helping and interacting!
---
Got me the best mark üëå
---
Unless you believe people are irrational, if they are doing it a certain way it means it is working for them. If you don't like it, you can vote by not buying. If most people agree with you, they will stop.
---
Time travel almost always makes me check out of a story.
---
You have to understand that an option you're unwilling to take is still an option.
---
It's fine that you're unwilling to take any given option, too, but don't act like that option isn't there because you made the decision not to take it.
---
How am I defending Blizzard? I'm merely advocating for making the best out of a bad situation and finding ways around the problem that doesn't make the bad situation worse...
---
Defending Blizzard would require me to claim the situation isn't bad, which I'm not doing.
---
You complain about queues being a problem, yet consider it a solution when people contribute to the queues by finding ways not to get kicked out when they're not playing the game.
---
Makes perfect sense.
---
The most hilarious part is that you're now using the solution I offered in my initial comment on this thread, so why are we even still having a discussion?
---
We basically agree on what the best option is, since that's the option we're both using. That doesn't mean other options don't exist, though.
---
is hillabrad really better?
---
I invited someone after I tagged Hogger and they got the quest item
---
I did that with my wife. Main is a warrior but she wanted to druid so I made an alt druid strictly to play with her. That way we can quest together, I know exactly the skills, talents, gear etc she needs, and I don't feel like I have to wait up on my main.
---
For how long is she grounded?
---
I literally checked to make sure I wasn't in the photo. Literally happened last night.
---
Zoom
---
Last night I was farming some silver for training, and was in a lowbie area (hey I was only level 7). I would randomly DoT on mobs to help speed up people's killing time. Warlock help is kinda fun!
---
I am indeed the same dwarf.
---
Holy shit, I died 12 times to get 1 fcking liver. This quest so sad tho lol
---
Jealous? Literally millions of people are playing Classic. And it's the more authentic version. What is there to be jealous of?
---
not at all. I think it's a market manipulation attempt, hoping to drive up prices of other blues that they can start selling in a month or two. 
---
this will probably end up selling for 200g down the road. He's just gotta list fees.
---
Onslaught said it would take about 4 full days for 60, then with focus on getting rag.
---
I am seeing a lot of names and language that is going to get a lot of people temp bans.  For some reason people think Vanilla was the wild west with no moderation, but racial slurs, inappropriate names/guild names all got dealt with.  I've been temp banned multiple times for inappropriate names and guild names, and interestingly enough I stopped getting those bans after Wrath.
---
The game will be there when you get back. I wouldn't even hesitate about choosing a vacation over WoW.
---
Shoulda made the Warlock the "Heart" one.
---
What? I'm talking about during leveling and going out and farming mats at max level, azeroth was a ghost town during tbc other than the cities. Everyone would farm in tbc during end game and with flying you could just run away any time you were about to engage in pvp. Projecting? That was reality dude, did you even play tbc?
---
Idk, I may be in the minority here, but I feel like he is perfectly within his rights to charge for his guides. It's obvious he put an enormous amount of effort into them, why is everyone so upset that he wants you to pay a tiny fee to access his years of work?
---
There's literally hundreds of other free guides everyone can use, he used to charge for his guides back in the day, and he told everyone ahead of time what his intentions were.
---
So we can level efficiently. It's not a legit question.
---
It's Attack Power, actually.
---
Druids (and Paladins, Shaman and Warriors) gain 2 melee AP per point of Strength, Rogues and Hunters only 1.
---
Cat-specced Feral Druids and Rogues (and lower-level Hunters) will find Agility generally more useful on leather gear. It only gives 1 melee AP but also increases Crit and Dodge Chance (for all classes, but Rogue and Druid get bonus Crit and Dodge). Rogues and Warriors also get 1 ranged AP from Agility, Hunters 2 ranged AP.
---
Bear-specced Feral Druids, however, have less use for Agility because Agility only gives them melee AP when in Cat Form.
---
Thanks sir
---
God that trogg overrun quarry was cancer. Thank god for the warrior and warlock I ended up grouping with. I love Classic
---
Randoms invite him to their layer
---
*Is there really no US server withoiut queue ? started playing two days ago (EU) never ever was only 1 min in a queue... even on primetime...*
---
What a beautiful story. I hope it comes true.
---
It didn't help. Incendius still had 6k queue, Grobbulus had 3k.
---
No one said it made sense. We did the same on gorgannash and dragonmaw
---
His guide was catered to speed ruining the leveling process to do it as quick as possible. Other than that idk.
---
The key to warrior leveling is to invite a dps that's on the same quest as you. They feel safer and kill things while you get punched in the face.
---
All the classes are fun and unique in their own way. I recommend to go with a race / class combo that looks fun to you personally and just figure it out as you go along. Exploring and learning the game is where Classic truly shines.
---
typical alliance pug group
---
I know haha
---
PvP servers probably are the most fun because World PvP is a thing and that can be inanely fun. I wouldn't be discouraged as there's plenty of players who are new to it as well, I'd say just jump in and enjoy the ride.
---
You have to use macros. Put (Rank X) after the spell name.
---
&gt;started the que as quickly as i could. Only 11k people so i had a really good chance to get to play
---
You know it's gonna be an interesting read when you have this at the beginning.
---
They were not fixed because they were just duplicated in the clip I linked.
---
What is your logic here?
---
If rearranged, your handle can spell "Rakenung." That's kinda like Reckoning - the subject of your comment.
---
2 seconds later....  
---
Your skill in Polearms increases to 2!  
---
Your skill in Polearms increases to 3!  
---
Your skill in Polearms increases to 4!  
---
Your skill in Polearms increases to 5!  
---
Your skill in Polearms increases to 6!..........
---
This is more fun and engaging than those insane mount chains from Legion amd BFA.
---
Fucking Diabolical
---
Probably quite a lot. It's not like anyone can afford to retire before 70 these days.
---
Fuck yes a warhammer dwarf guild in wow fuck yes for grimnir
---
It's challenging, but you do make progress and it feels like you're actually progressing. Not like retail where you fly through levels/rewards super duper quick and it would just feel your handed everything.
---
At this point in time the game is also just more simplier  retail version, less stuff going on. Makes it great to get into for the first time imo.
---
I'd highly suggest it, if you like mmorpgs. This kinda paved the gateway and defined what mmorpgs are.
---
I want to say thank you for the druid recommendation. I'm already have a much better time on it at level 8 than the warrior I rolled at launch. Just waiting on getting to the feral spells.
---
"I have leveled through all 3 expansions"
---
Lol at this.
---
Have you ever heard of multiboxing? What about one person playing in the spot for 5 or more?
---
Ban? hahhahah yeaaaaah, like they never banned multiboxers or even afkers in AV.
---
We have different interpretations of what offensive and appropriate means.
---
Kill one mob? Possible. Kill two mobs? Just with potions, kill three mobs? Prayers to god
---
parkour!
---
I don't. Any one time fee would be more than fine, but charging monthly is just scummy.
---
I made that journey on my main back in TBC. Fond memories of the sense of adventure and getting killed by the crocs
---
It's good without /sit macro cheese, it has 2 purposes
---
1) adds an additional swing occasionally to your prot pally for some extra aggro or dps or whatever
---
2) is used in drawn out pvp fights, where you generally heal/sustain/support and when you get 5 stacks, go run up and ultra-slap them
---
the second use is much more powerful and impactful
---
Yup having the same stuff.. very short flicker / 1 sec freeze about 1-2 every 2 hours
---
out of the 3 it was the only mid, the other two were high. the only option!
---
You don‚Äôt enter pvp zones per se until around 20. So you will have some time to learn the game a little. However, once people get to certain levels they might come around those areas just to gank you, which really stinks, but more often than not doesn‚Äôt last to long once they get bored. Also joining a guild would be a good idea, people are willing to come help you if you are getting attacked by the opposing faction. It‚Äôs my favorite part of the game.
---
It doesn't always work. Hasn't happened for me for instance.
---
Time Hiest
---
Extremely stable for most people. Some disconnection issues here and there but it's improving as the server load stabilizes, other than that it's been pretty smooth sailing for almost everyone.
---
Should be crossposted to r/heroin
---
I did a few times it's not for everyone
---
The 5% hp isnt much. The added axe spec for an Orc tank will help a lot with threat. On boss monsters, that 5 extra will cut glancing blows from 35% to 15%, allowing dps to dps harder and healers to heal for less time. This is highly min max, but thats my 2 cents.
---
Yeah, I contemplated to get up at 4 yesterday, but I slept in to 05:30... then I realised how crazy this is to get up in the early morning to play a game. Zero regrets though!
---
I prefer to pretend everything after Vanilla, starting with TBC never happened. Vanilla is the one true story line and TBC was the beginning of the end. I really hope Blizzard makes an alternate story life if they keep classic going
---
Hunter weapon
---
Yeah you‚Äôre right man. I just feel like I‚Äôm 14 again, it‚Äôs so crazy. I haven‚Äôt felt this way about a game since I first play wow.
---
Such loot much wow! You're taking role playing to the next level :D
---
Okay, I've read every single comment, and I'll try to be as unbiased as I can.
---
If you want to report the guild name, go ahead, BUT I don't think it's worth it unless the guild members themselves show racist manners. Maybe they picked that name ironically, and they are the exact opposite of racists!
---
For example, my country has suffered tenths of military coups, which obviously caused thousands of deaths, but that doesn't mean we can't make jokes about it or ironical references.
---
I understand the fact that you feel upset, but if I were you, I would report them only if they are racist or violent towards other players.
---
Good luck and have fun!
---

Eh, those people aren't worth playing with anyway. After a month, most of the tourists will have given up and the rest of us remaining will be serious about the game. That and there won't be any queues.

In RS you had to read where to go. 
---
In classic you have to read where to go
---
I have waited a total of 40 minutes since release. 35 minutes on Monday and 5 on Tuesday, none since. Westfall has been pretty decent so far. Tons of people everywhere I go and no queues.
---
I had a 6k queue on Incendius and a 3k queue on Grobbulus last night after work. I gave up and went to play something else.
---
I got my tailoring from 45-130 at level 10 just from making bags for people with their mats. It‚Äôs the perfect profession launch

If you don't want people to look like clowns, Tmog is not the way to do it.  Slutmogs and people looking stupid in mismatched joke items is pretty common.
---
Had that landed he would have prob kept chasing you lol
---
No, blizzard did PvP servers right. Your quests will be in friendly neighborhoods for awhile, once you start moving towards neutral areas is when will likely start seeing members of the opposing faction and even then most won't bother to PvP because they are likely questing too. But when PvP does start normally reinforcements from both sides will show up so you may or may not get curbstomped then but you should be ok for awhile.
---
I drive-by everyone. Don't even look at the class lol..
---
I've legit never seen a horde in RR
---
Same same
---
2 hour, 12 hour, 24 hour I believe. Make sure you're not putting it on 2 hour (a lot of AH addons have the times wrong so don't even use em, just use the normal AH tab for selling stuff).
---
KromCrush - do it
---
I've had several times more people watch my warrior die after a second mob ambushes me than those that helped me
---
Please keep being an amazing person
---
I was half asleep and didn't realize there was a THIRD farmstead that I had to go to.  It kept saying "East" so I was just sitting in the middle one.  Oy.  I missed Vanilla so much haha
---
100% no dude. There is virtually zero world PVP until you get many, many hours into the game. The community is extremely friendly and great for beginners. Tell people you're brand new to WoW, and I'm sure most will love to help you out. As for race and class - pick whatever appeals to you, don't worry about min-maxing. Have fun and good luck!
---
Yeah I think the talents max out at like 15% more, can‚Äôt remember if any tier sets help
---
Also a warrior can pull, they can use bows and guns.
---
Questing in Elwynn Forest last night. Looking for the Jasper mine. I told the guy I had met an hour prior that we needed to head east to the tower then north to the mine. He asked what questing addon I was using. "I read the quest text" His response was "oh, I didn't even think of that"
---
Joining a guild is your best bet. The classic community within guilds is currently the best part for me. Everyone just wants to have a good time!
---
Ye it does
---
Daaaaamn how long have you been at your company?  Mine gives 23 days, but I only got 19 since I came on full time in February.  Still, not bad.
---
Without getting too into it, major corporations/franchises put profits ahead of literally everything else.  Anything they can do to squeeze out an extra miniscule percentage of profit, it has really wrecked havoc on the wellbeing of their employees.
---
Grob Mob, represent!
---
I think this is my favorite post on this site
---
 You'll be fine. Just hit the grind hard once u get back.
---
In my opinion new expansions should be an entirely different game. Where they reset you back to lv 1 and you make you way forward to level 60. I feel like expansion fragments is alright but it doesn't really adhere to the world really well. That's why there are so many harsh transitions.   
---
Imagine BC coming out and there was a giant planet instead of just 5 different zones. That would be awesome.   
---
Just an opinion.
---
Actually I think the traffic is encrypted with TLS (as in, once the connection is successfully established, the packets' content is transfered in ciphertext). 
---
But as /u/DoverBoys said, this does not prevent your employer from knowing you're communicating with the blizzard servers because that part is not encrypted. The internet would simply not work if the IPs (source and destination) themselves were ciphered
---
What classic caster player and american policeman have in common? They both yell "Stop resisting" at an enemy.

---
Yesterday I had an 8 hour queue. Today I logged in a bit earlier and it looks like it'll end up being only 5-6 hours.
---
Didn't check BIOS version -- I'll have to add that to the list.
---
I can see where you might regard your wife as a bit inconsiderate for this. Most likely she doesn‚Äôt fully understand the importance of ‚Äúa video game‚Äù and just kind of... forgot. She‚Äôs probably excited about the BBQ and stuff. In my opinion, you should go OP. Not just to simply maintain the relationship with your wife, but also because if you don‚Äôt go she will blame WoW and resent the game, which is just going to cause you problems later down the road. If that happens she could intentionally find ways to keep you from the game in the future. Of course idk anything about you or your wife, so take my advice with a grain of salt and use your better judgement. Just my 2¬¢.
---
Titsandass is allowed too.
---
Hahaha. Man I wish they would do a new timeline. Like make an expansion for after this that is something new. Idk, I just don‚Äôt want to go back to the type of retail we have now.
---
I always pop Fortitude on the pet, plus a shield or renew if it's in combat.
---
Really like his pre launch vids.
---
Joker is a known account sharer, he did it on silver hand when the realm first opened. If you watch his logout switch too, you‚Äôll see him offline and then immediately come back online. Very obvious
---
How is this preachy? It's a dude sharing his experience and perspective. It's what makes this sub actually good rather than a repetitive jumble of "Lol I got the name Thex IAMA."
---
Gave up trying to get into classic yesterday so I decided to dick around in retail and make a new pally. Completely forgot about the chopper til I saw someone roll by me on it. Haven't played retail in like 2 years. Seeing the lvl range in ghostlands surprised me too.
---
That's why as a warlock I just debuff mobs at the start of a fight, then wand for a while and if something needs to die fast, only then I even touch my shadowbolt.
---
I think I'm 11 right now...looks like I get to do that at 12.
---
...but those action bars. Yikes
---
it's not as much the distance as much as it is the blurriness of the text
---
it was *medium iirc
---
Lol, I'm not even 15 yet, and I'm thinking about taking the weekend to recover.
---
Druids cant use polearms in Vanilla right?
---
You have to realize that low/medium/high are all relative. So a Low server may in fact be relatively healthy compared to the places like Herod. I can second Kromcrush as a decent server that has minimal queues (1-2k in the evening).
---
I'm not a pussy and I have a thick skin. But thank you for the advice. You are a shining example of what can be accomplished when someone is trying to win the asshole of the year award. You certainly have my vote.
---
And for the record I'm not offended. I just believe that racist degenerates have no place in society. Additionally guild names like this are against the T&amp;C of the game and should be reported.
---
Watched the clip. He hopped once, what's the problem here.
---
Try OnTopReplica.
---
You can create a window of another tab or program that will sit over top of WoW and can watch YT or Netflix or porn, whatever while on your crusade to 60.
---
I used it before I got a second monitor.
---
To be fair, if they kept the leveling in retail wow at the rate it was in vanilla/classic, it would take literally a year for most players to hit the current expansion. There's no way there would be enough players to fill out the old expansions.
---
Nice! I love the hue lights but they are so damned expensive.  The normal RGB Bulbs are $50 a pop and the app functionality is not particularly there.  Other than the price tag this looks really cool though.
---
i hope they come back
---
IO score under 1600?  Yea you can't be invited to this +8 you fucking idiot
---
Is that a horse? Sloth!!!!
---
Well I ran it an hour and a half before I had to be at work, so I guess there was a deadline...
---
Awh it‚Äôs so peaceful in the barrens
---
Are they publishing their progress anywhere, other than just twitch streams? I would be interested in keeping an eye on that. Method doesn't seem to be following them at all.
---
When the top comment spirals into some kinda pig-latin... ;)   
---
^^wish ^^I ^^new ^^other ^^languages ^^...
---
Oh I agree 100%
---
Leveling in general is a complete joke in WoW compared to something like classic EverQuest
---
I mean here you can level solo, no group required. That automatically makes it a fairly trivial endeavor, if tedious
---
Thy white knight
---
In 4 weeks this dude will be 60 lbs lighter and pimping out his wife and underage daughter for his next hit.
---
Yeah give it a try. I don't use Clique so IDK if that has something to do with it, and I've never use HB. The raid frames have always been more than enough for me, but hopefully it works out for you.(then again I don't bind my spells to right click either, left click works fine for me but to each their own /shrug)
---
Lol I have the problem of tanks thinking its retail and pulling a huge group of mobs when I have 0 mana.
---
Indeed, only way to play with an ultrawide.
---
How the F do you have 1g to burn already?
---
You can shift click any abilty from your spellbook into a macro
---
lol you should be able to roll need on any item in the game, but piss enough people off by doing that and youll find it tough to find groups
---
OG -&gt; zep to gromgol-&gt; duskwood -&gt; elwynn forest would have been faster lol
---
Well you can still see stuff ding
---
Which server?
---
Like the picture, but not title.
---
You sir, know your inns.
---
Thanks haha, my trick to funding it was hitting up the AH each time I log in and buying all light leather that's less than 27c ea. You can make it into Embossed Leather Boots at that price and sell to vendor for a profit. With 20+ stacks of light leather it adds up quick!
---
After playing since launch i'm only level 10 lol
---
It is never too late. My rogue is 30 and I am starting a mage today!
---
Yup.
---
Went from lazy -&gt; dead in &lt; week.  Classic struggles.
---
Cataclysm is pretty much where the story of the game jumped the shark. It's the expansion that made Thrall - someone who almost EVERYONE LIKED - into an annoying Mary Sue that no one liked because the story was just about him, and how only green jesus can save us all. Plus, making Thrall marry some no name Orc they created specifically for him to marry because Metzen was against Thrall and Jaina forming a relationship still kind of makes me salty to this day, haha.
---
So you went through the effort to find the new server announcement, but not the one right before that where they talk about why they're not allowing server transfers... yet.
---
What do you mean? Everyone gets screwed by remote queuers.
---
Nothing is p2w and it's all stuff that's exclusive. Nothing in it can be earned by playing the game. It's no different than the stuff people get with the Collectors Editions or for going to Blizzcon.
---
Why not enjoy the place during the day and play at night?
---
Shhhhhhhh
---
How‚Äôd you get that! Grats btw
---
Number 1 is shoot
---
On Delta gryphon lines,  you sit at the flight master for an hour, then you start losing armor along the way
---
It must be more safe to use Linux when queuing for WoW haha! :D
---
Perhaps, but that doesn't mean that retail isn't an entirely inaccessible, eldritch, confusing mess of a stiched-together corpse nowadays. And of course the solution is "buy a level boost".
---
Im calling them stubby or stubbs
---
its also just a numbers thing at this point, there are soooo many people playing that you're less likely to run into that one prick. That said being toxic when you're stuck on a server is just not gonna get you far, so people are less likely to be that one prick.
---
If you are having the time of your life from playing WoW classic then it is clearly you who is over-fucking-reacting.
---
I feel way behind just being level 18 haha
---
I'm not good with that behaviour, but as far as I know, so far, there has not been any report of such behavior by any member of that guild.
---
Nice congrats. Just got to 15 myself last night. Thinking of taking a vacation end of September or early October to try and get to or close to max lvl
---
I've just tested it, it looks really slick but the customization options are incredibly limited. I can't even change the shape of my action bars ? I mean I'm fine with most of the UI I'd mostly want to change my action bars shape and have a secondary chat on the right side mirrored with the first chat. If that's possible then I'm sold!
---
I love your UI. Got any tips on setting up SUF in that way?
---
Some warrior refused to group and went on to tag everything he could he had 4 vultures on him he died sharpish.
---
I stood on his corpse and killed all 4 1 by one while he whispered me to rez him.
---
I hope he learned a valuable lesson that day
---
Think about that sweet rested xp you will have.
---
Dang. I'm sorry man. Just /roll before the boss fight, if it's odd they'll drop for you. Its 100% science.
---
Mine was like 1.8 or 1.9 or some IIRC. I may be wrong though. When I get home from work(6 hours) I'll let you know
---
I'll check it out, I love customization.
---
This is so accurate! Had a conversation with my SO before work about how she thought I was losing interest in her. NO BABY CLASSIC WOW IS OUT!
---
In spirit I agree, but without the majority of the player base being of this mindset long-term how does Blizzard square that from a business perspective? I hope that at some point they set up a server subscription and let people have their own communities. This way everyone can go where they are most comfortable and rewarded.
---
Keep it up!
---
His guide is shit compared to the 500 IQ balding gnome tactic of just aoe farming anyways

yeah unfortunately its not like the original modui so if you were looking for that version in this classic you can't get it because hes changed it which sucks
---
Hey man just trying to inform OP that they should do some reading before risking losing something so big like a name. This could have been avoided. Sadly it was not due to carelessness
---
If I may add to this, the World of Warcraft is filled with easter eggs... like the tributes to the departed:  [https://www.wowhead.com/a-guide-to-in-game-memorials](https://www.wowhead.com/a-guide-to-in-game-memorials)
---
Yeah there are real sunrises and sunsets in game that match up to your server time, add in weather effects and turning density up high in the config file makes it a very immersive world of Warcraft
---
True.  I remember grinding to Warlord in PvP (couldn't bear doing it for High Warlord), earning the gear, etc. (also with end game content) and then, I think it was after BC (or with BC) there was a whole slew of purple PvP gear equal to, or slightly better, easily obtainable for everyone.
---
I get not everyone wanted that grind, but those that did do it shouldn't have just been shafted.
---
Holy hell, is there a reason you are sticking to that server and not moving to a lower pop one? I picked one of those servers day 1 and immediately switched to a med pop server so I could actually play.
---
Were in the gotta have it  lnow gaming meta. Everyones in a hurry.
---
Or not being the hero of the story. The later expansions I was a commander and everywhere I went people were saluting me and telling me they need me. In classic I'm a nobody.

I couldn't get a vein for love nor money in Elwynn, took a quick jog through Dun Morogh and the place was coated in them.
---
Can mostly put that down to human seemingly being the most popular race on my server.
---
Sometimes classic wow giveth, and sometimes it taketh.  Today it has giveth!
---
I agree with you but you cant ninja quest items
---
Go for it reroll. If you cant enjoy it, while waste more time? And no, character wont be wasted, after all you can level him to 35 lvl and enjoy free Tailoring/Alchemy or even Leather Working daily craftings (Transmutation/ Mooncloth/ Refined Deeprock Salt).
---
So for a single mob just frontload some damage in the form of a judged seal should be good enough.  You should have ret aura and righteous fury up.  For two you're probably looking at judging target number 2 and autoattacking the primary target.  For three you're looking at the same thing but being ready to stun the first mob that pulls away, which by the way isn't a forgone conclusion if you have enough mitigation to allow your healer to not have to heal you too much.
---
I think it's because there's no mom to put the food directly into the baby's mouth so it seems impossibly hard. It's kinda funny i guess

Sounds like your problem.

Same thing will happen to most classes. Skills are not the cheapest...

They absolutely 100 percent can see the difference in concurrent players between the two. The big question is how long the classic servers continue to out pace expectations.

With my summon and soulstone abilities I get all kinds of groups.

Was someone forcing you to level 11 characters, turbo virgin? If so, you might be a Chinese gold farmer.

What's your ign if you dont mind? Maybe I saw you!
---
I think he might be talking about the scourgestones you collect from the mobs in the plaguelands that can be turned in as a repeatable quest for Argent Dawn Rep? I assume that doing that also gives you exp as well so if you have a whole boatload of them you should be able to get a lot of exp?
---
Other than that I'm not sure what else he could mean.
---
It‚Äôs fine. Yes you‚Äôll get more poison procs with a faster OH but the dps is too good on CB to pass up.

As a new druid player, thank you for this information.

A VIP service..?

Exactly what I thought at first haha
---
Me and a friend had a 2v2 team during TBC with the name &lt;Here for the HKs&gt;

They could just end it after BFA and start all over again

Maybe it‚Äôs not reading comprehension, and more of a shitty attitude. I don‚Äôt jump to the front of the line at restaurants because I don‚Äôt want to be an asshole, maybe i should git gud at rl too.

The barrens covers a huge range.  Depending on what you do, you may leave and come back for level appropriate quests in the south.
---
I‚Äôll hit you with the /hug as you cast your frost bolt at me

Enjoy the rest of your summer break.
---
Probably get downvoted for this but classic wow was a boring slog for me and still is a boring slog. Simplistic unbalanced sleep inducing gameplay. Oh how i wish i could see through your nostalgia goggles.
---
No? Divine Intellect and Healing Light aren't worth it either?
---
Play warcraft 3.  If it wasn't for that game, WoW probably would not exist.  Lots of the lore is laid out in that game specifically.
---
Nice.
---
Huh? I dont really understand your comment on me. I meant that if me and my guild were to reroll, we would loose at least 25% of our members which would be a drag since we now know eachother from hanging on Discord for months
---
oh did thrall just re re retire or die or sum shit
---
Back in the day we used an add-on called Pally Power in raids to help coordinate blessings. I doubt this has been re-made yet, but it wouldn't surprise me if that does happen.
---
Anything that can show you a mana-regen timer would also be useful, but not necessary (I don't actually know, because I'm not using anything yet).

They call it ‚ÄúSpirit‚Äù cause you gotta have spirit to even consider flying with them

Speculation and rumors are different things.
---
thank u man :)
---
Personally as a fresh character i would instantly pick up leather working and skinning as professions to keep up gear up and for two items later before pre-raid stuff. Namely Devilsaur legs and gaunts.
---
For weapons you best options early are to get weapons from questions like Serena bloodfeather and supervisor fizsprocket quests. After that run low level dungeon questions to improve your weapons. Examples are Into the Scarlet Monastery, Baron Aquanis and In the name of light. If you haven't found a better weapon after a couple of levels check your local weapons vendor. This is the big change between retail and classic. You Local weapons vendors do have decent items to get you where you need to go next sometimes. 
---
The key is always accept the higher dps item, then look for agility/spirit then strength and stam. A must is to always upgrade you abilities  and complete rogue quests. These will be vital as you lack heath regen. Lastly carry food and bandages to level smoothly.
---
Honestly I can't think of a higher compliment
---
Counterpoint to this, there was a group forming for RFC in Org (shocking I know) that needed a healer. Being the helpful priest I am and roughly level 16 at the time, I offered my services because life to the living. Homeboy deadass whispers me back with ‚Äúspec?‚Äù. Like what? I‚Äôve got 4 points in spirit tap and wand spec like every other priest üò≠.

this shit is putting me off from playing this game

I logged in early, had to pop out to buy something urgently, baam, 12k ahead of me, whenever iam allowed in I¬¥ll have to go to bed

I for one REALLY want blood elves back as playable race. I started in Cata with a belf hunter and put so much time and effort into her. I started on classic right away wanting some of those memories back, that feeling of watching my character grow, but I can‚Äôt recreate her. 
---
I can‚Äôt make half of my characters in their original glory to go through a new campaign because I mostly used belves and odd class/race combos (female Tauren Priest names Divinecow. Made an undead priest in classic named Divinecorpse to keep the spirit alive at least)
---
I‚Äôm saying that I know the classic canon can‚Äôt allow for belves or draenai to exist yet and i am 1,000% okay with that, however, I do want to see the game get to a point where they can be reintroduced so I can see my most precious hunter in the game again.
---
Also, on the same route, my death knight is the only toon to be named after me (Zellboy) and it wouldn‚Äôt be right to give that name to anyone else at this point.
---
Members used to be a thing when I played actual  osrs...befire it was osrs. So half question there.
---
That would be ideal.
---
Bjarn would be nice if you can find him. but other than that i cant really say
---
Right near the bridge to Duskwood is a great spot for the spider meat!
---
but micro transactions have and always will be about the wales not the average fish. They don't care if 9/10 people don't spend money on MTX when that one person spends more than the other 9 combined they view that as a win. Then they start to cater more towards that one player than the other 9

I made the jaunt from the crossroads to thunderbluff just for The Rake. I didn't have to wait, he was right there when I arrived. Woohoo!

As a developer, this is an easy trap to fall into - your customers ask for a horse, and you give them a horse.
---
It takes a good game designer to be able to engage your users, tell them why those decisions were made, and that changing it the way the players recommend is harmful to the game.
---
I think the problem was that the leads and heads over those areas moved on after TBC or so, and thus you end up with people new to the lead or design position who don't ask themselves why a certain system was designed that way. 
---
Thus when you go in to change it, you think "wow, that seems like a bad design decision from my predecessor". This then slowly strips away meaningful interactions, simplifies the game, and ultimately, removes the fun inherent in the design.
---
I'm not saying Blizz was free from blame. Nor the players. But it's easy to see how these things get implemented over time, when you add time and personnel changes into the equation.
---
Trying to shorten the queue for yourself I see. Well played
---
15-30 minutes I can forgive.... Hours is just wrong.
---
When you‚Äôre the zero wanting to be the hero everything is challenging. Being the hero means you know you‚Äôll win.
---
There are great servers with no queue.  The full realms are just thousands of streamer fanboys trying to follow them around.
---
not really a public service though
---
No it doesn't. In a mirorr, it would read "DTEH" or possibly "DLEH"
---
Gehennas/EU region. Mostly Scandinavians, some Poles, Germans and Greeks the population as far as I have figured out
---
As an ally hunter, the pig farm where you get the quest to go kill princess, is an awesome place. Went there at level 8 and got to 10 grinding boars. During that time I got so much leather and boar meat that skinning, leatherworking, and cooking made it to 75ish.
---
There is a F2P and a subscription, yes. That most definitely isn‚Äôt a microtransaction or cash shop.
---
Leveling a warrior as well (horde though) but I‚Äôm definitely noticing that it‚Äôs more efficient to out level the zone by 1 or 2 levels at least. Same level or higher is very difficult with multiple mobs but manageable with green mobs.
---
I suppose. I didn't even think about it so it's too late now. I do get +8 agi
---
It's a tab next to your character's one
---
I think there are rules about advertising on RP servers.
---
Man how I pwned right after getting Strike off the Hydra...
---
Sounds like you‚Äôll enjoy the warrior more once you get past the leveling. Which is also what I‚Äôm doing.
---
Taking some minor notes from class design through BC/WotLK would go a long way
---
Bummer :( well i wish you luck out there! You will find a healer.
---
It will make healing easier certainly, but all the dungeons can be easily completed without those, so why slow down your questing speed to over perform in dungeons.
---
what are the mats to do this? Fucking good item. How much leagherworking?
---
I feel like this is all probably an overlooked benefit of layering
---
Set a schedule and don't go over it.  If you have a job/kid you're not going to be able to even come close to being able to be anywhere near the 'ahead of the curve' crowd in this game so you won't need to worry about it, or worry about being left behind or anything because you already are with zero hope at this point anyway, by the nature of the game, the genre and the playerbase.
---
So when you look at it like that, it's easier just to fit it in around YOUR life and not fit your life around the game.
---
My schedule is a rock, and everything else in my life comes first.  This is the very last thing on my priority list when all of my responsibilities are sorted and I actually have time.  Not really the target demographic here so I make sure I'm well aware of that, I was around for the first go round and understand quite clearly how this one will run away with you if you let it, due to the requirements and time commitments, needing to work with a solid group on the same routine/schedule etc...like it's a job.  Don't.  You have other jobs now.
---
"Just abandon all your friends and play on a server that won't last long term" idiots on Reddit
---
Thanks it worked, I guess one of my add ons turned it of, because of never seen that before.
---
Typically you just use sword/board but remain in arms spec. It's actually fine well past level 30.
---
When servers first opened. 500 people were all trying to tag mobs for quest credit. The ONLY way to progress was to group with others.  
---
So literally the FIRST thing the game teaches you is that grouping with others will accelerate your own growth.  
---
5 people all waiting for a quest boss to spawn? It will take way longer for each individual person to kill it solo than it would if everyone groups up and kills together. Oh wait I know this one! We should group up! 
---
Elite quests? Group up!  
---
Dungeons? Need a group for that too. 
---
And raiding of course is the most challenging and most rewarding content in the game and it requires the most coordination and the largest group.
---
That‚Äôs fixed on this patch
---
Youre Anduin, watching as an orc enters the end of your hall, who gets instantly stabbed to death by your guards. You stare in amazement for a minute, possibly two, when suddenly that same orc *gets right back up and keeps running at you,* hunger in his eyes. He gets cut down again, and you stare again...and he raises back up and charges again. This repeats as he slowly gets closer, until finally the time he makes it to your chair and socks you one clean in the jaw.
---
which spec should i be using? i went into arms and i assume thats wrong?
---
Is there anything similar for the horde? I also want a companion
---
I don‚Äôt have gm logs of a private server... I‚Äôm just telling you that it was common knowledge there. Nobody is going to admit they‚Äôre account sharing lol... that‚Äôs an instant ban. There will never be a source unless blizz catches him or those logs are released. Lights hope was a fairly professionally run private server and they would never jeopardize the privacy of their patrons, even ones that were banned for nefarious activities.
---
 Take that with what you will.
---
Idk about .org but pretty sure there is no Druid trainer in SW
---
Was gonna comment the same thing. I‚Äôm brand new to WoW, I can‚Äôt imagine remembering the names of any of my gear. But I remember Mad‚Äôs polearm.
---
Ah... exchanging or rewarding layer swapping with gold. I remember this from the original Vanilla alright.
---
Hah. You would have loved to see me rolling around Eversong Woods last night. 
---
I couldn't get into classic so I decided to roll up a new belf pally for the lulz. So there was a giant, ghostly Gamon rolling around and annihilating shit in the newbie zone. I hit level 13 in under 2 hours and was putting out over 200dps (maybe higher, can't recall).
---
Saw people duelling, so I put my tol barad spotlight in the middle of their fight and dropped my dancing flames statue so we could be sexy dancing fire ladies while they fought.
---
It was kinda fun.

When do you get your first wand? I'm level 11 and I still haven't got one yet.
---
Hah, jokes on you; I work weekends.

I'm a risk analyst for a major insurance firm, so when my wife and I were planning a birthday party for our seven-year-old, Crispin, my mind naturally turned to liabilities. We'd settled on the theme of a "backyard carnival", complete with a swing set, a trampoline, merry-go-round, and a giant Slip `n Slide. So I carefully inspected the equipment for safety. It all seemed sound.
---
We have a home on a bluff overlooking the ocean. As it happened, on the day of the party our neighbors were trimming their fichus trees. We heard the sound of their wood chipper buzzing occasionally from the other side of our tall hedge. It was a little irritating, but not disruptive.
---
The party started off wonderfully. A clown we'd hired made balloon animals, Crispin eagerly opened his presents, and all the children enjoyed cake and fruit punch. The weather was mild, the skies clear. It seemed a perfect day.
---
Then we brought out the Slip `n Slide.
---
The problem with water slides is what we in the trade call "distributed water deficiency zones", or in layman's terms, dry spots. If a child hits one of these, it can put the brakes on the fun, and send them sliding down a path of medical claims--contusions, concussions, lacerations, abrasions, whiplash, back rash, and disc impaction. And that's just for starters. From there, it's a slippery slope toward major litigation.
---
To avoid even the remote possibility of such injuries, I invested in this 55 gallon drum of water soluble personal lubricant--the idea being that the children could enjoy the slide in complete safety, then wash off in the hose before their parents came to retrieve them. With that in mind, I dipped each child into the vat before allowing them to cue up for the slide.
---
The Slip `n Slide itself performed admirably, as did the lubricant. That, in fact, was the problem. Due to the slight downhill gradient of our yard, the children built up so much speed that they skidded across the lawn and into a retaining wall at the other end of our property, with sufficient force that I had to put an end to the activity.
---
I endeavored to roll up the mat--no easy task, as the lawn surrounding the slide was itself now lubricated, and I struggled to maintain my footing. When I looked up from my labor, I grasped for the first time the scope of the liabilities I had unleashed--a horde of extremely well-lubricated seven-year-olds, hyped up on sugar and desperate for fun.
---
I saw young Eliza Gimmelman climb onto the trampoline. She began jumping, but the pad soon became so slick that she lost all control. Her wild flailing unfortunately fell into harmonic synchronization with the motion of the springs, propelling her ever higher, until she soared above the trampoline's safety enclosure, over the hedge and into the neighbor's yard. There came a ghastly grinding sound, and I could tell from the crimson plume that followed, it would be a total loss.
---
Twins Jeremy and Mason Lafferty were on the swing set. Having attained the swings' full range of motion, they were apparently having difficulty holding on. At that point, the swings became human catapults. Mason separated on the backswing, arcing over the roof of our home toward the street beyond. I surmised from the screeching tires, car horns and screams of horror that he was also unrecoverable. A terrified Jeremy soon lost his grip as well, sailing forward over the bluff, and plummeting 300 feet down into the ice-cold, shark-infested waters of the San Francisco Bay. An open claim, but not promising.
---
The rest of the children were clinging to the merry-go-round. Having just witnessed the violent deaths of at least two of their playmates, they were no longer in the mood for fun. However, the lubricant had dripped from their glistening bodies into the central cog, allowing it to spin far faster than it was designed to, and this, likely combined with other factors--their relative weight distribution, the slight incline of the ground--caused their motion to become self-sustaining, and the centrifugal force built upon itself until they became a blurry, screaming disk of human suffering. Then they began to fly off like cannon balls.
---
Martin Duckworth was the first to go, causing significant structural damage to our greenhouse. Lisa Aurelio shattered a line of ceramic garden gnomes, and Ethan Green slammed into our Audi Q7 so hard it had to be written off--as, tragically, did he. Several other children left what looked like gingerbread man indentations in the siding of our home. It was terrifying.
---
When the wheel finally came to a stop, there was only one child aboard. As luck would have it, it was our own beloved Crispin, huddled in the center of the merry-go-round, weeping. My wife ran to him and hugged him with all the might of a relieved, traumatized parent. A little too hard, as it turned out. Lubricated as he was, he shot from her arms like a wet bar of soap, up fifteen feet in the air, landed on the trampoline, and then soared, in a half-gainer, over the hedge, into the wood chipper.
---
Since then, I've asked myself a thousand times, is there anything I could have done differently? But in the end, no actuary table could have predicted this bloodbath. I can only conclude that this was an act of God. And that, to me, is truly terrifying. Because we're not covered for that.
---
That's not something Saurfang would do.
---
You want ppl to sew skimpy underwear?  Isn't there something more important to take care of?  I realize dwarfs look hot AF in a thong but you need something more than this to fire up the troops, don't you?
---
It has content planned for the next 2 years, what do you mean? Like post naxx content? If that's the only part of the game you are concerned about, come back to classic in 2021. But then you'll have missed all the content phases in the meantime. I dont get your logic
---
Bruh, just scroll down. Everything I named was literally posted this morning
---
TBH, it kind of makes me enjoy it more.
---
I don't feel like I'm in a rush to anything, and that my hundreds of hours of effort will become obsolete.
---
I can go through the game at whatever pace, and complete all the raids eventually, etc. It feels fucking awesome!
---
Well that‚Äôs a bummer, but no big deal, I love Classic all the same. Thank you for the reply!

Also wtf is with programmable keyboard prices?

---
You're right that  there wasn't  a jump off at nearest FP function, and I'm not a huge fan of them adding that. But starting to add more FPs is just a slippery slope... Changing mounts  to level 30 is just a *huge* change.
---
And there definitely were both bracers and gloves in vanilla
---
I know I do :/
---
And they exist because you're waiting in the queue to take their place.
---
Its day 4. Naxx wont be out for months. We are at least a year out from even starting to think about what's next

That's a great story dude I love it. I had to take him back home because I only have 2 slots right now and I need abilities. I might go get another later
---
Where are you seeing these complaints? I havent seen or heard of  any besides Q times.
---
The problem with Protection Paladin at 60 is the lack of important tools and gear that they suffer from.
---
There is one set of blue gear from (IIRC) Scholomance/Stratholme with Defense and MP5, stats that you need for tanking. There is nothing above that for you.
---
You never get anything with a greater range than 10 yards to pull mobs. You will have to rely on body pulling and praying that your group lets you establish threat before going HAM.
---
You have no taunt. If your group pulls something from you, you don't have that button to help save them. When it comes to tank swapping in a raid setting, you're useless.
---
Grasping at straws, much?
---
Quitting is a valid option if the problem is that the game has negative repercussions on one's life.
---
Quitting isn't a valid option if the problem is that one actually wants to play the game.
---
The problem here is that servers are full, which prevents players from playing. In such a scenario, playing on a server that isn't full is an option.
---
In your specific case, switching servers isn't an option you're willing to consider, because the priority for you is to be on the same server as your friends and your friends don't want to consider that option either.
---
I didn't think I needed to spell it out for you. And you end with an ad hominem, so I guess we're done, here.
---
Have a nice day.
---
It takes a big chunk of time to get to Lv. 25, it would be unfortunate to waste three days. But months down the road, it will not seem like much after all your future adventures. Hope you enjoy wherever you play!
---
Is that a fucking Lamborghini countauch?
---
My man is LIVING  the Vanilla days
---
Can't wait for reset for this pointless discussion to be over
---
Blizzard is a business company. If classic succeeds, they will continue to want your money. AKA more and more content...
---
Man that happened to me the other day, I levelled up at like 5 HP and was able to kill the boar!
---
Yeah, all complains I see are about other people complaining. I check this reddit everyday and play with many friends. Not a single time I've heard someone complain about  lack of fight paths, mount accessibility or difficulty acquiring gold
---
Lmao this is hilarious, thanks for sharing
---
SHIIIIIIZZZZZAAAAA
---
I want to party with you.
---
&gt;  In two years the game won't be any more successful than other MMORPGs 
---
That's an extremely bold statement to make. Especially considering they've hinted at releasing TBC. If this happens, and I think it will eventually, there will undoubtedly be millions of players playing. I would say it's extremely likely that 2 years from now, or whenever TBC releases, that "Classic" will have more concurrent players than any other MMO has other than WoW in the last 15 years.
---
Because the Ice barb spear from AV is the tits for a lot of classes.
---
I hit 23 before my vacation day were over
---
Just gouge for a very long time that gets dodged, parried, misses half the time.
---
Legit. I only hit 18 last night. I was planning to be in my mid-high 20s by the end of the weekend.
---
It's going to be close, but I think I can pull off mid 20s. I'm off both Sunday and Monday so we'll see what happens.
---
I completely understand this but do you ever feel that way about video games in general? 
---
I get it all the time like why am I really investing my time into something that doesn‚Äôt give back. 
---
But in reality if you try and think about it less, then you‚Äôre able to enjoy the experience in the here and now more so.
---
Rule 1 says this is not a community for streamer drama.
---
Then moving onto broken tooth at 47 for that sick 1.0 attack speed.
---
Because the small adversities you face is what makes it special.
---
Exactly the same.
---
Infact I‚Äôve never played a caster, I‚Äôve got every melee class at 120 and have played since vanilla.
---
I wanted something completely new and so far it‚Äôs been a great choice.
---
If you're still looking into this. I went Skinning/Mining at first to generate some money as I level and obtain some of the specific materials I would need for my planned lategame professions. Lategame I'm planning on Taloring for Robe of the Archmage, and Bloodvine set bonus, and Goblin Engineering for Goblin Sapper Charges(Extra AoE DPS), Iron Grenades(Stun/Inturupt), Goblin Rocket Boots(Second Blink), and Goblin Rocket Helm(hard removal) for PvP, Flame Deflector(early raiding), JumperCables(wipe recovery), and Field Repair Bot(wipe recovery) for PvE. On deciding what leveling professions I went with Skinning for the easy money early and Rugged Leather I'd need late into leveling Tailoring and Mining obviously for cost saving in Engineering.
---
Depends on perspective. A counter view is I see not being able to play what I paid for as ‚Äúwrong‚Äù because the only thing that is causing any build up of traffic is a lack of resources that I do not have any control over. Blizzard do. 
---
I know it‚Äôs a weird situation with not wanting to bring up new servers in case people suddenly leave and or get bored of the game. But I‚Äôm not getting bored, not going away, and just want to play wow all day like I did as a kid.  I can‚Äôt step out of that enjoyment fully aware of the 5 hour queue that will punish me the moment I leave.
---
&gt;Is there really no way to play holy paladin on horde?

Horde does not have paladins. Just like shamans dont exist on Alliance. It is physically, absolutely, without any shadow of the doubt, 100% impossible to play a paladin as a Horde.
---
No way.
---
It falls on the OG players to let the noobs who are already complaining that Classic is too tough what real in game annoyance is all about.
---
/run PlaySound(######)
---
But replace the # with the sound file number. Good luck finding it. I know wowhead has a list for current, don't know if they have one for Classic.
---
The servers have been stable with a couple exceptions. Some servers have absurd queue times but there are plenty that have a reasonable one or no queue at all
---
Don't like it?
---
Just multi-box one more character than he has
---
You are doing something wrong if you cant get a group. Takes me 5 minutes to get a group going as a DPS
---
Probably need to submit a ticket then. Normally they're pretty quick but I imagine they might be flooded right now with such a massive launch, hopefully they'll be able to get back to you fast.
---
The Honor system is roughly 3 months away in Phase 1 or 2 (I don't know if we're in Phase 0 or 1 tbh) but Battlegrounds IIRC are coming in the phase after.
---
In other words, in a few months WPvP will be worthwhile, but BGs are still a few months after that.
---
*Laughs in mage*
---
My IQ drops a few points every time I read one of your posts
---
u/apatheticaubrie confirmed it was in a later patch that this was introduced. Any word on an addon that does the same thing? Even if it only works with people who also have the same addon?
---
Tauren stomp regrowth macro is fire!
---
Oh yeah I need to setup a guild tabard
---
That‚Äôs a actually slow as fuck what have you been doing
---
Meh I‚Äôm gonna continue remotely keeping myself in game 
---
Adapt or q
---
No man, in classic paladins are alliance and shamans are horde. No way around that. You could try Druid.

---
Arguments over tags and nodes aren't just something that's because people are coming from retail. 
---
There has always been that guy that will swoop in for the tag. There is also that full group that swoops in for the tag after you've cleared an area on your own before anyone else turned up. People will do things to get what they want, and probably not worry about it later. There will be ninjas. Of tags, and of loot. Just like there was then, and still is now.

German servers are all filled to the brim or high pop. I think we need more.

---
There was [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cxiehu/loving_classic_again_but/) about 20 minutes ago asking to add more FPs and change the mount level to 30, lol
---
I just want to ride through and enjoy the view. I'm going to take my time, all of my friends would just blow through content on expansions and it was just a game of catch up the whole time. Not fun. Now I can enjoy my time and work on professions and shit as I play and level.
---
i havnt tried logging in yet or settled on what class to play. i too played warrior in vanilla, had hand of rag, pvped to rank 11, raided up to huhuran, basically had very awesome gear.  i think about rolling warrior again, but know its mostly only worth it if i play seriously at 60. 
---
going priest, hunter or rogue is tempting though. all strong pvp classes. priest would be relativly easy to gear as getting groups would be no issue.  rogues can do well in pvp even with out crazy gear, and are fine in raids and such. hunters are less useful in raiding due to their DPS.
---
but honestly i think people have a bit to much of a retail mindset for raid comp. we did these raids in vanilla with far less ideal raid comps because thats what you had to do to field 40 people, and players just straight up sucked alot more back then.  like, not being able to handle the most basic of mechanics while spamming 1-2 spells.
---
There is absolutely 0 way to play a holy paladin on vanilla horde. None of the original horde races are capable of being a paladin same as alliance can't be shaman. Having said that, if you're dead set on a hybrid healer/dps or healer/tank, some guilds have had success in classic using a druid offtank that can flex between healing, dps or tanking in a pinch.
---
He's actually half orc half ogre
---
My only problem is that after releasing 15years old game (instead of Wow2) .. they still have 8h queve .. ;-)
---
Nope. At this point paladins are Alliance only, Shamans are horde only.
---
Hello me, not a bad time to be us I‚Äôd say!
---
no palas for horde sorry. they have shamans
---
I think they keep upping the capacity of the servers and making them have more shards or whatever it's called.  So they need to do reboots to change the settings.
---
I really wish I could see them. I feel needy af.
---
What an absolute unit
---
Start your own group
---
Mont? Most people are not even close to 40
---
i never played paladin (or much alliance at all) back in the day but man I am enjoying it. I‚Äôm only 22 right now but I honestly love being able to do so much for a party and still bring okay damage in dungeons, even if it is just buffed-up autoattacks and the occasional judgment. i don‚Äôt even dislike grinding mobs, it‚Äôs pretty relaxing honestly. it‚Äôs slow but at least I‚Äôm not foaming at the mouth praying Jesus will bless me with some rage
---
Honestly closest thing is shaman, I would roll shaman because no matter what you can always heal and if a heal a lot is full you can dps
---
What am I looking at?  You took 20, or 27 damage when you were only supposed to take 7? Or what?
---
Just happened the same to me this morning. kid wasn't up for going to school so I just sit and play wow instead of taking him. Unfortunately it lasted about 15 minutes.
---
Thank you.
---
Hahaha I‚Äôm cool, I had my fair share of mmo addiction before ( even if it wasn‚Äôt WoW) and my dog was an old buddy and didn‚Äôt suffer much, so I think I can handle it. I have a new young barking buddy now that I need to take care of and now I am (what society considers) a ‚Äúresponsible adult‚Äù so I‚Äôll (try to) be mature and (maybe) prioritize important aspects of my life (hopefully)
---
Aetiesh lol. xD
---
You charming person &lt;3
---
I know it‚Äôs not what you are talking about with blocked drops but when someone pulls that in my group or I hear from a friend that it happened I add that player to my block list if I ever join a group and see they are blocked or a pug raid with them I just leave

You said your "group" decided to roll horde.  Where is your "group" now?  Shouldn't they be helping you?
---
Gratz man. Truly a hunter weapon
---
We are also all speaking in English about a game that is written and produced and distributed by people in America originally, so it‚Äôs not a super big stretch to think that the people in here commenting are also American, heh.
---
Had to help a Hunter too in Dun Morogh this morning.
---
It was a white Elite bear and the guy was two levels below. He died two times in a row and I couldn't help since I am rogue.
---
After many rez I had the idea to bandage him while he try to tame the pet and that worked !
---
We went questing later, pretty cool experience (and he gave me some silvers for helping :D)
---
as been said in the thread, I think most people dont reactivate after a death. I definitely forget here and there..
---
I equipped a mace for the first time as a rogue and was like wtf I'm doing no dmg. Oh yea, weapon skill is a thing.
---
That's highly subjective. As someone who leveled several 60s during Vanilla I just want to hit 60 asap so I can start gearing up, farming reps, work on professions, and get ready for raiding.
---
While the overall leveling experience is nice some people just don't care for the leveling aspect and instead want to focus on max level content.
---
Different people will play and enjoy different aspects of Classic. I feel that's one thing that made Vanilla so much fun.
---
If you enjoyed grinding rep/farming/raiding/pvp you had that at 60.
---
If you liked story driven content you had countless quests while leveling and all these fantastic zones to  explore.
---
haha all good..
---
I think back in the day I probably took a week to get to 20, but I was also like 16 and had no idea what I was doing :P
---
who is the most fuckable paladin in the lore
---
We are now playing Second Second life.
---
I was thinking the same thing. The face of conservatives.
---
Well, I hope things get better for you.  It's early days, so nothing wrong with trying something new, like shaman or druid.
---
Ain't that the truth!!!
---
I spent all morning there today. Finished the kill count and dinged 20!!
---
Still, have to kill Yowler. . Those boots man!!
---
I think that squanders the effort and man hours it must have taken to take a saved patch of a 15 year old game and deploy that on today's hardware. I'm sure there was a lot they had to do, so I'm sure they're hoping to make money off of it. That being said, they probably already broke even from people just paying for a month of playtime!
---
Is it me or was his tactic not possible in Vanille wow? This feels like blizzard introduced new game mechanicw.
---
Unplayable.
---
Jesus I was 45 on launch day. I used to let my 6 year old play to pick flowers on her Tauren.
---
The ding in Everquest was much more satisfying...and it scared the crap out of you.
---
Yeah I even checked with several Times but they bug out it seems. Maybe some addon doing it though
---
That is hilarious
---
You monster!
---
I would like to see them take a softer approach on updates like osrs. some moderately sized updates every 2 months instead of dropping content in one big dump. Classic seems like a good opportunity for blizzard to look at the ways their business model has suffered, and the ways its thrived. Sure expansions are a nice cash grab, but a constant stream of updates, maybe with smaller level cap raises would allow people to play at a steady pace and not get burnt out when they run out of things to do.
---
&gt; What's there not to understand?
---
That a few months (like you stated in your post) isn't the same as 2 years.
---
Hey, could you PM me please? :)
---
This may have a somewhat beneficial effect for folks playing on EST servers.  Heh...
---
Wanna talk about the time they literally nabbed the dragon soul under the nose of all the dragon aspects present at the time?
---
Then with proper marketing of ideas they will sway the masses of the games population leaving the minority voice unheard... (which historically the minority typically have the right idea)
---
Hurr

---
Ahhh. Cool. No idea what it is still or what M+ is. lol
---
Anyway, the thing is Classic is that it is so hard to find a group for any dungeon that people will most likely be less picky just like they were when the game first came out. Also, as long as you have some moderate level of gear, every dungeon in classic is very doable. It is actually more important for your group to have done it before and know the encounters than for them to have a certain amount of gear - at least if we are talking about regular leveling dungeons. Even people with MC and Onyxia gear will wipe a party in Stratholme if they don't know what they are doing and pull a zillion adds.

That‚Äôs what I do usually. But I can also use our guest WiFi it‚Äôs just rather terrible

---
And the server crashed? Can't wait till phase 2 when there are way less players playing, so they scale down the server infrastructure, and then the world bosses come out... I'll be surprised if we don't get fucked out of a boss kill/tag at least once due to server issues
---
Yes sexymap actually. They updated a classic version a week ago ;)
---
I'm in 13k queue right now. Got dc'ed 5 Minn after I got in. Again.
---
True tbh. Medium is 10s+ on my server
---
again, I never said I go around hunting. I said if I see people in Inn's, and general those are at quest hubs, where I am regularly returning after 30 minutes to an hour. You are the one that decided I "hunt" players. In total I've probably spent about 10-15 minutes writing reports and messaging players I think are AFK. and that's at a PUSH. it's probably cumulatively much less time. 
---
In terms of finding people that share my viewpoint - the ratio of negative comments compared to the positive in this thread kind of show that I'm not in a minority, certainly not amongst the people that have read this thread. This is further backed up by the posts rating. 
---
Also, intent doesn't matter. Their intent is to avoid something that is an inconvenience to others, at the expense of and with no regard for others. Their intent doesn't matter - they are still ass holes whether they intend to be or not.
---
these stacks of 10 ore are killing me.
---
That seems like a them problem. I don't have to agree with someone's politics or religion to say they were nice, kind and caring to others. People are to tribalistic, who cares what Chuck thinks about politics and religion if he treats people respectfully makes time for them and also treats everyone like an old friend he hasn't seen in forever. 
---
Chuck is all of those things.
---
Make friends. Seriously. You will need them to prop you up during leveling. And when you blossom into a face rolling wrecking ball, they will rely on you.

In vanilla, I exhausted a 16 slot bag of ammo (200-stacks) and only on the 2nd to last stack got the one to finish the quest (IIRC you needed 2).

Activision blizzard has been double dipping for a long time off of subscriptions AND cash shop stuff, realistically any company should be happy with a steady subscription model as it is predictable and easy to make projections on
---
It's so cute. people go like "free....with mats?" and i'm like "um...no. just...you know..free."
---
As a Priest, go into shadowform and talk to a warlock trainer.
---
"The shadow does not consume you."
---
What? Right now, I am LITERALLY SHADOW. WTF.  (this was in stormwind, I don't know if you get the same response from other trainers)
---
If you get the ‚Äúatlas‚Äù addon, you check what the level range is for each dungeon. Then go till things are geen and you arent getting much xp
---
I completely understand your point, but it‚Äôs the fact that if they wanted that kind of progression (from the very beginning) there should be a very clear cut couple of story paths that you can take that follow a linear storyline. It‚Äôs the fact that you can be following a new characters storyline concisely but then you travel to a different zone and it‚Äôs a different time period from the one you were just in (half of the time you‚Äôre going back in time). It destroys the players immersion because you can‚Äôt feel REALLY into the world until end-game/ the newest expansion‚Äôs area.
---
and you think Blizzard will acknowledge thier failings and offer free time? Doubtful...
---
My issue is that putting your rage bar so far from your abilities makes you constantly look back and forth
---
If you want to have higher threat, don't spec protection while leveling. Prot doesn't get good competitive with threat until level 40 (shield slam). Spec Arms for Tactical Mastery, this is the single most important talent for the warrior class as a while, and also vital for dungeon tanking. If you're not generating enough rage to use your abilities, that's not a rotation problem, that's a rage problem. But generally, your single target rotation should be: BT/MS/SS &gt; Revenge &gt; Sunder &gt; HS
---
To get rage, you need to not only deal damage, but take damage. Taking damage can often be the most important source of rage as a tank. If you're not getting hit, or taking enough damage, that can lead to rage starvation. Do the following if this is the case:
---
1. Pulling - Tank should nearly always pull in order to get the the initial aggro, and you need the rage from the initial damage. Also, Charge when you can afford to (and not aggro other groups). If you switch to Defensive Stance mid-charge, you can get off a demo shout as soon as you get the group of mobs.
---
2. If people are pulling aggro off you, they need to stop. You need to help them learn which target to focus. Use target icons, and assign cc roles, etc.
---
3. If priests PW:Shield you too often, this needs to stop, this should only be used in life and death emergencies, because it causes rage starvation and threat loss.
---
4. If wearing a shield and using a 1 hander causes you to not generate enough rage, use your 2 hander (wisely) and make sure the healer is aware if you do so. Make sure to have a macro to allow you to switch back to your 1h/shield for emergencies.
---
I never played vanilla so when I got into the stress tests I tried out Warrior, Druid, and Paladin, and easily settled on Paladin.
---
Now that we're live I'm very happy with it. I have no raiding ambitions but am fine with being shuttled to healing if I ever decide to try. It can feel simple and "slow" to play solo, but I find so far that any lack of damage is offset by being able to survive add pulls and ambushes, and having little or no downtime once you get Wisdom. I don't even mind the slowness of it. It's also nice to be able to just run around like an idiot and not worry much about dying from most things, and being able to solo stuff you probably should not be able to.
---
The biggest thing about Pally though is that it is a true support class, and outstanding if you actually play it that way. It has a large toolset for boosting groups and lending random aid to other players, and has something you can use to solve any problem that a group may run into, if you're smart about swapping to tanking or healing or buffing / rescuing instead of just blindly tunneling on DPS. And all the hail mary moves you get as you gain more abilities are really nice when needed.
---
I mentioned this in my alliance guild chat yesterday and a whole bunch of them logged off to make board characters just so they could see / hear this.

Weeee kudos 4 you.

you can have 2 instances of wow running at the same time without the help of any software.  I've done it.  It's easy to do.   And it's allowed.

Switching between the windows, to do abilities, that is where it can be challenging, especially if neither character can tank all that well...  If one can tank, then it's loads easier.....

As u/Xenatra93 mentioned, account sharing not allowed.  With that said though, the likelihood of actually being caught is pretty much non-existent.  You'd have to announce it, and brag about it, and even then, it's unlikely to actually be noticed.  I've, "shared", my account in retail over countless hours.  Still have my account.....  Blizzard is more actively looking for outright botters....

Blizzard can't really prove he is intentionally abusing layering and ban the guy.

Also, they put this in the game knowingly, full aware that this could or would happen.

The stockades is a dungeon in Stormwind, usually shortened to the Stocks

It helps if you tell us what the error message is

Retail is great if you don't really want to play an mmo but simply want to follow an arrow around to get free gold and loot, i mean you don't know why you do other than that, a checklist really and do it all as fast as f'ing possible, everything is rush cause you need to feel like u accomplished something in 10 minutes, that's not f'ing playing an mmo, the game is playing you, lol
---
So hollow, such an empty experience.
---
And here, Classic
---
Everything feels so satisfying becasue you worked for it, used your brain to figure it out, that's an experience, a  feeling of accomplishment, people are helping one another, a community formed in mere minutes, and that is an mmorpg, it's been so long people forgot the meaning.
---
Pretty much. So many 1% kills and deaths it's crazy.
---
Haha, this is exactly my character! Orc hunter with a crocodile pet. I even ran through Mulgore yesterday to Thunder Bluff. You don't happen to be on Ashbringer EU, do you?
---
If you didn't know, it was originally trialled as essentially "unrested exp", a penalty you got to try to convince players to take breaks, with rested being displayed as the normal rate - but playtesters hated it. Changing the names without tweaking the numbers at all and it became a really popular mechanic. Funny bit of trivia on player psychology.
---
Thank you for your reply. That helps explain it :-)
---
It is pretty cool.  
---
What is the class?
---
I‚Äôm going with a Dwarf Priest so I can have an easy position on parties, raids etc and because I consider it a class that lets you learn more aspects of the as I‚Äôll probably need others to level up. I thought priests are only healers but I recently found out that Shadow Priests exists and obviously have no idea what that means and what my class is capable of
---
masturbate or switch servers?
---
Cash shop mount would still be a much bigger advantage though. Unless they don't let you buy it until you have mount skill there would be a huge outrage but I doubt they'd do that.
---
Rightly so. They're bears.
---
Did you not read my post?
---
Layering is so dumb. Community begs for it not to be a thing and but then rides this guys dick for using it to cheese aoe grind. Defending him at every chance they get all so they can shit on method lol

They all say full during primetime, but it's not the same.  Some have 10k waits some have none, but they still say full. It's a bad indication.  Go look up the realms most recently added and odds are they have no waits.  Anything released after Monday is going to be easy to login into.
---
Before classic came out i decided to play retail a bit just for some resemblance. I started a new character, a human, and went through the starting zone. I remembered that the quest where you put out fires gave you your first cape. so when I turned in the quest I was pretty excited because even though it's just a white quality Cape it's still an upgrade. I put on the Cape and it draped down to my lower back. I remember back in vanilla it wasn't until close to level 20 that you got a Cape that was that long. To immediately get an awesome looking Cape didnt feel very rewarding. If everyone has a cool Cape than what makes it a cool Cape? I kept leveling and got to a quest in eastvale logging camp that once I turned it in the quest reward got upgraded to an epic item. What was "epic" about that? I only killed a few defies for a few scraps of cloth. You dont feel like you're getting much from the game in bfa because everything is given to you as soon as possible. In vanilla I felt accomplished after a day or two of leveling to loot a white quality Cape off a mob and equipping it only to see that it went down to my ass. I posted it an the guild chat and most people were excited for me and some even offered to buy it. In a game where even a Cape can make someone feel better about their character and justify their 18 hour leveling grind than I think they're doing something right
---
Tl;dr. A Cape made me cream
---
Lmao is that a bug tried relogging?
---
So like.. When do we get Wow Classic Mobile?
---
My guild spam is in short ‚Äúlooking to grow and foster a good community with plans to make dungeon and raid teams.‚Äù Because people actually recruiting with Raid in mind the first week are crazy.
---
Big thanks to you guy
---
One of the stockades quests has the quest giver threatening to kill you himself if you for some reason are trying to help the inmates escape. He doesn't give 2 shits about you, and it's great.
---
I remember that. I believe the man was playing diablo 3 and it wasn't necessarily lack of sleep it was because he had been sitting so long a clot formed in his legs I believe. When he stood up the clot broke or something like that. The takeaway was just make sure you get up and move around every so often. Still probably not advised to not sleep in a 4 day gaming binge lol

There should be an option to ask about class trainers and the guard will mark on your map and mini-map for you
---
Honestly they just need to kick everyone in Crossroads inn if youve been there for more than 10 mins
---
Unlikely it‚Äôs your motherboard if you‚Äôre not getting power. Sounds like a power supply issue. Mine went out a few years ago. Luckily you can get them on amazon for pretty cheap... although I would spend a few extra bucks and get a Corsair power supply, they‚Äôve got a really good warranty. 
---
Sorry about the difficulties though.
---
scourgestone turn in begins
---
Yeah had three murlocs and a pet on me, figured I'd be good but that spell pushback was too great despite the level and bubble heal. Westfall coast is a scary place for a paladin. Love the meme though!
---
The problem is probably you in that case. Either you aren't fully into the group "clique", you're not good enough for them, or they simply have too many people already (which fits into my first point).
---
Well, It is part of the game mechanics so it won't happen but i feel what you mean, that's not a beautiful way to end this race in fact.
---
I feel like the first 98% of a mobs health is actually only 50%.  That or there is some buff they get at the end that gives them 99% chance to dodge and parry the final hit.
---
Could be Prat.
---
Yeah that guy clearly never leveled a warrior in vanilla.  Keep it up!
---
I was doing this with potions (mostly cause I needed bag space) so I'd open trade and pop some potions in and you could almost see the gears working as people tried to remember if they'd asked me for anything.
---
Oh sorry if I am not interesting enough, maybe I should stream ;-)
---
Yeah I mean, I guess I understand if he‚Äôs looking at big picture only, to be 60 first. 
---
But blowing past quests, not raiding, not Guild working, just same instance over and over to ‚Äúbe first‚Äù. That part just doesn‚Äôt ring with me. To each their own though in the end I guess.
---
Then you finally get to it and some guy left some darnassus bleu inside of it and that's all.
---
What‚Äôs the total AFK window? You‚Äôre logged out of game after 30min and out of character screen after another 30?
---
Just because some orc tart threw a sword at you...!
---
How about you just play the damn game and not care about what other people are doing? Pretty simple actually.
---
This. You quest, you get quests for the dungeon, you do the dungeon.
---
Meh to each their own, I'm 15 and can solo pretty much everything. It's nice having a good group but as long as you crusader -&gt; righteousness you can pull good dps and just heal after the pull.
---
Cataclysm had a good approach.
---
All the must have talents became baseline.
---
Many talents that were just plain boring but necessary got removed with spec specific passives filling the gaps.
---
While you got fewer points overall, you felt a much bigger impact on each point.
---
I wish they had expanded on that.
---
This illustrates so well, why I dislike Mining &amp; Herbalism! XD
---
Ive missed talent trees since they took them out, tbh.
---
Its not a huge deal at max level, but it feels *so* hollow while leveling alts, which i love to do.
---
Between that and the insane leveling pace i just end up bored when i level alts on retail.
---
Actual PogChamp. 
---
Method and asmon lost to balding gnome LUL
---
Unless you're casting cos you can't block/dodge/parry while casting.
---
Armor nice tho
---
My night elf hunter and my pink flamingo pet from classic say hi!
---
And he is saying he enjoys endgame, and leveling is a means to an end.
---
Everyone can play how they want.
---
You can't do that though, then friends and family can't join.  They just need to open up free migration to another server.  I'm sure it's a technical challenge though.  You'd have thousands of people applying at once.
---
All the game similiar to classic wow (or better) are either dead or have low population. Think about it.
---
Now you‚Äôre having the piss.
---
So you must either wait it out or relog and queue for 49 days to get back online. True lose-lose situation.
---
A group of casters that AOE dungeons down
---
Awesome thank you!
---
Imagine if you just have to run out for say 20 minutes because of something but you dont want to wait in a 2.5 hour queue...that's a valid reason to not want to afk...now the guys multiboxing on 5-10 accounts imo cause a bigger issue.
---
Untrue.  WoW was an EQ-clone cash grab from the beginning.  They just had some dedicated devs that made it decent.
---
Classic WoW is responsible for a new $30 monthly budget item in our house that was not there previously.
---
We're supposed to be going on vacay to the beach with some family this weekend, and I'm strongly considering the results if I were to eat some undercooked food to stay at home and play more.
---
Because that would not be the "Classic" experience...
---
Oh shit could I really? I didn‚Äôt know that! Wtf? 
---
Ofcourse j know that, but some of us have friends on other servers? 
---
What about thinking about when low pop servers are dead as fuck?
---
I would urge you to stay FAR away from /r/gendercritical. They are a hate sub in every definition of the word. Their arguments are not made in good faith, almost always ignoring some of the facts and straight up lying in others. Their arguments never hold up to scientific scrutiny.
---
The most recent queue times for EU over at wowhead says that only 10 servers out of 31 have a queue time more than a couple of minutes and many have no queue at all. But those 10 have big queues. At least 29 minutes and Gehenas has a 484 minute queue.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/news=294747/classic-wow-server-queue-times-eu 
---
I believe the US has a similar breakdown. A few servers have very long queues. Most have none or less than ten minutes. I had no queue logging into Mankrik last night.
---
I just want to play dude.
---
Even if I have to fuck queue for other ppl, sorry..
---
Being an elitist is a bad thing, always. And what about the other 20 things you claimed which are as far from the truth as you can get? 
---
Its just pathetic, enjoy your own game, and watch the people you like playing on twitch. #Useyourownbrainanddontbearetardforonceplease
---
Addons
---
As a Priest healer its getting close to where ill refuse to group with a hunter after a few bad pulls. /s Also, priest could you fear more into next pack! Ffs some basics people lost when wow was easy in retail with full blue and heirlooms. I dont need to pucker my ass and drink after every pull. IF you pace it out i wont even lose mana because tank wont even get bubble pooped.
---
People 50+ on the two most full servers
---
Learn to read. I'm not telling anyone to do anything. Let everyone do whatever the heck they want. I couldn't care less. You people are the ones who are insulted that they're exist people who disagree with you, that everyone should take it so slow and enjoy the open world boring ass questing like it's the second coming of god.
---
I got the first 3 collectors editions of the expansions sitting at my house
---
You are correct! It was great seeing what everyone came up with though, lol
---
Imagine having the amazing ability to do this: /leave \[x\]
---
x = number of whatever chat channel you can't handle
---
There‚Äôs a streamer realm. There‚Äôs also other full ones that are just full guy.
---
Troll for the attack speed cd
---
I read it with the metal gear solid 2 trigger sound in my head.
---
Nice! I just jumped into the water and then ran along the shore
---
Warlock probably.  Mage could fit too.  Braindead is relative though, for lock you have to decide what to dot up that the tank can hold aggro and manage your pet.  I'm 25 so far, but finding it pretty involved.  Can't just dot everything, or I've had bad tanks, not quite sure yet.  Mage is more focused single target, but you've got to sheep stuff, or kite melee stuff with frost nova, etc.  Probably a little easier to play because you dont have a pet to manage.  Everyone loves a mage in a group, I find a warlock maybe a little less so.  At 26 your stripper gets seduce though, so it can work as a humanoid CC in lieu of sheep.
---
Str is still 2 in cat form. With heart of the wild talent maxed, 2.4 AP/strength. 
---
The reason agi is so good though is due to cat‚Äôs reliance on crit for double CP generation.
---
Was that by any chance in silverpine?
---
Is that a new spec in addition to holy and shadow? Poop damage!
---
I know how you feel. I usually offer free crafting at starting zones to level up my own profession by only requiring the exact amount of mats. You still get the job done and Everybody wins (+ you are helping others in the process.)
---
You don't need the killing blow to get the shard just need to be channeling drain soul when it dies as for the macro I just use 
---
#showtooltip immolation
---
/pet attack
---
/cast immolate
---
Just change the spell to what ever you want
---
Even...even if they added this to retail, it wouldn't be in classic, because we had to use addons for that in classic.

Horde don't even let other horde tame Echey. I have been prevented from becoming a total stereotype by some warlock who wanted to finish his quest or whatever :(
---
Just Remote Desktop and queue while you‚Äôre at work or whatnot. I‚Äôve spent 0 hours of actual play time in queue. I‚Äôm always in the server by the time I get home from work. Either that or get up early and join the server before the queue starts. I play on faerlina and queue doesn‚Äôt start till about 10am.
---
The people‚Äôs champion!
---
I litteraly made the same post hours ago and I got shouted down, so I deleted it, ahahah.
---
i thing 6 but i might be 7
---
I had a 10 minute wait one night at like 6pm.  And server is packed inside.  Right now it's perfect population. Although, there still are a lot of people.  I end up getting ahead of the groups in lvl.  Then I sleep and they catch back up.  So zones are packed again.
---
Lol why?
---
Dumb breathers continuing their existence in compliance with their biological programming. 
---
/s but not really...
---
But then how are you going to watch porn while you quest?
---
Osrs? And it's not even been a full week yet. We have no idea the douchebaggery that Activision is planning.
---
EXACTLY.
---
That's what I was saying, everyone can play how they want, he's brushing off as if there's nothing to do 1-59 it's pointless.
---
Honestly, you've totally jumped on the wrong person here, catch.
---
Same. All my old wow friends went Stalagg and get to play like 1 hour a day. I went to Thunderfury and play all day without issue. Server pop is even increasing a bit
---
This is the real wow classic experience.
---
Skill is pretty meh tbh too, hunters basically get hit cap for free
---
I was wondering it the /jump /sit flying macro is doable but i think that was fixed forever ago
---
Yep, vendor them all
---
I‚Äôm trying to remember but this is an OG site from Vanilla right?
---
Your untrustworthy kind murdered dozens of honest dwarven soldiers upon their arrival in Kalimdor. Why those umgak diplomats decided to ally with you after such an unforgivable act is beyond me; consider yourself lucky that our promises to them stops us from simply cutting every last one of you down on those grounds alone.
---
Id wait until your at the recommended level for whatever dungeon you want to try and let everyone know that its your first time tanking. Like someone else mentioned, running the dungeon as a DPS first should give you a better idea because you can watch what that tank is doing and how he is pulling.
---
Practice will help a lot in the long run and a lot of it will just be trial and error. Take your pulls small, be strategic, think carefully about each pull and if it might cause you to pull more then your group can handle. 
---
Good luck! :)
---
in classic mobs don't scale with your level. In general, anything within 3 levels is routinely doable. 4 levels higher is somewhat difficult, and 5 levels higher requires... extra care and strategy. Still possible, but not very fun or quick. The reasons for this are complicated and involve hit tables and resists. Basically anything higher than 3 levels has an unacceptably high spell resist rate and defense stat, making it very difficult to do damage.
---
 I remember how painful it was to level smithing as a warrior in vanilla. So this time I'll have my druid learned mining first so he can send all the ores to my warrior alt.   
---
I got like 20 stacks of bronze ores already. it's gotta be so sweet to level smithing to 90 in one go
---
I love giving people fear ward too. It's like I'm giving artificial courage.
---
Yeah you can but it‚Äôs expensive. Starts at 1g and goes up but resets after some time back to 1g.
---
Yea I don‚Äôt argue against that. It‚Äôs been years and years since I tried it. If I am not mistaken you had avatars and you walked around in a town of some sort yes?
---
Mine is from a barrens quest
---
Very this. Live you're just auto equipping whatever's a higher item level with little to no thought while questing. Classic I'm like shit, do I want lose 2 spirit for 2 more intel? Is that trade off worth?
---
At later levels it takes a good deal of whacking to get just one weapons level to go up. Or it used to anyway. So every little helps.
---
Pretty much the entire world is at this time.
---
Well, the principle that larger groups = less flexibilty isn‚Äôt something isolated to MMOs, it‚Äôs a general rule for organisations. Blizz, knowingly or not, designed a system that isn‚Äôt suited for large pre-formed groups. You can try to use simplistic arguments if that better suits you but the numbers don‚Äôt lie - there are huge groups of pre-formed guilds on all the ‚Äùfirst generation‚Äù servers that at the moment value their life as organisation over shorter queues. You can call that a poor choice or just say that they should have better discipline and just move intact but that isn‚Äôt how group-psychology works. They are there because those servers were the only ones available and ofc eventually some guilds will break and die and then the individuals can do choices. But it is a pity imo if Blizz lets this happen and instead they should offer transfers of these servers
---
this is the most ironic redit post ive seen in such a long time, you claim the guy to be claiming something he didnt
---
If u both roll NE you can start together otherwise you should meet up around lvl 5-10, which may take an hour to journey solo. I recommend just rolling NE and if you want to experience human start just roll a different char later.
---
He hade like 300 k right when getting into server
---
yeaa reading through these comments i thought i was the only one cringing right now.  just imagining a fully grown man rping on wow \*shudder\*
---
Chill man
---
Wtf
---
No need to go all ou offensive here because of a random streamer
---
You need a tracker for in-game steps
---
Shaman is an underrated tank. At least early on.
---
Ive been using battleshout to refresh buff on myself and any melee, should i use it more for threat? Also i never use demo shout do i need to?
---
Keanu doesn't like like talking down on people - Keanu Peeves
---
TAUREN IS LYFE
---
ahh of course, the first guy to hit 60 gets the most exposure obviously. What about the other salty players who abuse layering since launch?
---
Ever heard of speedrunning? Honestly how are yall so narrow minded? There are plenty of different ways to play games, especially a game like this one. 
---
Some people like to play the eco part, other pvp and another groupe Rp or pve. Obviously there will be some who will want to do all the quest while others will hit max lv asap. Some drop the game at 60, for others the "real content" just starts there.
---
Actually the best STV post yet
---
Good point, apologies /u/Mopper300.
---
cat is for fite!
---
Use the ah. Resources are selling like hot cakes.

do I need to buy a subscription first to see it?

This dude has a more attractive face than Cardi. She looks haggard as fuck without makeup pasted on her face.
---
\*\*creates female warrior named Rhondarousey\*\*
---
Me too! What a thrill.
---
iirc any /console command can also be done with a set in config file so it lasts between sessions
---
Agreed 100%
---
I read that shadow priests are supposed to melt faces and be almost unkillable in wpvp. Is it true? If yes, at what level does it start?
---
If yes, is it just against casters? In other words, does playing sp expose me to being the favorite target of rogues like in retail?
---
+20 healing means if you would have healed for 248, it now heals for 268
---
To everyone, apparently.
---
They did exactly this with artifact weapons...
---
Again, **PLEX is not the problem!** CCP has since added a real world money method of extracting skillpoints from characters to sell to other players which encourages botting and allows people to abuse the economy by pumping out highly skilled alts quickly that can use Rorquals etc.
---
To shreds you say?
---
I think the true gift of wow classic is all the fantastic memes
---
And when the lights come on, the mask and the urn are in the middle of the ring.
---
Virtually everyone on EU servers speaks english and I have no idea what you mean by cultural barrier. I am English and in a guild full of scandinavians, dutch, romanians etc and everyone speaks english and gets along just fine. Bear in mind if you want to raid etc on NA servers they are gonna be on a completely different time schedule to you
---
I mean... rage is our resource so it all makes sense.

Had a player named 'Daddy' whisper me 'Hey gurl, want me to fill you up'

Then proceeded to give me stacks of conjured water

I love him

Vuhdo-classic works 100%
---
Oh, for some reason I thought he was from TBC... 
---
Print screen would've been nice though.
---
right, I am asking for the folder with the files as I do not have it.
---
Look at that hair! XD  glad you guys are having fun! :)
---
I think you need to have an Active sub to WoW before you can see classic
---
At least then you can find your engineering
---
Reved as mage at harpies and he flooded my inventory with water yesterday. Like 60 of them.
---
On the other hand, I was running around with a warlock who was also mining, so what I did was hit the node once then let him have a hit. For the rest of the session we alternated hits on mining nodes and both profited and it was great.
---
If you're new, don't worry too much about that. Just pick one you like and stick with him up to 60.
---
"I" GAMON WILL- (gets shanked, dies)
---
Hey the gear only gets better for us warriors. And yea dungeon gear is nutty compared to quest gear.
---
This is most likely a photoshop!
---
If it's not, log a ticket....it's quite obviously a bug....
---
He means demo shout for threat generation, and absolutely yes you should
---
So it benefits lower tier spells more, thanks, is it the same for hot spells, such a renew?
---
Lol I did the same thing with The Butcher sword on my first character (warrior) in vanilla. https://wow.gamepedia.com/The_Butcher_(sword)
---
I remember when it dropped outside of SM and I was look oh cool new sword for me.
---
They had to protect Dr. Phil.
---
I've heard it called VC, but it was definitely a later trend.
---
isnt there a rare raptor in barrens too ?   
---
there is a rare wolf (dont remember its name) and an orange cat (the rake) in mulgore
---
Looking for:
---
* Maestro on Kirtonos
---
* Maestro on Faerlina
---
For trade:
---
* Maestro on Rattlegore
---
Yeah no offense but as long as they aren‚Äôt doing it all day, I don‚Äôt care. If you think I‚Äôm going to wait 3 hours in queue again just so i can get some food or get something done your nuts. Plus not all of us can just play all day or wait all day in queue.
---
How does pvp suck? Many people love battlegrounds and open world pvp in vanilla.
---
Same goes with raids. Just because it's more simple and slower paced doesn't mean it sucks.
---
Blizzard..PLEASE!
---
This is the Paladin thread my friend . ( I have no idea about spriests else I would answer)
---
Bear tank has the highest threat generation without having to work for it. Definitely gear agi over str even as a bear.
---
This is no different then the first image to 70 who had a raid group kill his tags. He got it in like 1 day
---
The problem is that now dungeons and raids in retail have different levels of difficulty.  Because the top 1% of player base got bored.  So it created a system where everything dropped purples to move through the difficulties.  
---
If anything, normal, heroic, and mythic should have different colors.
---
Or, they should cater to the majority of players and not the top 1% that want to push mythic content.  And that means that most raids can take anyone who knows how to play and it will be OK.  The raid won't be punished for having 5 people under geared.
---
I definitely agree with you! Mind helping me with it?
---
Won't be for a few weeks.  Rag requires a huge grind to summon.  The raid needs a lot of well geared players.  Without DM, it will be hard to get far, fast, in MC.  We won't see a full clear until October, minimum.
---
I thought so as well thanks for confirmation
---
Fanblis defending so much lol
---
No, I wasn't aware there were any.  I *have* seen all the things built for use in City of Heroes when that game released content-creation tools to the unwashed masses.  There were a few decent missions, but most of what was popular was stuff that packed the most XPs into the tightest possible space.
---
Without some way to vet content it'll tend mostly towards shit.
---
Female dwarf with dual big braids for swirly hair casting. The superior choice. The only choice.
---
Saw someone called Hexoffender earlier.
---
He gets world first WoW classic 60. But that doesn't supplant world first WoW 60. Two totally different things. Its a mechanic in the game, so he gets it.
---
i find it actually funny since Hitler has no HKs at all.
---
I guess you are right, could have sworn they switched to the rouge ap formula in cat form
---
You can relog freely. You save your spot for about 5 minutes. I constantly relog to get new addons
---
Orc is the best race for PvP, if you are thinking about this now, I‚Äôd reroll now instead of regretting it later on.
---
Read Reddit he needed on it but didn‚Äôt win.
---
Big mood.
---
No point in using thunder clap til max rank, it‚Äôs actually pretty bad I hate it
---
lmao, relog fixes that probably, i joined a small guild not long after i started, a scouting guild? HUH? I know new to me too, i was like wtf when i found out but yea totally great idea but what they are doing is they group up with you, get a feel for you, then ask you to join the scouting guild but you don't know it and if you meet all the descent player, knows wtf they are doing, actually plays as in not f'ing fisher price wanna be poser, decent person blablabla yadayad requirements as in passed, you get invited to the big one lmao blew me the f away, but yeah fantastic screening process. Legendary guild tbh.
---
Anyway to the point lol, haha, when i joined the real one, the guild info was all f'ed up, i'm thinking well i thought i joined this big one and it's no bigger then the one i left and same name too, but the people names were different, quick re log and whoa! ok that's allot of people wholly f!
---
You'll be fine.
---
Thanks everyone,  I appreciate you guys taking the time to write these responses  Have a great day!
---
Clothie can make mad money from tailoring/enchanting, using cloth to make greens to get enchant mats to sell or use
---
But it doesn't really matter right now. The market will continue to flux wildly, so just go with what works. 
---
Its definitely not too late to switch, tracking both of those could get old... but so would going back for low levels to skin. 
---
Tldr just do whatever works till 60 and then think about what's best
---
Every weapon is a rogue weapon\*

I used to share this quest at the beginning of every AV

Yup get back from work at 4:30 and getting herod queues up to 10k+ insane.

Questie and Dominos
---
I don't think it's in the alternate reality version. I think it's just Outland.
---
No, I did all the beginning quests.
---
It was very laggy though being the first hour or two of release ( I was logged in early and didn't have to queue, at first) and so many players bouncing around I must have missed something.
---
In the queue now to investigate. Thanks
---
What Addon do you use for health/mana bars? Also where can I get it
---
If it's profitable, they'll do it. If the entire classic community wants X content, they'll make it as long as they expect a heavy profit from making it
---
This is not the model that makes money.
---
Or being overwhelmed by three trash mobs only to have friendlies come out of the woodwork to help you..... even fighting mobs that they won't get any credit for :O

The ole stubbs

Guilty.
---
Been rolling with my girl Pooky since I started playing.
---
This is the reason 70% of us can‚Äôt get in
---
So do you just not do quests as a mage? Once you get blizzard or something do you just aggro big packs and aoe them down rinse and repeat and skip quests?
---
Mograine had a 6.5k queue 4 hours ago when I queued up. It's about to pop now.
---
Oh yeah, absolutely. They look great in plate and tier. Tier 3 is amazing.
---
As a Paladin, I was enjoying Shaman up until I got my totems, taking up all my bag slots...that free bag slot free mount sounding real nice now
---
I've seen Analwrecker and Drinkcum running around.
---
If he is 59 then yes..he is about to hit 60. That is crazy fast since most of the people who have been playing a lot in the past couple days are mid to high 40s.
---
This is what I am leaning towards as well. Keep 60, slowly expand the world. Preserve Classic mechanics.
---
.As long as there are those that remember what was, there will always be those, that are unable to accept what can be. They will resist.
---
Left of passage
---
Do you have any idea what the queues would be like without layering?
---
holy shit i thought it was a sword!!
---
nice man!
---
I would disagree. I like vanilla. I don't like the new vanilla that has mold masquerading as chocolate chips, even though by earing them I'm able to eat more ice cream than I could if I just ate vanilla.
---
&gt;This is why we said it was bad
---
Wow if farming rares and chests was your only problem with it I think we are good to go
---
LOL this is awesome!

Selling a game without wanting to do game development?  You think blizzard is just one dude in his basement?

U can try /who 10

So u can see al on your lvl
---
Simple, yet effective
---
Only on the base, too. Doesn't boost sp to renew.
---
Nah, and I am going to get team viewer today so I can log on at work at noon and stay connected all afternoon.
---
Blizzard is a bad company these days so these server issues are not surprising in the least.   Too bad they own all the Warcraft IP.
---
I see this one plays stellaris as well. I approve.
---
That just means that hunters can need on a shitload more stuff than anyone else, and screws other classes out of rolling for BoEs.
---
Blizzard has said themselves though, that they make the bulk of their money from transactions and not subs. That‚Äôs undeniable.
---
An orc with a red dragon whelp, very WC2 nice
---
Nah u1 is right this is shit and the tough part has been done 15 years ago. Those stupid streamers achievements are disposable and worth 0.
---
Care to provide proof, or is it just an assumption?
---
Also, a great many low level rares (which fits the level range of most players) only offer greens, many which are lackluster. So they are DE fodder, like an ass ton of greens are already being treated.
---
Okay.
---
will you care when that guy will have 100+ black lotus by monday using the same tactic ?
---
Just admit youre wrong. Layering is fucking up the game.
---
It's because our world as we know it is a giant simulation, not unlike WoW.
---
Depends certain guilds are going to be and act untouchable. Others will have B or C raid teams or alt nights where they will bring and gear people not on their A team and teach people to get good. In vanilla it also wasn't uncommon for the super elite guilds to have farm guilds, which they treated like minor league baseball.
---
This is very true, happened like 3 times in 14 levels.
---
I hate that mythic + ended up being a timed thing. I would have just prefered scaling dificulty waith scaling rewards.
---
That's petty and selfish of you
---
That worked thanks!

It‚Äôs really amazing the difference in feel now. Rather than questioning each mob I‚Äôm now like letsss gooooo

So, you probably leveled to 10 with daggers, right? Since there's little to no swords early, plus you need training (unless you started orc or something, assuming you're undead you need sword training). Well, your sword skill is probably still low. Weapon skill = higher chance to hit. Once your swords is caught up to your dagger skill you will hit more most likely.
---
Also, you will miss higher level enemies more. So if you're fighting stuff a few levels higher you will miss.
---
Hit rating is important for rogues and stuff however you basically won't see any hit rating on gear til pretty much 50+ dungeons. Your best bet while leveling is to keep your weapon skills up, and grab Precision in the combat tree.
---
Remote desktop. Dont be a douche and bot. Just get in line from work.
---
I usually stick to Silverpine until I'm about 15-17 then head to the barrens. I personally hate the barrens, it's too spread out, but you'll hit a wall in silverpine at some point in my experience.
---
squadW
---
Yeah, sometimes you need a little rock!
---
Not sure why. This reminds me of leveling in Vanilla WoW with a holy priest. Pet was our tank. Taught us both how to manage agro really well. Anyhow.. Carry on lol
---
TBC &gt; WotLK.
---
WotLK had the strongest talents in the last row, so you pretty much had get the last point in one talent tree (I think assasination rogue was the only one that you could skip if you went PvP).
---
During TBC you could go "elemental mage" which was half frost half fire. Or sl/sl warlock.  You didn't need the last talent to be competitive, and that opened a lot more builds
---
you're ok as troll. even if you do get stunned in PvP, there are diminishing returns. blood craze only affects melee AP so if you go elemental or resto, you're not gonna get it's full benefit.
---
TLDR holy fuck. It‚Äôs a mix of the two, and nostalgia is a big influencer on bringing people back, but classic is still a super solid game on its own.
---
Just finished my first listen while on lunch break. Pneuma is probably my favorite track.
---
They could just open up new retail servers where nobody can transfer.  So people can just start over again. Like once a year.  And keep the servers gated with progression.  Combine old servers with low populations.  
---
Just keep rotating people into whatever content they want to be in.  When a server gets to a new xpac, you can buy a lvl 60 toon for when BC content releases for example.  So you can start with everyone else.  
---
But it would have to be like a new server every 2 years or something.  And then the older ones might just have people stop playing once they reached an xpac they didn't like.
---
Upside down and back to front... help.
---
You can find casual guilds that will let you raid as Rey but it‚Äôs few and far between. Also that means that your raid comp is probably not strong over all and you‚Äôll be more likely to have wipes/take longer. It really just depends on what‚Äôs fun to you but I will say that 20/0/31 is enough to make you a great healer and carrying a second gear set is not the end of the world.
---
I healed RFC twice yesterday doing something similar. Kept flametongue imbue up, drop stoneskin on any group pulls, and save mana for only healing or using R1 earthshock to silence the casters. Felt more useful than just sitting in the back casting a heal once in a while.
---
4-6 months? I‚Äôm thinking it could take me a year before I hit 60 and I‚Äôm even playing a Warlock. I could play this game for multiple years in its current state and still be ok. There just isn‚Äôt another game that I can immersive myself in quite like Classic. I actually enjoy the leveling process though and have no intentions of raiding. Once I have my dungeon set, my character will feel complete.
---
I was hoping Anthem could fill that void but we know how that went. Maybe Diablo 4?

Oh dear.
---
Yeah all my friends wanted to be cool and play on the streamer server. I pleaded no, but was outvoted. They are all lvl 20 and above now. Because they don't really have to many responsibilities outside of there jobs. Meanwhile i havent stepped foot into classic yet. I have contimplated going to a diff server but i really dont want to play without my friends.
---
lol ok side of salt with that plate of salt please.

The average level of my sever when I looked was around 18.
---
Downfall of wow was the xpacs and flying mounts.    Let‚Äôs fly over the world and avoid the Warcraft.    WPVP=vanilla
---
IIRC there's a plaque around there also talking about that the crown was lost.
---
As a habitual Alliance player, that blood stain is still one of my favorite details in the game.  It's just so... visceral.
---
It‚Äôs amazing experience, but I can‚Äôt imagine how boring and repetitive it must be.  It‚Äôs one thing to run 5s, but 10s, ugh.  I guess everyone has their own way to play.  Just doesn‚Äôt feel classic at all.
---
As others have already said, yes every even numbered level new skills will become available for you at the trainers.
---
FYI you will also need to eventually buy skills for your pet, especially growl.
---
I dig the smaller size. My g910 is so damn huge.
---
You're reaching again.
---
It's not the same thing at all. Just stop lol.
---
It can‚Äôt just be nostalgia, I never played vanilla and I like classic. Also I got my first shoulder ads today! Level 15 leather and they‚Äôre grey! :D
---
Asshole move.
---
First he slays Method and now he slays Asmon, entire retail community brought to their knees by a SINGLE (1) bald gnome.
---
Are you in?
---
You will always be the target of rogues. Spriests have no way to remove poisons and slows, which makes them especially tough. Not many CCs, slows, interrupts. 
---
With that being said, they are incredibly strong and can beat people who outgear them easily. Once they're out of mana they're pretty much screwed.
---
I work during the day.
---
Don't get defensive. If you don't want to get clapped back don't spread random "LaYeRiNg AbUsE lMaO" nonsense based on five minutes of watching what has been an incredibly impressive and well-thought-out run that obviously took a ton of planning and practice.

I agreed to go to a wedding on Sunday as some girls date but I'm just gonna say I'm playing wow classic and can't make it lmao.

Great work - nails it on the head.

Doesn‚Äôt seem to have made a dent on Gehennas tbh
---
All relative to how fast he‚Äôs gaining exp compared to others. Compared to someone playing casually, he‚Äôs close.
---
The only thing I didn't like about Cata talents was being locked into a specific tree until you spent, I think, 31 points. 
---
RIP hybrid builds.
---
Lucky his character name's too blurry to really see
---
I'm on Grobbulus!
---
Or every few months, as retail is now.
---
Np!
---
It's one of my never uninstalls :-)
---
Yeah Gehennas is still crazy.
---
The majority of us are taking it slow and having fun. I could never be a streamer with the pressure of being first all the time. Just seems like a full out job and no fun.
---
Need Before Greed is where you cant need on an leather item or 2h sword as a mage. or the warrior can't need on a leather item. 
---
It's a bit flawed in classic since most leather items, also are very good for warriors and most cloth items very good for Resto Druids/Shamans and Holy Paladins
---
I mean that's kinda the story of WoW right?
---
I feel like this was me.
---
Why is bad for him to make use of what‚Äôs available? First people were saying he was 2 people, what they gonna cry about next?
---
Its not solely about spells I won't play current WoW ever again since it uses an random party finder and forcing a quest tracker and a shitload of other conveniences to you, all of these features originated from mods and since they realised so many players are using these conveniences nontheless they eventually implemented it for everyone, regardless if they would like to.
---
Opening the API for third party tools was the biggest mistake the devs ever done. People were getting accustomed to these benefits the tool provided who take more and more decision making of you away and were demanding from blizzard to offer conveniences like that as well. Now where pandoras box has been opened you can never close it again. WoW is dead, to me and lot of ther players, classic will eventually meet the same fate if this keeps going. Player wo complain about current WoW and using mods, don't get that are indirectly guilty of this too.
---
I was foretelling this 10 years ago, look where we are now. People will never learn that they are part of the problem too. Go and play bfa again but leave classic to the people who enjoy it for what it is, for people who don't need to modify their experience to seek fun.
---
Fuck barrens, do SP
---
Lol,  you're not smart, you're just an asshole.  Learn to time the queue right and you can be ready to go when you get home.
---
he‚Äôs number one on twitch. $ gained.
---
Yesterday, I quested as a Hunter with a Warrior in Barrow Den in Trldrassil - you wanna talk about low drop chance? The fucking SHAMAN CHARM! We must have killed 30+ shamans before we got it - we nearly gained a level (like 80% of a level) just by killing shit in those god forsaken dens!
---
Anime powers?
---
No the problem here is hes abusing a game mechanic that isn't intended. That is not allowed now imagine if he did this to farm gold he would destroy an entire server. What hes doing is not OK and people don't see it because they're not very bright
---
Thank you. It's so weird seeing people value cosmetic stuff so much and then saying "lol it's okay as long as it's just cosmetic".
---
theres no queue at 4 am
---
How do you get that one? it dosen't appear in the twitch addon menu
---
Maybe some people did but it wasn't close to as common ad it is now, not to mention there was little to no hype when new servers were launched so it wasn't like people would prep hard for it
---
Leap into the water and use seal form :P
---
Great choice! Good luck out there! Don't get discouraged if you run into A holes, there's always a few bad apples but most are happy to teach if you ask for help, in your first dungeon for example. Deadmines is right around the corner for you and is still my favorite dungeon in classic.  You're in for a good time!
---
AFK kick timer is 30 mins to the character select screen and then another 30 mins before you're actually DCed. If you can't eat your food or take a shit in an hour you have something wrong with you.
---
That being said Menethil harbor is in a sorta weird spot being outside of Lorderon. I suppose the family might have owned and/or come from that area though.
---
Damn that's brutal.

Me . Same . Hit lvl 6 last night
---
Lol they must not have gone through sensitivity training!
---
Been testing how lomg it takes in shazz server its around 2k players per hour and slowing down
---
the gp price for bonds is almost nothing if you are playing the endgame, people who are dumb enough to purchase bonds for real money to buy gear are not smart at all.
---
and yeah, i'd imagine jagex made bonds in a way to sort of kill the buying gp for real money and such, all though Venezuelans won't give up.

I live in a house where multiple people play and I play at work and from another IP as well.

They nerfed ranks of spells learned before lvl 20. A priest learns rank 1 flash heal at 20, so this barely meets the criteria for keeping its best coefficient. However, renew rank 2 is learned before lvl 20, so it gets the nerfed coefficient. This makes rank 3 the lowest rank to get an unnerfed coefficient.

I used to raid it even when we were in BT just because I loved it. It was my favorite raid apart from BT and I wish more content was available like it. I even got Attumens mount too!

Solution is to make it so you have to be in an Inn before your can hop layers...
---
Lmao imagine thinking retail requires consumables
---
This guy &gt;_&lt;
---
He started laying around level 58 after he started getting targeted by pvpers, before this he wasn't. 
---
So even before he started layering he was super ahead of everyone's. Chad gnome Vs virgin method.
---
Using an in game feature isn't cheating  or unfair. Everyone else can use it too.
---
He found the most effective way to gain xp. Super impressive
---
Hold up dude, some servers(mine) light leather is selling for the same price on AH as it would be to vendor, so you're losing money.
---
But.. Why would I want something that's just gonna take up inventory space? I need that space for my mad farms..
---
as u/FarWoods already posted, make sure you are wisely managing your mana by not always spamming highest ranks of heals, especially when it will overheal.
---
Learn how to use the 5second rule for mana management. After you cast a spell, you will not start regenerating mana again for 5 seconds. So if your tank or dps arent in danger of dying immediately you dont have to constantly top them off. Just heal them up to a comfortable level and then white attack things for a little bit while you try to regenerate mana.
---
They are just doing a classic stream to take advantage of the hype. I doubt they thought that they were the only ones who could win a race to 60 and its good for the game to have an org like Method playing it.
---
They sure did stick to the roots of classic wow
---
Yeah I've done P99 for a couple of years while also doing the new TLPs. Think I'm done with it lol. Can only do the same things so many times!
---
Going from expansion to expansion everything gear related etc is made irrelevant already... So not much would change.
---
Indd how?
---
Itll take weeks to farm the dungeon set, TIME GATING
---
Do it! 
---
Despite the frustration I enjoy the hell out of it. 
---
Most guys just need a reminder on threat mechanics and for some it‚Äôs their first time so it‚Äôs a learning experience.

Warden was useless back in vanilla/TBC at least. If you played from a guest account on your PC Warden was unable to detect anything.

Hey guys, I love WoW First off. I started playing during WOLK and played until start of legion. I havn't played in about half a year to a year though. I used to play only druid with dabbling in the new classes. I know druid isn't that strong for classic in the sense of what I want to do. i used to resto heal. I am wondering with classic what is a good solo leveling class with good dps/ decent survivability. I am mainly used to healing so would pally or shaman be a good fit for me since with paladin I can switch from dps to healing? Would it work like that in classic? Would love some input. Thanks!
---
I don't care. It's not my fault blizzard can't fix this. If I didn't log early in the morning, I couldn't play when I get off from work. I'm selfish when I wanna play? Aight.
---
That's me in the queue, I was on first thing this morning,had to go out so came home and had a 3k queue. Came back and hour later and the queue had disconnected. Put myself back I to the queue to a 13k queue. Went upstairs for an hour sleep, came downstairs to a disconnected queue again.
---
13k queue again.
---
It takes you an hour to get fully kicked from the server. 30 mins to character select and then 30 mins before you get DCed. 
---
Don't bullshit people who know better.
---
Using an in game feature isn't cheating or unfair. Everyone else can use it too.
---
He found the most effective way to gain xp. Super impressive.
---
Hes the world first level 60, you're malding mate LULW
---
Now you can have a sex with your gf.... Something positive :)
---
YEEES
---
Couldn't care less. This isn't retail where nothing matters until max level. I'm enjoying the experience and in no hurry. I also have a job, wife, and kids... didn't have the latter two when I played vanilla.
---
I do have some add-ons but none are for macros.
---
You're not going to do insane damage, but ret is viable. You can do more dps than people say you can, but you need to bring consumes to every fight and be 110% prepared. The spec is an uphill battle, but one you can win with effort. You need more consumables than other players in your raid, but fortunately, ret has a very easy time aoe farming with a shield spike, retri aura, and consecration. You can back to back SM runs and make a few gold every run, even if you just vendor all the greens and cloth. If you want to AH sell that shit, you can make more. 
---
Ret's got a full support kit in the DPS position, so it's kind of underrated if you play it right. If you play ret right, you can save your raid and be very, very useful. Even as a DPS, you need to focus on your utility as your primary purpose. I'm playing ret, I intend to use Nightfall. I'm gonna be a buff bitch and I'm not expecting to do fantastic DPS, I'm expecting to be an asset to my raid and a core memeber of my guild. As a ret, you need to be the guy who can get the job done and solve encounters through intangible benefits. Buffs and debuffs are your priority before damage, but you can do damage. 
---
If you stick it out to Naxx, you get to use Exorcism and Holy Wrath, at that point, you need to relegate Nightfall to a Wing Clip spamming hunter so you can pick up a fat 2h weapon and start doing real DPS.
---
Except it only really matters if you just swapped to a weapon type you haven't used in a while.
---
The important thing here is that you're not just beating the queues, you're adding to them substantially while afk.
---
Short legs!
---
My wife and i started again together and we are able to get. in 2-2.5 hours a night in after the kids are in bed(we are not able to play every night granted) and we are having a great time.  We will level at our pace and eventually raid when we get there.  Something great about how rads worked is that if someone made an alt, they normally have to go through the raid teirs in order to gear, so even if we are slow, by the time we get there, we ahould still have the other slow pokes as well as the faster people's alta to play with.
---
He‚Äôs been growing it out for a year.

Such a bad influence on the Classic community, such a terrible person!
---
you can run multiple copies from the blizzard launcher. just click cancel on the 2nd copy as it is loading initially. this will kick you back to the login screen and let you log in with different account credentials
---
But its still just artificially slowing it down....

Centaur fucking Bracers
---
They named a whole server after my favorite WoW weapon. Wooooohoo
---
guns have best stats for warriors in general.  I remember the high level ones having str/sta
---
Same thing happened to a lot of us day 1. Logged into Herod; only to get booted after hitting level 2 into a 23,000 person Que. Instantly switched servers.
---
Nobody throws a dwarf!
---
how? How has a streamer impacted ur gameplay in any way?
---
It's right click by default.  Left click just selects.

stop malding

They're trying to be twitch famous and build off that. If they want to wreck their brains and sleep cycles for a chance to be the next go to  wow streamer, go for it. Any of us can quit our jobs, live off noodles and give it a shot. We just have morals. Sorry if that offends anyone.

The AH was still around 20s, vendor was only 8.

I will buy them!
---
7pm here. Eu servers.
---
I'm still friends with the guys I met during vanilla. I've even met some of them IRL through weddings, trips, etc. (And almost all of them are now playing classic!)
---
I haven't had the time to play classic yet, but if it it's anything like vanilla, you'll have plenty of opportunities to make some friends. The game is structured to foster cooperation.
---
oh shit, wow, thank you so much
---
Haven‚Äôt servers been merged in the past? Or am I wrong
---
Imo stance mastery is basically mandatory for warriors in classic. I even consider "leveling prot" to be 10 into arms for that, then going prot.
---
Is someone 60 already?
---
Yeah I hit 1g, dropped to 50s, back up to 1.2g and back down to 80s. Skills are pricey and ammo adds up, especially because I've gotten guns and bows as upgrades so I had to totally swap ammo.
---
Dont know what to tell you. Blizzard has said there is a cooldown. If it's not working report it. Nothing else for us to do.

The number of servers isn't the issue. People not wanting to restart from level 20-40 (along with trying to convince their friends, their friends friends, etc to switch).

Remote desktop.  Take control of your computer remotely and queue up.

I know which one is balling out on Code Red and Doritos this weekend....amirite?
---
I guess, if you have no idea how to configure addons
---
I mean, people have been saying that for years, it's not a new subject at all... 
---
That said, I obviously agree with you, but like pointed out before, this is just part of the problem, the last couple expansions have had restrictions on the flying and there's still many things that break from having social interactions.
---
\&gt; Or not being the hero of the story. 
---
There are indeed a lot of game-players who want this kind of experience.  One thing that hurt WoW is that this sort of experience is available from lots of games, now more than ever (especially on phone-based games), and is also not conducive to the sort of community-based collaborative game that earlier WoW was.  In other words, WoW has become more and more like numerous other games, and these are games that often do not require a monthly subscription or a desktop/laptop computer to play.
---
BFA is the xpac that finally got me to quit retail(not just taking a break while I did something else for a while), been playing since feb 2005. They have turned the game I loved from a MMORPG into an RNG fest that resembles ARPGs which makes sence. Since alot of the current devs came from diablo 3.  If you like that, more power to you, but I much preferd the game when more resembled an RPG.  In my opinion(subjective I know), BFA is the worst expansion they have released to date.

It‚Äôs still annoying used correctly though.

Tuesday was literally the first time I've ever touched an MMO. I was about to die getting hit by 2 enemies at once, so I ran, I saw a group of higher level players on the road and typed "HELP!"

They literally ran over and saved me. Coming from Starcraft, PUBG, and Halo as most of my online multiplayer experience it was pretty neat.

I‚Äôm talking in regards to the insane queue times on that server. (Last time i tried it was a 24k player queue)

I think this is like arguing that the SMB1 world record speedrun is pointless because someone 20+ years ago beat SMB1 for the first time.
---
The original world first is a great achievement but was limited to a small group of hopefuls that got to practice in Alpha/Beta.
---
The new race in Classic is a big deal because of how accessible the game has been for a long time. It's basically a multi-day speedrun race in action.
---
Man I hope they somehow provide the polls for voting this kind of stuff to people who are greatly involved into the game... I dunno how they could make it work and be fair but I know for sure you are correct: the mass doesn't know what's good for the game.

You're right, it's hopeless.

It's pointless to try. 
---
Just abandon the quest. 
---
What kind of advice are you looking for here, man?
---
Depends on the person.
---
For some, a set of armor they buy from a cash shop would never be as cool as one they earned in-game.  Ditto for mounts bought vs. earned.  I'd bought some of the mounts for WoW in the past, but they tend to not get used much, as I end up using mounts that show off something I've done in-game.  (Flying around on a Violet Proto-Drake during Children's Week feeds my sadistic side so much.)
---
But if someone else thinks the armor looks cool and wants it, that's a part of how they enjoy the game.  Which wouldn't much matter because they'd still be crap in raids if they aren't earning actual gear that helps.
---
Whatever server method is on most likely
---
Maybe it's amazing the 1st time you do it. Or you really enjoy reading the quests, learning the lore, and, exploring the zones. That's obviously fine. 
---
But on the other hand alot of people leveled several 60s during Vanilla so leveling now is just meh.
---
I don't get why anytime someone talks about quickly leveling they are always shot down with "ZOMG lvling is amazing, it should take you 6 months to hit 60 how dare you quickly lvl up". 
---
Different people enjoy different things.
---
Haven‚Äôt hated going to bed this much since Christmas ‚Äò92..
---
I have a hard time even with Asmon because he comes off as very self-centered and selfish in terms of gear, etc... - which to some degree he has license to do because of all his viewers.
---
My go-to for Classic right now is TimTheTatMan - I watched him a lot during Fortnite the past year and now he is leveling a Rogue on the Horde side (he's level 27 or around there at the moment).  Between him, DrLupo and Cloaksy they have a pretty entertaining crew they run with.

No that's the retail version only
---
Remote desktop. That way you join queue from another device, say your phone or work computer. Its like screen sharing your home pc.
---
Retail is, classic is not
---
Are they on NA?
---
That‚Äôs only retail WoW
---
My RL buddy is pissed because I switched from Stalagg on day 3. It was either wait 5 hours to play with friends that are already 10 levels ahead of me, or join a new server with a discord group I could actually play with. Easy choice.
---
I'm frustrated tbh. But yeah I should stop doing these quests.
---
wholesome chat is wholesome
---
You don't need to be deep prot until you are raiding.
---
I read earlier that his /played was only 14 hours less than when Classic dropped. Is he taking turns with somebody else?
---
its not hard im pretty lame, as evidenced by my bad joke
---
Based on my experience in pservers, it sounds like large part of the population from them. Edgy children who think homophobia, sexism and racism is hilarious. I'd just report them if I saw them now, I haven't played on Blizzard servers for many years, but I assume they're stricter on that than the average pserver?
---
It's capped at standard so 100 I think maybe 120.

---
why not start with tailoring? why lategame?
---
He is abusing layering. BUT, he is still the physical embodiment of everything Classic, since launch he has only been BOT playing for 14hours... 3 hours of sleep only. If anything we should be proud of him for having such a commitment to this game we all love
---
That's for retail. Classic requires an active subscription.
---
Fund**
---
See classic as an add on to your regular sub, buy the normal game and get the whole of classic for free.
---
You need a subscription to play.
---
&gt;  I proceeded to farm for another 40min before finally seeing that gem drop. I ran all the way back to turn in, before I realized that my bag was full and I never looted.
---
Oh super RIP
---
Why port to 60?  Why not just keep arms to 60?
---
As long as you keep mana, you can tank pretty well.  Your threat gen goes to zero without mana.  You also don't have a taunt, which is a big drawback.  
---
They fixed both issues in BC.  Pallies got a tiny bit of mana back every time they got healed, and they got a taunt (IIRC).
---
Yeah same thing here. I really hope they have transfers (free or not) in the future to fix that
---
I'm not playing wow myself right now, but back in the day you would simply ask in chat 'can I need on that?' Need rolling before asking or at least alerting people that you were going to need was frowned upon. People who rolled need constantly, or waited to roll need after everyone else had greeded were usually kicked from groups because you knew that person was a [ninja looter](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Loot_ninja). Needing on something with the intent to disenchant it, when another need roller in the group actually intended to use that item was also a no no. Thats how it was on my server at least, I don't know if its different now with classic.
---
So your solution is to have 6 different servers with 6 different communities merge into one server. One of the huge selling points of going back to classic was to bring back that sense of community and you think smashing 6 of them together will end well?
---
Joker beat Joana's time on private servers by a decent margin already, no layering involved. He was also in first before he started doing that.
---
I'm not thrilled about it either, but let's be realistic here.
---
Huh, that's my wall paper
---
Damn that's some quality right there. He is so going to delete his 60 as soon as he gets it
---
&gt; And you usually get an item that is complete garbage by the time you're done.
---
While I agree with the first part. You're keeping this weapon for 10 to 15 levels.
---
Classic had addons also...
---
Yep.  Ive played on both on retail over the years, and with warmode on and off.
---
Its been nice to just run around in peace and only have to worry about mobs coming out of nowhere to slaughter you, or people stealing your chests/mob tags.
---
During my hours there‚Äôs no que, top notch server
---
I can move it with dominos!
---
That's what I initially thought, but I also hear a lot of people saying to ALWAYS need a BOE to prevent ninja looting, because gold from selling is valuable to everyone, and you never know if the guy will not end up using it and just selling it. I think they're fair points, but I ultimately agree with only needing if you can use it
---
Oh? I'd love to hear you explain this one.
---
Thanks. Yeah I know what it is I just couldn‚Äôt think of what the abbreviation RD stood for.
---
he got the world record anyway on light's hope. but yeah this sucks
---
Nah, they need to increase server capacity some more. 
---
Paying customers shouldn't have to do this type of shit to play what they are paying to play. 
---
You're mad at the wrong people.
---
Cap it lower (say 60) see if it still happens. Also check to make sure the cap works for those screens (shadowplay options, OBS or something to show fps).
---
Lol that's also the #1 piece of advice I've seen everywhere. 
---
Are people cool with losing the pet DPS the entire time?Or do I just do the dismiss thing only?
---
Was thinking I don't turn taunt on, keep it on passive so only attacks what I say so once I assist the tank. And don't send it in until tank gets aggro?
---
Hard to ditch mechanics from other games lol.
---
No one's running anything. 
---
It's for bragging rights
---
going all out for 4 days and then getting world first, haters be damned, sounds fun as hell
---
Crap, I saw the first article but read over the most important bit. Thank you!
---
TIL.
---
Now these toxic players won‚Äôt be able to escape my rez!
---
I love this month. WoW Classic. New Tool album. New (surprisingly okay) Slipknot album? It's bizarre.
---
You're right
---
Because I have blink, suckaaaaaaaaaa
---
Agreed. I see 40+ people just afk-ing there for hours. It‚Äôs bullshit like that that is keeping queue times up.
---
"Plain Letter" /cry, nothing plain about that I tell ya...
---
I've been pleasantly surprised with the chats on Sulfuras alliance side.  Pretty slow overall but generally not much toxicity at all
---
Could be, but even if it's a 1000 people per realm that could be an hour of queue time.
---
I make it a habit to logout every night when I'm done, then remote desktop in to my home PC from work about 6 hours before I'll be ready to play as that's the typical queue. 
---
I spend my time away from my computer waiting in queue, not taking up a slot.  Either way I'm not playing, so might as well let someone else have the spot.
---
blizzards community managers and development leads aren't in touch  with how the game works, never have been
---
What about this? its not software or macro :P
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKAkw5oRUpo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKAkw5oRUpo)
---
Nah I haven't, but the general/trade chats I've seen haven't really been bad for me either.
---
This is correct. All other weapon skills cost 10s.
---
Nope. In my experience it's almost always been a general agreement that if it's a valuable BoE, everyone rolls the same. Everyone should have the opportunity to get it, because it has the exact same monetary value for everyone.
---
Yes, 1 trainer in 1 city has better/more recipes than the others.
---
There is another tailoring trainer. That 1st one should say something like he can't teach you anymore, go find this person who taught them.
---
That second person will have the next set of items.
---
Right now, I log on and I don't see the same person twice. 
---
For every argument layering has, there's 10 good ones against it.
---
After the first whisper I felt I needed more. I'd have missed out on this with "yw".
---
So... just release a new realm every few months?
---
Yeah, there's like nothing to do at lvl 60. They surely quit
---
me and my buddies have sold multiple sub lvl 20 greens for 20-40s. Some people just want those upgrades now. I put a nice lvl 12 req two hander with + stam +str on the ah and it sold so fast. I know that warrior was like "I'm coming for your head now fizzle".
---
Not almost, bus by far until level 29 corpsemaker in rfk
---
So where is the line and why are you the one deciding on that?
---
Forreal, I've seen groups of 5 level 10's going around trying to kill harvest watchers like they are goddamn raid bosses
---
Losing a small amount of damage isn‚Äôt that big of a deal when compared to possible annoyances of a pet.
---
Oh wow.
---
The best thing about talents in Vanilla is the CHOICE to do what you want to.
---
Weapon Specializations for Rogue's and Warriors for Example, is one of those things. Do you HAVE to choose Sword/Mace/Axe Specialization? No... but the fact I can CHOOSE to play the way I want to... is what makes all the difference.
---
Too bad he wasn't on opposite faction so you could punish him.
---
And there were bugs and exploits reported, and there were fixes.
---
The nada nothing zilch zero none , best addon there is, version 1.13.2.31687.
---
wrath was peak wow.  Most players subscribed.  I bet we will see it in 4 or 5 years.
---
Yes, but bonds are a good thing as others have said. OSRS has no shitty MTX cosmetics or MTX boosts like retail.
---
You must have expensive taste in memes.
---
Name checks out.
---
Hardly any on Ashkandi. The Horde side had some spammers in general chats but I ended up rolling Alliance with friends; nothing crazy so far.
---
WoTLK was as good as BC though. It was everything after that, which tore the community to shreds. Based simply off sub numbers. Cata was a trainwreck, MoP didn't fix it, and everything since then has been one giant clusterfuck of stat squeeze.
---
I only started robbing people a couple months ago so I'm a good person still, right?
---
POM pyroblast?
---
I would drop mining or herb for skinning, only because I would be annoyed switching between find herbs and find minerals all the time.
---
I know that's really what I should do but I would still like to have the structure of a proper path to go down looking at all of the potential paths I can take but not knowing which one I should take is part of the thing that can give me early burnout.
---
Nah, more talking about jumping between parties to negate Mon respawn timers.
---
Camped for a week at that damn tree as a nelf hunter in vanilla, worth it though.
---
He was laughing while typing that out
---
How do u delete all the art stuff from the blizzard ui and put everything so tiny in the corner?
---
The thing is, by tying WoW classic to their regular subscription, actiblizz will just pat themselves on the back and say how great the retail game is and do that even more.
---
And dance naked on top of a mailbox

Not even an Orc sham or Undead priest... a TROLL SHAMAN... merry her IMMEDIATELY my friend.
---
fuck off
---
he's a talented player and deserves it you do whatever it takes to win. the problem is layering
---
She hasn't been exposed to the evils yet.
---
His char isn't offline 8 hours a night, so he isn't sleeping 8 hours a night. He also did a 39 hour session at launch lol.
---
You can tank as 31/5/15 for the entire first phase, maybe even for BWL depending on how competitive your guild wants to be.
---
he didnt start that until level 58
---
Ah, neat. I'd seen a lot of them around, but that one stood out.
---
I think it's from WWE

---
gold is tight for people i would imagine at the moment, hard to put a price on it.

---
Society has changed lol, it is much more acceptable to take time off work to play games now, playing video games doesn't necessarily mean you are a nerd anymore, I was well informed relative to my peers during vanilla and it was not the same. During vanilla wow I was in a semi hardcore guild, we were the best guild on our server, we were all nerds, if someone in our guild said they were taking a week off to play wow we would have all made fun of them for it ...
---
So either you are making assumptions about how it was based on what you think now and not what you witnessed or your vanilla wow experience was drastically different than mine
---
Numbers were never disclosed for either, but yes, they did increase the cap by an unspecified amount of players. It was done over time on all realms, so most likely done through increasing the number of layers rather than their capacity.
---
I don‚Äôt care how other people view how ‚Äúcool‚Äù my character, regardless of a cash shop or not.  
---
If some dude wants to ride a flying pig, and he likes it, good for him, why the hell should I care?
---
Or if your ass has to run an errand (like go to the store) which you fear will take longer than half an hour.  You can un-AFK yourself with this and not get booted out back into queue hell.
---
Negative.
---
My twink from vanilla was engineering, I would set an exploding sheep on someone (in a lvl 29 bg) and watch them be confused as I slink away stealthed.
---
Go fuck ur mother little bitch
---
So what's your argument? You said rumors were going around...I said it was just speculation....then you said you don't get my point...because it *is* speculation?

No invite means they're on a different realm, yellow name means same faction whereas greyed-out name means opposite faction.

For some reason you can only see the levels of your friends if they're on the same faction and realm.
---
Stormwind, home of the patriots.
---
Most hardcore players are in it for PvP, resource control and area denial. How is that any less valid than the way you like to play the game?
---
Is he, though?
---
How is that remotely the same thing? Hes  utilising a mechanic thats in the game not doing anything against the games rules just because you think its wrong doesnt mean it is.
---
Foreword: I'm a druid shill.
---
I'd say that druid would be a good class for you to pickup, especially given your group makeup with your friends. (You do not want to be those people going "LF2M, tank and heals" -- that's just embarrassing.) This class will allow you to heal, tank, or DPS. Druids are very capable tanks, especially when in dungeon groups. I slightly disagree with your bit about feral druids being difficult to gear - there's an abundance of rogue gear (and, oddly, +stamina leather gear) that you could scoop. The caveat is that you should try to let rogues get it first, but - given your friend group's party makeup - you could be selective about who you invite into your groups, therefore skipping the competition with rogues.
---
The nice thing about druids, too, is that speccing into Feral will allow you to effectively tank or dps with the same build. It will be something like 10/34/7 (PM if you have questions about that).
---
Otherwise, warlock is a great never-need-to-respec class. I actually usually roll warlock as my alt, and I've found it to be the most fun, dynamic dps class.
---
Both "DM" and "VC" are acceptable when referring to Deadmines.
---
While "DM" is obvious, "VC" stands for "Van Cleef" (the end boss) and is used as an alternative in order to avoid confusion with Dire Maul, which is also shortened as "DM".
---
Not sure if you were memeing or serious.
---
It's not being finicky over a minor detail if someone is calling you out for something you didn't intend. He's just correcting you do the distinction in the minor detail is justified. You're the only one looking stupid here dude
---
For me, it leveled to around 60(?) for DE'ing. From there, that's when the random enchants would boost it up more. By 60, that's when I invested in leveling it up from where it was at. Sorry, I should have explained it better.
---
I need to have my mom over to constantly ask me if I‚Äôm ‚Äúin battle‚Äù while playing
---
Tailoring is pretty self sufficient since you dont need a profession to gather cloth. Since most other professions require a gathering prof I see your options as the following.
---
Enchanting. Also doesnt require a 2nd prof but is a known time and money sink. Sure you can make profits later but for leveling this is a drag.
---
2nd gathering prof. Any of the gathering professions are a good second choice to supplement income. Would reccomend skinning as your 2nd to level with to help provide some income
---
There are Addons that will show you if somebody has rolled need/greed before you roll yourself. I know ElvUI has that feature.
---
I thought the Grey ppl are on a different server?
---
Whiff is a term used far outside of WoW
---
Appreciate the shared knowledge! Something new learnt today, ill make sure to spread it as well haha
---
‚ÄúFly my pretties! Fly!‚Äù
---
You should work towards buying a greater magic wand before you hit lvl 13. It‚Äôll give you a major damage boost. For the moment though people are selling cheap lesser magic wands and you should ask to buy one of them on general chat.
---
Ok cool :).
---
Annoyances of a pet + brand new = no fun for anyone. 
---
Thank you!!!
---
They are on Faerlina for the race.
---
Yeah its not a court of law but Blizzard isn't going to ban a player for something so objectively trivial. They put it in the game. He's not breaking a single rule by doing this. It's just the way it is.
---
Haha tru dat. Soon I believe queues will be gone anyway.
---
Well, i'm using minimum modifications - dominos and swing timer are the only addons for me. I've just really got used to this look of the ui, the original one feels massive

You could always switch servers you know buddy?
---
Not necessary to play in a full one
---
* blizzard has warned you *

You want warlock, just like the others have said. Checks every box, plus your end-game gear looks amazing and scales well. Do it. Go warlock.
---
You deserve some Silver my good buddy. This hit me in the feels, thank you. I laughed so hard at work my co-workers had a blast with this.
---
Jealous
---
Damnit, everytime I see/read something about poor posture I realize I'm just a hunched over Orc IRL...
---
But I didn't say one group was larger lol. I said that some people do end up sliding into extremism from jokes, I'm saying it is actually a thing that exists, not that it's everywhere you look.
---
CHARGE!!!
---
But when we hit 60 we all will try to look like that.
---
I dunno, I think the phrasing and 1 downvote/1 comment are more than just coincidence lol.
---
He probably would've worded it more broadly if he meant solo players in general.
---
OP  = Salty gatekeeping nerd
---
I guess as long as it's only phase 1 that is okay. i was afriad it was going to last perm.
---
The problem you're having is that you still trying to play with the people that are racing the first.
---
the stories your reading of people having a good time or the stories of people that are just hanging back and doing it at their own pace you've already spent 60 hours are at level 30 most people are sitting around level 10 to 20 right now we're just doing it casually.
---
I know a lot of people who have had lots of good stories just today me and my fiance we're playing and we grouped up with three random people no problem we all killed Zuldazar are so we didn't have to do it individually.
---
I believe maybe trying a new character is for you but I don't think quitting classic is for you I think you just need to lay back and play a little bit more casually or at least grind it out with people that are playing more casually than the people that are racing the first.
---
because he has to be honest the people racing 2 first or probably the most toxic people that are trying to do everything Solo or individually right now.
---
If you're in Stormwind pass the tailoring shop and keep walking up the road and at the top to the right the journeyman tailor trainer is that shop.
---
Good to be here!
---
i was in gnomeregan yesterday with a level 31 warrior. he had no problem holding aggro. yes sometimes one enemy switched targets but it was no problem for him to taunt it back. i dont know what you are doing wrong, but this run was smooth and we didn't wipe once.
---
Easy, yes, but it‚Äôs still not a solution.
---
That. Is. Fucking. Amazing.
---
The server I play on has no wait time, And I have a Job so don't play it all day and when I get home it's med pop. But yeah nah y'all keep taking up space afk and enjoy the reports. cheers
---
I've never encounted queues through this week. Hydraxian Waterlords master race.
---
Or when i had low hp and some mob just spawned
---
This is so much better than an afk bot. I wish everyone running afk bots would do this instead. The queues would move so much faster that way.
---
If one of you is going to do smithing, only *one* of you should do smithing.
---
If you actually want him to be able to make you gear worth using, *both* of you should take up mining.
---
I would suggest the other of you either take up skinning (for income) or enchanting (for... enchants).
---
Also you have VanCleef down as "The Defiance Kingpin"  I think it should be "Defias Kingpin"
---
Isn't this the plot of Shrek Forever After?
---
avoidstreamers.com
---
imagine trying to tag adds without layering, would be interesting
---
Don't remember exactly but it started as "What's there not to understand?" and then reiterated his same point.
---
Can I heal in dungeons as an enh sham? Do I need to keep an extra gear set?
---
Pay $15. Download Classic. Pick a server. Pick a race. Pick a class. Pick your nose and wait. Then...play!
---
Use the slider, don't at just each item...
---
Lol it would not be better. Did you play on server launch on monday? It was a shitshow and doing any quest took 30mins or more in a starting area. Npw, that was one layer...imagine at least 20 of those. Do you want to compete against 10,000 people to tag hogger? It would take DAYS to get to level 10
---
omg so accurate
---
They keep opening new servers, but there are launch servers I've never seen above medium pop. Not sure if that's a bug.
---
This is the spec I‚Äôm going to be rollin with, given how much dungeon grinding I do.
---
that too
---
This is flamelash eu, right?
---
thunderfury might be a dead server in some time. I've been playing on it last few days because there is zero queue time even during prime hours, but I'm just fooling around and not leveling seriously.
---
So warrior is the better/best tank overall? Damn
---
Tons of people use auctionator. Its not automation and all the prices it scans are available through the API so your perfectly in the clear.
---
Well from 10-12k queuing it's alot
---
&gt; Both allowed you to convert minimal effort on alts to give you thousands of gold a week.
---
I'm aware, but the price of the token was relatively stable through WoD *until* "convert to BNet balance" was added as a feature. The price almost doubled instantly, jumping up to being 9.1% of a characters gold cap at that time. It was an instantly destabilizing force on the game's economy.
---
Ok, beyond that I guess.... :)  I really don't know anything, but folks in the office keep talking about it, and working in IT I need some relevant geek cred.  :D
---
If anything it's like that now. In vanilla if you reported someone an actual GM would talk to you in game. Then they would talk to the other person and ban them.
---
The damage increase is just super small at that level that its less than 1 damage. At higher levels you will start to see it do 1-2 more damage...
---
Lmao at all the salty boomers in this thread. Keeping sipping your sugar free monster drinks.

Updated my drivers yesterday and it happened every 30-45 minutes. Going to mess with it tonight and see if I can figure it out.

As far as professions go, obviously mining/blacksmithing is a good choice. Other than that you might like herb/alch if you can get gear from other places, or mining/engineering for the more funky stuff.
---
For more general warrior tips I would say take advantage of the fact that so many people are playing right now. Group up! On your own as a warrior you have the worst solo experience in the game. It's just tough. But if you get a healer or some other dps you can become an unstoppable wrecking ball of damage.
---
Always keep food on hand. Cheaper to get it from a mage obviously but you want to have your own store. And level first aid. No self heals means you need to find it where you can.
---
Don't be afraid to ask people for buffs. You will be surprised how far an extra 8 Stam from fort buff or an extra 20 melee attack from a pally will go.
---
Learn the art of pulling mobs. Watch paths and wait for the perfect opportunity to pull just one. Invest in a ranged weapon and some ammo. Damage isn't important, but you need to be able to have some range so you can pick out one enemy at a time.
---
Make sure your weapon is on par with your level! Too many people forget that. If you have to forgo the next rank in an ability to afford a new weapon, do it.
---
Other than that just remember that your suffering in the solo part of the game will pay off when you are tanking for groups or wrecking face in damage. And the higher level you get the easier it becomes.
---
Yep I always justified it because GGG is a small new Zealand comland, but now that tencent owns them I haven't played the game since
---
I had the same crash. It's how they apply the changes if you don't use the slider
---
I like mine too.

Elvui + weakauras and Details!
---
First Aid. Cooking could also be good to make good food for healing and stam buffs. Solo levelling is a bitch so group up as much as possible. Honestly it's much easier rn when the realms are super populated. Easy to find groups for all quests. Make sure you keep your weapon updated! Your auto attacks will be a lot of your DPS.
---
I always had a large diverse friend group, over 25 people easy, and 95% came back for Classic. In fact, I wasnt going to play until I opened up my Blizz friends list and just saw how many.
---
I don't know the guide, but I guess it's not on the list because instances are not worth it when speed leveling.
---
I was only 4 minutes late this morning. Only 3 more hours.

If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are headed.

Haha holy shit, 15 years ago, but brings back memories. I camped out on a tree next to where he spawns, kept jumping all over it trying to climb it to keep myself occupied. People kept snaking their turns and getting him -\_-. Eventually I got him tho... Had him till I got Bangalash.

It's going on, on every server.
---
Back in OG Vanilla, server communities were much more isolated with the lack of developed Internet (i.e., no reddit, no wowhead, not even thotbot yet). Some servers adopted to calling Deadmines "VC" when Dire Maul was released in order to make it easier to determine which was being referenced when talking in Trade or LFG chat. Both instance names naturally abbreviate to DM, but Dire Maul didn't have a boss that abbreviated so easily. Later on, players landed on DM+direction for Dire Maul to indicate which wing, but on those servers that had adopted "VC", they kept that, too.
---
People just think that their OG Vanilla experience was the only OG Vanila experience, and so clearly anyone who remembers differently from them is wrong.

If you‚Äôve never played any WoW before, I will warn you that classic is PAINFULLY slow and more-or-less anyone who says otherwise is a masochist or has nostalgia goggles on (I have nostalgia goggles personally.)
---
I would look up streams/videos of gameplay before anything. Understand not how to play it, but what you‚Äôre getting into first. 
---
After that, it‚Äôs really just pick a class that sounds cool, and hop in. If you can‚Äôt find something for a quest (as there are absolutely no objective markers) either look at your questbook or ask in general or google it. 
---
There is otherwise no ‚Äòmaterials required‚Äô to just start. You need a subscription and the mentality, that‚Äôs all.
---
Got a couple  weeks.
---
Just wait till Activision puts the pressure
---
pay blizz for a month of gametime, log in, read the racials and class abilities in character creation screen, pick, make a name, play
---
that's literally what I did, and was hooked
---
but quickie about classes? you have warrior which can tank and deal damage, then you have healers which can deal damage some - priests, druid, shaman, paladin. then you have pure damage dealers - mage, rogue, hunter, warlock
---
Nope! I'm sitting here imaging what I could be doing in Wow classic. 1 hour to go!

AFAIK most of their income from MTX comes from Hearthstone and overwatch, not WoW. WoW is still primarily sub driven. Considering the tiny % of people that pay for MTX anyways, wow has a constant revenue source.

About 6:30 pm central time, my friend had a queue that was 1.5 hrs, unless he was just bsing an excuse not to play lol.
---
okay little fella
---
World firsts don't mean anything, especially in a game that it's already been done in before.  There are no prizes for being "first!", etc.
---
I guess you have bragging rights, but really?  Bragging that you have more free time to sit and do nothing than others?  /shrug 
---
Whatever tickles your pickle.
---
This one changes the unit plates slightly. The one JokerdTV is using doesn't at all, except adding the HP text.
---
Also this one only shows the mob's numerical HP as the percentage, without the % sign. JokerdTV's is showing their actual HP as well(like 3452)
---
That's not really what I mean.
---
Leveling in Classic is a large part of the game, in many ways, it is *the content*. Leveling in retail is the thing you start and finish 8 hours after the launch.
---
The time-gated chores I'm referring to in retail are less needing to wait for the content to unlock, no matter how much you play, but rather that you have specific, timed windows for everything else.
---
Everything has a timer in retail. You log on, the game gives you a set of RNG tasks and it's up to you to complete them before the timer is up. Feel like doing some mythic+? Here's an RNG keystone with an RNG change at rewards, just do it before this timer is up. Feel like doing a BG? Better make sure the game isn't tied before the timer is up, or you lose. Better get your AP before the timer is up, don't want to be behind - forever.
---
For each one of these "timers" is an RNG reward, with multiple RNG force multipliers. But what also comes with these timers is the ***perception*** that the player is punished for failing or not doing them. 
---
And that's fine, you shouldn't be rewarded for failing, but the emphasis isn't placed on doing - it's placed on **rushing.**
---
Why?
---
Virgin warrior Vs Chad paladin

WAAAA. Someone has more time to play than me. Isn‚Äôt this what you fucks wanted? The grinders to be the best?

No minimal sleep in comparison to others. Alkaizer streamed probably 15 hours more than him and he's still FAR from 60.

Ahmpy that was first for a while played around the same.

Most of the speedrunners at that level are sleeping the same amount.
---
read it again.... slower.

---
I was Googling for this just now as well. I want an addon to identify trainers, repair NPCs, current target, etc. on my minimap. Then I'd also like to see flight path locations marked on the main map. I walked right by a couple of them on my way from Darnassus to Redridge Mountains and have to re-trek my way back from Menethil Harbor next time.
---
lol thanks for just proving my point.
---
Why not?
---
There are tons of opportunities to group up in the world.  I've joined like 4 or 5 groups just doing quests in teldrassil and darkshore.  I'm engaging with other players.  It's not very engaging to spam LFG in trade.
---
good for now yes, but those servers might be dead in a few months when most of the players either quit or move back to their main full server.
---
It's called Whorecraft. So I've been told!
---
The darker one (on the left) means the item is indoors. Probably in that mine.
---
Dudes, mobile skilling is where it's at.
---
The darker one is underground, that's why you don't see it above ground.
---
5 days is a couple to you? I never said you couldn‚Äôt make it to 56 in 5 days lmao, I said 60 in a couple days, which when i posted.
---
Why so mad?
---
And only because of the ganks
---
Darker ones are underground.
---
This is honestly hilarious. When Classic was announced, private server players were discussing efficiency of different routes, likely times to 60 or how fast after release will they manage to clear Molten Core. This was continually met with "lol real Vanilla is actually hard, your pirate servers are ez, you're in for a rude awakening" from retail players.
---
Now that private server players are actually doing just as well on Classic as they were on pservers, they are met with "wtf that's not how the game is supposed to be played, you're ruining my experience".

---
yeah it just takes literally 2-3x longer than other classes
---
Now that is an old reference.
---
For dungeons, they are ok. They do more damage and have better threat. But without the shield they facetank everything (no block/perry), and agi stacked dodging helps but doesn't make up for it enough to come within %10 of the effectiveness of a warrior.
---
People trying to rush for levels is something that will happen no matter what. To each its own, some want to read each quest, others want to be as strong as possible
---
I've never heard any1 say retail is more difficult, and I have no idea where you went with the second half of your post. If you're saying WoW is a sequel to the Warcraft that's just untrue.
---
Blizzard decided to timegate the bags.
---
Mankrik Horde has been an absolute pleasure
---
Because you don't understand that speed running is still a thing even after the first week of launch, however, when they remove layering it'll be near impossible to break a speed run record because they can't exploit like the og record holder does.
---
I don't think you understand the entire point.
---
Not kidding, playing through vanilla WoW reminds me of my first ever Dark Souls 2 playthrough (started with Dark Souls 2). It's hard if you go in and have no clue what to do or how things work. But it's alot of fun.

Try to be a pocket healer for as many people as possible.  Do dungeons as much as you can.  Do all the quests in dungeons.  Doing content solo is too slow.  Find groups for elite or hard world quests where you can heal/damage at same time.  
---
I'm leveling faster between 15-25 just by doing chain dungeons with average people.
---
Switch servers. It'll save you a lot of headache.
---
Oof
---
More of an overpopulation issue. Azeroth needs Thanos.
---
I'd argue 99% of people brute force life through time investment and grinding. Most people don't have much talent.
---
Dem nightelves though
---
First lesser magic wand and then greater. WC drops some rare wand.
---
the game being less streamlined means there's more depth and bigger range of things to get exited about. 
---
Getting an Int buff on my Rogue means I level weapon skills faster, in Live there are no weapon skills. Early greens and cooking buffs tend to give Spirit, but in early game Spirit HP regen counts for more and reduces downtime. In live, everyone has a self-heal and fights
---
you get a new one every other level
---
Westfall had ques the first three days for sure at peak hours (highest I saw was 4k), just usually only for the evening.  But I haven't been able to log in since Wednesday since I'm in the middle of moving.
---
My honest recommendation is to not follow the speed leveling guides. The players I know following them are having much less fun, and some of them send you running around when there are plenty of quests in single zones at their level ranges!
---
If you want to do Dead Mines, do it. You might want to wait until level 20, though; Paladins get a quest sending them into Dead  Mines at 20 for a fantastic weapon.
---
Then people will claim world first 60 without layering, IDK why you're bitching.
---
Where the heck is your wand?
---
they said they consider it when people get high levels
---
we arent there yet
---
I couldn't find what that patch was about (was after the capacity increase) but yes they made a post about it and never told us how much the capacity actually is
---
I feel you man. However, the trick to enjoying tanking is to let go a little. Your pulls are the most important, a lot of what happens afterwards is out of your hands. You can reliably keep aggro on 1 target, but when your dps is using AoE mobs WILL run around everywhere. You just have to roll with that. If you can keep a straight head throughout the madness, your party members will too. A ton of shit happens that makes you feel bad as a tank (if you're used to modern wow) but it's simply not possible to keep aggro on everything all the time.  
---
You have to adjust your expectations of what it means to be a tank in classic. You don't have as much control as you think you do, that's why people are arguing with you, not because the community is shitty.
---
That is not ninja looting, everyone can use the BOE. If a glowing brightwood drops the damn mage doesnt get it, everyone rolls.
---
It's not the infinite levels of difficulty in the upward direction that make retail 'not hard,' it's the infinite levels of easy in the other.
---
Dudes a joke.
---
I mean, they'll have a better ring before they're level 20 even
---
I've always used DBM, idk what the game is like without it haha

Correct

Stalag at this very moment is 2400+.

can you prove it with timelines on his past vods?

It's a full interface add-on called ElvUI

But he gets it anyway because he's not actually cheating

Is it sad that some of us can tell this is Westfall with only this amount of information?

actually plenty of people are switching‚Äîthats why queues are going down

That's the joke. "Que" isn't a word either.

You guys are asking for too much. Why on earth would they do server transfers on character people have invested 3 days in? If your queue is so bad that you spend hours every day in it just reroll on a new server and youll catch up by monday.

I'm on Myzrael.  No queue time as of yesterday.

Perhaps don't pick the server that Blizzard warned you would have obscene queue times?
---
True
---
Warning for those who want to check: there are gnomes. Female gnomes.
---
Lmfao. Way to protect so much onto what I just said.
---
I usually try to help unless if I'm at least a little certain that it won't be certain death for the both of us. I have seen some people letting people die when they could help simply so they can kill the mobs themselves.
---
To expand on this, many people form a triangle with the imp, mob, and you being the 3 points. Micro your imp to the front left or right of you and pull with it, then start attacking. You should pull aggro off the imp before it hits 30% hp.
---
I'm not complaining that this happened. Just thought it was funny and took a screenshot
---
Yo that would be cool haha. First raid boss is actually JokerD
---
Method org technically account shared by having someone come and press space so they wouldn't get kicked for afk. Should they all be banned? Should their world first (LUL losers pov) not count?
---
He only started using layering at 58. And also, it's not cheating in any way, breaks not terms of service. But stay mald. He's playing the game as intended, since layering exists in the game. If they really didn't want people to use layering like this there are so many easy fixes, which you can imagine the dev team aren't stupid enough to not implement.
---
And over arching all of this, is the fact that even before the layering method he started at 58. He was ahead of everyone by a huge margin. Methods team aren't even trying, it's as if they didn't even prepare hard for this. (Granted only really 1 or 2 are actually trying for worlds first 60, but they lost long ago)
---
Pretty much all raid boss attacks that are on a timer or can otherwise be predicted will be called out by the addon. Usually these types of attacks can kill many people or outright cause a wipe so that's why it's important for every single raid member to have DBM
---
I wonder how much nostalgia and hype factors in. Like are we more willing to grind through more because of the great memories we had playing back in the day. I'm not saying anything about classic is bad. I'd like to get an opinion of someone totally new to wow.
---
Or... dont take more than 30mins to use the restroom
---
Yeah it's a dang shame because it was a decent game other wise
---
Need before Greed just means need rolls supersede greed rolls. So a need roll of 2 will beat greed 100 but it doesn't restrict whether or not a player can need roll on any item.

 [https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/casterpets.php](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/casterpets.php) 
---
Generally speaking they had sub-standard stats compared to other pets in their family archetype.  There's no confirmation on whether or not the caster status still exists in classic as it did for vanilla....but at the same time there's no reason to believe it's been fixed either.
---
For now it's better to assume the same "bug" that existed in Vanilla also exists in classic and avoid any pets labeled as "casters".  If it does exist still, then you'll have an advantage with better pet stats.  And if it doesn't exist, by choosing to avoid caster pets, you didn't really hurt yourself in the long run anyways.  :)
---
No it didn‚Äôt. Blizzard fucked that all up with their ‚Äúno player left behind mechanics‚Äù. I jumped into legion late. I saw the artifacts tree and was so stoked. I spent like an hour figuring out what i wanted to get first etc. from 100-110 you got like 6 points total it feel slow yet progressive.
---
I went to suramar to check. It out and wOoSh after completing the first suramar main quest i received like a billion xp towards the artifact and basically unlocked all the talents at once.
---
Thats when I uninstalled and quit retail.
---
First blue? This was what it was like getting the first green.
---
It‚Äôs all relative. Tanking in Vanilla was way more fun and involved than EQ or FFXI. But players coming from those games also understood Threat and aggro mechanics. It was always embarrassing to pull aggro off the tank. 
---
Retail makes it so easy to generate threat that the tank is terrible if they can‚Äôt handle packs. And so you get the current situation.
---
Sometimes when I look at my hands, I don't even recognize them. I mean, whose hands are these?
---
Thanks for the tips. I wasn‚Äôt using battleshout - I didn‚Äôt know it helped aggro.
---
My hope is blizzard suspends him for malicious behavior. And you need to learn the definition of acknowledge.
---
Ppl are brainless drone following "rules" they think are morality.
---
Dude, we are not comitting any fucking crime AFKing. Even Blizzard hasn't said a thing about AFKing because its somewhere in a "gray area" since 2005 Alterac Valleys.
---
Blizzard should know better. Announcing only 11 servers before launch? What a joke lol.
---
Does the Aqual Quintessence quest line require rep to start?

A threat meter, ClassicThreatMeter is the only working one I know of atm, maybe more have been ported already

Gotcha, thanks.

My first lv 60 in classic was a warrior I leveled prot.  You make a lot of dependable groups for the long 5 mans that way,  it takes forever when you're alone but once you start making connections people hit you up to tank as soon as you log on.  And some of those instances take like 3+ hours when you want to do all of ST/BRD
---
Polls also said that Hillary had a 98% chance of winning the election. When will people learn that polls are simply a political tool and not a metric of actual sentiment?
---
Enchanting is usually the one you would take to supplement tailoring.
---
No proof, lmao Methodfanboy. A lot of talk and accusations but never any actual proof, just retards repeating dumbshit because they love Djarii or some shit.
---
This is also very space dependent, in the barrens it works out great since you can kite for days, but inside caves, towers etc voidwalker is by far superior in a normal tank n spank setting. He can also easily tank 2 things at once for you if you can't avoid it.
---
It‚Äôs clearly abuse of the layering system...but whatever.
---
Wrong. On many levels.
---
Warlock all you do in raid is cast Shadowbolt. That's literally all you do. It's not fun.
---
Remote Desktop!!
---
depends on what you want to do while leveling. soloing content? go full ret. want to heal dungeons? go holy, obviously. want to tank dungeons? rush to consecration in the holy tree, not so obvious. Check out Kargoz's paladin guide video, its in depth and you can jump around the video for the content you need. the only thing he is wrong about (due to /sit macro working on private servers, and not in classic) is his AOE reckoning section.
---
You get bumped to char screen after 20min, bumped to login screen after another 30min. At least from what I can tell.
---
Lol what is this?
---
That's an IP ban offense if I've ever seen one!
---
The extra bow skill isn‚Äôt very important in PVE though since ranged attacks don‚Äôt glance
---
I‚Äôm thankful that I‚Äôm a morning person and I login around the time most people log out so I can avoid the queues pretty effectively.

\^\^\^
---
what are you talking about? clearly calling it WORLD FIRST has nothing to do about reaching 60 WORLD FIRSt \\s
---
Man up pus
---
Why would that invalidate the time? This isn't some kind of official competition with a set of rules. First to 60 is first.
---
?
---
Sounds like you are just looking for confirmation of what you did and not people's actual opinions...
---
Not a question, but I want to enourage Paladins to break out of the molds. Yes, you will almost certainly never be a raid tank, and it may be tough to find a raid spot as DPS, but you can perform all three roles in dungeons very handily.
---
For Rets: Check out the SpellRet build  
---
For Prots: Take command of the party, assign kill priorities, and make sure people don't start to DPS until Consecrate. Also, Mage/Warlock/Ret + Druid healer my your favorite party as a Pally tank!

I just use ElvUI tbh, I enjoy the interface, and the bag UI it uses is pretty much the same.
---
Been watching through this with my friend, hardest part is not cheating and watching more in between hangouts
---
Yeah, it will, essentially every time it refreshes the duration it will. 
---
The caveat to this is if you‚Äôre grouped up with a fury warrior or a higher level war that has a better version. Yours won‚Äôt do shit in those scenarios.
---
Lmk if you have any other tank questions. I‚Äôve done the 1-60 grind exclusively through dungeons 2 times now on a war and have a ton of pro tips to share.

It‚Äôs just very easy, you can pull 3, 4+ mobs depending on your class and not be at risk of dying
---
Had a troll hunter scream at me in whisper yesterday because i had THE NERVE to attack and kill Echeyakee instead of letting him tame it after I summoned him after doing all the work myself. Like homie no, im not run i gall the way back to Crossroads and back to replace the single use quest item. He wouldbt leave me alone so I mailed him some salt from the trade goods vendor. I hipe he wastes his time going out of the way to find a mailbox now.
---
It's a pretty reasonable guess considering the majority of Redditors are Americans.  No need to be a dick about it.
---
Why not druid+rogue? Both stealth classes with good synergy
---
Group Loot and Need Before Greed are two different loot options. Check in the drop down menu next time you're a party leader.
---
You can rdp back in and tap the space key to jump to restart afk timer.
---
My advice is that OP should reroll to a different class. I'm being serious about the world of pain bit
---
In 6 months nobody will race 1-60.

---
My own personal opinion, ADD-ONS destroy the very fabric of astonishing discovery.
---
To be fair I was dps in the run. But they were still an upgrade.
---
&gt; do what you think is best and insist they dont do silly things like your example of charging mobs as a dps warrior.
---
You really didn't read his post did you?   That's exactly what he *did* do and all four other group members ganged up on him saying *he* was wrong (he wasn't).

The more people that use a remote desktop app to get in que then the earlier and earlier the que will start.
---
You're not wrong at all a lot of players just don't understand how things work in classic.
---
So if someone has to take a break, you'd rather them wait in a 4 hour queue again? Are the only people who deserve to play those who can sit and play for 8 hours straight?
---
Reported
---
People with adult social lives and families?
---
Why exactly do you think that just curious.
---
It's funny becouse it's true

not a macro expert at all but don't you need a [stance:3] Cat Form; clause in that macro to take you out of cat form?

I got my 6 year old introduced to the 3rd person skill-rotation genre by having him play on my super-geared Path of Exile character in low-level areas. 
---
Soon I will have him farming for me while I make dinner every night the same way in Wow.  He can make a little side-cash for me while working on his computer dexterity.  I basically made an IRL bot!
---
inb4 me and the boys run straight to the front and spam tab+sinister strike for that tag then peace the fuck out

Because people have lost all concept of what the word racist actually means.
---
Hunters are good tier 1 raiding. They suffer past that because pets are like roughly 30% of the hunters damage and their damage is unaffected by gear. They are still fine, you won't have issues finding groups for anything. I main hunter and love it.
---
It‚Äôs a world first, not a speed run. You can worry about who actually did it the fastest later. Won‚Äôt change the fact that he was the first
---
you move up in que if you use the print screen button
---
While levelimg hunter becomes way stronger than most other classes. You just need more experience to refine your skillz.
---
One of the easiest and strongest imo.
---
U remember to use abilities?ü§î
---
Yeah this weekend I have some errands but I'll be on my phone moving around every so often since Whitemane weekend queue is gonna be like 12 hours I'd assume. It's not automated so it should be fair game, right?
---
Hunter is usually middle of the pack because they rely pretty heavily on their pet. But that being said Marksman at level cap still can be top DPS if played properly.
---
As someone with a job I've spent FAR more time in the queue than I have playing so far. In EU for context
---
I've been in the queue for 2 hrs in Faerlina and I still have at least 1.3k people in front of me.
---
I went out to Mulgore at lvl 10 after my pet training quest to look for ‚Äúthe rake‚Äù. Found him right away, I was so happy.
---
I added another account so I could play on a lower pop server while I stay in queue for where my main and guildies are. That costs obviously but I‚Äôve been thinking of multi boxing anyway. My alt on the low pop may end up being my main because I playing that toon a lot more because I can‚Äôt get past the queue on Pagle.
---
Cope
---
&gt; I wonder why they'd do that...
---
Well, they probably haven't showered in 5 days.
---
That's what she said.
---
How did you stayed?
---
Yes and yes. Keep a set of int gear for healing. Cloth is fine for your heal set.
---
Cries in warrior
---
For a moment thought that was Dio
---
I quit a while back and don't really miss the game, but your mention of the brewfest kodo reminded me of my mount collection and that gave me a stronger twinge of nostalgia than I've had in years.
---
Imagine being a world class business/guild and setting up a lan in las vegas to stream world first but losing to a BALD GNOME from malta in a shack with a modem and YOU have to try and COPE by blaming layering
---
Sure at earlier gear levels but warlocks hold their own past AQ in PvE and they are way better at early PvP than Warriors. Even at top gear levels warriors need pocket heals whereas locks can 1v3
---
Lol this is true.
---
&gt;find veins
---
I imagine a heroine addict doing this same thing
---
What's the difference between abuse and usage?
---
Right, so thats any better though? Literally the same thing.
---
I just don't have a queue on my server =P
---
I feel bad for you. I've had a wonderful sense of community on my server. I hope you get to experience it soon enough once the sightseers die down.
---
GrobMob has had a queue every night since launch
---
I strongly agree with this, I feel like all of the things BC did correctly could have been done without the level cap increase. Namely bringing up the viability many class-specs through the introduction of new spells and gear availability.
---
dual wield is trash for leveling.
---
You want to go 2 hander fury
---
False
---
Same thing goes for resto druids. No matter what class was healing that run, the mage would have had to compete with someone for it be it priest, Druid or sham.
---
Yeah but you can't actually attack or use abilities on him.
---
If your goal is to spam dungeons, then you should go prot. If your goal is to solo quest through the content, either is fine. You need to sit and eat/bandage after each fights. Leveling a warrior as any spec in classic is not fun.
---
slightly similar tip for enchanters:
---
I just bought 10 greater magic essences for 15s each.  The wood to make a greater magic wand is 38c.  The wand sells for 15s 38c.
---
For 3c i was able to make wands and vendor them.  At that price i'd say its worth it to keep doing that until the pattern goes green.
---
Hell, if youre willing to spam trade or if prices are different on your realm you may even be able to sell them for a profit.
---
As a gnome rogue trying to kill you orc anything is far, far more annoying.
---
Gnome IMO is almost holistically the best class for Mage/Lock for serious PVP, with perhaps a case to be made for Undead. Gnome gets the int, Gnome gets escape artist which is really solid, Gnome gets + engineering which is nice-to-have because engineering-lock/mage is definitely a leg up other professions. 
---
PVP wise, I don't see a reason to not be Gnome either, because while int doesn't actually give spellpower, it does give mana and spell crit. 
---
There is also reasonable benefit to the small hitbox size in large clusterfucky world battles. 
---
None of this really matters enough to not play whateverTF you want to play! I would say the differences in racials can be very noticeable (Orc DPS Warrior masterrace baby, fuck dem Rogues). The racial differences do make the lvl 60 feel a LITTLE different and sometimes it's trivial, sometimes not. So my advice would be, pick the racial for fiction and fun, not for optimization.
---
DS ruin is not a pvp spec.  I would advise a mage, Hunter, or druid if you want a relatively low gear required pvp class
---
They work by picking a Full population server and then being so entitled and stubborn that you decide that instead of playing the game on a different server, you're going to spend all of your time waiting to play and bitching about it on reddit. My first server has long waits daily, i switched to a lower pop and haven't waited since day one.
---
can you give me an example of what fury talents i should use with a 2h

With the cinematic ending too

Sounds like you're just a whining little child who is looking for reinforcement because a bunch of people in game told you that you were an asshole. Here's the nitty gritty - if for some wild reason you were leveling as elemental, then the shoulders were probably fine to roll on. If you're leveling as enhance however, yeah you're an asshole. Int gives you nothing, would be like a warrior rolling on agility mail just because he can wear it, but worse

I've noticed a lot of complaints about paladins lately, with regard to their low dps and limited combat options. But what players are forgetting is the main reason Blizzard programmed Paladins. Paladins were not designed to be hybrid Tanks/Healers, as many claim. Instead, paladins were designed to be played while downloading pornography.
---
Paladins have roughly zero combat interaction, thus making them the perfect character to play while downloading massive amounts of hardcore pornography. Simply target a monster, hit "1", and minimize your window. Then sit back and enjoy the amazing girl on girl action.
---
Because a Paladin takes about one full minute to kill any monster, you can leisurely browse the erotic and pornographic fruits of the internet without much concern over your Paladin's welfare. After a minute, I go back to WoW, and usually my Paladin is alive and ready to loot the corpse. This is what makes grinding so pleasurable and convenient for me; the ability to simultaneously watch girls have sex with each other and level up at the same time. I doubt any other class has such an elegantly designed system, and I applaud Blizzard for their foresight in crafting a character that I can play with while playing with myself.
---
DPS? Who needs it? The quicker I kill something, the less time I have to watch boobies. Combat Interactivity? Overrated. I'd much rather interact with the girls writhing on my computer screen. Yes, a paladin was created for the sole purpose of surviving a fight while you stream hot pornography directly to your computer. That is why we have the high armor class, healing abilities, and the low, low DPS.
---
As for PvP, nothing is better than getting into Battlegrounds and soaking up the honor points while I watch girls take their clothes off for money. Only the minimum interaction is necessary for a Paladin to perform, and it is this very quality that I love the most about my Paladin. I doubt Rogues get any time to watch pornography while trying to vanish and rack up combo points, and I bet Shamans haven't seen a single naked breast while figuring out which totem to throw down before choosing which shock they are going to cast next.
---
In addition to grinding, we have several defensive options during combat that also allow us the flexibility of downloading pornography. Hammer of Justice allows a quick 6 second glimpse at a naked lady while our opponent is stunned, and Divine Shield allows a leisurely 8 seconds of quality right-hand time. Indeed, Paladins have cornered the market on the pornography during playtime of World of Warcraft gameplay.
---
It saddens me that many Paladins do not take advantage of the main functionality of your character, and are in fact lobbying for increased DPS, or more combat options. These are all unnecessary frivolities that would only harm our pornography downloading efficiency. Instead, we should thank the fine programmers at Blizzard for crafting a character that is great to grind with while grinding your loins.
---
Gnome locks are cool. Something about a midget summoning massive demons is cool. Plus the int is a nice bonus and escape artist is decent. Other than rep humans have no beneficial traits for a warlock. Sword skill, spirit, and detection are kinda pointless for warlock. 
---
In horde side orc warlocks are great with stun resistance and per dmg. Undead are good too and fit the class.
---
Got my fishing up to 75 last night and it‚Äôs the most fun I‚Äôve had playing WoW in years :), certainly enjoying the fuck out of the game

Only if you insist on playing a server with 5-hour queues. There are several (NA, at least) with no queue even at peak times.

It has the potential to be the most profitable profession. All you do is destroy rare drops and sell raw mats or sought after enchants.

You can also charge for service for end game enchats. Crusader is a good example.

Retail has turned into a theme park ride. You get on and the game drags you along the way it wants you to go. It puts little things in the way to give you something to do for a little while, and every few minutes one of the mascots pops up and tells you (and everyone else on the ride with you) that *YOU* are the Hero of Azeroth and only you can save the world. Then the ride moves on to the next big set piece, over and over again until you get to the end and you grind out better loot so you can get on the next one.
---
It happened!
---
Nice. Seems I am going to collect all the companions! Already have a roach, snake and a prairie dog on my list. Guess I'll add this chicken too
---
Dont go too hard on yourself:). As for tips id simply recomend youtube class guides. There are a lot of great guides out there
---
Adding onto what everyone else said, their tier sets don't help with tanking and even with off pieces of Leather here and there, it doesn't compare to the Warrior set bonuses.
---
id BL u if this shit happens hahaha no1 wants to group w ppl who leave earli n i surelydont want a chance of doing endgame with these apes

At no point in retail wow will you feel at danger. Greens are absolute garbage and you will not speak to a single player all the way to 120.

Sigh, current year arguments are fucking stupid.

I don't have the energy to argue with the rest i know you wont listen and will continue not blaming the people causing the problem rather than simply blaming the company making the game for about a dozen continuously repeated cop out excuses.

Killing mobs, selling loot.

Hope you realize you‚Äôre the 50th person to post this but honestly, who cares about this first lvl 60. We get it, he has no life.

Shaman has its advantage, but some quest gave a reward of 10 sticky glue things that hold a target for 10 seconds.

The rake isn‚Äôt special on classic bro all pets are normalized...
---
420 =p
---
I'm a horde Hunter. Which pet should I go for? I'm lvl 10
---
I think the rub is that it was always seen as a solo accomplishment. All the hunters that were setting records before were really doing it entirely under their own power.
---
For this to work, he needs people on standby in different layers.
---
He would have been first finisher even without this, and I think he even would have had the fastest time, but for me I can't consider that time to be the official time set for fastest 60. I can consider him the person that did it, but that's all.
---
Haha, thanks dude :)
---
well, he had practice on private servers. not a total nobody, maybe to OP he is
---
I find tanking early dungeons hard. Especially if mages well any to do aoe clearing. Swipe just isn't cutting it. Maul for single targets good but with a ten second taunt I really struggle. Anyone else got some helpful tips?
---
The same way every other class does.
---
He had 14 hours down time since wow launched, not unreasonable, just really hard, stop accusing without any proof dude, that's sad.
---
Well he went under method‚Äôs radar;)
---
Regardless of whether or not he needed to use it to be the first one there - Regardless of how accessible and easy it is to utilize this - It's still exploitation of a mechanic.
---
If you're going to praise layering, I 100% will laugh when you eat your words, seeing what it's going to do in a few months when there are less people playing.

I've died a few times now. It seems to only be when people flee an area with several mobs in tow. Then they rubber band back and I'm done for. I can easily solo elites if it's one on one but those groups... nope.
---
I hate those fucking frames what are they called again
---
I hope your little brother/sister angrily deletes your first 60 when you finally get done sweatily leveling and that you don't get it back. Also I hope someone shits in your fruit loops. Love someone who anti afks. PS: I log off every night like everyone else when I'm done playing, so eat ass
---
Ooof... same...   
---
I had one i thought would die from my Moonfire ticks. So i engaged another one... only to see the first one's heal get off in time. That was a salty corpse run.

This. Clever use of game mechanics.

He‚Äôs actually trying to delete his character. People keep sending him mail to prevent it though haha.

Thank you. Its so fucking infuriating listening to people complain about the queues. EVERYONE including Blizzard has been saying to hop servers to a non crowded server since day one. Ive hopped servers FOUR TIMES, is it annoying communicating that with my 25+ person guild? Yes. Do we have a queue now? Not really. Now we are on a  home realm and having a blast. If your stuck in queues and complaining, you have no one to blame except yourself...

What class/race should I pick?

I was a blood elf mage. I love the horde, love the mage class, but only undead and trolls can be mages and I am not to found of each race. I made a lvl 10 undead mage. But i am wondering if i should change because I think a tauren would be fun. But I dont like how druids have to cast in moonkin form. Should I keep my undead mage or look into something else?
---
Is it though? I can‚Äôt imagine trying to push for world first anything. Best case some people remember your character‚Äôs name worst case you have nothing to do for a while until people catch up.

I think in the original design, the pink was the color of the faction specific class. When TBC came out, suddenly there were two classes with the same color... one needed to be changed. So the chose to change the Shaman to the blue we know and love today.

Why do people still sit in queue for whitemane?
---
Eh, you mean world of Warcraft? Man only in this sub will you find #nochanges and pro streamer layering cheese. Rich
---
It was Blizzard's decision to include layering. This won't be the last you hear about it being abused (Black Lotus, Devilsaur etc)
---
just got kinda sad when I realized that Total Biscuit would have loved classic wow.
---
Yeah I'm really enjoying the game but some guy in my guild was asking for relationship advice because his girlfriend was depressed and I said "bring her food and rub her feet" and someone was like "FOUND THE WOMAN" (I am actually a woman) and everyone started saying really awful stuff about women, essentially just "REEEE WOMEN GET OUT" and I just don't know about that one my dude. Maybe it's just that guild, or maybe just that realm, but I spent over a decade with the same experience in retail WoW as a woman and I only ever managed to find exactly one guild run by a woman where that wasn't the case. It's like half the reason I quit playing retail to begin with, the other half being that the game sucked. I don't know if I want to put up with this crap again for another decade. I played in the beta and everyone was super friendly and welcoming, no problems at all, I'm sad it's not like that on actual release.

Did method say they were going for world first 60? Or world first raids?
---
My cousin tried to name his nelf hunter nighthhunter, that was taken.. So he then went with nighunter og nighhunter, not the best coice in retrospect.
---
LMAO AT THIS PIC.
---
CANT STOP LAUGING
---
I don‚Äôt think the horde version was added until a later expansion, but (and I‚Äôm not sure here) horde can still get the quest from the chicken but the feed can only be bought from an alliance friendly npc, if you find the feed on the shared AH it might work.
---
Yea they are surprisingly tough

Pick one. Imagine being so much of a bitch that you consider being called a loser "verbal abuse".

Get a wand.

You are in your 30s?  You came off as a teenager, my apologies.

If my comment was only a personal attack it would be ad hominen.
---
Be your own person and make your own decisions. No one can help you but you. I skipped a lot of that nonsense because it‚Äôs a waste of time, and you could have grinded out that same exp in the time you took to wait. Stop crying lol
---
Not necessarily. The extra regen let's you be more aggressive, you can start shooting enemies before they get to you because it's not a big deal if you take a few hits, you'll regen it even during combat. And besides, shit happens. Extra mobs wandering up or whatever else might go wrong.
---
Asmon is unskilled as fuck. Even i see that, as a not even casual wow player. So comparing those 2 is retarded.
---
Glad you enjoy it aswell. :)
---
Hunters use melee often dumbass
---
Method is already changing the goal the day they saw Joker'll win the race into not just lvl 60 but also Rag.
---
Casual gatekeeping
---
Everyone was complaining about layering, but look at its potential!
---
You can, just log on both accounts on the same computer and launch two instances of wow, 1 for each account.
---
yeah count sharing is against the rules but they probably live in the same house so they're already playing on the same IP anyway.
---
Not likely to get caught.
---
and there's no rule against owning two accounts and playing them both at the same time.
---
Pro tip: Learn alchemy, first aid, fishing, and cooking. They cover a lot of the spots warriors are lacking in while leveling. 
---
Potions can give you really useful buffs (+armor, +strength, regen in the starter tier) along with in-combat healing. 
---
First aid gives you out of combat healing that‚Äôs faster than eating, and in-combat healing as long as you‚Äôre not getting hit, not to mention poison antidotes. 
---
Fishing and cooking give you a way to provide your own food so you can save your gold for your mount or a new sword or whatever. And a lot of cooking recipes produce food that gives buffs when you spend long enough eating.
---
I think some snobbiness will emerge as more people hit 60 but hopefully no outright toxicity.  Not being able to do cross-server raids should go a long way towards players having a personal reputation on each server.
---
No such thing as dual spec. If you want to respec, yes it gets steadily more expensive, capping at 50g.
---
And it's not really necessary to fret too much about your talent spec. I am invested mostly in the discipline tree because I found it was a good balance between offense and healing. For levelling just make sure that you have those first ten points, though. They're key. 
---
If you aren't happy with the speed of your kills I could see going deeper in shadow, but it doesn't really benefit your wanding, which is a good 1/3 (at least) of what you're doing.
---
Nice. I didnt see it live. Did he delete his character at 60 like he said while leveling or not in the end?  
---
Nicely done though! Especially after all these raids on him!
---
He's posted this exact same statement like 3 times already in various threads lol.
---
So much for not giving a shit.
---
Well, world first 60 or not, it **is** still a gnome.
---
Lol I hear ya. I not only saved a mage running for his life but also gave him a wand :) He was lvl 11 and I was 14.
---
Dude's gonna make a few month's salary today I bet.

I can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs worse, method fans calling out joker or joker fans calling out method.

Hope he enjoys his hollow victory since he only actually worked for about half of that : /
---
There is no victory in exploits
---
No I meant no wasn't silver.. it was red my bad
---
It‚Äôs not hate, just was funny how excited I was that my random dungeon and mob drops somehow made me look legitimately good
---
He obviously didn‚Äôt know what he was talking about.
---
sweet UI! Will do what ever druid does, turn in to a copy cat and nipp it from you ;)
---
You don't need to spec deep into holy to heal while levelling, but you do need +int gear.  Always swap to it when you head into a dungeon.  Don't try to heal Deadmines until you are lvl 20.  Flash of Light is your brad and butter.
---
I was hoping he'd deliver a speech that'd mention them and their accusations but I guess they redeemed themselves by subbing.
---
Joana didn't have layering.
---
he was about to delete his account, but he had mail LULW
---
I had one whole gold earlier today and I immediately took a screenshot and told my entire guild

[Method‚Äù is a professional raiding guild in the popular MMORPG ‚ÄúWorld of Warcraft‚Äù. Under the guidance of guild master Scott ‚ÄúSco‚Äù McMillan the guild has come to be revered by many as the most accomplished guild of all time with several noteworthy achievements under its belt such as multiple world firsts, high ranking PvP teams and losing the Classic 60 race to a bald Maltese gnome.](https://i.imgur.com/sKyGVLz.png)
---
No. And once layering is removed, it'll be impossible to do what he did again.
---
I still do it though, i like getting randomly buffed so I'm keeping the trend going so I can keep getting randomly buffed.
---
Was even 340k viewers at the end.
---
That's the pot calling the kettle black ya weeb. Go back to humping your waifu pillow.
---
Raid spec was 31/0/20 for a long time.
---
Mage, aoe grinded mobs, had people inviting him to change layer to avoid waiting for respawns.
---
Had people invite him after he killed a group of mobs so he could keep going without waiting for respawns
---
Only like 15 years late... :D
---
Yeah if i wanted to go for world first.i'd also deleite It because i'll like to actually enjoy the experience.
---
4g @20 here.
---
The computer taking actions on my behalf (botting) is different than me remotely controlling my computer. One is a violation of the ToS, the other is not. if I get busy or forget to remote back in, I get kicked. Botting doesnt forget and goes on forever allowing you to never disconnect due to afk. Big difference.

Yelling it wont make you any less salty and wrong

I just learned of this person so idk anything besides he was world first 60. Can you elaborate?

I missed the live event. Fuck.

took me 2 hrs lol. yeah down from 20K but lets see where the queues are tonight X__x
---
Random out of the blue transphobia? 
---
Ah, r/JoeRogan user, what a surprise
---
What part?  There's so little interaction outside of waiting for SoCasino to proc.  You also scale much worse than Warriors/Rogues/Hunters with gear.
---
A Paladin was my first 60 in vanilla and I healed as 20/0/31 all the way to Naxx...I genuinely wouldn't recommend playing one unless you just want to heal.
---
its as big of a deal as you want it to be... apparently 300,000 people thought it was interesting enough to watch the twitch stream of it, so that's something
---
Oh shit sorry didn't know they were trans.

I loved when he turned the corner and [saw everyone lined up along the road to greet him](https://i.imgur.com/hMzz5ID.jpg), he let out a legit "what the fuck?!" in amazement.
---
guild, friends, etc -- important long term things
---
He didn't mess with the layering system until 58 because horde players were stream sniping him.
---
every inn is like that during the day, I swear half the players are just anti-afking before they get home from work, and they're the reason stalagg has a 5000 person queue by noon
---
actually took a gap year in the middle of my phd program to play classic wow with my mom while we're both taking care of my greataunt. needed some time off to clear my head and i havent been this genuinely happy in a long, long time. my PI probably hates me but as I get older it really becomes more evident that fam &gt; work.
---
...the fuck
---
LMAO I don't even know what to say to this
---
There was a comment on a classic beta video that stuck to me:
---
&gt; In Classic WoW common pouches are more exciting than raid gear from BFA
---
he tried, but you can't delete when you have mail, and people kept sending him mail.
---
Damn he earned that. Made over 10k in subs alone. What a high he must be feeling from this.
---
People are salty as hell about this on wowhead's fb page on some "That's not how it's supposed to be played!" but isn't that one of the things we really wanted out of classic? Variable and unique experiences to be possible as opposed to the funnel that retail often feels like it puts us through? This is Jokerd's unique experience, so why take away from it?
---
Yeah when most people were children and on shit computers with no mmo experience 
---
The average player, if in a guild, can clear Naxx
---
GZ Jokerd with level 60
---
Joker played aprox 3 days 7 hours 10 minutes to 60
---
You can discipline your children, write your manifesto, try to beat your pull up record, dress up as a clown, stare at strangers, hide until the heat dies down, send anonymous messages that you shall return, etc
---
Actually he can do it faster
---
So you‚Äôre returning toxic with toxic. That doesn‚Äôt make you any better than them.
---
I can imagine you people frothing at the mouth with your face going beet red when you hit that report button
---
Wow, you're one of those people who cant think of anything to say, so you just spy on their past posts to smear them with ad hominem?
---
You're a reeeal winner, aren't ya?
---
uhm, please don't respond to people who aren't speaking to you.

I saw 333k viewers right at the peak after the teleport to Stormwind. Then he walked to Goldshire to delete his char, was blocked by unread mail, people sent him more to block the delete, so he logged back out to host the Method stream (their highest level at the time at level 55). Bit of a twat, lol :D
---
First 60+rag+ony. But METHOMEGALULD will probably now say its only for rag and ony of which they actually have a good % of getting
---
like how it was done in 2006 or something idk lmao
---
So not about that peasant life.
---
Method and their various streamers were being preeeettttty salty about being so far behind in the race and several outright accused him of cheating on their streams.  I think this response is to be expected.
---
I'm having the opposite on my server. Super humble
---
Your twitch phrases are making me cringe so hard that I'm going to implode
---
No one is genuinely hating on Method. It's just teasing.
---
Hes a seasoned speed leveler and he always goes to goldshire and deletes his characters.
---
Honestly right now everything is in high demand, i have gotten into RFC and WC groups instantly after saying "DPS LFG X" into general chat.
---
Memes I suppose
---
Someone hit 60?
---
I remote to my desktop at work from my phone start the que anywhere from 6-7k and average a thousand an hour. So I started que at 2pm and Ill be in around 7-9 when I am home. Nothing wrong with getting in line while you‚Äôre not home
---
it is a made up accusation, people want to believe the worst because they are salty and skeptical.
---
really.. Friday and no q on Gandling?
---
I almost bought that nice but in South shore. Was 50s though. Got a better one a couple hours later from a world drop. So glad I didn't waste the money.
---
No. I think he meant what he said.
---
To trigger everyone LULW
---
Server first, not World First. Come on guys, this is getting ridiculous.
---
You didn't actually watch did you? He only layered for level 58-60 because of stream snipers.
---
I don‚Äôt care either way but I‚Äôm just curious because I see the argument in the 99 other threads. What makes you so sure he didn‚Äôt account share?
---
The same argument you make for him not account sharing I can make for him account sharing. Is there evidence of him playing on video? Anything at all?
---
Like I said I don‚Äôt care either way and I‚Äôm not saying hurr durr you‚Äôre wrong, just wondering how you know he wasn‚Äôt account sharing.
---
It was both, they‚Äôre obviously focusing on Rag now that 60 has been achieved. I believe they changed the stream title actually from ‚Äòrace to world first 60‚Äô to just ‚Äòrace to world first‚Äô
---
Don't forget to invite your wife's son and bf!

DM is Deadmines
---
DM + DIRECTION is Dire Maul (plus wing)
---
Can paladins tank while leveling ? Any problem aggro-wide ? Resistance wide ? I know they lack of mana and a taunt at 60.
---
BoE means a bind on equipped item. So you are able to sell them up until the point you put it on your character. This is different than Bind on Pickup (BoP) which is unable to be sold to other players.
---
alliance warlocks are so dogshit in PVp it's unbelievable. literally 50% of horde pvpers are undead
---
I meant ‚Äúhe‚Äù as in it‚Äôs not just him playing. The fuck?
---
Kromcrush horde babyyyy
---
So he could have two world firsts, duh.  He would be the first person to delete a level 60 in classic.
---
Congrats Jokerd! Those who predicted a retail player getting first 60 are crazy, same with a Rag kill.
---
Four days since release, he made it in 3 days 7 hours of played. I suppose it depends how technical you want a "couple" to be.
---
Sometimes you guys forget that if you stop giving them money you cant play the game rofl
---
A guild that suites your play time will level at about the same rate you do. 
---
What I mean - you play 4 hours a day average. Well the hardcore guilds that put in 8+ hours a day will blow by you and you wont have a shot. However there is a bunch of guilds out there that only have the same 4 hours a day playtime as you (averages obviously) so if you want the hardcore guild, you have to have play time to match.
---
I just had my first kid this year and have very limited playtime. However I'm not stressing since I know theres lots of guilds and guild members out there in the same boat. I'm not aiming for a hardcore raid guild because I know I cant keep pace. I'll find a casual guild that plays and grows at the rate that matches mine. You should try to do the same
---
Love it, took about 35-40 minutes?
---
Am I wrong though?
---
just in general not this wep per say since it's a mace.

I wrote a guide for Linux recently.  For wow I recommend Manjaro as the base for better driver access, access to the AUR and it's a solid rolling distro with great DE packaging.  I run it with a Ryzen 2600, RTX2060 and get about 280fps in Linux.  Obviously I limit to my refresh rate of 144hz though.  :) 
---
I recommend the KDE Plasma flavor of Manjaro, but you can pick what suites you best.  BRB with link to my guide.
---
I would've moved already if my name wasn't taken on every other realm I've tried ;_;
---
aoe grinding WAS his main leveling method. thats basically all he did except for questing at lower levels.  layer hopping he only did from level 58 onwards so i wouldn't call that his main method either.
---
What is the actual time? Because it's frustrating not being able to take a break and go to the bathroom and grab something to eat without worrying about getting disconnected, because that would mean an end to being able to play that night. Not saying this is right or anything, but the queues are definitely a problem right now.
---
My attempt was 30 sec late, but here, [have a dinging screenshot too](https://i.redd.it/leeinzj6smj31.png).

RDPing externally is considered high risk because of possible data exfiltration. IT departments typically do care that people are RDPing out of their network but not because you might me playing Wow.
---
&gt; I believe there technically is a way to raise that skill
---
There were plans for it but it never got in-game. There is no way to learn or raise other languages.
---
rogues and ferals cat form = 1 atk power, hunters = 1 meele atk pwr, 2 range atk pwr

And people were saying you will not be able to AoE Grind because there will be too much people xD

Jokerd Gnome Mage, half an hour ago
---
Not everyone min max pets lmao
---
Well sort of. It's going to depreciate at absolutely skyrocketing speeds as people level up.
---
Didnt start layer abuse until 58 and he was way ahead of everyone else. He would've got it either way.
---
He doesn't have a brother. All the brother stuff was clip bait and shit tons of people fell for it.
---
Intentional layering happened.
---
I got a +4 agility ring at level 21. Was so freaking excited. I'm a Hunter though.

---
No thanks. I want that slow shitty drop rate. Make me EARN that quest completion. 
---
Or if they up the drop rate, increase the amount we need to get to make it just as long.
---
I didn't. Leveling in Classic is fine because because of the whole "journey" thing and the late game not having a whole lot of content. Leveling taking forever in retail is a shit change because any time I want to level a new class it now takes forever to get through 15 years of content that I have already seen multiple times. BfA has pretty much killed alts though so I guess that's what they were planning since that xp change.
---
Me 5 mins ago lol

Little known secret: Throwing weapons are quick. Even a low level dagger gets the job done.

&gt;  Kargoz warrior leveling guide
---
can you explain the start attack macro? i dont understand that. i never it because its a pain to click enemies.
---
It's absolutely unbelievable how entertaining that guy was. Son Goku scream, so many balding jokes and amazing music and ending and presentation and celebration and the pure sheer dominance. There is no way that method's stream could have come even close to that level of entertainment.         
---
This guy won the internet for the year 2019 for me. Fucking good job.
---
Its because its embarrassing to their whole operation. They told a bunch of sponsors they would be world first and made this huge thing of renting a studio and streaming coverage as if it's the super bowl. 
---
Then they lost world first badly like 5 levels behind. They shifted the goal posts to world first ragnaros kill and I doubt that will happen either. Private server players have all the world firsts on lock.
---
WHAT ARE YOU DOING MY SON?
---
Wait did he really hit 60? I thought it was a meme
---
TBF Finland isn't even Scandinavian coutry
---
best server eu
---
What do you mean switching layers? How do I trigger a new layer and how can I use this to my advantage?
---
Furthermore: METH OMEGALUL D
---
Translation: the OP didn't pick a server with friends or a guild. Therefore he feels you are an idiot for not abandoning your people to go play on the server he is on.  
---
I doubt he will even make it to 60 and that would be a good thing.  We don't have to listen to him cry about how his server's population is dead
---
Why are people watching streams when they could simply play themselves?  Boorrriiiinnnnngggggg!
---
Besides, layering wasn't in original wow, so I call shenanigans!  What a pathetic loser, lol.
---
Everyone who played when Classic was actually released.
---
I enjoy joanas leveling guide. It was well done in vanilla and it‚Äôs well done now
---
Thunderfury hasn't had a queue since I first logged into it on Tuesday night. High population server, only been disconnected once, and that was on the first night.
---
Where the fuck are you getting pre level 20 rings lol
---
Well, he probably made a lot of money today with 300k plus watching him. So that's certainly something.
---
I‚Äôm just playing devils advocate my man.
---
What UI addon are you using? Are you happy with it?
---
The realms are so insanely overcrowded as it is that I don't think that will be an issue.
---
Like the overcrowding will get WORSE as they remove layering, queues will probably get longer too.
---
He did do it on a pvp server tho
---
A lot of big name gaming outlets will never throw shade at large companies since it could hurt them in the future. If you want real unbiased gaming news try independent sources like youtube creators
---
Ok, great! I will take a look at it.
---
So much cursing
---
Kind of funny that Method announced a ‚Äúrace to world first‚Äù contest only to lose immediately.  I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll account-share their way to Rag, though.
---
Phew, it would've been very dissapointing after all that for it to be illegitimate
---
You can't switch when you roll with a group.
---
Maybe one day you will make friends and understand
---
Nothing like recovering from an ending relationship by playing some good ol' fashioned WoW classic.
---
Yup a Troll Rogue with a /played of around 10 days. Talk about an utter waste of time.
---
I have 9 left.
---
Ah gotchu! good idea as well.
---
Not everyone played vanilla lol. I was 4 or 5 when wow came out in ‚Äò04 so I really only played during wrath. And even then just barely.
---
Are there any chicken in Tirisfal Glades ?!
---
It's almost like you should just play on a different server
---
Not confirmed but my theory on queues jumping backwards is because of disconnects. It‚Äôs confirmed that if you DC you have a grace period to relog without waiting in queue. So someone who DCs, the queue counter would initially read that as you moving up 1 spot, and then if they log back in you‚Äôd move back 1 spot. 
---
Something like 500 like the figures you mentioned was probably a mass DC who then all got back in. Again, just a theory‚Äîbut I have seen the queues go up in number too so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve guessed at
---
I honestly wish I knew about this kid before today
---
I too shall also tattoo that onto your cock.
---
what do you expect with people like Jakenbake, tips etc
---
Not exactly hardcore gaming veterans
---
Wow dude. You found a way to shit on someone not even remotely related to the topic. Are you proud?
---
I'd buy Jokerd cool for $1,000,000
---
I can and that's the main reason I'm rolling tank
---
He was getting ganked though.
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt care about the ‚Äúrace to world first‚Äù or whatever
---
You quite clearly do care, and care quite a lot.
---
Awesome. I didn't turn on the audio until level 58 so only caught the end
---
Salt
---
I was going through his VOD atlaunch and saw that he thought he would only have 0.01% chance to get WF. It it also pretty interesting to see him chat with his speed runner buddies and how organized he was. And there were people expecting him to get the WF. nothing is random, he worked hard for it and made history.
---
My server has no queue, I moved and many people complaining can as well
---
I believe you can just do it by joining other people's parties. You need to have friends of different layers and then just group and ungroup with different ones
---
It will change every day
---
It is still the single biggest individual achievement in classic. Hats off to the first raid kills, but this takes far more dedication to accomplish in my eyes.
---

Have a plethora of followers continually invite you to group then leave the group.
---
Hit P to open your skills, then go to general and look for the new cooking skill icon you were given. Open that up and click on what you want to make while at a campfire or most sources of fire I guess.
---
This is the same as saying him grouping with someone or using his blink spell is exploiting. It‚Äôs a game mechanic. There‚Äôs no honor to be had, it‚Äôs a race for FIRST by any means necessary. If the other people gunning for 60 aren‚Äôt using this then they‚Äôre missing out.
---
Say there‚Äôs one person who is racing for 60 that is trying not to use layering for whatever reason, but gets invited to a group, puts him in a new layer, and he kills mobs and gets xp he maybe wouldn‚Äôt have gotten otherwise, is his run to 60 ruined? No. It‚Äôs part of the game.
---
i'm prepared!
---
It's not as impactful for leveling and gearing sure, but for endgame it does change hit cap from 9% to 6% which is fairly significant.
---
He actively raids mythic on retail
---
Oh hey, a mage. I am Jacks complete lack of surprise. 
---
Grats though, definitely hard earned.
---
Well this tread made me feel better. Apparently I'm not the only one getting merked in the Barrens lol

For real, imagine if he did it from the start. Would be 10 hours saved at least
---
He has multiple world firsts in different servers and only even started layering way later.
---
Get invited to someone in a different layers group when all the spawns are dead or you see pvpers
---
Big shout out to the random undead warlock running near thunder bluff that saved my ass at literally 13 hp. Came in so clutch.
---
Cause it's only in greens that dropped for him from mobs, so his gear is shit, he has no quest progression, and he's done no dungeons.
---
Any video of this?
---
Who gives a shit?
---
So some Asmon clone, neckbeard streamer thinks he's hot shit because he hit max level in a 15 year old game, more than a decade behind the actual world first holder. And now he wants his fans to give him a giant ego boost.
---
Maybe then but better to just save your silver.

Would you like to see more of it?

Sorry my friends and guild all rolled here and we're lv30+ just figured people would appreciate the meme. Wasn't meant as a complaint thread.

I wish

Yea, that book was written in 1925 well before World War II.
---
Quick question if you don't mind? 
---
How do you go about Screech rank 2? Is it automatic or do you need to find a mob that already has rank 2 in the same way you acquire screech in the first place?
---
He'll become his own Devilsaur Mafia.
---
APES will get rag first
---
cool beans
---
someone from another invites you and you go into their layer, which can mean new mobs, new mines and herbs, etc.
---
I have done to 300 on rats
---
Go to a fire in an inn or any fire really. Press p and one of your skills in general should be cooking, click on that. If you don't have the skill find a trainer, ask a guard.
---
Yeah he cheesed the layering.
---
Not even close the what the ACTUAL world first was.

This guy's a weeb.

I get this is probably a joke, but for those who don‚Äôt know:

I get four weeks a year and was thinking about using a week for classic launch but decided I'd take the week off when I hit 50 to finish off that last leg.
---
If they had happened to get first 60, they would have really cared about the first 60 race aswell, trust me. Now that they missed it, it's not that important anymore. 
---
Can't really blame them, almost everyone choose to prioritize what they are most successful at, it's just how humans work.
---
You're completely right. Blizzard had to adopt a "play the patch" design style out of necessity. Endgame is designed to be the meat of the game, which makes total sense.  They couldn't feasibly add 100+ hours of leveling content each expansion to retain the feeling of it being a "journey" if they wanted to have any sort of endgame at max level, which is when they'll players to want to continue playing week after week. 
---
I somewhat agree/disagree on the accessibility of raiding in retail, though. I think the difficulty system manages it fairly well. Mythic is still incredibly exclusive, relatively speaking, with LFR being on the opposite end. Most people don't count LFR as raiding, and you really shouldn't, as it's just a glorified tour of the raid and boss models so people can actually see the work Blizzard is putting in.  Normal is still fairly easy, but it works well as a launching point for newer players or people that are just dabbling into the raiding scene for the first time. Heroic feels like it's in a good spot for most players, although this tier it feels a little easy since you can cheese a couple bosses with enough DPS a little earlier than you could in previous tiers.
---
For your average player, they'll still go through a mostly linear progression of Normal -&gt; Heroic -&gt; Mythic each patch if they continually push the content they are geared for. Titanforging shakes things up a bit, allowing people to get into higher difficulties before they're actually capable of it from a skill perspective, and I'm really hoping they get rid of it to smooth things out. I don't have a huge issue with M+ giving heroic gear since it at least requires you to put in the effort of running the +10 key, which is difficult for a lot of people. Maybe they could just reduce the iLvl you get from the end chest/weekly chest by 10, but that'd be it. 
---
The biggest drawback of this system is that it mostly invalidates old content, which is kinda sad since the raid tiers lately have been fantastic. I'm not really sure how you can manage to keep old content relevant while also wanting to move people into the most current content. At least it's somewhat mitigated by the fact that I'm consistently running the raid while it's relevant, so I usually will get my fill of the tier haha. We're also getting much bigger raids on average, which helps.
---
Joana did it in Vanilla. Private servers and Classic will always be only an approximation. 
---
I‚Äôm not taking anything away from those players. But I consider them separate games. Joana owns the vanilla record. Others own private server records. Joker owns the Classic world first (and speed record, for now).
---
Method has all of the main raid guys in a fishbowl in LA with a bunch of casters doing the full world first production right now.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
reading all those stories and experiencing them myself again just feels so good and I love the fact so many people feel the same way!
---
had so much fun yesterday when a fellow gnome and me escorted a lvl 12 priest in wetlands -- he pretended to be the pope and we were his bodyguards - things like this makes this game feel so good again
---
Generally any nodding of models/textures results in a ban... unless they changed their policy on this recently.

Deleted off the private server where he practice?

Since I had an internet connection ever so long ago I played every MMO I could get my hands on. Played most of them to max level, others usually the asian ones I would get close or such and move on. If you wanna talk current MMO era then the only "good ones" (subjective as always since people still play the garbage that is BDO) I have played consistently are GW2 (Not recently though since they announced it was basically on life support, SWTOR (Only because its SW and the new expansion seems nice), FF14 ((I have all classes to 80 already after about a month of playing ShB launch, did all content but savage)) that game is proof you can have a single player driven like story, LFR/LFD and still have a very active and friendly community. Then I play TESO here and there. And of course I play Retail and classic (Way less. Ive played it a couple hours at a time otherwise I get bored). 
---
Finally I started in WOTLK near the end but didnt sink time in until Cata. Though I think it doesnt matter TBH, peoples tastes and such change throughout life. For example I used to HATE turn based RPG's 15 odd years ago but now I rather love them! I used to enjoy visual novels but no longer do now. I was always in favor of classic coming back because there is a playerbase for it (A massive one however I doubt heavily) and we all love WoW. Is Retail perfect? Not at all NO GAME IS. But I love almost everything about the game and have since MoP (MoP was peak WoW imo, I would rather have MoP servers than classic lol). If blizzard made retail more and more like classic again I wouldn't sub anymore. Then they would lose someone playing both games. People talk about this sense of community but I see other players all the time, I go out of my way to chat with them, do WQs together, ect. I am not on this subreddit to bash classic lovers but this circlejerk of Retail being garbage and it's going to die now that Classic is here..or that Retail HAS to become classic pisses me and a lot of the main wow reddit off. Which is a shame since I supported classic but now I kinda want it to lose over half its playerbase in 6 months so I can have a laugh about it BUT nope I won't I want both versions to be their own thing because again WE ALL LOVE WOW.
---
&gt;Consequently
---
Conversely
---
If you like dog go for a kitty, high dps
---
There's nothing more enjoyable than not knowing where you should be leveling at any given time, having to run back and forth across an entire zone multiple times because the quest chains don't flow easily, and when you might be destroying/vendoring quest items that aren't marked as such.
---
&gt; /u/Wumbolojizzt Yelling it wont make you any less salty and wrong
---
Explain how I'm salty or wrong? I don't participate in these races nor am I in the competitive wow community. 
---
I just don't believe praise should be given to those who cheat.
---
He did it for 2 levels. I'll say it again - HE DID IT FOR 2 LEVELS, 58-60. 
---
I hope people don't blow out this argument against him. Also remember, don't blame joker for abusing layering, blame blizzard.
---
When the dorky girl gets cute over the summer
---
Ye doesn't give a shit, said so on stream. Even said "ima be transparent" to bait some forsenCD's. He doesn't need to prove himself, he already has world first by a wide margin and could easily do it without layering abuse
---
Medium pops don‚Äôt have a queue. At least in my experience.
---
Herb and alchemy is always nice. If you are playing both toons roughly the same amount I guess there is no need to have tailoring on both.
---
Goes to absolutely murder the other faction.
---
Agreed.
---
Rip. Which server?
---
One doesn't not simply swim into Stormwind
---
Makes it even more hardcore since he would be deleting 420 gold aswell..
---
Bruh, I hit lvl 9 last night.
---
Curious to see how many subs he got in that last stretch. They were coming in non stop for the 15 minutes I was watching I can only imagine he'll make well over 6 figures this month alone.
---
Only if you want to go for Truefaith Vestments
---
sweet summer child.
---
Guild banks are not a thing, your officers will make bank alts. Or make them yourself.

Fuckin' LOL

the leading players will snipe 80% of the market, the casual player will not have more

Good talk!
---
There are multiple "old school" western MMOs in development but all have been delayed so we will have to wait to see how they shake out
---
I'll never not upvote this meme.
---
Level 19 should be perfect for Deadmines
---
There would have to be a way for players to opt-in to community content for sure. It would have to be isolated somehow (maybe there's a zone for user-content or something, kinda like Outlands). 
---
One idea to explore would be restricting where gear from community quests could be used. For example, if you have a three dungeons made by Creator A, you would only be able to use Creator A's custom items in those dungeons.
---
Alternatively, Blizzard could just create random loot tables/templates for dungeons of a given level, and content creators could plug those into their dungeons directly (so they don't get to explicitly decide which items drop where). 
---
It would be challenging to implement, and it certainly has flaws, but I'm not convinced it's impossible. An opt-in setup would be absolutely necessary though.
---
but doesnt it make sense? I mean maybe it could be that if you've mastered a weapon you start other ones with a small boost or something to ease the repetitive ness but if you're a specialist in 1 weapon you would be worse with another, naturally -- it seems a fair enough RPG mechanic. What would you sugggest you just buy the skill and instantly have what ever the highest hit chance is currently?
---
Stop calling them alt right nazis. They are nazis.
---
Title wrong. Ninja owns the (any game) twitch concurrent views record. Over 600,000 I believe it was. Now for wow, that's Joker. But not any game. Very misleading
---
So clearly nobody else is having any issues
---
Lol same here, guess I cant help
---
Requires least amount of effort to click haha.
---
I didn't forget I just dont have inventory space for an ugly ass pet like this
---
It‚Äôs the same. The tooltip literally says 26 damage for rank 1 and 25-27 damage for rank 2. Tbh I‚Äôm really confused about it.
---
Good idea about the no party thing.
---
I spent quite a few seconds debating the pros and cons of using a bag space to carry my fishing pole while questing
---
Skinning and leather working, you can start with herbing for money
---
Gz on first 60 but.... Not sure what to think of this. Exploiting layering to AOE grind more effectively is same as doping in competitive sports, but that's just my opinion. Anyway at the very least I don't think this should be compared with actual vanilla speedrun records.
---
THIS - I took 2 days off work due to having a lot of extra vacation days and had an absolute BLAST, however with that being said I can definitely say if I had continued to play for a full week straight I would be burned out as well.
---
You took a week off of work so just enjoy your time, do things besides play the game and then you will find yourself wanting to login and continue. I understand you think you will only be happy if you are playing hardcore but if you are already getting burned out I would honestly just slow down a bit, enjoy the progression (even if leveling isnt your favorite) and just go with the flow.
---
sorry for the noob question - how can you tell what layer you or people in other parties are on?
---
Finding the best and fastest way possible to level up is pretty impressive
---
Ashbringer, since that‚Äôs what my friends chose when they started up.
---
This isn't really useful. The information is over 18 hours old
---
There is no taint here. Blame the system, not joker. If system (blizzard) enables this, then they are at fault, not the "abusers" (Joker)
---
buddy... there are servers with no queue..
---
That's saying it was last updated last night around 6:30pm unless I missing something obvious?
---
What show?
---
Classic is much harder than private servers to aoe farm due to differences in mob spawns, mana regen, and spell batching which explains the 3 days 7 hours time.
---
I haven't seen any evidence so far and I've been looking
---
I took a ‚Äúsick‚Äù day yesterday.  Already a 3 day weekend otherwise I might have been tempted lmfao

---
False, because someone else would have gotten 60 during patch 1.12 when it was current.
---
This isn't Vanilla. Just because a group of people all get together and call something the wrong thing doesn't make it the correct way to call something.
---
Even Blizzard correctly calls it Classic.
---
I like the screech noise and I hope the enemy player has their sound pumped up for it too.
---
I‚Äôve only had that happen once in Classic. A copper node visible from outside Jangolode Mine in Westfall that vanished as I moved into the tunnel.
---
Once you have Consecration, aggro won't be an issue. Mana will be though, so ideally you want to pair with mages for big AoE pulls and plenty of drinking in between.
---
Now get some rest!
---
The Mandalorian
---
No need to blame him, his /played record is just invalid.
---
Not in wc2
---
Sometimes the servers jump up by a large amount.  Good luck
---
It‚Äôs not from a trailer. The sound is from a cinematic in Warcraft III.
---
Its fun
---
Getting to 60 isn't a sport.
---
&gt; But instead of using aggressive server mergers to bring more players together in a healthy environment they instead decided to erode server identity and turn every player into an island.
---
The problem is, those empty leveling experiences happened on servers with large and healthy populations too.
---
As you level, I‚Äôd recommend two gathering professions ‚Äî mining and skinning or herbalism. These will help you make money, as you can sell those materials on the Auction House. Later on (level 50+), you can switch one of your gathering professions to blacksmithing or engineering. Blacksmithing can be lucrative, and you can create some interesting gear. Engineering is just a *blast* (ba-dum-tsss).
---
Early on, I‚Äôd direct your focus to PvE, as your probably won‚Äôt do a whole lot of PvP until later on. With that said, you can **easily** tank any dungeon with the Arms spec, and that one is generally accepted as the best leveling and end-game PvP spec. I would actually avoid protection until you get to ~50, as it takes away opportunities for more dps.
---
Any other questions, just let me know! And I‚Äôd welcome others to chime in if you have a difference of opinion. I‚Äôve gotten a warrior to 60 once (arms 1-50, protection 51-60), but I do not consider myself to be overly knowledgeable.
---
Or a stylish  Cenobite from Hellraiser
---
Battlegrounds in classic do not give XP
---
Thanks for the answer, extra bag it is!
---
Take a chill pill. He did it for the last 2 levels, at which point he was 2 or more levels ahead. So say what you will about him saving at most a few hours, when in the end it changes nothing about the result. 
---
And yes he could do it without layering as well, don't be silly.
---
I can blame both cause he wasnt forced to abuse it. He was in the lead and could have just kept leveling more legitly
---
Kazukan kazakit HA
---
I've seen too many ppl doing this
---
lol neither will the people with 4 hour queues
---
I just use /petattack. It should attack your target.
---
/petattack
---
Yes, Kirtonos is mostly full and that is with layers. When they remove layering you will want a lower pop server. Herod and Faerlina are fucked for Phase 2 layering removal. They won‚Äôt be able to remove it.
---
Hmm the thunk of arrows is pretty nice. Just think of the imagery with it.
---
Id be playing pally if it wasnt alliance only!
---
everquest did this, called them alternate ability points. at a certain level you could divert your xp flow into them instead of your character xp (or just wait till max level then switch). IMO its a decent system, the artifact from legion was somewhat similar to it
---
IMO it can work but the problem EQ faced was if people fell behind, or they were new to the game, and a new xpac released and added more points, people were just buried in needing to grind so many points. if they included a system when once you hit the 1st new character level of an xpac you are granted the points from the previous xpac to spend it would work better
---
Think about it. You're actually skinning their best friend.
---
damn im totally going for those now... are they a pain in the ass to make?
---
but at one point vanilla WAS retail
---
I mean, you're not wrong that the economy is weak in general right now, but there's definitely still opportunities to make money on the AH. I personally wouldn't buy an upgrade at a low level (except maybe a wand), but there are people out there who will. Some classes really need those high damage weapons, and some people just aren't thinking about the grind to 60 in as efficient of a manner. There are also definitely people buying up greens to level ench and such. There's lots of silver to be made.... not so much gold yet however. lol

he's 22. he's played more "retail" than actual official vanilla, lol

Yeah I don‚Äôt think a raid should be used to skip content when we can use other ways to skip the content for newer players. That‚Äôs what I meant not that it shouldn‚Äôt be done. I‚Äôll edit to be more clear on that aspect. Thank you

Huh?  How can they play alongside me if I'm in queue?

It's not their fault, why should they have to leave behind everything they've done so far so that I don't have to wait in line?

I'm not an asshole, holy shit.  I wouldn't do that to them.

Make friends with a priest and group with them. Thats what me and a friend have been doin.

How are they solid?  Anyone using Nightfall will take a DPS hit but Warriors, Hunters, and even Shamans can maintain the proc better.  Paladins are quite literally the worse of the potential Nightfall users.

I assume anyone speed racing to 60 would roll on a pve server, though I guess it makes no difference once you get a few levels ahead of everyone else.

True, but agi also gives armor. So even for a int class, an agi ring is still better than a blank slot and you can‚Äôt de/vendor it still once you get something better.

Ashkandi. Consistent medium to high pop, never a queue time when i hop on during peak hours. Seems like a good balance

Well it wasnt in the spirit of vanilla was it.

Oh yeah, absolutely.
---
Why do people love doing everything speedy? Did private servers spawn some super serious min max group of players? I legit never heard of people who legit judge for races and want 60 in 3 days UNTIL private server culture lol.

He has records of 2 days 17 hours and 3 days 10 hours on private servers so it really didnt make much of a difference it seems, mainly helped against gankers

Any decent player ‚Äúwho practices their route‚Äù. Good routing/times do not come without practice, regardless of how good you are. To clarify, it‚Äôs impossible to ‚Äúbeat‚Äù Joanna‚Äôs record. His record is for original vanilla wow from over a decade ago. You can‚Äôt magically travel back to that time to take his record. I‚Äôm not trying to take away from his achievement, it was an amazing achievement; it just doesn‚Äôt hold up to today‚Äôs standards of top tier speed running.
---
Classic is much more grindy than retail. Things like daily activities and catch up mechanics dramatically reduce the number of times you NEED to repeat any given task to make progress. For a player like myself who wants to play wow 10 hours a day, I'm still grinding dungeons all day to get better WF pieces but the guy who gets annoyed after his 3rd dungeon and wants to quit can make progress in retail but can't in classic.

I'm glad I saw this. The Wowhead guide for Druids in Classic says we can learn polearms so I was about to waste time running to Stormwind to get to the weapon trainer. I'm disappointed too because those stats look nice.

well big streamers like Shroud are giving up a decent amount of viewers for now to stream Classic. But yeah he might be the exception, not the norm. Plus he is probably more comfortable financially than most streamers so he probably doesn't mind a temporary drop in viewership.

All the big FPS streamers that are playing classic probably have less viewers then normal.
---
I feel attacked
---
There's no reason to assume that he is account sharing because he honestly isn't playing more than other people who are racing. He slept more than Kennymarsh for example.
---
They already did this
---
Honestly that would be hilarious and i think there's room for both of your examples within the game.  I hear your point though.
---
My character does this sometimes because my 3 year old daughter and 8 year old sons both just like jumping on it.
---
Hydraxian Waterlords!
---
After they loot it.
---
And we are talking about dps here?
---
What do you mean? A couple is two, not four.
---
Sauce please. I‚Äôd rather see than take your word.
---
I thought I read this before and couldn‚Äôt remember if it was a copypasta joke or something. Still true.
---
So the 95% of fresh 60's. Salty kids from method's chat dont understand the game lul
---
Having some guy hit spacebar every once in a while isn't really "sharing an account."
---
As long as they fully loot the corpse. Protop: wait until the person killing animals walks away from the corpse or it‚Äôs apparant they aren‚Äôt skinning it themselves. Don‚Äôt be like the undead rogues in the barrens that run right up to my kill while I‚Äôm still looting it because yes I am going to skin it when I‚Äôm done
---
And here I am, still level 13 in Westfall haha
---
Yeah it is NOW because they lost. Method was in the race to 60, too.
---
You can tank? I usually don't get enough Rage for a Sunder Armor before the mob is eating the healer.
---
whats his character on retail? guessing a lvl 120 ilvl 500 gnome monk?
---
I'm not seeing anything about that in my Google search, at best it looks like SoCrusader is used with Nightfall and that makes sense if it can only proc off your physical hits
---
If they don‚Äôt release BC in its original form me and many others are gone. How is ‚Äúclassic‚Äù changing major components? Makes no sense.
---
This isn‚Äôt the players fault. This is blizzards fault for underestimating classic popularity and forcing us to find ways to combat the que. I had to find a way to stay logged in so I have been using Google Remote Desktop and click to move every 30 minutes while at work. I‚Äôm technically not using any script or macro so I‚Äôm in the clear. But it‚Äôs sad that they launched with so few servers and we‚Äôre at this point. Eventually it will get better after the initial rush.
---
A twink is going to be very expensive to put together I made them at every bracket in Vanilla except 59 and they were straight up money holes. Classic will be around for a while, my tip to you is to level a class that you enjoy and get it to 60 at your own pace. Relive the world, enjoy it and then use that character to farm for your twinks. The path to 60 isnt as difficult as it seems, it does take time and a lot of patience. 
---
PvP at 60 is it's own beast it's incredibly fun regardless of gear if you play with a good team. 
---
Making a twink wont be beneficial until they add in BGs so they'll probably just sit there until that patch rolls around.
---
Queus will not disappear overnight if you banned everyone afk dodging.  It'll go down, sure.  But it will still be there.
---
Yeah who cares about video games amirite? I'm too cool to care about silly things like that
---
You claim this guy is a snowflake yet you apparently can't handle when other people say something you disagree with and demand they keep it to themselves? Who is actually the fragile delicate one here?
---
xenif
---
was a joke, he didn't share the account
---
Well, why did you make a guild instead of joining a guild?
---
You'll probably never see them play that again, unfortunately. I remember reading back in those days that Maynard was pissed at the crowd reactions during that tour. The meathead portion of the crowd at a lot of those shows was pretty obnoxious during the quieter parts of those songs.
---
Most people don't mob grind to 60 though?
---
true!
---
*moan*
---
I think commercially for Blizzard, the way WoW went was a great idea. However, for those of us who prized socialising rather than reward, it was negative. 
---
If you drew a venn diagram of the people with an opinion about the subject, I reckon there'd be a circle with the people who wanted to have to work for their MMO and make friends and that would be about 2/3 of the starting subscribers, if I had to label them I'd say old school gamers. Then you'd have all the people who heard what a great game it was and joined around late TBC/WOTLK time and wanted the game to be as easy to pick up and put down as it could be, casual players, and that would be about 2/3 of the subscribers of that period. But by WOTLK we're talking about millions and millions of people, so in that venn diagram the circles are hugely disproportianate. 
---
I'm not arguing about who has a right to what here obviously, because everyone's allowed an opinion, but i do know the circle of people I was forced to interact with over the course of the life of my subscription got smaller and smaller. My circle of friends were firm, but my circle of acquaintances became vanishingly small.
---
You think he spammed the unnoficial time in SW or something?
---
ban waves + free transfers to low pop
---
I honestly have no idea how anyone can play any class besides druid. The game should just be World of Druid.
---
....nice
---
You hit the nail on the head.
---
I saw Slutface on Fairbanks, that one isn‚Äôt going to make it
---
It many ways yes but in many ways the retail game has brought incredibly cool challenges to us.
---
The Azshara fight is an incredible dance of mechanics that require so much coordination to pull off. I actually think it‚Äôs one of the coolest designed fights ever in WoW. That kind of complexity only comes when you constantly want to raise the bar.
---
Puntin' time
---
Didn‚Äôt know he did the STV quest! Fuck him that quest sucks lmao tons of exp though. Cool vid.
---
Because a lot of people hate transmog since you can't exactly see what gear someone has, if they were to have cosmetics it would be the same problem all over again.
---
Flamelash
---
Sounds like latency
---
That could be! I‚Äôll have to check that later, since I don‚Äôt have any spell dmg or int gear yet.
---
You think you deserve to play over me? How dare you
---
&gt; Carpal tunnel so have trouble using my left hand properly
---
&gt; Doing these rotations and tabbing to different targets hurts so instinctively I click and get all fucked up
---
Every battle. Every quest. Causes me great pain and enjoyment.
---
In one of my classes in the Uni, after a group project I found out one of my classmates also played wow. The first 2 days we talked about normal stuff; classes, raids, fucking legion legos, etc. The third day, as we walk through the filled as fuck hallways towards the exit, he begins to tell me in detail about this wow porn video he saw the other day. I had seen coloseum of lust so I recognized it at some point but holy shit he just wouldnt catch the hint that I wanted that conversation to stop.
---
Most effects in vanilla were "batched" at 400ms intervals, and everything in each batch is considered more or less simultaneous. So you can kill a mob that kills you, two mages can sheep each other, etc.
---
This is vanilla behavior that was specifically re-implemented for Classic.
---
Haha I was confused lol thanks for the laugh
---
I think they will go down eventually but it sucks because it's basically a self-fulfilling prophecy discouraging people to play.  I would love for every server to be at or near max capacity as long as the queue isn't insane.  It makes the world feel more alive.
---
/world  Someone inv for layer hop please?
---
3 Agility, 1 stam, damn straight my Warlock is rocking that ring.
---
Originally leveled in Vanilla using succ drain tank method.
---
Plan to use it again because it is just non stop asswhoop.
---
Pyrewood village EU
---
just skip through the vods and stop bullshitting
---
that's racist as fuck
---
no really if it's racist to say it about other races it's just as racist to say it about white people. 
---
Which is weird because reddit HATES racists... yet you have upvotes!
---
I can agree on the idea, but to say that classic is a "proof" of this is crazy. It's not even one week since launch, let's see how it fares in 2 weeks, two months, 6 months, etc...
---
There isn‚Äôt one. I rerolled in Vanilla for this reason. Hit 60 and had no one to run dungeons with so just restarted and leveled again on another server.
---
Jokerd got 350k tho :p
---
Not only do they have to grind to get allied races, they then need to start at level 20 with that allied race char and level and grind all over again with the char they wanted to play from the start
---
&gt;shit state of retail guilds
---
Method literally just came off getting a world first for the most recent raid tier in BFA. I don't see how that is the absolute "shit state".
---
Which is part of the reason I couldn't play it long. It felt like every lancer was the same lancer. It was also kind of easy to figure out like the rotations are very apparent. If that gets more complex later on I see the appeal but other then that I really don't get it.
---
&gt;At least not without drugs. 
---
&gt;coke and cigarettes
---
"Its extremely fun to grind the same monster for 8 hours, here you go son, I'm going to get some shut eye. Good luck!"
---
Can't even reply this, speak for himselfs
---
I only played wow for 6 months before in wotlk, and I was blacklisted from raids because my name was CLOSE TO the name of an infamous ninja looter (I was dirtyjobs, he was dirtyjob) they literally blacklisted me "just in case", and all it took was one guild to do it, and then all of the guilds had me on blacklist, and I was getting kicked from PUG groups constantly, even fucking dungeons.
---
I'm so tilted I'm already running into these idiot blacklisters, and because the server is so populated people won't bother to give you the benefit of the doubt, they'd rather be safe and have nobody in their PUG on the blacklist because there's a thousand other people ready to raid, and not blacklisted.
---
Yeah, Bonhams drumming in highway to hell really is something else.
---
Affliction.
---
How to play?
---
Moar dots.
---
From 22 on.
---
Ah the corpsemaker, had it on a twink back in the day with crusader, it was awesome!
---
Get that guy on the right some back support LOL. Man is gonna need it!!!
---
He was gonna delete his character but people kept spamming him with mail
---
We‚Äôll be your friend, mr. anxiety! Ally side on Benediction. :)
---
There is no proof and no way to prove it. Method fucked up big time by "confirming" the account sharing though. The only "proof" was Jokerd joking about it, which got clipped and sent to Method who swallowed the bait whole.
---
Join us on Flamelash :) small queues, only English language in chat, very nice server in my opinion
---
But wait. People actually believe dungeon grinds are faster than aoe pulls?
---
Respect for every aoe mage btw. Thats the definition of patience.
---
Right in the feels
---
Hey you have my laptop
---
It kinda makes no sense they would recreate the chest just for the sake of it being there and taunting everyone :/
---
giant surprise, vanilla pserver players &gt; retail players when it comes to vanilla
---
what hubris to think you're going to beat someone who lived and practiced this shit for years. i can't wait for pserver guilds to get every world first too
---
I agree with you, I appreciate your reply and your analogy helps hammer your statement further into place. 
---
You're right, they're not going to admit they're wrong. This mentality of "I know what you want more than you do" is incredibly narcissistic, and the adamant refusal to apologize or admit defeat is just another narcissistic trait.
---
58-60 is like the a days worth of play without layering
---
I cant play for a couple hours - pm ;)
---
It doesnt really matter, you basicly need to do 1-2 questlines and farm some dungeons anyway, doesnt mattter did u grind, quest or dungeon farm. Thats how the game works, brd farm could give u 2-3 bis depends on class, but thats it
---
How is it a scam to charge for your work? Do you expect people to serve you food, unclog your pipes, and maintain your roads for free? Or are they all scam artists too?
---
30 mins

Noticed how they‚Äôve exchanged classic talent for bfa item enhancements which are similar to old talents
---
You might wanna be safe when it comes to treasure chest Isaac.
---
The big problem is this sub moves so fast, and its typically the memes/streamer stuff that gets upvoted, so if you do make a post not many people are going to see it.
---
Why are you in this thread then?
---
Sulfuras, the sleeper server
---
xdxd
---
Classic had all sorts of these types of issues that people will slowly remember.
---
I haven't beat the queue monster yet
---
saying there isn't an accomplishment because he used layering to get away from gankers is pure delusion, you ate up someone else's bullshit by believing in the account sharing meme, he did literally no cheating, you're just being salty
---
You have to be by a fire. You can make your own once you pick up cooking aswell
---
I used to play on the pvp server, tichondrius, in retail and to be honest, there are a certain kind of people that congregate to certain servers. This server was home of the trolls, racists, and your usual unfriendly person. If you were a nice person and listened to the things in chat, then chances are you were going to be offended in one way or another. 
---
This is not the case for all servers though. I originally played on a PvE server and it was night and day. People on the pve servers are far less likely to be aggressive, more friendly, and understanding.  Depending on what kind of atmosphere your looking for, you may be interested in PvE or an RP server. Nothing wrong with playing those. They're just as fun :D
---
and,
---
There are tons of idiots in the world. Try not to let them all ruin the things you enjoy!
---
I was thinking the same, and last night when I hit 23 I went to check right away. It payed off big time, he was just chilling under the tree. Three taming attempts and one death later Humar was mine!
---
what was the maximum twitch viewers count?
---
Well, to be fair that caster took a clip from Jokerd's stream seriously and thought that he was actually account sharing with his brother, its not like he made it up.
---
Yep I was doing this all day yesterday mining in Alterac. Do a big sweep and then ask for invite for layer hop.
---

I'm so glad I have no idea who Method or Joker are.

Warden wouldn't give a shit that you have you logitec/razer/corsair firmware running, and that's all you need. Hardly bannable software.

https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cxkwd1/psa_if_you_post_a_queue_complaint_or_screenshot/
---
&gt; at this point it is basically impossible to play without queuing with a remote desktop app from work or school.
---
That's simply not true. I've not done that and the longest queue I've had was 2+hrs on Monday. Yesterday I had no queue at all.
---
Is this the reason i play queue simulator
---
This! Fucking this.  I was screaming it from the roof tops. People just bandwagon too damn hard
---
Grammar boner
---
 it's your choice to be miserable or do more than run your god damn mouth on the internet you have a problem fucking do something about it that doesn't involve bitching on the internet.
---
You now get on the block list don't bother responding.
---
How are shadow priests? Thinking about making one since i like the whole idea of an evil priest but how is their dps? And are they fun? I have a lvl 18 mage right now and spamming frostbolt is getting kinda boring
---
Can you explain how he abused layering? not a troll question, I legitimately would like to know.
---
I highly doubt you have tried Zygor - that website is a website - you have to alt tab to see and click on next to update it....
---
Secondly it doesn't tell you when you have two or more objectives in the same step...
---
While Zygor does both and all that IN-Game it updates automatically as you finish your quests. And has additional functionalities.. like auto accept auto turn in quests.. gear advisor, sell grays, talent advisor etc, repair locations, vendor locations, class trainers.. etc.
---
I haven't found anything closer as good as Zygor yet - I would love to though!
---
I don't believe the guide itself is very optmized but they are not bad at all..
---
I'm guessing this is streamer stuff
---
Type Wow Classic Warlock guide. Jeez people are getting lazier and lazier.

that should work. but i've updated to use this.

And here I play minecraft in craptastic 1.14.4 that has our server restarting every half hour, grinding to a halt at 50 players at just 15 minutes. 1.13.2 was great, huge render distance and zero lag even with 50 players on. Hoping that the modders fix Mojang's fuckups before too long.
---
wtf spill the tea reddit is 4 drama
---
no it isn't /u/MAGA_centrist ( L O L )
---
Slightly offf topic but I want to level in tirisfal as an orc. I‚Äôm level 7 can I just go over there and start new quests or will some only be available if I do all of the undead starter quests?
---
It‚Äôs a bit iffy. Like normally I would likely pass on anything that isn‚Äôt my armour type unless the other people didn‚Äôt really need it. But I‚Äôm pretty passive when it comes to that stuff. A blue is a big deal in this game and so I can see why others would be upset, especially if they didn‚Äôt even have shoulder armour yet. But at the same time if it was a big upgrade for you then that‚Äôs fair enough. Just keep in mind that if you roll need on something that isn‚Äôt normally for your class then people may not like it, so it might be better not to do that or at least talk about it before hitting need. Just to avoid figure problems.
---
I can't imagine those final moments when his stream went to 150k, then 200k, then 300k. I think it topped out at 350k just before he dinged. Talk about an adrenaline rush, holy shit.
---
Live to win, til you die.... its stuck in my head now
---
Ah, Grudgebearers.
---
He is yes. He got ganged by a group of level 40s while he was in his late 50s. He just layer swapped to get away though
---
\~13h, honestly 13h of sleep in 3 days doesnt sound so bad... \~4h/night...
---
But a horde of people also wants to feel vindicated about Classic when we haven't even left launch yet.
---
Isn't it weird to say that "we don't seek instant gratification" when threads like these flood the subreddits and forum sites before even the first month is over?
---
So does Linux. Also it's not hard to update, just hard to control it.
---
That‚Äôs a good point... if you‚Äôre really going for faster /played that sounds like the optimal way unfortunately
---
Unrelated, but I like your UI setup. Just custom setup on ElvUi?
---
You underestimate how bored some people get.
---
The Ring must be destroyed! Cast it into the fires of Mount Doom!
---
Pretty sure affliction is not viable for end game raiding until debuff slots are increased. If course for leveling you should go affliction/demo hybrid. Look up optimal warlock leveling build.
---
I came here to say that as well, such a sweet note.
---
That font reminds me of city of heroes
---
I'm not trying to split hairs I'm just telling it like it is lol.
---
Spirit is better used on other classes than a rogue. I would kick and ban you too if you pulled that kind of shit. 
---
Crazy that youre acting like the victim here.
---
Yea they should have two catagories. Layered and unlayered. I hope he does another run when layering is removed to see if he can get world first unlayered 0 to 60
---
Super impressive. But holy FUCK was his twitch chat the most annoying cesspool I've had the displeasure of experiencing. I would likely have watched him way more if there had been some mods there working.
---
Intellect staff from the Deadmines quest is BiS for warriors at that level.
---
I mean, you have to do that with mythic raiding...
---
But you're always flagged for combat on a pvp server. Do you actually have to hit someone for it to count for the layering cooldown?
---
IMO that tool album will be remembered as the album that should not have come out. Its straight up terrible.
---
Similar to my wife and I.
---
I thought about playing when I heard Classic was coming. My wife and I played until just after WotLK then off and on since.
---
Tuesday I told her I started up again on my MacAir, which is difficult as hell to play on. Back in the day I played on an Alienware with a full rig.
---
She started playing with me. We have two kids, one who is a big gamer and has seen us playing WoW throughout the years. He has since said he wants a new laptop to play with us, we‚Äôre considering it.
---
A MacAir with a mouse is not the easiest to play on so last night I dropped a hint about getting a new tower to play on. 
---
Brought it up again this morning.
---
My new tower will arrive tomorrow.
---
Tool released an album and a wow world first 60 today!  What year is this!??
---
He wrote in world chat from time to time for invites, we had him in our party for a while lol
---
Being fucking rich ?
---
Lol, and perfect for a 6 year old.  
---
"here, hit this button"  
---
Macro kicks in.  
---
"Here's how you loot...just grab everything and let me know when the bag is full"
---
Win/win
---
what does that have to do with anything? You don't have to delete your chararcter to start a new one
---
Plus this dude is a speedrunner, if you think he's doing anything slow that's fucking hysterical
---
I've played for like 40 hours straight once (not wow, another mmo, Tibia) and this guy has been offline for like 12 hours or so in the last 4 days, so I don't think it's anything to imply cheating. 3-4h of sleep, not much, but definitely doable in a short period
---
Shame they used layering Exploiting. Oh well.
---
All the bright colors... Are you sure you're not already 60?
---
The standard UI already has that option
---
Nope but you can play private servers while in queue 4Head galaxybrain
---
I can‚Äôt argue with the fanboy, you‚Äôre right.  I‚Äôm making it all up.  Method is a joke, and backpedaling now.  Or the fact they kept him off the classic race addon the entire time.  LOL
---
retail is more challenging than classic
---
Source?
---
I saw that Sco congratulated him in a none ironic way what so ever on Twitter?
---
u retarded?
---
fucking eh.  i was looking for the tracking icon around the map and thought it just wasn't in this version of the game.
---
fml.
---
go outside
---
Haha nothing, just remembered your name but wasnt 100% sure :D
---
All good Expansions
---
Well you probably have a real job to start with.
---
Gnolls in redridge
---
Are you being sarcastic?
---
BM was too damage spec until you hit the agility threshold as survival
---
It isn‚Äôt dumb. A whole day is a massive difference if he was only using that tactic toward the end when people started to actively try to hamper the run.
---
If that was just the tactic than that matters a fuck lot. If not than to be conservative add 8 hours or so to it and he still beats the record.
---
He also account shared.
---
They'll get rid of layering eventually so whatever
---
O rly?
---
And malganis

[*Farewell to thee, Placeholder...*](https://youtu.be/-2xuO8JBepM)
---
I'm still on the realm I joined opening night!
---
I assume you are the two with the Samsung monitors, 32?
---
Honestly, how are they?
---
And they were all set up like that mere minutes after he leveled.  Really cool.
---
Yeah I started in August 2005, didn't even settle on a character to level up until like March or April 2006.  It wasn't too hard finding regular randoms to run Deadmines/etc. with, even without shared servers.  Guildies/high level players would also occasionally help with dungeons, making it way faster.
---
*miss*
---
*glancing*
---
First of all...not complaining, bitching or saying he exploited anything. 
---
But layering invalidates this. And it was always going to no matter who hit 60 first.
---
Becausee I saw this exact concept executed differently a short number of days ago. It was the exact quote and everything, just with a slightly different graphic.
---
Sure, why not. I played the game with only 3 GB ram laptop with no graphics card or anything.
---
layering.
---
Oh please... stop
---
I like socializing and grouping with other people, this is 50% of the mmo experience for me
---
So literally just the cookie cutter single target build for levelling
---
Remote desktop.
---
it does when u have like 3 spells and maybe 1 or 2 cooldowns.  the skill ceiling is far lower
---
An 2h axe dropped in VC for me the other day it was BoE and had 8+str 7+stam for a level 20. These little items make the game more interesting, its like bis early game.
---
No. It's a massive advantage.
---
It also says small tauren camp. Of which there is only 1 (Maybe 2) on the gold road.
---
I mean he chose to stream it on an account he chose to monetize then chose to ask for subs. More power to him he can do what he wants
---
I main a lock since 2005 and I agree
---
I just used this again logging into Incendius. The estimated time remaining definitely isn't working quite right and I will work on this. Also I had one point where the OCR only got the first of 3 digits. I plan to add some checking for huge drops in position and save the screenshots to figure out how to adjust the threshold and the regex. One thing that has been fairly stable though is 3300-3500 players logging out per hour from what I have seen so far.
---
??? It‚Äôs very easy to have a spare time 1g at this point.
---
Maybe if you're a scrub and only fighting 1 monster at a time
---
I don't see a dead Ragnaros yet, what do you mean??
---
Layers. Same thing happens in retail version.
---
you just gotta choose one friend and play on that server and hope others will follow
---
blast em in LookingForGroup not trade...
---
Ashenvale. Those dues PvP there constantly. Or stonetalon mountains.
---
I think 3d 7h. Yes, he did, he is a mage.
---
Thank you very much good sir. Everything you say to me is very valuable. I don't understand too much why if I opt for Arms spec, how I can tank?  Shouldn't be Protection tree the way to go for tanking instead of arms?
---
Can mine faster after you have a mount -big brain-
---
that's his point lol
---
I never thought I'd learn so much about knots while playing an MMO!
---
Doesn‚Äôt sound like he is crying. Seems like he is just pointing out a fact.
---
I mean no one here is blaming him for using it. It's just hard to compare previous records to this one if a mechanic other runs can't use is used. I would put this in a catagory that uses layering, simply because it was used. If i do a no cheats run and only use one bug at the end to shave off 5 minutes i still wouldn't have done a cheat free run.
---
Gooogle ‚Äúhow to level engineering‚Äù
---
hello here
---
Man just shutup with this it's so stupid congrats tp joker tho fr he a real one first 60
---
These are the older model 27‚Äù but they‚Äôre amazing dude - can‚Äôt ask more from a 60hz monitor
---
Yeah fucked up the alliance put literal demon fueled aliens that raped and murdered their way with the help of said demons through Azeroth twice, into prison camps.
---
Oh wait no there‚Äôs nothing wrong with rounding them up and putting them in camps lol. I honestly don‚Äôt understand how people think how the Alliance was even remotely in the wrong for that. The Alliance could‚Äôve began a campaign to kill literally every Orc in Azeroth after their initial invasion and it would‚Äôve been 100% justified. 
---
The Orcs invaded Azeroth twice and brought demons, fel magic, war, and literally nothing good with them. Even when on Azeroth and free from the Demon Blood, a sizable portion drank it AGAIN. Like come the fuck on. 
---
There was nothing wrong with putting the orcs into internment camps, and the only way people could see that as a bad thing is if they willingly choose to ignore everything the orcs did.
---
You‚Äôre a literal human. Put yourselves in their shoes. If Orcs invaded Earth tomorrow and then literally brought the demons of hell with them and then did it again years later, after they completely ruined the Fuck out of their own planet, then we as a species should openly support their immediate annihilation.
---
Pay it forward
---
How did he switch the layers?
---
What's a closest
---
Where my nudes addons at
---
This is the any% record. When we lose layering, people can run NoLayer%.
---
Learn to screenshot mate.
---
So that someone else can be the only level 60

what does that have to do with the mobs killing him?
---
I did but its just so overhwelming that I cant really be bothered
---
you can just go over there to Brill and get all the quests
---
Who cares...
---
WoW dwarves with a book of grudges?! Now I've seen it all :p
---
its good for everyone in same value till like lvl 25-30
---
There are plenty of places to farm essences in the open world
---
Screenshots and let people on your server know. These BFA babies are used to hiding behind the anonymity of retail. They've got a big surprise coming when the server knows what they do and they can't get groups anymore. Reputation's a bitch.
---
I played A Day to Remember on repeat leveling during WOTLK.
---
FFXIV 1.0 I think required you to use the bed in your room if you wanted rested exp bonus.
---
This isn‚Äôt a zero-sum game. Him getting things isn‚Äôt taking anything away from you. Him doing his thing isn‚Äôt affecting you. Are you even on his server? If you are, you don‚Äôt have to be, if you‚Äôre not, literally who cares?
---
Nice man ü§∞üèΩ
---
Is this why I couldn't see my friend until I invited him to a party?
---
Is this true that his grandma played when he was asleep? or is this just a meme?
---
if that's true that's fucking awesome. SO PROUD OF THIS COMMUNITY
---
This is sick. Thanks for doing this. I was about to build a new UI until I saw this today.
---
And you wonder why you get kicked and blacklisted.
---
It is a little known fact that the goretusk boars donate their livers to charity at age 14
---
yes there are plenty in the other threads. If you dont like it then dont waste your time. now go along, thats it, shoo

For true gamers it is bottom of the pyramid üòéüòéüòé
---
That‚Äôs just the most interesting to some people. Some people want to enjoy leveling and others want to race to 60 to see how fast they can do it. Same thing as speed runners, why would they rush through those games? Because they enjoy it
---
Thank you for the resources. I don‚Äôt see him listed on the top resource, and I can‚Äôt make the bottom one work at all on mobile/desktop. Still confused. But slightly more knowledgeable about the game. So thank you, I think. Lol.
---
Like it wasn't already
---
PSevers never get the perfect numbers. I remember playing on a vanilla like P-Server with one bug. In Razorfen the caster dealt 800 dmg and oneshot everyone.
---
10 months ago it was. 1 or 2 weeks ago, no.
---
Poe skill tree is daunting not because of the complexity, but because you can't reroll it in any other way than leveling fresh.
---
Am I just stupid? I don't get it
---
Yea, no problem. 
---
I don't know if there was some extra benefit or an incentive to doing 60 content raids even when BC was out or something. I don't have as much experience with this game as your or the others here. There's a lot of knowledge that I don't hold regarding this game.
---
Well thats why i had no clue i guess,  but what is the point of mention  that he wasnt included on the list of "competitors" when Method also followed people outside their studio also doing the race.
---
ha! Hope you enjoy running back to your body.
---
He slept 6-7 hours day 2 and 5-6 hours day 3
---
Pretty much, the devs claim it'll be like the like this for mainly the beginning of phase 1 in order to keep the servers steady
---
Oh my B, that was back in Cata.
---
Yeah it's actually ridiculous how strong they are
---
Why wouldn't it? He only used it in the very last end and did it to get away from gankers.
---
This is a perfect explanation as to what is wrong with our society and culture as a whole right now.....well said.
---
If they hype surrounding WoW Classic has taught me anything, it is exactly this.
---
They have categories for all different kinds of speedruns. TAS, glitchless, low%, any%, 100%, etc. Personally I like both glitch runs and glitchless runs, but for different reasons.
---
Glitchless runs are cool because it's all about optimizing the path that the game sets out before you. Anyone can participate in a glitchless run, you just have to keep practicing.
---
But glitch runs are also cool because you get sort of a sneak peek into how the game was coded and designed, and being able to pull off certain frame-perfect glitches requires insane mechanical skill. And IMO it's super interesting to see what people are capable of when it comes to *literally* changing and executing code in the middle of a run, like [how to beat Super Mario World for SNES in sub-5:00](https://youtu.be/Jf9i7MjViCE). How did anyone ever figure this stuff out?
---
But yeah, when it comes to speedruns obviously glitch runs don't invalidate glitchless runs, not are glitch runs themselves invalidated because they use glitches. They're separate categories with their own required skills and knowledge. How that pertains to this guy's world first 60 is up for debate, but just because he uses glitches doesn't invalidate the run. If anything it just gets put into another category.
---
Wow a ‚Äúthe boys‚Äù meme !
---
Until then...
---
Need more rage
---
Can you imagine being this big of an asshole for no reason at all? Not everyone is a WoW veteran, many of us are learning to play for the first time. Get over yourself.
---
They are planning to, but they hyped world first 60 just as much, if not more at this stage.
---
You're assuming I have children... hahahahahahahahahaha. All my cum goes in a sock buddy, not a woman.
---
Here‚Äôs nothing to buy.

Mind pm-ing me the discord as well?

I like the animations and being the Biggest Boy‚Ñ¢Ô∏è on the team
---
That didn't work for me
---
The problem with modern videogames is that they always make you the hero or superman. Its the same thing with WoW, when you are above the world you are in it feels empty. When you are just one Warrior in a horde and it takes 40 of you to kill a dragon and save the world for all these heroes you knew from WC3 it's much more meaningful. You kill a dragon at lvl 4 or whatever in Skyrim and the rest of the storyline just seems like an inevitable grind not something I could actually fail at which cheapens the victory. Same with Retail I cleared heroic Azshara first week and really had no incentive to even play anymore until next xpac.
---
Highest character is still level 6 because my first dude is trapped on Grobulus. Feels bad but Deviate Delight's been a nice community so far, minus some of the belligerent overflow from full PvP servers.
---
Does your mouse have a lot of buttons? How do you manage strafing for example? Other than that this sounds like a great fix for my current problem and will give it a go!
---
Ahh, so it worked. Escape button, logout then closed the game and when I started the game 2 minutes later I had no queue. That's pretty cool.
---
It's okay, mostly I appreciate it for the junkboxes giving me potions.
---
I like questie :(
---
Also /agree on the other front. Most addons are for your own aesthetic tastes... the only one you definitely will want is omen because it helps you AND helps the tank by you having it.
---
that's really weird. i preferred to stay at max range (assume the CC'd mobs are further away).
---
What threat meter are you trying to use? They are supposed to parse the entire group not just the people who have it installed.
---
Yes it's integral to the whole experience. Blizzard did also add layering for a reason and he just used it ONLY cause method fans were griefind and bming him. Any other player would have done this and world firsts are pretty much "any way possible" so nobody really cares how he did it since now he is the first and will always be the first.
---
It's a heavily story based MMO, and it has a long GCD that makes the early levels boring.
---
But said story is incredible, the music is amazing, the game looks beautiful, and all the raids and stuff are super epic. ARR, or vanilla, is pretty good, but f you can get to HW, the first expansion, it's pretty much amazing from then on.
---
That was him memeing and Method taling the bait hook, line, and sinker
---
He doesn't have a brother
---
Yea isn't it like a 100x hike for Game of Thrones porn when there's a nude scene in the episode? I remember hearing something of the sort
---
Clearly there is at least 1 person who cares whether I think something deserves an asterisk and I'll give you a few hints... its not me and no one else responded to this threaded of the discussion. Wink emoji.
---
Look at all the replies to the tweet, and you will see the issue.
---
Shit is already stirred, Joker is stirring himself too.
---
They slapped (West) on it specifically because they want Kenny to take (East). As if it wasn't a world wide race but separated by region.
---
The head manager of Method hosted the entire event, and he was the one who said they would exceed expectations. They didn't even come close to finishing first. Expectations = exceeded.
---
Nobody called him out on it when he accused him of accounting sharing. It was a paid representative of Method and they have no addressed it. It will continue to fester until they address it, Joker is world first in classic, and will hold that title forever now.
---
But it‚Äôs not funny
---
This except the warrior rolls need then actually sells it later
---
Plenty of new players have answered. Just hit up that search bar.
---
The whole "server reputation" thing is massively overblown and idealised on this sub. Especially this early, your message will drown out in the sea of trades and even when people see it, most of them will not care. Best bet for OP is to /ignore, move on with his life and hope for better groups in the future.
---
Method is congratulating him on social media. This subreddit is actually cancer lol
---
Just play retail
---
try making a folder at c:\blizzard\wow classic
---
And install classic there instead.

I went too pee in an up to date content world zone. When I came back, I had 3 mobs attscking me. I was down to 50% health. I just spammed some instants and they were all dead in 5 seconds, my health was full and so was my mana. My char has utter crap equip, easily obtained by doing what I just did for an evening or two (slaughtering dozens of meaningless enemies for daily quests). After I saved my ass and somehow magically went to full health by doing so (bfa mechanics, im a mage btw) I went on to do the Q I wanted to do. Kill some 2x mobs. Run in, pull 6-10 mobs, apply aoe l, see everything die. It's pretty much like prototype. It's fun for about 2 hours tonjust mercilessly dominate your enemies but eventually it just feels like cheating.
---
The Mechagon dungeon ewas pretty fun with shit gear (actual fun challenge) but since I already dominate my daily quests I don't really know why I should strife for better gear. And of course the dungeon becomes trivial as well once your gear surpasses catchup level. 
---
M+ and and upper raid difficulties are of course fun for those who wanna do them but it just lacks incentive to me (get better gear to get higher difficulty tonget better gear tonget higer difficulty...). The progression in BfA is fucked and that's just oncle of the problems. Flying is a nocmip cheat (literally) and the easy world content makes socializing into a decrease in efficiency and somehow efficiency dominates BfA, because you don't actually wanna do the cintent but be done with it asap to reap the rewards.
---
Many more things, but when it comes to leveling, Blizz dropped the ball long ago. Maxlevel is down to a 10 hour grind (starting from prev expansion) and most players just rush through it to get to end game because leveling blows (too easy, too themepark'y)
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
When an activity is  trivial and your only motivation for doing it is the reward while you get no joy from doing the actual activity, it gets annoying.
---
Granted, the joy of classic is kinda mad. It's about struggle and travel and patience. But all the struggle makes you wanna team up, be social and actually be happy when you succeed. 
---
And I said it a lot but while classic may not be Mythic Eternal Palace level of difficulty, it strikes a perfect balance between keeping you engaged (you'll die if you don't pay attention, unlike my bfa story from the beginning of this novel) while not being stressful (mechanically demanding or requiring quick reflexes). It's super relaxing to play but doesn't get boring - to me anyways.

First guilds will run MC by Wednesday.

EA‚Äôs WoW account confirmed.

Enchanting and Tailoring is great for any cloth class.

Herbalism and Alchemy is also a great choice to make yourself and friends Mana Potions and Health Potions.
---
Any idea what that tool is? Bad player lvl 26 theres 3000 people hitting my mobs
---
i have no sympathy.  everyone knew the realms would be a mess with population and those players still chose to wait 6+ hours instead of just rolling on a realm with no queue.  i saw the queue time and nope'd all the way to one of the new realms and started playing right away.
---
now the population on my realm is high and we still don't have queue times.  if you're on a realm and seeing 6+ hour queue times, i have no sympathy for you because you are choosing to stay there.
---
People also think using mods ruins the vanilla experience, when in fact mods were a thing even in beta WoW.

Why do you think I‚Äôm so confident I could pull off three solo?

I think it was cataclysm or possibly mists

This is me right fuckin now. 2 Hours and counting.
---
fuck that. I got to level 20 in the first two days, and there is no way i'm rerolling on another server just for queues that are only gonna last another week, max
---
See I think your wrong about the need for more levels. That‚Äôs just the way it has been done so it seems necessary. I‚Äôm also not suggesting a side progression system, it is progression but rather than higher item levels you get higher skill levels and gear bonuses that allow you to do these fights without crazy stat inflation so that a t3 60 and t10 60 can fight and it be fair( if the t3 has farmed up the new skill levels obviously) but thank you for the constructive criticism and not just the standard kys reply lol :)
---
That‚Äôs sad, I just did succubus quest last night and if you screenshotted the quest more it too, would be deemed too sexist.

I rerolled when I found out Thalnos was like 30% Spanish. Ain't nobody got tiempo for that shit
---
If you had just said that you'd be fine.  If you used profanity or abbreviated profanity it's enough to get your ban.  You used some here in your OP that would be more than enough for a reportable ban there.
---
Congrats! Was fun to watch him grind the last bit - insane viewer count! There were a lot of people (multiple layers) in Goldshire celebrating. Was awesome!
---
There is a lack of updated guides and most of the best was on a site that was shutdown recently.
---
Quite a long post for one containing zero information.
---
Ah, yes, it's true that I haven't changed the install location yet. I'll see if that helps
---
Doesn't change the /played so who gives a fuck. They haven't admitted but sometimes he talks and then it's quiet for a long time so I think they do
---
The ‚Äúneed‚Äù has always been a gear need.  A gold need or disenchant has never been proper etiquette.

haha people still believe this

He has fat fuckin‚Äô Lenny as a subscribe alert?

Lol. You can just leave your main in an inn and create level 1 character, kill it and just afk macro as ghost. Good luck finding my ghost.
---
Who cares
---
I was being sarcastic
---
Do we have an addon list for his setup?
---
Finally a bit of sense on this thread
---
it's a multiplayer game. grinding mats is one thing but bulk of endgame is focused on multiplayer
---
I see. Man, retail is f'd up.
---
Well there is not much you can do. The mages however should chill until you have aggro
---
Every time I see an elite like this I mark it with X so my dumb ass doesn‚Äôt go charging them all Willy Nilly. Saved my ass in the cemetery multiple times in Duskwood (I forget the mobs name)
---
It came with windows 10. Lol. I dont have a problem running anything except games obviously. Its definitely not a gaming pc lol.
---
I mean he can do what he wants with it what do you do with the milk carton when you finish the milk? make a hat?
---
Did he really delete his mage?
---
The twitch chat was unbearable for me. I couldn't watch it unless fullscreened
---
He does if you aren't spamming searing pain lol
---
Are you not paying attention? The servers they told people to leave to ALSO HAVE HUGE QUEUES.
---
That's what speedrunners do.
---
I went 15-20 basically (no south park memes intended) killing westfall and redridge boars
---
there‚Äôs gonna be a large tolerance for getting to 60 in serious raid guilds since no matter who you are it‚Äôs going to vary heavily, serious doesn‚Äôt mean nolife, I really don‚Äôt think you have to worry, just go at your own pace
---
He doesn't play 60. Speedleveling is his game. He remakes the same character over and over again.
---
why would someone even taint record by using an exploit like that.
---
to me he's 60*
---
Boy am I glad I got talked into playing on the Horde side. Alliance sounds completely horrible!
---
equating a character in a game to a milk carton is null
---
TL;DR Guy used a power leveling service and got banned.
---
It would still be easy to remove the chest at this point, unless nobody cared enough to do so..
---
I mean it‚Äôs not really world first because it was done 15 years ago.
---
Thank you, I've been wondering if I've been doing something wrong, or if Voidwalker threat management is just shit in Classic. I figured it was the latter, but I had this suspicion that maybe I was doing something wrong. Bye VW, see you when your threat gen gets better
---
Fripp
---
I heard JokerD made a joke about letting his brother play so he could sleep, 1 method caster took it serioulsy and mentioned it on Method stream.
---
I was going to do this today, got my macro ready, stood right next to the vendor, then I realized I didn‚Äôt want to waste a slot in my bags, so I walked away.
---
And it saved him like what, 1-2 hours max in the end? This record will be beaten.
---
1-13 takes roughly 1h and 20 mins if done right. I guess even people with jobs could read into what they're supposed to do.
---
&gt;I'll take a grind that feels like you're accomplishing something over endless, mindless quests most days.
---
The thing is, I didn't feel like I accomplished anything afterwards. I just got a little exp and thats it. I made way more exp by the sheer amount of shit I killed.
---
First is 1g, but yes they do max out at 50g. Reduction only happens at a rate of 5g/month.
---
Technically he has more of a life if u think about it
---
I mean hard ones.
---
 I see the same Omen Laptop i own, i upvote!
---
Saw these at Costco for 169.  Was blown away by the price.
---
I'm gonna go do it this weekend. The return for ANY reason is a big seller.
---
From what I saw he did.
---
exactly. people really think layering for 2 levels saved him 37 hours of play time which is absurd. he was faster by a huge amount and layering wouldn‚Äôt have changed that. he beat next closest by 5 levels.
---
Sure, they don't work the same way though.
---
Don‚Äôt believe you can halt EXP gain in this.
---
You're meant to take a photo with your phone not screen grab..

What pray tell us a Tryhard Pissbucketer? And why are they not a Pissbucketeer

if Guild Wars Classic is released I will literally cream my shorts
---
Yeah they started doing that in WoD and continued it since. It certainly wasn't a thing that would happen in Elwynn Forest.
---
You can build affliction and be raid viable.  
---
Tell those Geeks that you have DOT priority cuss your a total badass. Worked for me 15 years ago
---
As in actually being able to play the game and enjoy it.
---
They‚Äôre aiming on it.
---
But there‚Äôs a ton of private server guilds that have had classic on farm mode for years.
---
Very helpful, I appreciate the tips! Yeah, I've played GW1 and older mmos but never got around WoW because of $$ monthly sub, but im a grown ass man now, I pay my own SUB!  
---
BTW, whats the difference between Normal and RP? like whats roleplaying all about?
---
Good one.
---
If your work even monitors it.  My job doesn't.
---
It‚Äôs just some cheap keyboard I got from work when they were throwing them out to replace them. HP brand with silent flat keys. So that may be why?
---
Hahaha exactly the responses I expected. I‚Äôm just picking it up to play while I‚Äôm out of town and then putting it right back up on kijiji when I‚Äôm back. My only worry was that a lot of people are saying their computers won‚Äôt run it because it uses a newer engine (don‚Äôt know if this is right) than the actual original. Thanks for the responses!
---
I wouldn‚Äôt call it senseless, its a game. For him the real game is the speed leveling.
---
Rogues and ferals get 2 AP per agility, and 1 AP from strength.
---
Twitch chat is always unbearable for large viewer count streams.
---
the leveling weapon guide is the most valuable imo
---
Yeah, no.
---
The only reason that was a bad thing was because it showed an extreme lack of foresight in the Alliance. Instead, what they should have done is begun a massive campaign to exterminate every Orc on Azeroth to rid the planet of the Orcish cancer.
---
There is absolutely and literally nothing wrong with the Alliance putting Orcs into camps, and only a buffoon who willingly puts his head in the sand would think so. The Orcs invaded Azeroth from a different planet, fueled by demon blood, bringing with them fel magic, demons, ogres, and other horrible things not native to Azeroth. They started both the First and Second war fueled by their insatiable bloodlust to rape, pillage, and conquer their way through Azeroth.
---
The Orcs, after ruining their own planet, and doing horrifying and unspeakable acts to the Draenei, decided that their desire for carnage wasn't enough, and thought to do the same thing to Azeroth, and so they tried, and ultimately failed. Despite having the backing of so much powerful and unholy strength behind them, they ultimately couldn't defeat their Azerothian counterparts. 
---
So, after ruining their own world, violating the Draenei, invading Azeroth, doing unspeakable atrocities to the native inhabitants of Azeroth, and then trying again and failing again, there is something wrong with putting demon-fueled, world-ruining, war-driven savages into camps to deal with the aftermath of the horror and destruction they caused? 
---
Nope. In fact, they should have been annihilated to prevent any future headache and to guarantee the safety of Azeroth. Even to this day, in BFA, the Horde, and Orcs, continue to rack up war crime, after war crime, after war crime. The Alliance on the other hand, have barely done any at all, and the ones they done, are miniscule in comparison.
---
I absolutely do not understand how anybody can sit and defend the Orcs and their disgusting legacy. The Alliances was fighting a war for their very survival. The Orcs have infinitely more in common with the Nazis than the Alliance do. 
---
Death the Horde, and Glory for the Alliance.
---
Same position as you my friend. Take it from the guy who ignored his ex wife for expansion releases. 
---
My current partner has been accepting of BFA and the last few days. Now it's time for me to raid her instance.

Halt xp was introduced I think I warth it was was killed twinking

Semi related: when I played Vanilla (around 10 y/o,) I remember I rolled need on a robe as a warrior in Razorfen because the name was cool and I wanted to wear it for RP. Teammates understandably yelled at me.

WoW has a cash shop though...

It was always this way, and this is the reason why WoW was in a steady decline, blizzard (as well as many other studios) started chasing after a 'casual market' of people who don't play games and won't play games even if you make them piss easy and gratify their every whim. Really hope this is a wake up call for industry, the audience they wanted (i.e. the money source) don't fucking exist
---
Idk, comrade, your language is kind of aggressive. Try "The predominant language in General Chat is Spanish" instead of using "Spanish ppl" or loaded terms like "taken over." Dial down the hate. /s
---
Dampen reduces healing. Not a good idea IMO.
---
14 year horde player here gone alliance : Thank you
---
Except the Voidwalker is garbage. He holds no threat and does no DPS. Its the slowest way to level up as a lock.
---
Report him for botting.
---
Lol great reference. Watched that episode again and again before classic came out.
---
Skraal Blart, Thrall Cop

Neither does keeping a character he will never play?
---
1.  Don't stand in the fire.
---
2. Don't stand in the fire.
---
3. Pay attention.
---
4. Don't Melee on the same side as the tank.

5. Don't stand in the fire.
---
More of him being jobless and receiving social serves. And that he wants a beer.
---
3 years old is fine, yeah I‚Äôm almost certain you can run it, I can‚Äôt be definite but VRAM is allocated not dedicated with integrated graphics and the rest of your specs are easily good enough since the reqs are so so low so yeah you should be good
---
Just temporary haha
---
Supposed to grind instead of playing the game right? Or is it rush to 60 and bore yourself silly so you can be a higher level
---
I thought everyone was aware that method were dicks?
---
That's not true. Most things are bind on equip.
---
You can edit your controller input when your in big picture mode or by hitting the steam icon button
---
Just curious.  Why not just look around real quick and familuarize yourself with the town. Look for quests, etc?
---
Incorrect, the only account sharing that is permitted is for one adult to share an account with *one* minor they are responsible for.
---
A parent can't let two kids play on the same account technically. The parent would have to have two separate accounts to be in compliance with ToS.
---
Paladin tanking is fine... Seriously the misinformation is awful on pally
---
Didn't he "avoid PvP" by being 20 levels higher than everyone else?
---
Someone else said about lowering the resolution and what not.
---
I guess you could argue that. Layering is also way slower after engaging in PvP, so there is that. 
---
I don't have a perfect answer since layering is a necessary evil due to the massive popularity of classic.
---
I can say the gankers left after killing him once, so yeah. Idk it's a hard topic.
---
I'm professionally unemployed and I want a beer. You pay
---
It takes a hell of a lot longer than that on a crowded server, especially if you aren't following a guide. I doubt your average player is getting to 13 in under 2 hours even on a good day.
---
You can switch layers on command??
---
Are you using a controller?
---
lmao, ok dude.
---
Does stam give you any added benefits in vanilla other than the extra health?
---
People who say the MCP grind is bad are people who don't know how to manage their time. If you go to gnomeregan do 5 runs and sit at the door to wait for the lockout to reset it will take forever, but that's the worst way to do it. The best way to do it is to do 5 runs before you log off, leave your character at gnomeregan, then when you log in you do 5 more runs. That will be 10 runs per day and take 30-45 minutes a day, which will net about 25 if your farm 7 days a week. However, you don't need 25 per week, so you can just farm 4-5 days a week. That's a sum total of about 2.5-3 hours a week to farm MCPs, which is incredibly lax for what will be your best consumables.
---
Shaven
---
The main thing I'm hoping is that Blizzard learns from this and patterns retail after Classic. There were a lot of changes they made over the years that seemed good at the time but really took the soul of the game away, bit by bit.
---
If you're afk long enough to get disconnected because you went to the bathroom you may want to get your diet checked. 
---
Or maybe use your own toilet instead of one 10 minutes down the road.
---
Sorry not possible.

You are disgrace haha

join rp server, find house with no npc's, equip gun, yell at everyone to get the fuck off your lawn.

thats as close as youre gonna get.

I'm hoping they take lessons from Classic and apply it to retail. More challenging content. Stuff that fosters community.  More relaxed progression.
---
Joana was hosting this Amphy hunter who was insanely efficient, constantly chain pulling and never standing still. Didnt even loot unless he was moving in that direction anyways. I was certain he would be #1. Then I stumbled upon Journey stream, 3 levels above Amphy.. insane speed that guy had.
---
I never said you would. But when people aren't playing, they often participate in other ways. This whole website is centered around this lol
---
I'm in the same boat as you, my friend (level 14) says he is now "too invested to leave Whitemane" I think I might just abandon him.
---
Yeah, not to bash on classic but every game is populate the first few weeks of launch. 
---
My friends list says they are all playing classic. It also at one point had them all on hearthstone, then overwatch, then destiny 2 and even blops4. 
---
I don't doubt a lot of people will stay playing classic but there is also going to be a lot of tourists from retail.
---
Lol no way. I can't tell if you're trolling or just an edgy freshman in college. 
---
Just google SOMETHING about the class. I feel like you just read what the talent points do and think you can theorycraft just based on concepts about hybrids in classic. 
---
Actually, don't do that. Just try to join the most competitive BG group you can as reckoning and see what happens.
---
But this is how it is: In pvp, you can play reckoning. You can play deep holy. You can play ret. All are viable. But in no way is reckoning the only viable spec. In the most competitive atmosphere, a deeper holy build is standard, not reckoning. So don't tell new players reckoning is only good in pvp, and almost all experienced paladins will agree. That's all I'm saying.
---
greed is the disenchant/gold
---
need is if you are going to fucking equip or learn it right then or when you ding.
---
anyone who's rolling need on something to make gold is toxic.
---
they're not going to learn anything, we've been trying to teach them for over a decade, they do not learn
---
Still getting daily queues on Blaumeux, but they haven't been too bad since the pop update. Maybe an hour at absolute worst peak. 3/4 of the day has no queue and once it starts getting near peak it's maybe 2k = 20-30 min. At least that's roughly what I've seen
---
Do you know the difference between what is possible and what is impossible?
---
What kind of diper did this guy wear?
---
How is "he made a joke about account sharing" different from "he literally claimed to be account sharing, albeit jokingly?" What I said is exactly what happened. He made the claim (joking or not, he said it), somebody clipped and linked it to Method, THEN the caster made the accusation. You dont broadcast that you're doing something illicit and then get mad when someone says you did the exact thing you claimed. It was a very poorly thought out joke
---
He said he was going to host but didnt. Truely gnomed.
---
Hang in there the weekend binge is upon us :)
---
I've seen 3 hunters win it. I'm passed deadmines now but it was a little absurd considering we had a priest who needed in each run.
---
He said he wants to heal while doing some supplemental damage. Shadow priest is not what he is looking for because he is looking for a heal spec which shadow priest is not.
---
No people don't group for quests because you don't need to. Ever.
---
you forgot the part where he hopped layers to get more mobs faster
---
I lost a blue staff roll in bfd to a warrior after i asked why he rolled need his reply was cause I'm broke. I was salty for the rest of the day cause that staff would have been a huge upgrade
---
It's always been ridiculous since you can easily tell by the person's level, they're not LFG for diremaul at 20.
---
What's the most damage you think?
---
Lucky bastard.  My stupid girlfriend just reads books.
---
The Linken quest chain in ungoro especially after the breath of the wild game as a refreshed appreciation for that game
---
I suggest you /join lookingforgroup
---
Wait, what? Is this true ?
---
*clears throat*

*taps microphone*
---
B... 
---
BFA BAD!
---
The voidwalker needs to hit the mob first to have a chance to keep aggro. If you pull with dots and have him intercept he probably won‚Äôt get their attention.
---
But that's part of the fun
---
It's not misinformation. Rather it's "it will be harder than it should to make it work"
---
How is it blizzard's fault? This sub literally told everyone to go onto 2 servers. You banished streamers and their fans to one and claimed the other as a no streamer server. If anything it's those people's fault. Blizzard doesn't want to make too many realms and have them die out and make them have to merge realms
---
I just help you with number 1. Loot windows you change in Blizzard options on first tab , somethings like loot on cursor , not in ElvUi :-)
---
Jesus must be nice to have no life no girlfriend no job and no career ambitions.
---
he did it by exploiting layering? so lame.
---
he's 60*. show me the first 60 without layering
---
The biggest rip!
---
Rushing to max on classic is really missing the point, but gz to jokerd \^.\^
---
What server and can I join
---
Most polearms have otherwise 0 IQ stats but would be perfect for druids (at least while levelling or something) who can't equip them.
---
It's one of those "what were they thinking?!" design decisions. This one is hard to defend, since ferals certainly wouldn't have been made any more relevant anyway.
---
Play with everything default and see what annoys you. Chances are the first thing you're going to need is Bartender4 so you can do better keybinds (hint, keybind, keybind, keybind. If you're clicking skills in combat you're doing it wrong)  
---
When you start getting an awareness for what makes a good player, (maybe after reading some class guides and such) you're probably going to want WeakAuras2 to give you information you need during combat. Stuff like procs and alerts.
---
If you're tanking, Threatplates is nice to show aggro on mobs.  
---
Vendorprice is really, really useful because it tells you how much stuff sells to a vendor for, so you can make a decision on what stuff to turf if you're out questing and need bag space. (rather throw out that 6 copper claw and pick up the grey 2-handed hammer that sells for over 1 silver)  
---
Don't go out and install a million addons and overwhelm yourself from the start. Addons are there to solve limitations you find in the UI.  
---
Stay away from stuff like Questie and TomTom if you actually want the Classic experience. Back in the day we read quest text, looked up comments on the web and asked other people around us questions. That's what made the game great and how we made a lot of friends.  
---
If you want a big glowing marker telling you where to go next, you should probably play BFA.
---
What UI is this and where do you get it from
---
Well I mean since they don‚Äôt have full time jobs and a roster of 40 it‚Äôs kind of a no brained they are gonna be near the top.

I just don‚Äôt care for them they always seem petty been that way since the inception. Drama and pettiness

---
Since you want to be pedantic and ruin a joke: Classic wow did exist 15yrs ago. WoW: Classic did not
---
Yes, I know. From your description I thought you meant that you‚Äôd be logging in to create your character at one time and then logging in with the new pc later.
---
If you‚Äôre talking about logging in to get into the queue for a few minutes while you set up your new computer, then in theory that might work.
---
But you‚Äôd need to login and create the character within 30 minutes of your spot in the queue coming up, and then keep yourself from going AFK for too long while you finish setup.
---
I somehow read your initial question as it being two separate days.
---
Well fed buffs is a huge part but early game foods won‚Äôt give you that. Also at lower levels you don‚Äôt have much hp so you refer quickly. I feel like it‚Äôs not super useful starting out but even in the 20s I‚Äôve used it a couple times when I get really low and want to get into the fight quickly
---
That's just a theory afaik. People are looking for a reason to be mad. First place in the method race is what, 56? Its not hard to fathom that someone else beat him to it.
---
...they literally just congratulated the dude on twitter, the dude apologized for his comments and he got baited by twitch chat into saying that on stream. It was literally ONE comment made by one of the casters on Method's stream. Is this a troll thread? I actually can't tell.
---
Hint: it's a anagram
---
It is such a non issue though, if you want his guide for free it's pretty easy to find being as it had been for 10 years prior.  Let the man try and make some coin off his hard work otherwise pirate it if isn't in line with your morals.  So many fucking whingers regarding this.  I guess the community has to stir up some kind of drama.
---
Serious moves, I wanna run Deadmines at least 3 times tonight.
---
As far as I can see it works in between. But I need to double check that.
---
Playing whack a mole healing for epic loot sounds awesome to me.
---
Crazy how he did it solo.
---
while method was account sharing, team farming and hired their own butler to go around hitting the spacebar while they go on break.
---
Seems like if he downloads the client on his computer and logs in using your credentials that it would work.
---
*Method* itself didn't do anything. JokerD made a comment about how he is letting his brother play. Then a caster repeated that comment, but JokerD later claimed/said it was a joke and the caster apologized.
---
After the world first, Method's chat was bombarded with memes, so they cut to private.
---
This post is making it sound like Method is actively engaging in a hate campaign against JokerD, which simply isn't true. It's also interesting to note that some Method players were caught in the queue at various points, so there are different circumstances at play here.
---
All things considered, congratulations to JokerD. But making posts like this up there that make it seem like Method is going out of their way to harass/downtalk/attack JokerD are just insulting to this community. One caster took one comment JokerD made himself, and he even later mentioned it was a joke and clarified it.
---
I have tanked dead mines three times now having put all points in ret. Worked quite fine so far.
---
Later on you will probably want some points in the other trees but I wanted to go for pursuit of justice asap.
---
Indeed! I never had one growing up, but I guess now that I have all the others in the family laid out next to each other, it's only fair
---
It's hard to blame them for going down that path with the game. Once you've killed the Lich King, have the best gear in the game, and can one shot kill Ragnaros, they have to keep upping the ante. It's like comic book sequels. They have to keep creeping character power higher until some hard reset event, which has sort of been teased for the next retail expansion.
---
He doesnt even have a brother lol
---
&gt;cheat a lot so we can finish,
---
nothing wrong with preferring glitchless speedruns, but using glitches is not cheating, and to imply it's not "playing fast and effectively" is just ignorant.
---
Just bounce from groups when you see that happen. Literally had a group from SFK last night that 4 were in same guild I was the outlier. The tank rolled need on two back to back green pants that were shittier than the ones he had on (it pays to inspect people). So I bounced and they kept saying I could have one of the mail pants if I wanted it so bad told them thats not the point they didn't know roll etiquette not worth wasting time on a group like that.
---
Haha yeah, I know about the names, and honestly that is the hardest part for me, choosing a cool name that is also easy to remember
---
''Method‚Äù is a professional raiding guild in the popular MMORPG ‚ÄúWorld of Warcraft‚Äù. Under the guidance of guild master Scott ‚ÄúSco‚Äù McMillan the guild has come to be revered by many as the most accomplished guild of all time with several noteworthy achievements under its belt such as multiple world firsts, high ranking PvP teams and losing the Classic 60 race to a bald Maltese gnome.

If you have it you can jigsaw and get a bracket for abother side exhaust fan
---
Pretty much. And you put him next to a bank for more space. Even make it an enchanter to d/e your leftover greens.
---
Yeah, I also hate it when I'm in a forum of people who share a similar mindset and I make every effort to water their opinions down to a single "HURK DURK" quote. That's why I posted this in WoWClassic and not WoW! We should definitely replace the mods of all the subs that I don't like.
---
Classic WoW closing isn't *that* strong.
---
2-3 people 10 levels lower than you can still kill you.
---
He on your account? If so and its asking him to buy anything he probably clicked on retail and not classic
---
Yeah bud, fullscreen works too. But honestly I enjoy having the chat on in most streams I watch, for actual discussion. When it turns to LULW GNOME OMEGALUL DERP DERP. It makes me want to gouge my eyes out. So I'd rather not watch at all. Specially when the streamer doesn't even talk that much.
---
They didn't OP is actually dumb. One caster made a comment that he got baited into saying by twitch chat or whatever and now apparently people hate the entire guild and it's players, lol. Not to mention the fact Method was never going for world first 60, people are just making things up.
---
No. You only have 1 chance to make a character. Blizzard will cancel your sub if you try to make another one.
---
What lol. This is supposedly racist?
---
Samwise Didier, Art Guy for blizz and the icon they used for things without icons up until... Wrath I think?
---
For dungeons and raid trash, it's fine.  The taunt issue is actually one of the lesser issues.  Bigger issues are the inability to push crushing blows and crits off the table (druids also have this issue, but have a lot more effective health to mitigate it) and mana.  Paladins can just go oom, at which point they stop being able to tank.
---
Not necessarily lower than vendors prices, but not worth the trouble of going to the AH for.

I struggled with finding a client download outside of the battlenet launcher, is there one out there?

Jokerd is practically One Punch Man and &lt;method&gt; is like all the weak other heroes.

W &lt;- pointy W 
---
I want a W with a rounded bottom so I can make a penis in chat with q p
---
&gt;Is this based on 1 guy just mention that he may have account shared?
---
Yes, it is. This thread is what we call an overreaction.
---
He plays both. Most of the people on Method's stream aren't retail players either.
---
My 5 week old boy would also politely disagree with above statement.
---
Normal is as described; RP follows the same mechanics pvp-wise (not flagged automatically) as normal, just with the idea the server is supposed to be for the roleplay crowd. No difference other than that.  
---
It's permanent...TM. In original, Blizzard opened up server transfers after a time, either as a paid service, or sometimes free from an overcrowded realm to one or more select low-pop servers. At this time, it's permanent; Blizz may or may not open transfers in the future.
---
I really feel like all the dailies were great in BC. The only problem that I really have with the expansion, in retrospect is the massive amount of badge gear added in the Isle of Quel'Danas area. It was fine but Badge gear kind of ended up feeling like consolation prizes. This coming from someone who considers TBC to be my favorite expansion, especially in terms of gameplay, and played it and bought badge gear out the yingyang.
---
Did op beat joanas 1-60 time?
---
if thats true then it changes everything.
---
This I can agree with, his first scene I was like "Wow.. he's been able to do the entire time? I want ***MORE***
---
I didn't really follow all the drama over there but it seems that some HATERS try to create a drama. Well, like always.
---
Really what was his name?
---
I was in a large circle trading war stories with a Tauren guild in Bloodhoof Village. It was my turn. I told them in my near death moments on the battle I gathered the courage to fart. I was told to leave immediatly and never return. I was ignored forever.
---
People still don't get it.
---
Having this kind of stuff in your bag makes it worth more. Sacrificing a bag space means it means more to you.
---
LMFAO, just delete this thread dude. You're kind of just making yourself look dumb.
---
Make your own guide you fuck.  There's nothing scummy about trying to make some income off your hard work, if you don't like it don't buy it or ya know, use the Wayback Machine to get a copy for free.  I bet you collect government hand outs.  PoS.
---
Method never seriously claimed they were going for World First.
---
They mainly organized a big event to spectate all the different guilds and people going for firsts.
---
You‚Äôre right. I‚Äôll try to find more important things to care about.
---
Neatplates does this iirc
---
Level leatherworking of course. Honestly, if you wear leather, it's a great profession to level with and then just drop it for engineering or something at 60.
---
Vangina?
---
Remind Me! 6 months
---
Yeah, they were a great alternative and some of them even had a minor amount of story content (Ogrila, less so but still somewhat) which was cool.
---
This is a good point, it is just so frustrating now. I entered Q, went and ran some errands and came back and I missed it. Re-entered and I'm sitting another 3-4 hours. 
---
It sucks but I'm not in a rush this time as far as powerleveling (I was in a very, very good raiding guild the first time) and I don't even plan on raiding HC this time around. I can't play 5-7 nights a week anymore. 
---
But that sorta is what's frustrating that my much smaller playtime window is being dominated by the queue.
---
Probably just stick it out. If anything let's hope we get a few days credit at the very minimum on the access fee.
---
&gt; a bunch of people trying to gank you won't be either
---
Uhhh.. The honor system is in phase 2. Ganking will be crazier than ever.
---
Staff of Westfall is perfectly fine.
---
Yeah in retail? Does retail even have other players than method left? I wonder..
---
Damn what a crazy bad ass!!! Doesn‚Äôt give a fudge!!
---
He's not going to keep playing the character.  Leveling to 60 is what he does.
---
Hmm, this is an option too. I'll look into it thanks!
---
Most people consider blow a hard drug?
---
Thanks for the quick reply and yes this works for me!
---
Yeah i agree with you on this one, my fault that i said what i said on internet where ppl cant understand the way that im saying what im saying...if that makes sense...english is not my first language so...
---
This is the TRUE Classic experience.
---
How efficient would it be to use it if he isn‚Äôt getting ganked and there are enough mobs? Seems like it would severely slow him down.
---
Ah, I see you‚Äôre a man of culture as well.
---
Some people dont use reddit on there pc... im one of those people
---
viewers were spam inviting him when he wanted to switch, if the mobs reappeared that meant he switched layers and he stayed in the grp.
---
Im actually mad as fuck that I watched this video.  I can't ever get that time back.
---
He thought he didn‚Äôt want it but he actually did.
---
You are confusing "Group Loot" with "Need before Greed" both loot options exist in Classic (create a party and check loot options for yourself). 
---
One allows anyone to roll need on anything, the other checks to see if you can actually use it.
---
The thing is, as a game designer, you can achieve that feeling by enabling the player to, (with effort) being a regional hero. A town, a faction. 
---
It doesn't have to be the whole world.
---
(Designing it in a way that it's not instant gratification but you can still go to those regions and, because of what you did there, feel like a hero, if that's what you want.)
---
Maybe in other town it's not you exactly who's the hero, but a certain group/faction you helped build and belong to. Stuff like that.
---
The thing for me is that his tanking ability is just a threat builder, not a taunting mechanic.  I burst right through that with no problem.
---
Blueberry is dead to me.
---
&gt;blizzard laughing all the way to the bank
---
This doesn't make sense as in they'll make money with additional subs. People like myself play classic or nothing.

Best holy paladin spreadsheet for pve.  it shows you how to value stats and what is bis in every stage of progression. this spreadsheet values +healing over crit for non mana intensive fights. 
---
flash of light is just so efficient that crit isn't as useful as people think. you can stack pure +healing and never go oom if you have pots and proper buffs.
---
Vaginan?
---
he didnt buy more energy in the cash shop
---
Yeah but the burden of proof is on the skeptics. And really all they've got and will have is his silent stream. Not necessarily proof.
---
All loot is hunter loot.
---
Yes the whole server shares those things i believe
---
1 caster accused him of having his brother account share based off an out of context clip from his stream, and later apologized. The method cast congratulated him and have an announcement of his win on their bottom scrolling banner. 
---
Grow up lad, no need to inflate drama off nothing. He even thanked Method for the competition.
---
Got a link for that?
---
350k+ people gave a shit when he dinged. No need to be a bitch about it. WF MC has also already been done, so with that attitude that doesn't mean anything either. Just let people enjoy what they want.
---
I also think that is stupid. But  it was available in vanilla. Layering was not
---
Any info since then if it works on the classic live servers client?
---
Method are just so awful, sick of their corporate pr and production. Kudos to maltese autist for showing them how its done.
---
Keep seeing these posts, and keep tellin‚Äô my fianc√© ‚ÄúThis could be us, but you playin‚Äô.‚Äù Lol

In all fairness, we‚Äôve been on vacation since last Saturday, so neither of us has even had the opportunity to play. Just tryina get her addicted once we get back.

Hey do you still have that premium account? Was wondering if you could get this movie for me: https://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=16917

Who would be the first lvl 60 Horde?

Get yourself an owl from the NE zone then teach it screech from a carrion bird in west fall and you have the best leveling pet in the game

Joana's record wasn't on his first time leveling up, lol. He had many practice runs to find the best route possible.

I literally just told you that that's not going to work. You're not going to make me feel stupid just by implying I'm wrong. Quit doubling down. This isn't how you argue.
---
Also disagree downvoting doesn't make me more wrong either, it just reaffirms to me that you're unwilling/incapable of actually arguing whenever it's coupled with this kind of dumbass Stacy-stare bullshit.

Gnome masterrace, this is our moment!

Me either friend. Let‚Äôs group up and take it together!

Who was the world first to post jokerd made world first 60?

I am level 32, still do not have a helmet, neck, or trinkets. I am not worried. Loving every minute of it.

Don‚Äôt forget multiboxing, saw three different people playing five characters each yesterday. Numbers add up üëåüèª

Free server transfers.
---
thanks!
---
i dont hate
---
i  just dont see why it's interesting
---
Yeah and criminals exist because of systemic issues and lack of social safety nets. That doesn't mean they should avoid punishment.
---
Yup. I'm lv 14 in full greens because so much of the same gear is posted in AH. It's fantastic! Most pieces were 5 - 7 silver :)
---
A coworker said that but, as the other commenter said, maybe it was an assumption.  Although the exact quote was "I think layering."
---
Hang on, were you playing on the rebirth?
---
Download twitch client.
---
Done. Even updates them all.
---
Even easier against a caster mob - just send him to attack and cast your shadowbolt to open.  Imp's firebolt will beat the shadowbolt and he can eat the first cast for you.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
~~Nice~~ Oh no memeable numbers :(
---
&gt; to imply it's not "playing fast and effectively" is just ignorant.
---
It is a factual statement that it is not only as I said, "someone playing a game super perfectly and fast."
---
I got that one too, So good!
---
Wait, wasn't he already selling his guide back in the day?
---
Captain Falcon in this bitch
---
nice
---
To what extent? No one is expecting you to be immune to layer transition but for 58-60 specifically he used it intentionally for an extended period of time. Not saying it matters anyway, literally anyone can do this and blizzard could‚Äôve easily applied a fix to avoid this but to what extent since you want to point out that he apparently used it prior to 58-60?
---
But those are *meta* cons.  The monetary cost of playing a Warrior isn't even valid given that they're often paid / bribed to tank 5-mans (EG they often get the first Righteous Orb in a Strat live run).
---
&gt;No real PVE Tier sets unless for Tanks, so most War raid gear will just feed your Tanks
---
Compare this with Paladins where their tier gear is a mix mash of focusing on their healing *and* their damage, so they're bad at both (until T2.5 at least)
---
&gt;Worst solo PVP (can kill other Warriors and roflstomp bad Rogues)
---
No more so than a Paladin who gets absolutely destroyed by casters and using my own experience for example, I wrecked my Warrior friend when we were in pre-raid gear but by the time of BWL he completely wrecked me in his full DPS gear versus me in full Judgement.  I just couldn't keep up with his damage outside of some crazy RNG
---
&gt;PVP need epic weapon wich need PVE raids wich need wanting to roll and compete for 2H in dual wield spec = GG
---
You think you'd have a better chance to get a PvE weapon as a Ret Paladin?
---
I'd say your only real valid criticism is the need for Warriors to respec talents (and I'm personally dreading that) but honestly it's not a big deal because there's not that many gold sinks in vanilla anyways.  The rest of your criticism either applies to Ret Paladins as well (in even worse ways) or they're poor arguments to begin with.
---
Guys what are good zones for level 60?
---
Oups sorry, I was reffering about a wowhead tweets about US loggin Queues (at a specific hour). You can check their twitters.   
---
We still have long queue in EU tho, 11k+ at 11:30am while nothing at 09:00 (Firemaw here). Don't really now the situation in US today for big servers and top Queue time.
---
Too young to get a job? What are you like 13? Get a paper route kid.
---
it's a 15 year old game dude
---
this isn't new
---
amazing post.
---
&gt; i can't wait for pserver guilds to get every world first too
---
Maybe it's just me but I don't feel like world firsts in Classic are going to hold much weight.  I mean I think world first Rag will because that's been a whole thing, like how fast can a guild start from absolute scratch and clear the first raid.  That's new and interesting and fun.  But after that...?  It just doesn't seem like a big deal to me.  All of this stuff has been downed before about a million times, in retail 15 years ago and in private servers even since.  World first progression is about conquering something new and extremely challenging.  It's not like everyone's going to be watching with baited breath while Limit gets Nefarian to 52% but Method gets him to 47%.  Any decent guild is going to roll over Classic raids, they are simply not as complicated or difficult as modern Mythic raids.  Classic raid progression will work for bad/average players only, the top few percent is not going to have any trouble with it.  Which makes world first seem extra pointless, to me.
---
&gt;For me, it's that they need to develop WoW 2. The game needs a total reset 
---
I said this exact thing 10 years ago
---
Also, level based resistances etc are much lower for pvp, so level doesn't matter as much as it does in pve.
---
Yup. Crazy how easy it's made it!
---
Catching fish so you can cook it and get +4 stamina and spirit for 15 minutes? HELL YEA
---
Thanks for the permission. I assume you're dumbass based on your user name.
---
Every mob can now be tagged by anyone who does damage to it. The mobs are also easier/players are now stronger. Those things added together means no one is gonna group up to do anything
---
Because being able to track obvious sarcasm and knowing not to speak about some controversial stuff to 50k+ people is considered Jedi social skills.
---
Is that bagnon you're using?
---
Are you and your friends white?
---
That's vanilla. This is classic. They're not comparable.
---
Almost like he abused the layering mechanic the last few levels....
---
Yeah. I think Guildwars 2 is actually a good example of this.
---
If Blizzard took the expansion and sideways progression of Guildwars, and then gave it the blizzard content output + blizzard polish, then I would never play another MMO. The problem I have with GW2 right now is that there isn't anything fun to earn, not enough variety in gameplay, and they've overextended so much that the maps feel dead. Retail WoW beats in terms of collectible skins, in terms of volume of content, in terms of variety of enemies, and more. But the core gameplay loop of GW2 is so much more satisfying than retail. As I reflect on my experience playing classic, it's very similar to my initial experience playing GW2.
---
"Nothing I do feels like a waste of time." Because I could make real progress in every zone. Every material had utility. Everything I did was relevant. And for that reason everything felt satisfying. Classic is the same way, except even moreso. I also noticed that the games design and avoidance of instanced content created a much stronger community, and seeing displays of community like random people helping one another felt way more common than in WoW.
---
But now that I think about it, there's another thing themepark MMO's simply can't do if they want to still feel alive. They can't overextend the map. Otherwise the population gets spread too thin. That's another problem GW2 is dealing with.
---
I personally wouldn't be opposed to having four sets of vanilla-type servers (though I guess I would be concerned about splitting the community). One which is vanilla forever. The second which will slowly roll out updates like they happened. The third which will only update to a certain expansion. And the fourth which will be a new start. Updated with completely new content and borrowing good content from newer expansions.
---
Vaginna?
---
Cool!
---
For some people, yeah.  That is a majority of the game.
---
I mean it's still spamming shadowbolts but nightfall procs give you free insta bolts so there's a bit more going on then just cast x times until mob is dead. You have to keep up your dot and curses while working around the procs. It's the more interesting of the two.
---
The main lock spec is just cast bolt over and over and use ruin when its up. No dots since there is a 16 slot debuff limit. No pet either since sacrifice is what makes your damage so good.
---
Is it actually confirmed that he was first? Its possible someone who was not streaming could have beat him
---
The only argument I see against this is that layering wasn't possible in vanilla so in a sense the record isn't true to the original game. It's very much the sense of beating a speedrunning record on an emulator while using exploits that are only present in said emulator.
---
Other than that it's just people upset that he capitalized on what could be considered a gray area in order to get an edge that others either didn't think of or wouldn't dare try.
---
Good eye, sure is!
---
Which guidebook is the one on the left? I found the Dungeon Companion at my local second-hand bookstore like 6 months ago and had the foresight to buy it, but I didn't know they had a regular guide.
---
&gt; I was watching Asmongold
---
This was your first mistake.
---
Yes it would be cuz it's just a stat stick to you increase your dps very slightly but for a rogue it could increase it way more because he is attacking with the barb
---
But think of all the exp and copper you got fighting the mobs to it! Another bonus of wow, drops feel real. Even when it's trash
---
Yeah... my eyes are in pain looking at this
---
Unironically this is that guy. This guy went solo all the way to 58 where he got a bit of help, while Method players have been instance grinding all the way in a studio in LA or w/e. Only to be beaten by a bald gnome. This is the story of the underdog coming through.
---
Try mining while your Auto Shotting üòéüëåüèª
---
What's the difference between you and everyone else? Your preaching to the choir here my dude
---
It‚Äôs called asexual reproduction
---
This whole race to 60 using layers, dungeon farming, and aoe grinding has been so boring to watch.
---
Can someone explain that to me? I played a bit of goldeneye way back in the day but didn't really understand what was going on in that vid.
---
Did you take it?
---
Ded üòÇ
---
A sign
---
This policy always made me a little frustrated as a hunter.
---
If a rogue can roll need on a +agil bow/crossbow because it is an upgrade, I can roll on a +agil 1h weapon if it is an upgrade as well.
---
I am not going to just pass on an item because it is a "better" upgrade for someone else. We are both putting in the time and effort to complete the dungeon, so we are both entitled to roll for an item that we can use, as long as we WILL use it.
---
That being said, it's never okay to roll on agil leather as a hunter.
---
Likewise, be careful of the Warhammer fan who's unaware of the existence of Tolkien, Starship Troopers, and about half a millennia of European history.
---
&gt; This is vanilla behavior that was specifically re-implemented for Classic.
---
Technically, server batching is still in retail, with a much smaller time slice. The window was just changed back to what it was in vanilla.
---
I do this as well. Got stuck in traffic for an extra 45 minutes yesterday and barely made it back home before the queue finished.
---
what's the addon called?
---
You put two of my favorite things together. Take my upvote!
---
Damn I think he changed his plan after a while
---
[Yea it's pretty insane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smk0Dqq0x-I)
---
Also though his taunt seems to be easily resisted which is annoying as hell.
---
I think BFA is more "you think you do, but you dont" than classic
---
Just download and try my friend.

---
Neat plates!
---
This is ridiculously complicated for no reason. Just open with Immolate while you send in Imp. Then agony, corruption, wand spam. You should be fine with very little downtime between Demon Armor, First Aid, and Health Stones.
---
One month lol
---
Problem is you cannot have infinite growth with a subscription model. Sure, you can fund blizzard as it exists now in perpetuity with classic and the rest of the games, but *muh investors* will always demand infinite expansion in profit.
---
They don't want some money, they don't want a lot of money, they don't want obscene amounts of money. 
---
They want ALL of the money. 
---
And thank god for Jim.
---
/Oblg. Not sure if trolling or serious ...
---
Except players had to literally complain for _years_ to get Classic and that only happened because of _private servers._
---
Not even from the group. It was *a caster*.
---
You know you're old when you have no fucking clue what POG means.
---
Yes but they moved the goal post as soon as they lost the leveling race.
---
Thought he crammed the whole thing? When he came back from his breaks there was no progress. Can you prove he did? I also wouldnt want to be talking for 91 hours
---
Thank you for leaving in the awkward nazi bit. Great show.
---
The wheel turns...
---
For this, Blizzard is awarded the title of Hero Socialist Gaming, and a monthly stipend of 400 Copper.
---
&gt; it‚Äôs not always totally accurate
---
AIUI in classic, addons can't tell the difference between spell levels, so when the enemy casts something, it has to take an educated guess which level they're using.
---
Took the words out of my mouth. By the time phase 1 is done we're all legendary world changing heroes. The biggest complaint of a lot of xpacs was that the status that you'd earned in previous expansions gets lost in a new one, and you're some Commadore's pissboy. No motherfucker I saved the world, like 5 times over.
---
So duh that by the time you get to WoD you have to be some high ranking legend, in Legion the literal bastion in your class, and in BoA the top ranking ambassador for your faction.
---
Fuck people forget in canon there's only a couple dozen heroes from each faction total. Just enough to fill out raids and fulfill all the class/race combos(with some extras in the 40 man era).
---
Honestly, it sounds like you guys are only a couple of hours in. In the time it takes to get through a queue you could probably remake your characters on a queue-less realm.
---
That's some serious gatekeeping somersaulting logic there.
---
Thank you, I need my dose of birds for this game
---
So you mean to tell me that games such as LoL, DotA and recently CS:GO are actually terrible with their exploitative design of being free and offering paid cosmetics only?
---
F2P is not necessarily bad, depending on the implementation.
---
I think you hit the nail on the head.  This guy wasn't using any mechanics that weren't available to every other player.  People just want to be upset or find faults in everything. I dont personally care who was first, and I doubt that most of the people who are complaining about this really care either.  Just enjoy the game and be happy for the guy imo.
---
Horse shit. Many more people buy gold when it is officially endorsed
---
I mean, is he offering?
---
Just don't camp him. You can get common 1.2 attack speed cats around level 23-28 if you just wait for it.

Joana is great if you enjoy leveling guides and a friendly outlook.
---
There‚Äôs people who have been playing Mario 64 8 hours a day for like 10 years. It‚Äôs not fun but speed runners have aspergers or something
---
You know you can still play FFXI.
---
SM GY farming. He was skeptical about having an 8 man group when I had some guildies with me. He had 4 i had 4. He told me to tell my guildies to fuck off and his have priority. I said well we could merge and have an 8 man, and i convinced him its good xp. I thought about it again for a sec and i had some other people getting on so then i said what is at the top of that screenshot.
---
Non-stop??
---
marijuana
---
I would say the difference is, you see level 60 at what you want to achieve. I personally don't. I level professions, help out other players, get some money, etc.
---
I'd do it
---
But then if that exploit is removed there will be another category so the current records aren't just unbeatable
---
They do, and it's accepted. But it's categorized separately. It can't be considered comparable to someone doing it after layers are turned off. There would be a new list of people/times. It's not frowned upon at all, just a different contest.
---
People keep saying this but are there any guilds out there that are racing them? And are they doing it under the radar or just less visible due to methods branding overshadowing them?
---
Idk man his dick is too big
---
Ye weird that a full dedicated retail guild lost to a guy who played vanilla private servers that practice speedruns. Yes i know he also played retail abit but this guy played more private servers to speedrun than anyone else ever did.
---
So you rather choose to play on a dead server in a few weeks/months or wait in a queue for like 30h+?
---
Yes, he said in his stream right after hitting 60 that his plan was to delete his character, but his inbox was indeed spammed mail to prevent him from doing so.
---
Imp does it automatically
---
layer hopper is not impressive
---
Thanks, didn‚Äôt know that

---
You are clearly the chosen one
---
Ha so this is where I normally say you can Count me out
---
In my opinion this is totally viable. What I did on private serves was to put 5 points in divine strength, 5 points into divine intellect. 1 point into consecration. That is all you need for tanking in my opinion. From my experience, this is viable for scarlet monastery. You can also heal decently as you have the 5 points into intellect. the rest of your points you can put into retribution.

Yeah, based on this ss, the guy said some stuff to you after you said something to him. Needs more context as to what happened before.
---
Yeah obviously private server training is the way to go, just based on results.
---
The previous wr was like 120 hours of gameplay, so no.
---
[Tribe](https://www.twitch.tv/tribe_tv1) is a solid bet, though the stream is down right now. His guild is one of the top contenders for world first Rag kill.

---
Apparently that‚Äôs not interesting my guy
---
Works for me on mobile. Zoom, enhance.

This looks like a screenshot of NeatPlates tbh.
---
I‚Äôm a measly level 26 priest but I‚Äôm having fun and I didn‚Äôt have to grind and stay up for days... I‚Äôll take this experience over world first 60 any day
---
Another thing to note, based on info from old retail vanilla, that there are some bugged wind serpent types (nicknamed caster pets), which have lower base stats(armor stamina etc..) than usual, and makes them weaker for no reason. 
---
Petopia website listed this info, but they are not yet sure if this bug is present in classic or not.
---
Here is the detailed article from petopia if anyone wants a read: https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/casterpets.php
---
I'd really like to know about pally macros
---
Layer hopping is already ruining classic.  People are already abusing it to farm rares, treasures, nodes, etc...  Blizz should have put some restriction in place to limit it like they do with instance resets.
---
Well obviously because it's still the honeymoon period
---
A lot of people will be leaving eventually. How soon and how much is anyone's guess
---
They've already opened more servers and have raised the cap temporarily. And people STILL refuse to move. That's on them for staying on the highest server in the US
---
whats pst?
---
Of course it can be beat, you could just have 100 people helping you while you tag the mob and keep running letting others kill for you. That isnt layer abuse so it's fine and if you think it wouldnt be fine then no help whatsoever should be fine so a run where 1 random guy helps you kill a mob at lvl 20 wouldn't count either. Their are SOOOO may ways to get a faster run time than layer hopping, (I mean just for a /played time run you could just only play with rested xp as well and destroy his record) it was just the easiest to do while also being the highest level so he couldn't get help.
---
i buff anything with legs
---
Abandoning a toon with zero XP who was created solely to reserve a name is "rerolling" the same way jogging from your car to your house is winning gold in the 100m dash.
---
The correct problem would be ‚ÄúQOL &gt; 20K Q but my guild and entire friends list play there‚Äù. You sold the right side of the equation short.
---
Dyslexic people definitely see it.
---
Give it time, activision will fix this over site
---
If you are a warrior, heed this advice.
---
It's worth NOT having a mount for 1-2 levels if you can actually KILL things without being butchered yourself. Sitting and eating only makes those grind levels that much worse
---
I actually don't, just from what ive been reading through this subreddit for the past 2 weeks while its been happening.
---
Stats for general purpose.
---
Cheap thrown for tagging
---
Mine is the fact that someone who was noone before Classic out of nowhere had probably the biggest single person stream with 350k viewers. And the last 20 minutes before he hit 60 was absolutely crazy with Live to Win playing in the background, and the Undead Warrior trying to kill him moments before 60.
---
HI MOM
---
If you check the vods, he went to sleep 3 times for roughly 6 hours at a time, surely if he was account sharing whoever he was sharing with would take over while he is sleeping? His /played is believable, the fact he managed to swap layers to make it faster makes it even more so, he also got WF on 2 private servers, so he already has the experience. I think there is alot more evidence to prove he is innocent than guilty.
---
tastes like chicken! xDD
---
I agree with your last point, the problem is that this is all subjective, and nothing is quantifiable. 
---
Who is to say that me getting a bow upgrade will be more of an upgrade? What if that rogue who could roll for it is gearing to run MC, and I am a casual player who doesn't intend on raiding past UBRS? Does it matter for me to get it since it could be the last bow I ever upgrade to?
---
My approach to the situation in vanilla was transparency; before I started a run (whether I was leading it or not) I ensured the group knew if i was intending on rolling on a melee weapon. At that point, they could choose to remove me from group (which is reasonable, and not something I was offended about) or leave the group themselves so that they didn't spend their time running and potentially losing the roll anyway.
---
And no one trying to beat that record from here on out will have to deal with the absolute shit show of extreme lag and mob camping that was the first 3 hours of launch.  
---
It took me 2 hours to get to lvl 5 on my crafting alt that I started launch with, then only ~30 minutes to do the same on my second toon (my main).  
---
What he saved in layering he very likely lost on launch anyways.
---
Black
---
DM. It's DM.
---
Dire Maul isn't even out yet. When ever in the game besides this have people called a dungeon by the end boss?
---
Or maybe I am not as easily offended by online people trolling as you. Not that hard to see my point of view.
---
Not from an Alliance
---
Best part is that he beat a team of ‚Äúprofessional ‚Äú gamers (Method).
---
Wow. Jelly much? Thinking like this is so toxic. So much for "classic is a better community than retail". So many people trying to make Method seem bad and incapable.
---
I was actually able to get my real name on a server yesterday - perks of having a rare name with a rare spelling. Of course, now I don't know what class I see myself as...
---
Awesome!!!!! :)
---
Why do people get excited over nothing? And it‚Äôs not world first. There was already a world first lv 60 when the game originally came out. So Johnny come lately.
---
My 6 year old son was asking me about it after i was watching some classic clips last night - I don't think i've ever talked with such pride reminiscing over my WoW career, i've done some really cool shit in my life too
---
Here is the doc that the community is using to track progress: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1guzb1WcYXwpRvnOqT-MMKikr8FDImSgxSADe36i_WuM/htmlview?sle=true#gid=0 
---
Not official, but probably as close as it gets. I haven't done too much checking, but APES has two groups in the top 25 players, under rikh/tribe and tierratv. Other groups also close, but I don't really follow the scene so I don't have the full list.
---
I got caught by my husband playing, we made it a family thing
---
DS1 and DS2 (7,5) were playing roblox, DS3 (8weeks) was in the sling while I was standing and DD (18m) was popping around to everyone pilfering food and watching play. 
---
When one of us had to step away to assist a kid, the other would reach over and push buttons occasionally 
---
Worked pretty well!
---
Lol try playing on a realm without a queue
---
Trade chat has always been home of edgelords and trolls. They‚Äôre just doing it to get this very reaction. The more They see people QQ on the forums the more they push. Asking for blizzard to act like a parent and fix things is what ruins crap. Just report, block and move on.
---
Well I‚Äôm at lvl 8 so ha!
---
In a perfect world; Shadow Priest.   
---
But that's if a player straight up ignores you or is distracted by another foe, your dots and mind blast will tear them apart.
---
Shaman is just way more ~~cheesy~~ tactical with their shocks and totems they can cast on the move.
---
Herod is the official MB server? That is news to me. I'm level 30 on Herod Alliance and yet to see a single multi-boxer on either faction (and I've done quite a bit of PvP so far.) Maybe you have it confused with Stalagg, which I've seen referenced as the official MB server multiple times here as well as the official forums.
---
It'd be silly to roll on Herod if you are a MBer honestly, or any of the high pop servers (save Stalagg I guess, if you want to play with other multi-boxers.)
---
Everyone knows delayed gratification is where it's at.
---
Green Street Hooligans. Talk about nostalgia. Such a great movie.
---
Tbf he only used in on the last 1 1/2 levels.
---
Talking to the devs after NGE had been around for a bit when I was in high school was a trip. Some folks vocally preferred the old approach, others felt the new way was more streamlined for then to design for, others thought the masses would like it if they have it a shot. I only played it during the days I was there with them but it was really heavy handed with the fanservice. I played as a bounty hunter and like my first quest was to talk to Boba Fett and Darth Vader lol
---
A lot of recipes vendor for more than the cost of mats.
---
Its clear you didn't play Vanilla, its VC.
---
Yeah he soloed.
---
and he only used the layering technique from 58 to 60.
---
Well, we learned that Twitch switches off the stream automatically after 48 hours. But we have survived this and only few hours left!
---
And this time around I suspect private servers will be significantly better. I know this is kinda old but we will have perfect data and a renewed interest in vanilla.
---
You might consider just leaving the internet as a whole if it offends you. People are trolls. People are racists. People enjoy getting a rise out of other people. People are people. Blizzard bans people all the time for this shit, but that's upto them. It sounds to me like you need to either re roll alliance, find another server to play on, or just leave the internet all together. In all honesty, someone has the right to be a troll/be racist just as much as you have a right to come here and complain about it. If you don't like what someone is saying and it hurts your feelings or makes you uncomfortable, maybe it's not the Censoring that is the issue, but your sensitivity. 
---
There are a lot of issues in the world, many of which will never change.  As long as there are varying races there will be racism. Deal with it or leave existence. Those are literally your options.
---
Yep, was doing that so obsessively I ended up with literally half my bank full of leather stacks. My leatherworking is happy, suffice to say.
---
For the average person there is no money to be made outside of launches. Potions and flasks often sell for more than the mats to create them and if you get rank 3 you might break even. But I did make a pretty penny by being among the early herbalists and alchemists on launch.
---
Where do we draw the line here. Sure it‚Äôs stupid. But someone clearly thinks it‚Äôs funny. Does your need to be coddled and avoid distasteful sentiments overrule someone‚Äôs right to make a joke they think is funny. Who is right? Both of you, and neither of you. Welcome to the world of nuance.

How are other servers doing? I play on Whitemane and queues have been non stop crazy past 12 noon every day.
---
Taking 3 or 4 murlocs on at a time is more fun that 1 quickly!
---
Retail is way more casual than classic.
---
Ok thank you. I've tried getting ElvUI through a few different places but xouodnt get it to work. Havent tried tukui yet tho.

It's a palomino.

Sounds odd not to discuss this at all with your partner

You must be a solo player of have an agreeable group of friends.

Opening more servers AFTER people are settled is already too late. That's just not how people work. You can waste time with how people OUGHT to behave, but that's not reality.
---
Hiiii!

Guys, a stupid question, but are the graphics the same on the new WoW and the Classic WoW? I have some old laptop which can't run the current WoW, but I was wondering if the graphics got reversed I may install it on it?

Lol why the fuck are you living like that? Sounds like it's more stressful than your work. Stopping your car on the way home?... Dude.

It's supposed to be fun. Do what you want, but there is no way on God's green earth I would ever queue for hours and never even get in just to play a game.

I'll be playing as a shockadin, stacking as much intellect and spell damage on my plate gear as I can. Basically I want to go holy spec to be able to heal dungeons/raids, but I also want to be able to dish out some damage in pvp. Seal of righteousness will be probably the best seal, but should I use it with a one-hander, or a fast two-hander ? The first option might seem the best, however two-handers deal more damage and most people attack from behind anyway, so shields aren't that useful.
---
Any thoughts ?
---
There's a bracket for every 9th level also it still could have sold to someone for good gold
---
yes it is. but who is saying he did? his grind strategy was the same all 3 days of stream. went offline multiple hours. Throwing rumours to get other people down like that out in the open is as much of bitch move as really doing account share. Which I really feel like he didn't as seeing how long he was offline now and then and not being higher when logging back on (playing on his server so we've all seen him level and be offline at times) 
---
Just because you can't level that fast doesnt mean no one can.
---
18 hours a day is ofcourse a fuck ton to play but it's definetly not impossible
---
Low pop server. I was flabbergasted at people waiting hours to play. I was definitely level 2 by 7pm.
---
I dont know. I almost want to see a screenshot. I'm on Fairbanks and spent some quality time there.  Barrens chat had always been stupid, funny, outrageous, and over the top. If there is anything posted there and not funny, I generally view it as an attempt to be funny, even if  it is in extremely poor taste. 
---
But if you want to say that someone was being anti-semitic... nuance, context, and detail does matter.
---
Usually considered kind of the gatekeeper of hard drugs. Like the hardest soft drug if you will
---
You mean swapping on the PC itself and not logging in through a different PC? I believe it's still account sharing, but I don't think he did that? Correct me if I am wrong.
---
There are places like this everywhere! I just never knew until a couple of days ago that you can buff people who are on the fp :)
---
But a Shadow Priest isn't spending significant time healing are they?
---
Could be on the opposite faction
---
They all look to be doing well, most of my guys and girls that I play with are all talking about moving servers to a less populated server so we can play more
---
If you're pushing 30 and live with your parents I think you have some things in your life you should be doing instead of playing WoW.   
---
Neg vote me, boys.
---
Opposite our troops are swelling, think that will change mid 20s. None have world PvP experience bless their souls
---
From what I know absolute macro like startattack, stopattack, petattack, cleartarget do not take a variable so they cannot have conditions.
---
Any chance I can get the 1-40 leveling spec from you as well? Much thanks!!

I wish I had used one. Waited through an 8k queue and must have been disconnected right before I got back to the computer. Back of the line I go. I‚Äôve only gotten in once since launch :(
---
He can download the game and use your account info, but if he starts to get really invested he will want to play when you want to play and that could cause a conflict with you guys. Then if he does get an account he will have to start all over because his toon was on your account.
---
You have a life/family/job/other interests.
---
Honestly it's cool for him, but honesty when you think of it really sad he had 3 or so days to dedicate fully to playing a video game.
---
The refurb market is very much alive with tossing Win10 on pretty much anything Ivy Bridge or later, often still leaving the original HDD in it rather than tossing in a cheap SSD. 
---
Just reimage, clean, and ship.
---
I love ret paladin... I'm leaning towards maining one as I do in retail. I never played vanilla at all so the ret on classic is a little... Discouraging when looking at the skills.  Along with all the talk of rets being pointless, I'm curious.
---
My question is, what version of wow will ret paladins' dps become "respectable"?
---
I'm not interested in joining a hard core min/max raiding guild.  But I still like to be towards the top in damage.  Also not interested in playing a hybrid dps/support role... I'm afraid ret fits into that category.
---
I'm mainly focused on pvp but do enjoy dungeons and raiding as well.
---
Were you the guy spamming that? xD
---
All these at the same time
---
No. It didn‚Äôt exist. Servers were only 2500 capacity back then. Now they are over 10k.
---
What ever dropped with highest dps for main hand.  
---
Then I used an old weapon for oh (to train weapon skill so it always was at max). I preferred fast oh daggers etc but any goes as spec in furry doesn‚Äôt bring weapon talent in to play.
---
No it's not bad. Racial bonuses make very little difference and don't matter unless you're no lifing.
---
Be a tauren.
---
Exactly, it feels like people are just jealous, and can't see the real picture. Even though layering switch was used for the last 2 levels, the launch was a mess, with queue times, lag, overcrowded early areas etc....
---
Classic wow is a very undemanding game. You probably can run it
---
ppl on this sub hate retail more than ppl on /r/childfree hate children and /r/politics hate donald trump put together.
---
Congrats to this guy and his brother for helping him level his character while he slept. Nice teamwork.
---
If it's an upgrade, need roll on it, and immediately equip.
---
There's no reason to not equip an upgrade, and it should show good faith why you rolled as such for your group.
---
Can almost guarantee the people you are seeing say this are, in fact, not racist nazis. Trolling has been a part of wow since day 1.
---
The problem is when all you see is racists you miss out on the nuances. Snowflake little lefty.
---
I wouldn't ask who cares, people care about plenty of stupid shit. The real question is why should I care.
---
e621 is actually my goto
---
You mean layering. And it‚Äôs only during the initial stages of classic release so that the map wouldn‚Äôt be overloaded with people. There‚Äôs a ton of info on the boards and on this subreddit about it.
---
Bacon checking in, my warrior buddy is beef
---
For leveling you only need 3 points in imp corruption because of that exact reason if you plan on PvPing 5/5 is definitely worth it
---
Yea no shit.  Start a fresh toon in BfA and the starter zones are still swamped with new characters.
---
bad combo for a first character, because alchemy requires herbs, which you either have to buy regularly (you're poor, so you can't), or gather yourself. To gather yourself, you need herbalism. 
---
Herbalism goes with alchemy. Skinning goes with anything that is not dependent on another gathering profession (so no engineering, blacksmithing, alchemy). A good and popular combo for a priest on a new server would be skinning+tailoring.
---
Because some people actually need it and some people will just sell the item.
---
SKINNER !?
---
Rogue, I would argue, is harder to play than a warrior. That being said, they do a lot of damage and are a great pvp class. If you go warrior and go tank spec, you will find dungeon groups and raid groups really fast though.
---
It‚Äôs not that bad. Given that there are 40 raid spots to fill, it‚Äôs not too bad to be one of them as long as you are friendly with your guild. A lot of vanilla difficulty came from getting 40 people to do the right thing and show up at the right time to do it.
---
I personally blame LFD for the path WoW went down. It went from a game that you could play by yourself for the most part but it was screaming at you "HEY THIS IS BETTER WITH FRIENDS" the whole time. After LFD came phasing, after phasing came LFR, after LFR came garrisons, and eventually it just turned into a game that was better with friends but you could pretty much play it by yourself with other people who were essentially bots.
---
I understand why they went the way they did, it made the game more accessible and they were trying to keep their millions of subs. I just didn't really care for it because once I stopped playing on a schedule with my guild exploring the world got replaced by standing in town waiting for queues.
---
That's not true at all. It varies a lot.

It might be a group lvling the char.

They were doing that for all the "realm firsts" back in the days.

You say that but everyone else seems to understand it prevents you from progressing while you wait for it to reset

Why do people have to talk like that...

"NO CHANGES"

I really wish they would have went in and touched up some the art/assets. 
---
I guess it's just me but... oi.
---
Or maybe some new quests/rewards VERY MUCH sidegrades and in line with everything else.
---
Agreed. Sure if you max dots and spam shadowbolt you'll overtake him, but if you manage your mana pool you can farm all day without getting touched.
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay he only sped for two miles‚Äù
---
Do you really believe that? I mean... we literally watched him continuously swap layers after clearing his AOE route. I don‚Äôt blame him for abusing the system - I blame the system.
---
Big Lenny !

Was ganked by an alliance rogue today while killing a mob that was gonna make me ding. Mob was low so I just tanked it while fighting. When I was below half HP, I kill the mob for the ding and the rogue starts running for his life.
---
But you can't escape the Horde my friends
---
heh
---
I‚Äôll check it out, I do prefer the Classic UI however, can I disable ELV UI except for the gold tracker?
---
What drama? The guy who beat method for the world first 60 on classic?
---
If my memory serves me well (and it probably doesn't because it was a long long time ago), ret was serviceable in pvp by racking up reckoning and blapping people. Might not work in this patch/version and it was always a bit of a meme build. Bubble and stun were always useful.
---
It is just the way all games are now days.
---
Just like gamers always optimize the fun out of everything, developers optimize their game for engagement.
---
WoW Classic feels like they built a world and didn't care about optimizing rewards to make everything "worth it." In retail, and all video games these days, I can expect a similar reward out of 10 minutes of work. I know what I am getting, how long it gets to get there, how long the quest takes. 
---
Classic on the other hand, everything takes different time. I go to 4 different locations across 2 zones because that is what makes sense for the quest.
---
1. Reroll on a different realm, skip the queue
---
2. Rub it in their faces that you get to play and get a higher level than them.
---
3. Watch as they start refilling as well because they want to play too.
---
I'm wet-
---
I just finished deadmines!
---
Well, yeah. I am pretty sure Jokerdtv did this legit. If you, of course, don't count the layer hopping as something significant enough.
---
It is not sad this guy just kicked off his streaming career and will start making a lot more money than most of us here.
---
I actually really like fear inoculum most
---
Etiquette for dungeon loot (assume PUG):
---
Greed on green BoE (unless upgrade)
---
Need on blue BoE
---
Greed on all non upgrade BoP
---
Need on all upgrade BoP
---
For mining, herbalism etc. -round robin, /roll
---
Then you can play retail?
---
You could do 10 man raid dungeons in vanilla, you couldn't layer hop to aoe farm mobs. It's not on the same level. But sure, if thats your personal view you're allowed to have it. :)
---
Is there a list to all these pets you can get in classic?
---
Nope. No facecam.
---
Don't feel bad, I was just running around looking for them without any real tactic other than luck
---
It isn‚Äôt only in the USA. This irony/humor/normalization is associated with the rise of fascism throughout history.

Yh ik, was just expanding on it.

If it isn't me on my warrior....tought I wanted to mage but apparently...no :)
---
Yeah, i get my wife to log me in a few hours before i finish work, that way by the time im home and have had dinner im in and good to go.
---
Disappointed no one commented on your character name. Love when that DnD story pops up every few months :)

Probably.  I was 1200 in que yesterday and got logged in

I swear to god I know someone who looks excactly like this guy in the front.
---
Well now I mean yeah but I'm assuming a priest would get a slight buff like a little more mana or slightly stronger heals.  You know for balance.
---
Not whitemane lmao
---
And druids are completely different from retail
---
I‚Äôve got a 2.90 speed polearm so it benefits more to have righteousness
---
The race to Rag is already lost, Method will be obliterated by APES.
---
Paladin raid tanking only really became a thing in the burning crusade, and even then it was sub optimal. I know as I spent many an hour off tanking magtheridon and zul aman. Fun times!
---
I think they mean how do we know some rando nonstreamer didn't get it quicker?
---
They should have redone the textures then because that's pretty bad for hd
---
Wow moms unite! In between making sure the house doesn't burn down and the monsters are fed.
---
Method are a bunch of epeen douchebags. I don't get everyone's obsession with them. Pretty happy they failed here.
---
Chinese gold farmers will exploit this to the max.
---
Right... if you want ninja or pirate skins you gotta fish and cook like the rest of us.
---
I seriously crave making a priest but went with rogue because of leveling horror stories. What's the leveling like? And are you going for holy or shadow?
---
I used to think you had to constantly feed your pet until it got happy. I didn't know you gave it a bit and that basically made a happiness HoT so I should wait. I had friends sending me all the food.
---
I had the fattest of fat bears.
---
If you don‚Äôt mind PVP I‚Äôve never had a queue on Benediction.
---
If a boe drops all roll need no question.  On loot that drops from boss loot table that is the objective of the group.  Getting a weapon upgrade by doing a few runs isn't that tough and if some rogue wants to use assassins blade for 3 levels before he upgrades... damn right I'd rather have everyone roll and sell it for 100g later.  It's greedy to want to use it and throw away 100g down the line essentially when you will use it for a day then upgrade.  My thoughts...I don't care if I lose a roll for a boe I would use as long as we roll on all of them.
---
BASED
---
Also in a different version of the game, one where he couldn‚Äôt switch layers to respawn mobs and didn‚Äôt have thousands of people actively rooting for him and helping.
---
Epic achievement but classic and vanilla aren‚Äôt the same thing, they‚Äôre two different records.
---
They are so salty
---
I'm a morning/nap time user. Whhhhhhich is how I got caught today.. went AFK to soothe the little, fell asleep with a little.. DH walked in and saw the disconnect screen..

So now I have to let him play with me ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Difficulty of the current raid or population of mythic raiders?
---
I actually prefer pvp ... might check that one out
---
 Hey, i just started playing WoW classic with my friends. Its been fun so far and im playing mage. I want to do pvp later on as we are playing on a pvp server too. I am only lvl 5 and there is still time to change class. I see some people say mage in pvp is only spamming frostbolt. (which is obviously not very fun). First, is this true? are there not really more spells that can make your rotation smoother and just feel rewarding? and second, does a rogue outclass a mage in terms of PvP?(1v1's, WPvP skirmishes and battlegrounds) And last does rogue feel more smooth? Thanks
---
It's one of those things that is only ever going to resonate with a portion of people, but that's fine as what it does is unique. EVE Online is an MMO that's very different and that makes it interesting so I appreciate it existing but it'll be a cold day in hell before I play that game
---
Ah I see. How is fury so far? Everything I've looked up says to go arms for leveling but I think fury is a cooler spec.
---
Fear is the mind killer.
---
Probably bots buying things priced lower than vendor.
---
I play on RP server. Love it.
---
That was my race/ class in vanilla and those were my reason. The only trade off (kind of a big one) is that Tauren cant use bows. I regretted it a bit. But at the end of the day its and mmoRPG. Do what you want
---
Oh I guess im missing that badge. Step back lads, another bad ass vanilla guy here.
---
My point stands. The dungeon isn't called VanCleef.
---
&gt;But once it was clear JokerD would probably win the race, chats got increasingly toxic, spamming 'losing to a bald gnome' and stuff everywhere and getting worse with every hour, basically raiding everyone who's not JokerD - especially Method's stream.
---
These are jokes and people having fun. Nobody is being toxic. You're being too sensitive, people are mememing and having a good time of the race.

TC is decent threat and is often useful to dump your rage in one global after charge so that you can immediately switch to defensive for revenge on the main target (when you're low level and don't have tac mastery yet).
---
They‚Äôre not this and I‚Äôm a fan of preach, but...
---
There‚Äôs been a long standing presumption by some in this community that private server guilds are big fish in a small pond, and that they‚Äôd be shown up by more capable players come classic release. 
---
In the circumstances, some level of vindication is understandable, and unfortunately method as the most organised group feed the brunt of this.
---
I was just outside.  I came back in and everything i said is still correct.  Now what?
---
APES are in mid-50s grinding BRD. What's the current state of the Method roster?
---
Snakes in Org.
---
If someone rolls need on a Boe, they are equipping it immediately or they are kicked.
---
Rolling need on a straight upgrade for another player is being a dick, boe or bop.
---
Oo sounds like someone‚Äôs offended by just simply a word
---
SAHM here; rolled Horde on Bloodsail Buccaneers. I usually have time to play during the (mostly mornings) day or after 10ish (PST). Always looking for WoW friends. :)
---
I'm wondering the same thing. Trying to sign in for the first time in 6 years (I'm pumped) and my position and time in queue have only steadily increased. I'm looking right at it, and literally nothing but increases. I hope it's a bug.
---
You just pinned down the exact reason I quit retail in BfA. Everytime I'm on my (insert class here), I think hmm I wish was this or that. In classic, you ARE your class. Sure alts are fun, but you ARE your main. Period.
---
All of those things are currently against Blizzard‚Äôs rules so I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre asking for. Report them.
---
I‚Äôm which case he didn‚Äôt beat Joanas records, just set new ones.
---
If you've read the post which you must not have, I said we don't need to hear that, we've heard it countless times but the fact of the matter is I'm trying to locate and speak to the individual(s) with the names and possibly come to a consensus or mutual agreement. As I've stated to others, they haven't really played them so it wouldn't be a total loss and it could be a great opportunity to profit.
---
Funniest part is, I bet you‚Äôre white AND offended lmfao
---
Ahhh, what is later hopping? (Noob here)
---
Jokerd was a disadvantage, getting attacked by horde players throughout his grind and exposed to stream snipers
---
Btw, I‚Äôm a horde player and was hoping he would get ganked/camped  on lol
---
As someone who also works from home, these are very dangerous times lol
---
Some dude already hit 60 and I'm sitting here like "lfg for hogger."
---
Maybe "real" wasn't the right term. What I meant is that most of us have more normal lives and jobs that don't allow us to play WoW all day for a living.
---
Agreed
---
No big streamer picked biggles? They are all on faerlina?
---
You can do a /who 55-60 and see everyone in that range, so it's impossible for someone to get 60 without everyone knowing.
---
Note that that's a level 50 spell so there are very few mages who even could make that portal at this point. And if you find one, at a minimum you should be prepared to reimburse them the 20s for the reagent.
---
Ouch, that weapon speed though
---
Not always possible depending on the infrastructure
---
Oh no! Crushed by nap time lol.
---
I'm thinking about rolling an alt. What's the strongest support class in classic? Horde if that makes a difference.
---
Personally, I think Nintendo is in the same boat. But to each their own.
---
This exact joke has been posted so many fucking times in the last few weeks, it stopped being funny like a week ago
---
I got to like 2 ranks from the top back in the day was a lock without much raid gear. It's doable. Fights in classic are way less gear dependant. You'll need blues and chants for sure, but that's easy to get. But if you want mobility it may be hard. I pvpd with soul link and life drain. Mostly dots and good survival. I don't remember, but if we have death coil that helps a lot too.
---
Join rattlegore its a great server!!
---
this is why when i jump afk i always go to a secluded area that no player would ever dare enter; AKA SW park
---
Anything can be funny.

---
Google chrome Remote Desktop viewer WORKS better then any iv ever used download on device&gt; setup passcode then download of phone or second device and login to chrome and it‚Äôll let you go right in and play the game and more from it.
---
Ah, thanks for clearing that up, I had no idea
---
You can also dodge the queue while not breaking the tos. Remote Desktop.
---
Blizzard banged on about how layering would make it fine, how they‚Äôd figured out how many people were gunna play, etc, etc. Yet they clearly haven‚Äôt. 
---
There was ONE pvp oceanic server until like 3pm on launch day. When they opened another it had a 15k queue. Now we have 3. If we had 3 to start guilds and friends would have been spread more evenly.
---
If all your friends/guild pick a realm it‚Äôs basically impossible to get everyone to change. 
---
Blizz fucked up. We‚Äôre playing the cards we‚Äôve been dealt.
---
So we can‚Äôt but mobs can? Naga siren legit using two hands to channel a smite and she ‚Äúparries‚Äù me????
---
My bad. It's just that a lot of people think that streaming and things like that cannot be considered a real job because reasons, lol.
---
I guess it could go out to every inhabitant of the Charred Vale haha, probably the toughest experience I‚Äôve had thus far. It was a blast though
---
Anybody else distracted by those character names?
---
how is the one queuing remotely fine for 4 hours bumping up the login queue. its exactly the same as ppl afking ingame for a couple hours and i dont blame anyone for abusing these either. the only one whos at fault here is blizzards for dealing terribly with these kind of situations. 
---
free server transfers should be an option immediatly and also how they have dealt with dead realms in the past causes ppl to flock to the biggest server out of fear ending on a dead realm in a couple months
---
Was not impressed at all tbh. It's chill and all. But maybe a little TOO chill.
---
It really does, but that doesn't fix a lot. There are many things you can do to make the leveling experience more fulfilling and immersive.
---
But ultimately, if you do fix it, it might not be even worth it because so many long term players have a bunch of max level characters and you are having huge trouble attracting new players.
---
Not to mention anyone that level is probably busy grinding and not doing portals.
---
My guild moved to incendius just to have that server also become high pop.. can‚Äôt just keep moving.
---
Will check it out :))
---
Complete opposite, started with 20ish, now in the 80 range.

I bought everything in the MTX shop, but I never got the email that Blizz sends to the whales asking what they want in the game. I might be missing it, can you forward it to me?
---
Agreed :-)
---
&gt; helped him level so efficiently.
---
..from level 58 to 60.
---
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome.‚Äù 
---
Thank you, for the 800th time since Tuesday.
---
You can also use google remote desktop, which doesn't have silly quirks like alt-f4ing you out of the game if you disconnect from your phone. I'm currently in queue from my phone, myself.
---
But most of the time those glitches in the games are way harder and can fuck up speed runs completely... i mean look at this video for [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHDCXhnNaug) ... some people would beat a speedrun with those stuff but its to risky and espacilly speedruns in nintendo games often need pixelperfect stuff.

---
Well, due to the explots and rumors he has against him id say it would be more rewarding if he didnt take these shortcuts and truly just played the game competetng with people and everything to get to that point. Id find that person cooler than the one that has to use these things to get there. Its like a moral thing, i think
---
Money doesn't mean fulfillment.

I think it was something like 14 hours offline in the ~90 hours since launch.

Thanks! I googled it after posting and already have some set up.

Yo for real? I basically live in two places and I log in from both of them. Do I have to fear I get banned now, just because I'm using a portable device to play the game wherever I like to play it?
---
I just like that question even at level 5 is somewhat of a challenge.  You have to pay attention to your surroundings and actually manage your mana, and you might actually die a good few times.  In retail questing is just mind-numbingly easy.
---
Look I absolutely want the game to be successful by it's the first week. Let's see how long this lasts.
---
Except for the first ten levels, there aren‚Äôt any racial restrictions on weapons. Tauren Hunters can learn bows at level 10.
---
if you cant think about making jokes about someone and hating on them you can't be helped at all.
---
If anyone else on Skeram wants to do the quest as alliance hit me up. I save the horn to do it later but it's so cliche I don't think I will. I'll hook ya up.
---
Yes, I too am much smarter than people who like different things. :)
---
You got to remember that about 30% of the player base will give up on classic in a month.  So the problem will fix itself over time.
---
No, but for a little while, everyone had heirlooms (items that level up while you level) that were basically blue quality rares (maybe better) so you really could blow through dungeons on a group full of them. No mechanics, no worry, just mindlessly going through the dungeon as fast as possible.
---
Being tank, I would have just said "welp, i guess we're going to have to find a new DPS then".

Leveling is a breeze.  It‚Äôs a little rough until you get a wand... and then when you hit 20 you get holy fire and it‚Äôs a breeze.  Holy fire&gt;mindblast&gt;SWP&gt;wand.  Mob dies, you get spirit tap, your at full mana again.
---
"Losing to a bald Gnome" is not toxic. It's playful banter. They aren't insulting the person. It is meant to playfully poke fun at the situation.
---
You need to lighten up.
---
My point is just that it does, absolutely, make a difference on world first times and speed runs. They simply can't be counted in the same category as Vanilla WoW. This is its own thing now.
---
I was at a poker table at the Imperial Palace (back when it was around) in Vegas. I played for 23 hours straight and had been awake for a dozen hours before I ever sat down at the table. And to be honest, I had to force myself to stop. I felt like I could've kept going just fine. So yeah, it's definitely possible to be awake for 2 days, no question.
---
Yes, let me just get the guild I've joined to all reroll on s new server because this was all in my control.
---
Like it or not this is blizzards fault.  They got people to commit to like 11 servers to start, saw that there were queues to reserve names and did nothing for a week.
---
The more people that coordinate/organize the harder it is to change.  Opening 25 new servers on launch day isn't a realistic solution to 50-100 people who have established on a full server.
---
That's ryan lockwood's speedrun on streets agents from Goldeneye 007, it's kind of a long story but to sum it up there's a level which was believed to be almost impossible to finish in less than 1 minute and 13 seconds
---
So this dude Ryan tried for months only to cut off 1 second off the previous record, I'm talking of hours and hours of the same level for months, crazy stuff. 
---
Also, there was a forum in which no one believed he could achieve that so when he did it he inmediately posted the video as a big fuck you to all the non-believers.
---
That video is the edited version from his stream, after he did his run he watched it again and did the most epic commentary you will hear in your life.
---
There's a cool albeit long video explaining his achivement, I'll try to look for it after work. The record has been broken since then though, it's now at 1.11 if I'm not wrong.
---
Indeed. I wonder if there's literally anyone who wasn't in the world first race at 50+.
---
I got hyped by my first white item, no more grey for me, this bad boy had 48 armour!
---
LOOOOL. How are you going to streamsnipe someone whos much higher level than you? Bs excuse
---
Go Tauren. You'd much rather be the race you'd like than do an extra 1% dps. Racials really only get crutial if you're super min-max and would cut off your left arm for a minor advantage
---
It depends what your definition of ‚Äústrongest‚Äù is. If you‚Äôre talking raw healing output, priests for sure (particularly minus Paladins on Horde). They have a strong PvP spec in Shadow as well (even though it‚Äôs not all that viable in raids).
---
Why should we be impressed by top level basketball players? It just takes dedication. The game is over 120 years old, it isn't anything new.
---
Good point, I forgot about that.
---
For an example (even tho not perfect) check Hakurais Videos on YT
---
Nah fake news obviously
---
Everything felt earned, I spent like 40+ hours trying to get Quel'Serrar on my warrior tank main, never got it, but when my buddy and fellow tank did I was stoked, much like he was when I finished my alt's hunter legendary questline. I thought Legion was fun (we won't talk about BfA), but theres few things that I stop and think, that was cool that I got that, that we did that, etc., Its not the same being like 'YEAH I KILLED THAT FARM STATUS BOSS AND TITANFORGED GO ME'. Literally have played the last few expansions to enjoy the story and quit because raiding feels like a treadmill, and the communities suck ass with xserver (link ach, have better gear than me, 2000000+ [raider.io](https://raider.io) only please). We knew what we were getting a lot of the times when we invited someone, and even if they weren't the greatest we invited them anyways because it was possibly the only person we could get at the time, which led to some epic runs of even 5 man dungeons.

This ~10 minute video is by one of the people from the Goldeneye speedrunning community and very clearly explains why RL is 'a fucking legend' :)
---
Alright dude, its not a dick measuring contest. Just be happy for the dude for getting worlds first.
---
they do regular disconnect waves that kill afker macros connections, real players log back in right away.
---
Stop parroting their obvious PR lines.
---
I like Stonetalon.
---
I'm in the EU, Golemagg which has a 20k queue and i did just fine on my alt Rogue.
---
no it doesn't
---
Prices are based on the level of each zone not the distance. Weird but true to vanilla
---
Can tell you right now I‚Äôm getting sick of waiting in queues every day I go to log in.
---
I know that one did. But not all of them.
---
when he turned his HUD back on and the elite was at like 75% health and he was at 3% mana i almost lost my mind
---
/r/Gatekeeping
---
Once every level warriors can pull two mobs, granted that they ding by killing the first! :P
---
Honestly I thought he would hate and love it at the same time.
---
No it's still only 10s. I'm a hunter and just trained it for a polearm I got. Not sure what OP is talking about.
---
He actually adopted his brother so he would legally be his dependent so it doesn't go against TOS
---
Check Hakurais Videos on YT for example, training, a perfect route and never stop moving and hitting is Key. If you're standing still you're wasting time
---
warrior for sure, you can do instances as dps or tank and leveling as rogue is really hard but kinda the only way to go since they're not that good in instances (dungeons)
---
First of all, yes we know that we might be a bit late at killing Deadmines, but we're proud anyways.
---
Today we tried Deadmines with a couple of underleveled friends. We don't know a lot about the game, so we just thought about going into it just for fun and trying it out. We kept on wiping and having to walk all the way back, when the dungeon just reset itself for some reason.
---
That's why we just quit the dungeon for a bit and level a bit more. So we did and we tried to go in as 6, which works apparently. This time we were able to clear it with a Rogue tank and 2 healers who kept on healing him. And we couldn't have done it without the inspirational speeches of our Priest.
---
This dungeon was a lot of fun for us, it took a lot of time, but without any good knowledge about the game we were still able to clear the dungeon and gear ourselves even more.
---
What do you mean?
---
Alright
---
Didn't he just layer hop for the last 2 levels? He was more than 2 levels ahead of the next group so even without it I doubt it would've taken him more than twice the time without layer hopping.
---
almost.. it's a reskin of ElvUI called RedTukzUI
---
He tried to delete his character right after he hit 60 but he had too much people sending him mail.
---
How many times can this joke be recycled
---
I downloaded the app and plan on using it to queue a few hours before I get home from work.  I‚Äôm not gonna run a hot key script to jump and run into a wall in an inn, but I think it‚Äôs reasonable around 2pm to tell my computer to start logging in so they maybe I can play by 7pm.
---
I totally agree really young my aunt and cousin played and I always dreamed to have an account of my own. Not just a character on theirs. Christmas I got mine! Iv never been able to get away
---
Are you guys RPing Warhammer dwarfs? Lol
---
Never played vanilla and I had nothing against murlocs, but after some time in classic i would gladly wipe out whole population.
---
They wanted us to keep buying xpacs
---
To op... these are mainly just for level 60 raid content but needed at that point pretty much.
---
Well that was part of the building of the hype of World of Warcraft. Back in 2004, asking for a $15/month subscription was a lot. Especially since a lot of people were still frequently using cash/check for a lot of transactions.
---
So the game wasn't an instant hit. Like it was popular enough, but it got more popular with time and more and more people got into it. So there was a constant influx of new players up through BC and Wrath.
---
Classic is different. There is a huge amount of players right now. People that are going to play it are probably just going to jump in really early. Sure you will still get people jumping in later, but not anywhere close to how many people play the first month.
---
Have a full group of friends playing DoS2 on the weekends for the past few months. We put in a good amount of time (like 6+ hours a weekend) and have yet to get out of Act1 yet. Sadly WoWClassic launched and we won't be returning to finish this adventure for a while... It was fun as hell though! Felt like DnD kids wrapped around our table again.
---
Never even saw a 1:13
---
I only know about the drama from reddit. If you watched the stream when he got 60 it was just inspirational and awesome. Didn't even know who method was until I saw it here.
---
Idk, some streamer I guess.
---
I imagine it sounds like randy marsh but with a higher pitch
---
Sounds like Method should get on his level
---
It's the same way as retail
---
Yep that is why I added the bit about a dangerous murloc somewhere in the mine :)
---
Everything that‚Äôs inside the mail.
---
Thank you, added
---
shit happens man. haven‚Äôt died that many times, just makes me more aware of my surroundings &gt;w&lt;
---
pacific standard time.
---
&gt;People literally just invite me to groups without asking. I'll be killing mobs next to them and they'll just assume that I want to group up for a quest. Do I even know you? How do I know you're not just trying to pad your logs with my Battle Shout? Everyone is so lazy and wants to just be your friend so they make quests easier, people should really stop assuming they're on my level.
---
I know this is a joke post and all, but I gotta be honest, I wish people would ask before inviting. I don't mind grouping up sometimes, but please don't assume I'm actually doing this thing.
---
I'll help people kill stuff, I'll through buffs up. But if I want a group, I will (and do) say.
---
Yeh the method announcer.  I edited my post to show what the drama is, I could have just deleted it. Or left things ambiguous so  what‚Äôs your point?  At least now other people can see what happened.
---
No problem
---
I told them it was an upgrade and that I would 100% wear it. However he called me an idiot. Said he played WoW for 13 years and it's always been like this even though I heard it the first time now.
---
I seriously don't get it since if I wear it, I can't sell it anyway. I guess some people prefer making more money than let other people have better gear
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but it looks like a drinking bird that's failing to press a spacebar.
---
Epl is fast as shit
---
Thanks bud! I like the name for the site
---
I'll be your friend.
---
But that just might prove the theory wrong.
---
He said laughing nervously. üò≠üòÖ
---
People get screwed by the assholes running scripts to prevent the afk boot.  I think jumping in queue early is reasonable.  It‚Äôs either that or flip your sleep schedule so you sleep as soon as you get home and wake up at 3am everyday to play a little.  That sounds awful.
---
Our hero
---
Very good point. I kind of forgot about OSRS. I apologize for not mentioning it in the OP.   
---
Although Classic WoW has got a lot more coverage than OSRS from what I've seen so far &gt;.&lt;
---
Why not try playing on a different server????
---
I know it's a crazy thought but at least you could play the game omegalul
---
Agree, abit late to the party.
---
And wtf is that to celebrate when the game is older then most players on it.

---
Instead of sacrificing realism for convenience, Classic sacrifices convenience for realism.  Is it convenient or fair that Hunters need to buy ammo when no other class does?  No, but Hunters use ammo.  It's the little idiosyncrasies like that that help make the game immersive.
---
I think given the 24 hour notice, the 2 new PVP servers will be a good start for those rerolling or new players.

Mein Kampf is premised around anti-semitism. Not sure how to help you here.

Dude I got three hours sleep and I‚Äôm currently in the middle of my 12 hour shift... I want to die
---
I agree. I‚Äôve never understood how people enjoy watching other people play video games. To each their own I guess.
---
Don't think I've touched shadowbolt since I've learned CoA. Sent pet to attack -&gt; immolate-&gt; corruption-&gt; CoA -&gt;wand. If going to pull more, wait for it to use the threat ability twice before switching. First mob should die right about as it switches aggro to you. Works like a charm for mr easily pull 3 mobs my level at same time.

He attempted to, but apparently was unable because people spammed him with mail and you can‚Äôt delete a character with mail in the mailbox.

---
Yeah. I really don't understand why people are working so hard to say it was negligible. Maybe it is, or isn't. I'm not qualified to assess that because I never played classic until two days ago.
---
But an advantage is an advantage. And when you're reaching the upper levels of performance in any sort of race, minutes count. And here people are talking about a differences of *hours* and saying it's basically the same.
---
It's comparable to saying a given steroid only makes a difference of a few percentage points. That doesn't really matter. Steroids aren't supposed to be in sports, and phasing isn't supposed to be in classic. Phasing makes it *categorically distinct* from classic and isn't some nebulous advantage - you could directly compute the differences in XP gain from faster mob spawns.
---
Getting snoo was how I got into this whole mess!
---
Oh yea, some kid hit 60. Shared the account with his brother or didn't. Something about a guild. I don't know. Been scrolling through reddit at work and you kinda pick these things up even if you don't want to. :)
---
Then he hosted Method LMAO üòÇüòÇ
---
works with guild chat too, i was trying to get a mob that was camped, and typed "inv" in guild chat and switched layers, then the mob was right infront of me.
---
3s?!
---
It isn‚Äôt
---
Google chrome Remote Desktop viewer
---
Yeah bro he's the slappiest boi
---
That's good to hear. Hope that kid is doing well.
---
How does this have anything to do with retail?
---
b/c he cheesed and he's a scummy corner cutter...
---
dude's been kicked out of wow for forever and even kicked off of private servers... he's a scumbag
---
Yeah, no real achievement imo
---
I've never played wow before so I'm not really sure what I want but something fun that's decent to level and can be helpful in dungeons. Ideally it'd work for all content.
---
Also he most likely needed to use it or people would've fucked him up to make him not get this record even tho he would've gotten it anyway.
---
Who pooped their pants
---
I guess I can't just make it with my mage and send ot to my priest?

That's a paddlin.

Bigger chance of critting with your wand!
---
I did mess with vorpx with reconstructed geometry in f1 2019 and was terrible.
---
A gnome
---
Your sentence doesn't even make sense.
---
Wait so why is joking about pizza okay but joking about a bald gnome not? 
---
Are you bald irl and salty af? LoL
---
from day one i thought method had no chance, i hoped they wouldnt get it because its always nicer to see individuals get world first, not some organization.
---
They all violated the TOS and abused game mechanics. This was done by having macros keep them moving in-game, even though they were asleep, thus allowing them to bypass queues. Meanwhile, using layering to your advantage is not a violation of the TOS and thus not "abusing" anything.
---
I think queueing while at work is fine because they are in line waiting. Remoting in and being in game is taking a playable slot, but not playing. I dunno, to me it's the difference of being able to play vs not.
---
No one is bringing a hunter for their high dps anyway. They are only invited for tranq shots in an optimal setup. So just dont be a huntard, manage your pet well, know how to communicate a tranq shot rotation, and your tauren will do just fine in raids
---
I've been playing for 6 hours /played and I'm only level 10...
---
The party leader can't change loot rules in dungeon finder groups.

---
Because I have friends that I‚Äôve played with for 14 years that took off work to play and are already lvl 30+. Kinda hard to convince everyone to migrate when they‚Äôve invested days into their characters. I know it‚Äôs a crazy thought to have friends with that condescending attitude omegalulz.
---
How many fkn times you gonna send me to other side of the map tho, these gnome legs...
---
I believed this for the longest time when I played vanilla.  Was a nice ritual though :)
---
Method is the one that spread the bullshit that he was cheating because they be salty. They claimed his brother was playing his account while he slept, the guy doesn't even have a brother.
---
Just google it bro, knowledge is power.
---
Uhum, I did this 15 year before him .
---
I've added their group, thank you very much
---
and that's the way to play in my opinion. I don't really understand people who race like this, finding exploits in mechanics or without. We've cried for years for blizzard to give us a wow with good gameplay and immersive world and then you ruin it on a speed run? nah, no thanks. I'll take my time farming mats, leveling professions, reading quests, helping others, some world pvp etc.  But to each it's own I guess.
---
Absolutely not true about the mage. Mage is about kiting your opponents as you wear them down. They have a very strong toolkit and if you are a good mage, the only classes you will struggle with in 1v1 is warlocks and Shadowpriests.
---
That's bullshit though, it doesn't make it any more ethically sound. You're not hurting blizz by doing these things, you're hurting the community. It's the same argument people make for profiteering; I didn't make the market for sex slaves-- someone is going to be making a killing, why not me? Ethically bullshit.
---
Stop clout chasing
---
Yeah, they‚Äôre fuckin annoying.
---
Agreed. Makes me think the right recipe for an MMO is just to have you pick a new character when a new expansion comes out so your guy doesn't get too strong.
---
I was on board with WoW up until MoP. Like the journey from nobody to Elite Soldier was great. You could still argue that when you killed Deathwing, you were just part of a group of very Elite Soldiers. 
---
But MoP is when they started the shit where you were just part of the group of main characters. And then WoD took it to another level where you became best buds with Khadgar.
---
I've got friends that arent gamers playing it and they are loving it! 
---
It's become mainstream, when I played in school I didnt tell a soul!
---
This is a WoW subreddit lol what are you even saying
---
iirc ToS states the only person you can share with is a minor in your family, such as a younger sibling or your child (under 12).
---
i did rep grinds on priavet servers, and now im on Classic WoW and I can tell you this with absolute certainty:    CLASSIC WOW REPUTATION GAIN IS HALF AS MUCH AS PRIVATE SERVERS.     and thats because private server rep gain was based on the values at tbc release which had been doubled
---
Wasn't World First like 16 years ago?  Not really a first when the game was already released and he could practice until the official release.  Being the actual world first was an achievement, this was just a guy going around his carefully planned and researched route on data that had been available the last near 2 decades.
---
literally any private server that wasn't about X level pvp had normal leveling.
---
It's safe for work...Almost!
---

---
I suppose with unlimited supplies I'd agree with your list though.
---
Coke (atleast good coke) is expensive yeh, but you're more likely to fuck your life up quicker being addicted to good coke than ket, imho.
---
Hey just to let you know I backed out of the queue and went back in and it‚Äôs going down rather than up now. This shit probably cost me an hour+ lol
---
Also have lots of friends scattered across different servers due to the queue times and some of us would like to eventually end up with our mains on the same server
---
I am sweating (and pooping a little) at the thought of the 10s to train one weapon type other than what I started with....
---
I'm going alliance on grob, horde on DD.

I think. Still haven't decided on a main hahahahahahahaha
---
Totally. All those people competing for speedrun records in the old Mario games are just wasting their time. World first was 30 years ago!

But my absolute favorites are the mage quests in Theramore with Tabitha, and benediction.

---
Nah.
---
Goddamn... that new Tauren model are ugly in the bad way and are trying to be cute. Their design doesn't have the spirit of Warcraft at all. Did Metzen had a say in this? I can't imagine. They look more Disney-esque than anything. I have missed nothing after WotLK (or whenever the model revamp was). They were so on the right track with the revamp of Sylvanas and Varimathras. Those are cool models worthy of the revamp.
---
 ï ·µî·¥•·µî î ‚î≥‚îÅ‚î≥
---
It's also the only polearm in classic with Armor on it.  It's a confusing piece.  Who was this meant for? Paladin and Warrior tanks who need 1H and shield for tanking?
---
Ah if her pet dies she needs to call it with the whistle FIRST then Rez the corpse. I thought my pets kept running away but I was wrong. Otherwise just feed it and keep happiness smile level (near pet bar at top) at green.
---
He surly is better than asmongold
---
Something about the old tauren face looks cooler to me. Idk. You look like an actual BEAST. On the right you moo. Still think both of them are overall dope.
---
Shucks, that was my fear. Thanks for the reply.
---
Only real issue with flying mounts is that they pull you out of the game.  If Blizzard had built the game to include flying as part of the world (rather than just a way to ignore it) flying would have been awesome.
---
I suspect they tried it, and just couldn't get it to play comfortably.
---
I can relate to this
---
There's a lot of things in classic that weren't in vanilla. We can't nit pick.
---
You can use remote desktop to stay logged in. It is related. It‚Äôs a compounding issue, the longer the queues the more people will do anything to never get disconnected.
---
By the time most people catch on queue times will be a thing of the past.
---
wtf? you can not be serious?
---
i lold üòÇ
---
Yeah, adding in gear changes the story.
---
And gals. We dirty for the bags too.
---
I'd suggest seeing a bit of awesome games done quick on YouTube :)
---
Then you missed my point? I wasn't trying to diminish his achievment, my entire point was that he WAS a nobody before this. Getting some records on private servers? majority don't give a shit. Now he IS somebody because he was world first on classic. reading comprehension will help you in the future.
---
Pretty sure u can with a console command, or an addon if u prefer
---
this.Also that means AH prices will keep getting dumped down over and over. Layering gonna reduce demand
---
Least prep might be hunters, as you can just buy vendor ammo. I don't remember if rogues needed to come with poisons but they might also be pretty prep light.
---
Good luck my friend.
---
For dungeons, it's more than fine. They are great for that, even.
---
The issue is their mana on long raid fights. They still work well as off-tanks and are good at generating AoE threat, though.
---
I only know him as eamor. And his fancy helmet
---
Well, this is the only polearm in Classic with armor. So at least Druids do t have to stare too long at it longingly.
---
Sorry forgot to add that if you like the idea of a dark priest alchemist then go herbalism and alchemy. Alchemy is useful at all levels of the game. One of the strongest profession combos.
---
Oh yeh they‚Äôre all medium to high most of the time, but the queues are non-existent or minimal.
---
Gratz on the lvl up
---
I'm doing the same but with bacon grilled cheese instead of almonds. :)
---
Someone should inform him he has a brother. He may have questions for his parents
---
Doesnt matter, he loses aggro at 70% mob health if I've done anything beside coa and corruption.  I'll just let him tank one mob while I tank another.

You should all check out Pantheon when it releases

u still make others wait longer that would be legitimately able to play right now

Report me it won‚Äôt get me banned haha. Nothing about that is bannable you are just dumb
---
My theory has been people just too focused on leveling first couple days. I know a couple of my friends were all eager and Gung hoe to get 60 because they forgot just how much of a grind it is.
---
"I popped out four kids and still played games."

Is that an auto attack bar for a priest? Lol why?
---
Stop being purposely dense.
---
Invincible is dope. I can't pick until my 5th listen tho!
---
It‚Äôs definitely fair game
---
Beep bep
---
For 5-man, I'd argue that it's not even harder - Paladins are great at tanking dungeons.
---
For raids, yeah, it's harder, they have real mana issues. Still, it's probably not nearly as big of a deal as people make it out to be.
---
Krol Blades and Glowing Brightwoods. Mmmmm
---
Do you think there is a way to keep the classic design of the taurens and polish them into more contemporary resolution?
---
Starting arms isn't really worth is since you dont even have stances to really dance into. 
---
Start fury, the crit is big and piercing howl is a game changer.
---
Respec for 1g to arm's when sweeping strikes comes online and double your grind speed.
---
Have them on secondary bars, I use shift+1,2,3 to pan through abilities :0
---
Maybe it‚Äôs not a retail or classic issue. It‚Äôs people on the internet being dickheads.
---
Don‚Äôt be ignorant and spin it so that any bad encounter with another person is somehow related to retail.
---
Ah yes... this and also when our guild enchanter disenchanted a blue boe that was worth 5+ hold on AH. Good stuff!
---
There is a shortcut to menethil to save you that long ass run through wetlands.  Search YouTube for ironforge to menethil shortcut should find a video on it.   Or just do the run.
---
Maybe just read The Boys comic?  It ran for 72 issues and only stopped because they completed the story they were telling.
---
You forgot cookie üò≠
---
It can be a pain, but I'm wearing mostly what I've made for myself and would otherwise still be wearing white or even grey items from random drops, and maybe a few greens from quests.
---
Some of the best pre-raid end-game/lvl 60 gear can be made with it, and if I remember correctly, some of the resistance gear needed for certain raids is also made using BS
---
I just tamed Echeyakee with my Night Elf! She's gorgeous.
---
Yeah, sorry, but you just see what you want to see. This is nothing new and has nothing to do with retail - some people are just assholes and there were just as many of them in vanilla.
---
Also make sure she's done the "Training the Beast" quest. Back on my first hunter I was so excited to get my first pet that I missed doing the second part completely. Without that quest she'll be unable to feed her pet in the first place.
---
I think around 40 or so it surpasses wand DPS
---
I'm not condoning a behaviour that allows you to stay connected, afk, 24/7.
---
If I was botting-afk, I wouldn't feel the need to shorten the queue. if you can't tell the difference, that's your problem.
---
I think they might be waiting to make sure he didn‚Äôt account share, just in case he did. 
---
To clarify, I‚Äôm quite sure he didn‚Äôt, and I‚Äôm sure blizzard thinks the same, but it‚Äôs better to double check than to accidentally congratulate a cheater
---
Realm discord should never be a thing, The people on it are the ones who whine about LFG addon then forces people to use a LFG discord instead.
---
A new what? Family?
---
fa real?
---
I went from 4,795 to 6,605 in 2+ hours pls explain Blizzard
---
No, the pets did  not get normalized until 1.9.
---
What???
---
So do you consider these players using his stream to find him and come and try to kill him cheaters or not? 
---
Besides, if you want to blame anyone, blame the players who went into zones way higher than their own level for the SOLE purpose of wasting this guys time. The fact he did 1-58 legit and only started this when he started getting ganked makes me think he probably would have played legit all the way through if players didn‚Äôt go out of their way to ruin it for him. 
---
It‚Äôs not only on Jokerd for doing this. It‚Äôs on blizzard for not restricting this and those players who went out of their way to harass him that pushed him to this point. Either way, nothing you can do.
---
He could have leveled in a Normal server then. That's the risk of leveling on a PVP server and livestreaming it. He doesn't get a free pass because he might die and it will cost him time.
---
Got hyped af for a gray upgrade yesterday, then shortly later just as hyped for my first green loot. Even random drops that aren't monster items, like recipes, are exciting just because of how rare they are everything feels earned bc of how easy it is to die from mobs or how much i have to stop to eat/drink between pulls.
---
I don‚Äôt get to play much at the moment due to the que‚Äôs.  I mostly que my husband in early so he can play when he gets home.  I finally got to play a whole hour today before I had to pick my daughter up from school lol.  
---
My husband was huge into wow when we first started dating in  2007.  He gave me one of his accounts so I could play with him.  Took a break after Worlk cause it just wasn‚Äôt the same.  But we were bother super excited about classic.
---
It's as simple as cutting and pasting files.
---
DUDE ANOTHER MEME AWESOME
---
Wrath, added in patch 3.2.0.10192
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
I downloaded it and it gave me a password to log in... went to work and left the program running to do this and when I tried to login at work it said password invalid.   I‚Äôm guessing that the password refreshes or something?  Is there a way to set the password and keep it the same (like an email) so you don‚Äôt have to worry about it changing?
---
Omg this is the worst meme i think i have ever seen.  Format, cropping, subject material...this DESERVES TO BE SEEN.  Upvoted!
---
SOE are retarded though, nothing short of competition with WoW would have been "acceptable". They shot themselves in the foot to try and clone WoW
---
He‚Äôs probably still sleeping lol
---
No no, we'll make new friends starting from now, all of us sharing the nostalgia experience.
---
Its not like people are going to reach 225 enchanting before 40 anyway :)
---
It's not shady it's strategy
---
send **n**udes?
---
Hmm your life or not breaking probation? Wonder which you should choose.
---
It‚Äôs not against the tos at all though.
---
No your post just sucks ass
---
Ah, yeah we haven't lost any original guys/gals yet at all.
---
It's just a meme chill. Everyone who plays wow knows how good method is

Never played classic but I'm drawn to druids in games where they are available. I'd like to be a healer but am unsure if it would be better to go priest since I intend to dive fully into raids and WPvP
---
Nixxiom attacking Westfall with 100-200 Horde, full raid group not able to participate due to layering
---
and spontaneous
---
You are autistic
---
Exactly what I did too.
---
hi thats really cool i also died to spiders and bears but I kept grinding and im also tired now so im going to take a 2 hour nap.
---
/sleep
---
;]
---
If it has good armor and block, yes it is a warrior (tank) shield. It makes a way bigger difference for a tank to have that, than a shaman to have a bit more mana/regen. Stats are super confusing and not all-telling in Classic.
---
At this point in the game when everyone is in the low level areas, nothing should be hard. You're supposed to group up like the other commenter said. Seriously just invite the people who are doing the same quests as you. You'll get done done faster and you'll stand a chance.
---
Turning quests alone from 1 to 13 takes more than 2 hours. Walking to different areas with different lvl mobs too....starting out with a single white item...who the fuck is hitting 13 in 1.5to 2 hours? And how???
---
It's missing YOUR point of classic. Stop projecting your understanding of enjoyment on to other people.
---
Idk about that but I have Omni cc which just makes them spin down like retail
---
This exactly. MMOs as a whole were niche until WoW. If they had stuck to what made SWG great they could have definitely gained subscribers as MMOs became more mainstream.
---
Proof?
---
I found an old WoW time card in the closet. The husband has been asking why I have been replying to his texts so late... he knows a new Blizzard game came out, so he is starting to put two and two together.
---
Day 1 title was "Classic Race to World First Presented by WSOE &amp; Method - Day 1". I've watched on an off and at on point did I see a "world first 60" in title, nor in the graphics in the stream, and they kept telling chat again and again that they weren't just racing to 60.
---
I don't know why there's so much shit flung at Method, but half the thing in this comment sections are just bullshit.
---
wElL rOlL oN a DiFfErEnT sErVeR tHeN!!!
---
Can't you just more comfortably farm greens when you're higher level?
---
Yeah... :/
---
I can agree with that, it's not remote desktop, you can't stay afk, well you can, you'll get dced.
---
In that case, should'nt blizzard punish these afkers rather than those who DO the queue and disconnect after playing ? You know, like me.
---
I've solo'd dungeons for my level in retail before, with certain tank classes. It requires 0 effort or thought and is a mind numbing grind for 70 hours before you reach max.
---
Pets are not normalized.
---
That makes this whole thing much less interesting/exciting.
---
is your blizzard app up to date?
---
Diablo 3 was really weird. Why should a weapon directly effect spell damage? Its not like om magically throwing it.
---
Friends who wanted to match
---
Walk the beach at night is so nice, was my favourite part of visiting the carribean
---
I hope my bag comes with stuff
---
I worded that poorly. I was saying if he went to alt draenor it'd be genocide version. He could go to Outland.
---
I‚Äôll give that a go, thank you.
---
Definetly tailor, you can craft awesome stuff from there. And some gathering to make money
---
It's about the journey. The feeling of making it. There's no cache of loot waiting for me next week. And I'm ok with that.
---
well i was pretty sure where u are coming from with the first statement but u pretty much confirmed it now "what i do is fine, but what others do to deal with this situation isnt" to make yourself feel better about it lol.
---
its fine but and thx for your input but telling me im wrong isnt going to change you cheating the system and i dont blame you either
---
They said it was only a beta thing.
---
Or stream snipers
---
Give it a few hours. Also make sure you bnet app is up to date.
---
P.S welcome to Azeroth:)
---
"PepeLaugh
---
He doesn't know"
---
is a popular meme
---
Gonna need some facts to back up this claim.
---
Tbf they said Rag and then a dueling tourny from the start. WF 60 was just also apart of the race.
---
Paladins are awesome if you want to buff people and get all the buffs while levelling (at least in my experience). I buff people in towns who come along (also hunters, warriors and locks) and you will get a buff back a lot of the time so lvling is less scary
---
This is not normal at this level. I'm level 27 on my warrior ATM and unless I fight something too high, I go probably four to five fights on average before needing a heal. But I am being careful not to rush ahead so I end up with only quests a level or two above me 
---
My advice to OP is, you've probably done too well getting quest completes done with minimum kills. Find something in your area easy to kill, pop on some music and put in a level with a grind only. At level six it'll be quick. Get in the practice of killing things which are in between you and your goal. Once you have your pet this will be super easy for you, and one of the main reasons hunters level so quickly. It adds up. 
---
If you do this as a practice you should easily minimise the amount of times you're left with only quests you feel are too high for you.
---
retard
---
May you find peace and strength through this difficult time.
---
Oooooh, ok.
---
at least this trash post wasn't another meme
---
hahaha :P
---
Then they will simply have to learn.
---
:3
---
I believe t is up to date, so I‚Äôll just wait!
---
P.S thanks :)
---
Mind sharing that spreadsheet friend ;)
---
are you guys actually on a local area network, or just playing wow together in the same room?
---
Well there has been some tweaks (for example, we have the modern mail system and not the awful garbage of the day, also global AH instead of individual cities), so the tweet isn't inherently wrong and i doubt he wouldn't enjoy the game in the end
---
Try free to play retail. It‚Äôs pretty close to classic in many ways.
---
Im sure he's purposely leaving out  that 1 to 13 in 1.5 hours likely means 5 man party speed cleaving
---
Good shit. I main ret on retail and spam Wisdom on people to let them know when they're stupid.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt think you actually know what you‚Äôre talking about.  
---
If you think there‚Äôs not a fleet of developers working on this you‚Äôre in for a wake-up.
---
Mankrik! you?
---
I'm usually not big on the "retail bad classic good" but I got a big laugh out of this one.
---
Just imagine all the WQs and LFRs he missed out on.
---
Thank you! :D
---
Lupos is nerfed. Attack speeds are not. The only pets better than a regular cat (1.3 speed) are Rake (1.2 speed) and Broken Tooth (1.0 speed)
---
Priests represent! Can‚Äôt wait to heal as holy for some raids
---
‚ÄúPlayer of the game‚Äù as far as I know
---
I have yet to play so don't know if all this blacklist stuff is truly a big deal or if people are exaggerating, but that type of zealotry wasn't present back in my day in Vanilla.
---
Undercutting is fine. Undercutting costs the undercutter time, so it's a fair exchange. If you want to beat aggressive undercutters, then just get a good reputation so people are more likely to buy from you even if it costs a few copper more. It's the same way it works in the AFK world.
---
And drama over that staff? Really? If a Lock or Mage won it over a Priest, then I can imagine, but the stats on that staff doesn't really make a lot of difference on a Lock or Mage.
---
I'm glad that I read mostly positive things from people here about their experience in Classic.
---
5D Checkers
---
mmmhm
---
&gt;yea we claimed but haha we weren't serious of course :D
---
I always think it's funny when I get a 30 minute buff in exchange for a 5 minute buff they probably won't even get to use by the time they start combat.
---
Is that a genuine question?  
---
You're on the internet, more specifically reddit, more specifically a subreddit about WoW.  
---
These are phrases uttered on a daily basis around here, and it's not meant out of genuine hatred. If your skin isn't thick enough to handle reading minor insults like that, that weren't even directed at you... Maybe this isn't the right pastime for you? There be real monsters lurking here that will frighten you much more than this.  
---
Maybe picking flowers, or coloring books is more suited to your talents?
---
"Someone doesn't value the things I value, they must be stupid!"  Who's being dense again?
