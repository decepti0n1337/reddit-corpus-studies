Obviously nobody knows the actual answer to this right now, but it's been fun reading and hearing other people's thoughts on the subject. I loved BC and Wrath so I wouldn't mind playing through those expansions again, but we do run into a bit of a problem with staying on the same path...and that is ending up where we started. To 'fix' this they could easily just stay at Wrath! Or they could branch off from Wrath with new expansions! Or they could just branch off from Classic and maybe save themselves the trouble...? 
---

---
I dunno, man. I think I'd be cool with anything they did, just 'cause it's not like me being uncool with it would keep it from springing to existence.
---
But it really depends on who writes the stuff, y'know? I don't want some half-baked shit writing like we have been getting the last however-many expansions. :( If Classic+ was something like that, I'd rather just rot in Classic forever at level 60.

I would compare the going price of certain items in the auction house then vs now. Take the average inflation rate.
---
You won’t have a problem
---
But I am curious now!
---
It is really great! I love SL builds, such a versatile gameplay
---
What discussion? It's just a picture.
---
I dont like the last part, Dungeon finder is amazing.
---
my ENTIRE personality is based off of this web series.
---
PaNcAk
---
I was about to ask about summoning stones. Now I feel even more validated about leveling Warlock.
---
Unless everyone is doing that...
---
I've thought about it, but my twink stuff and my guild bank full of goodies would be all I cared about. The gold i had would be pennies now.
---
I've got my ZG tiger still, so I can sit in town on it, but even that is worth less now. I guess you can buy it through some p2w auction house.
---
So that does not seem optimal at all ! It is +15% shadow damages, when a living Succubus is +10% all damages + its own buffed damages.
---
You call them streamed hams despite the fact they are obviously grilled?
---
Lots of warriors. Lots of rogues. Plenty of huntards. There will be a good amount of pallies at release but half will be gone when they reach 60 and realize nobody wants their dps or tanking "prowesses."
---
Not that many warlocks, acceptable quantity of mages. Not that many priests, acceptable quantity of druids, but not that much.
---
I'm not saying that it should go down the same path as it did before. Like level increase or anything of the sort. Mainly the question was for content. Raids, dungeons, something.
---
These are fine for world bosses, but all buff should be removed when you enter an instance. 
---
But we can’t do that cuz of the #nochanges morons.
---
Thank you very much!
---
God damn vanilla is good.
---
It's about a 6 minute wait on Gurubashi when I log on at 6pm EDT when I get home, but it only about 2-3 minutes on Tuesdays when I get home later after Netball practice.   
---
  
---
Oh wait, no I don't know because the game hasn't launched yet - like everyone else on the planet.
---
These makes me Jones for wow like crazy
---
I'm honestly happy realm xfers are in. I'm so nervous I'm going to end up on a shitty server.
---
The height of my play was raiding in wotlk, but I hopped around to quite a few guilds and I can’t remember any names unfortunately.
---
A lot of the show is pretty well written. I love it. Gets shitty towards the end though
---
Yeah where most of them are viable in any number of combinations and you have the option to change them mid-raid.
---
While you certainly have lots of different build options in classic as well there are a number of "best" talents that you should pick unless you wish to intentionally gimp yourself.
---
So I would say there are more ways for you to fuck up your talents in classic, but less viable configurations than retail.
---
I just wanna grief people till they quit and corpse camp them till they find the game no longer enjoyable

\----------------
---
**Prologue; the origins**
---
Inspired by the heroic actions of [**Fuel Rats**](https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Fuel_Rats) group in [**Elite: Dangerous**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Dangerous), &lt;Goblin Rocket Fuel Rats&gt; exists with the sole purpose of helping others in World of Warcraft: Classic.
---
&gt;Well, what is **Fuel Rats** and what is **Elite: Dangerous**?
---
Elite Dangerous is a space-flight simulation game in which the player explores a realistic 1:1 scale open-world representation of the Milky Way galaxy (yes, literally 1:1 scale). Since the Milky Way is mind-bogglingly huge, it is not unusual for space explorers to get carried away and end up stranded somewhere in the void with no fuel. When this happens to you, your only way of getting back is if someone manages to find and reach you to transfer fuel.
---
This is where Fuel Rats come in. These are a group of volunteers who literally go above and beyond to help out their fellow players. There is no in-game system for this, mind you. So each and every member of this selfless organisation help out others through their own means. Their longest rescue mission consisted of five Fuel Rats members finding Commander "Deluvian", a stranded pilot who is 65,788 lightyears from Sol. [**The combined journey took 600 (actual) hours.**](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/02/18/elite-dangerous-rescue-mission-commander-deluvian/)
---
It would be an understatement to say how devoted these players are just to help out someone else.
---
Our goal is to provide a similar helpful environment in WoW: Classic. With the help of some [**Goblin Rocket Fuel**](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9061/goblin-rocket-fuel), anything is possible.
---
**Our guild ideology**
---
We have one goal; helping out any adventurers we come across. Some will come to us for help, but we should always be open to seeking out others who may be in need. Your level, equipment or the amount of wealth matters not. What matters is a healthy and friendly attitude. We do not have set roles for our members (PvE helper, PvP helper, crafter etc.) because we want you to be exemplary members of the Horde; no matter the activity. We only expect you to be kind to others, guild members and non-guildies alike.
---
As long as you wear the &lt;Goblin Rocket Fuel Rats&gt; guild tag, you should always remember that you are representing this guild with your actions. Treat others the way you'd want them to treat you; don't ninja loot, don't spam the chat, help out low level players in quests and dungeons, give them food and potions and buffs, and perhaps some 6-8 slotted bags etc.
---
**Guild Events; it's not just helping but also having fun!**
---
Helping out others is not the only reason for our existance; obviously we should be able to enjoy the game on our own as well.Such as;
---
* 5 man dungeon runs (leveling dungeons, max level dungeons)
---
* World PvP
---
* Molten Core / ZG / AQ20 / BWL / Onyxia runs should be doable with enough people. AQ40/Naxx is not on our scope.
---
* Attunement/key runs
---
* Some light Battlegrounds (when they are released)
---
* "Fuel Runs" where we go out to the wild and help random players
---
**Epilogue; closing thoughts**
---
A little background on myself; I've played WoW almost religiously starting from final stages of Vanilla all throughout Wotlk and beginning of MoP. I did almost everything aside from AQ40/Naxx and PvP ranking. Much like many returning players, this time around I'm too old/busy to have a similar playstyle. Instead I just want to kick back with some friends, and enjoy mainly the social aspect of WoW. I will most likely be tanking 5-mans and offering free food/portals/enchant services on a mage alt as well.
---
The reason I wanted to start this guild is to provide a friendly environment. If I can make one person happy, that's a good day for me. I'm also starting this guild on (Oceanic) PvP server so with some luck I can take revenge on that level 55 gnome rogue who is harrassing those poor level 30's.
---
Feel free to contact me on here via a PM, or on Discord. I feel like I'm a bit old for Discord, but that seems to be the #1 tool to gather players (and also a great upgrade to Ventrillo) so we have a bare-bones server as well.
---
Thanks for your time.
---
**Elite Dangerous**
---
Elite Dangerous is a space-flight simulation game developed and published by Frontier Developments. Piloting a spaceship, the player explores a realistic 1:1 scale open-world representation of the Milky Way galaxy, with the gameplay being open-ended. The game is the first in the series to attempt to feature massively multiplayer gameplay, with players' actions affecting the narrative story of the game's persistent universe, while also retaining single-player options. Elite Dangerous is the fourth game in the Elite video game series.

Assuming we get the 1.11 version of PvP gear (I wish we didn't but Blizzard said we do), the blue sets are pretty solid but not amazing. For the specs that use it, it's roughly on par with T1. For the classes whose T1 isn't suited for PvP, such as warrior, it's the best PvP gear available until quite a ways into vanilla, not counting the R13 set which most players don't even have the opportunity to try to get. For caster classes, any two pieces of blue PvP gear remains BiS for PvE probably until AQ40 thanks to the 2-piece spell power bonus. And of course, for classes like shadow priest, it's literally the only gear that exists for your spec, so you kinda have to get it.
---
"I DIDNT BUDGET FOR THAT EXTORTION HUT, CHEESEY BEARDS!"
---
Not very, they were two rows longer than vanilla, but it was the same principles. A set number of "working" configurations you had to choose between.
---
I can see where you're coming from, because I was lucky enough to be on a higher pop server where you could solo queue pretty regularly without issues, but xrealm BGs really helped low pop servers. Sure, R14 might have been harder, but waiting 1-2hrs for BGs and only being able to get into BGs during peak hours is pretty lame. And this guy says he almost never got to do AV? That's pretty lame.
---
This reminds me of a funny back and forth in our Discord channel during the Blizzcon demo.  
---
Me: Damn, I’m conflicted. They’re saying it’s coming out in Summer, but I’ve got my internship at Google during the summer and I don’t want to miss that.  
---
Almost everyone in the channel: Go for that internship, man. Chase your dream.
---
One dude: Not to sound, like, whatever, but I’d say skip the internship for WoW. Classic WoW is only coming out once, you know? That internship will always be there. WoW launch is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.  
---
Everyone in Discord: *Silent, all realizing WoW is literally coming out twice and is not in fact a once-in-a-lifetime thing, followed by everybody laughing spontaneously at the same time*  
---
Needless to say, I pushed back the internship. I’m not missing this. Still such a hilarious twist to the “its only coming out once” scenario.
---
To be honest, I would wait and see. You can save up a lot of mats and then start looking for specific opportunities. The ones I can see early on are 
---
- free action potions (engineers/blacksmith tryhards cannot make these without leveling an alt but definitely need them), 
---
and 
---
- greater magic wands (Every priest or warlock in existence knows this item is amazing but it requires journeyman enchanting, and is incredbly cheap to make: 40 copper worth of vendor mats and 3 magic essences, which are a 75-80% drop rate from disenchanting any low level green weapon.). It is worth about 50 silver to any smart level 13 priest on a fresh server who is not himself leveling enchanting for another reason). 
---
I would just look at the relevant items here as you level with your dual gathering professions, and then transition into a crafting profession once you have identified a consistent economic niche. It can be a real pain in the ass to actually find reasonably priced consumables, and the opportunity cost is not staggering to level an alchemist. It might be worth, while you are at it, making a couple dozen free action potions and slowly filling a market niche. and these things will not get cheaper as a server ages. Free action potions continue to be very useful to pvp of all levels and therefore, of all financial means.
---
But the easiest way to get in is to farm up the mats you would need (fishing, herbalism for alchemy, and enchanting alt for greater magic wand), and then if your auction house addon indicates a stable value of these things (the wands) or a gap in market supply (potions), you can make your move. There is not any money to be made in greater magic wands if 10 dedicated people are fighting over the market on your server.
---
Faction changes would be weird because of the pally/shaman issue. do you also let them change class or do you not let them faction change?  
---
Race and Realm changes i can definitely see happening. It's potentially a lot of money for Blizz to miss out on.
---
Fame is a fucking weird thing
---
Lock summoning happened for sure, but most people weren't lazy and got themselves to the dungeon
---
Duh
---
You make it sound like timers wont make a difference... but the hardcore guild on the server is always going to plow through content, and removing these buffs wont change that what so ever. 
---
Casual, semi casual, semi serious and the majority of serious raiding guilds are not going to be milking world buffs... so I fail to see how anything is going to be affected.  We knew of them back in vanilla, but it was usually the guild who started raiding the earliest post reset that got to really get to use some of them. 
---
Such an overreaction for such a small issue.  Keep in mind that casual guild players are not going to wait to turn in their head and do so very randomly.  
---
Your thoughts are based off of pserver experiences, not actual vanilla.
---
Because they had one of those BoP you couldn't disenchant or destroy
---
Lol I would pay to see him reeeeee
---
Best: Dreamwalker/Judgement
---
Worst: everything hunter
---
Yeah rogues will be everywhere. I’m probably wrong, I just don’t remember warriors being the most played class at all.
---
It's so funny that you're worried about calling other people toxic yet here you are, clearly, one of the most toxic people on the sub.
---
Yeah we don’t know what the realm pops will be, how many servers there will be or how many people will be playing at any given time. All we really know is that they’re using layering at the start so maybe there won’t be any queues until phase 2 but who knows.
---
I think it reads more like a gatekeeping guide, like "If you like x, vanilla doesn't have it so stay retail"... horses for courses though right.
---
All good, I would like that stuff for sure - just not on the main servers
---
Agreed.
---
And who is going to control random people from non hardcore guilds from very randomly turning in their heads?  No one frickin waited for the buff in most guilds... they just got their frickin reward and moved on.
---
This was not an issue in vanilla.  It is only an issue on private servers.
---
Uh just curious, do you know if they have any public logic / reasoning explaining the decisions that that page offers? 
---
The 6th tier Human Warrior BIS has the Shield of Condemnation, which is a +10 Int / Stam shield that has mp5 and healing done- I'm curious what the logic is for that. Just the bonus ~400 armor?
---
Bad queues when they remove layering.
---
 Elites are nearly impossible to solo  - most classes can solo a same level elite  
---
 You can toggle pvp on some servers, but on others it’s always on  - all servers have pvp flag toggling, pvp servers have contested zones that auto flag you
---
And what if some casual raider turns his in right as your serious raiding guild tries to get the buff?
---
That is why it was NOT a problem in vanilla.  Timers matter massively lol..
---
Even if it was a thing, I am not gonna summon 40 people..
---
Right, and dealing with "collect X of this item" quests with competition. The congestion on pservers even now can mean you're spending 30+ minutes just collecting flowers in the night elf starting zone...and that's if you straight up camp a spawn point. I can't imagine Classic launch will be less congested than that.
---
They have to have some kind of plan for new content in some way. Nostalgia will only last so long, and if they are dedicating this much time and effort into it, there must be something cooking.
---
29s were way more fun.
---
No one ever got all world buffs unless they were on a frickin dead server and they were the only guild raiding.  
---
Timers are going to shut down this concept completely, and it is why no one complained or cared about back in vanilla.  
---
More private server bull crap bleeding into this sub.
---
That's a hell of a goal. I think I'd be pretty burned out of raiding after killing KT for the 10th time on my first character let alone doing it another ~70+ times on alts.
---
Cool theory. 13 years of experience says otherwise.
---
Oh ok. I was just a scrub who played on a PvE server (didn’t reach 60 until BC)
---
I don't think achievements will be added, but we have not had official confirmation as far as I know.  
---
only the original wow collectors pets will transfer. no pets from future expansions
---
# [Horde, EU, PvE server] &lt;The Muffin Vendor&gt;
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Hello there!
---
“The Muffin Vendor” is recruiting people interested in playing Horde on a PvE server. We’re going to be making a guild for end game content, including PvE and PvP as well. That, of course, doesn’t mean we only want raiders and pvpers. Anyone interested in having some fun is welcome!
---
**Who are we?**
---
We’re a group of friends who have played Warcraft together after meeting about 7 years ago. We all played Vanilla at the start as I’m sure a lot of others have. We’ve got experienced raiders from all across the timeline of Warcraft, and we’re all avid fans of the Lore.
---
The guild itself has some background in vanilla as a raiding guild. So there is plenty of experience there as well!
---
**What we offer?**
---
First of all, we offer all you may need to make your levelling experience as fun and enjoyable as possible. From help with dungeons and group quests, to experienced players willing to introduce you to the game, to an active and bustling chat which will keep you engaged even through the dullest grind sessions.
---
Second, we offer a productive and organized environment to let you experience everything Vanilla’s endgame has to offer: dungeons, raids, battlegrounds and so on.
---
**What we are looking for?**
---
Right now, our core raid spots are covered, and we're seeking to expand our numbers - as well as potentially build a second raid to strengthen our progression. In particular, we're looking for **Holy Priests and Resto Shamans**, though other applications may be considered depending on their quality. Recruit prios may change from week to week so stay tuned!
---
**Rules &amp; requirements:**
---
* A patient, positive attitude. Vanilla content is less about your macros and more about your commitment. Respect your guildmates, listen to your officers, and we’ll go far!
---
* Consumables. We’re not going to be hardcore about flasks and such, but everyone can fish some sagefis/rum or get themselves a few potions/elixirs.
---
* English – or at least some basic understanding of it.
---
* Looting rules: We're planning to use a **DKP** system with **blind bidding** in order to avoid bid wars. **Loot Council** will be employed for **legendary items**. We believe this represents the fairest compromise between the needs of the guild and the needs of its members.
---
**Raiding schedule:**
---
We’re currently planning to have at least three weekly raids. Of course, these numbers depend on content and player/alt availability (such as in phase 1 when there’s only MC/Ony and people don’t have geared alts yet), but eventually we plan to have every major raid cleared at least once per week.
---
As far as times go, we're currently planning to raid from 8:30 to 11:30 CET. Earlier starting times may be considered for weekends, depending on players' turn-up.
---
**Where you can contact us:**
---
For anyone interested in joining, feel free to apply on our guild site:  [https://themuffinvendor.enjin.com/](https://themuffinvendor.enjin.com/)
---
As if a hardcore guild could ever secure the buffs consistently anyway... I remember always having some no name casual raider turning in their head close to our raid time post reset.. and it wasn't because they had just killed said bosses, but rather because they flat out did not turn in the quest the day/week of them clearing the content.  
---
World buffs are not a problem.  People can only abuse it on a dead server.
---
all good, just best to clarify :) there's a lot of misinformation around
---
I guess it depends on what kind of stuff they cook up. If it's engaging content, then I would absolutely support it...and I do support the \*concept\* of course...but the issue always boils down to writing. If it's gonna be trash, count me out.
---
World buffs are to be despised on private servers.  
---
World buffs on timers in vanilla did nothing... you had random casual raiders turning in their heads at random frickin times that threw everything off.  It was never abusable unless you played on a dead server.
---
And frankly.. if a group of people are stuck on a dead server, I say more power to them.. at least they can have some fun with the buffs in their ghost town.
---
Current trees are far more complex. Retail gives you choices like 1% crit versus 5% battle shout ap. This can be pretty easily mathed out you know how much dps 1% crit gives you know how much dps x AP gives. 
---
Compare that to say Inner Rage versus Sudden Death versus Wild Slash and the math is way more complex.
---
This comment makes me think I’m out of the loop.
---
1) Disarm prevention
---
2) Engineering
---
3) Free Action Potion (FAP lol) and a rage potion.
---
4) Horned Viking Helm/Gnomish Mind COntrol Cap
---
5) Spider Belt.
---
Even if it was it was a different time.
---
First to 60 this time around is gonna be either a mage or a hunter
---
This is probably the best way to look at it. Maybe also adjusting for IRL inflation as well.
---
damn u/aetheree rekt
---
I remember grinding for my Winterspring mount before work and it just felt so incredibly magical out there... I took so many screenshots...lol.
---
Yea, it is basically private server players vs people who actually played vanilla. 
---
World buffs were not abused on server with medium to high populations, because every random joe and their mother would turn in the quest at a random time, screwing over the hardcore guild(s) wanting to stack them.  It rarely ever worked, especially on the first couple days of the raiding week.
---
1G = 15,000G now
---
What if people rather wanna experience BC and Wrath and not Vanilla? Do you speak for those people too?
---
/r/classicwow: don't roll a warrior if you aren't willing to tank dungeons or a priest/shaman/druid/paladin if you aren't willing to heal dungeons
---
also /r/classicwow, apparently: we meant it, do nothing but dungeons all day every day, you don't need a dps spec and dps gear
---
Do you think rolling a troll for greater threat generation will be better than rolling an orc for better hit%? I'm a bit on the fence now between those 2 races.
---
Vastly more complex than what wow has currently for a talent system.
---
To rephrase.  
---
People will do this.   
---
Infographics like this one will make some non-zero amount of people not do it for questions that this infographic will answer, assuming that they had seen it on this subreddit before hand, or if it is linked elsewhere.   
---
This infographic is also helpful if someone doesn't want to type out a response, they can just link an image of it.
---
&gt;  the vast majority of people won't be in hard core guilds,
---
I dont think this is a realistic representation of classic.
---
Classic is going to come out, and the majority of players interested in playing it are doing it BECAUSE they feel it is more hardcore and intend to be hardcore themselves.
---
Otherwise they'd just be playing BFA.
---
Classic WoW is going to be rife with even more elitism than actual vanilla had, because everyone was fucking stupid back then, armed with little information, etc.
---
Everyone knows how the game works now. If you don't, you are objectively wrong -&gt; countless sites and calculators can tell you that you are wrong. This will be used against you constantly if you choose the objectively wrong spec just because it 'feels' good to you in a game that is more like a job than an actual game.
---
Well that will be your problem, another lock in the guild will do it, and if you don't wanna cooperate maybe you won't be invited
---
wow lost its RPG component way more than its MMO one, imo. M+, which is the only thing that's really fun for me anymore, is pretty much diablo.
---
See this guy gets it
---
He might just be stuck in this state, rather than triggering it again. People did everything they could to him and nothing fixed it. (MC, Polymorph, etc)
---
Yo that was a guild on ursin too, way back.
---
I'm late to the thread here. Just wanted to say nice post.
---
World PvP is not griefing, play on a PvE server please
---
*
---
/r/woosh
---
Yeah, I ran a guild of about 300 twinks. Most chose forest over the wranglers
---
Eh, I played the old one a lot, but at the end of the day it was always just a stale mate somewhere for hours on end.  
---
It isn't as glorious and epic as some people seem to think it was.  The rare moment where one push happens in 6-10 hours and the boss gets summoned?  YEa, that part was nice... but holy crap, what are the odds that you see it happen in that session?  
---
It was low.
---
Why is arms missing?
---
&gt; ya just showed up on time
---
How dare you expect basic consideration for everyone else's time from your players
---
That intro and song choice...peak 2005
---
You really like that little zergling huh?
---
Wasn't that wrath?  TBC still had objective fights and defense was still a fairly heavy role.  
---
In TBC, you couldn't just rush to the end and actually have a chance at winning unless you got in with most of your guildmates in an exploited premade with high end raid gear for that insane DPS boost.
---
I got called beaner, shit skinned, wetback, got death threats from white guys on Xbox live when I was 12. She’ll be fine.
---
Saying there are only 7 points so it's less complex is like saying counting to 1,000,000 is more complex that calculus because it uses more numbers. 
---
By almost every metric current talents are more complex. There are less "dead talents" that you can just easily discount. They shine in different situations so you have to keep changing them for maximum optimization. The math to determine which is better is harder to do. 
---
I honestly dont think I changed my talent build once during BC or WotLK I change my build on BFA twice a raid. 
---
There are multie different utility talents that you can change on the fly based on what utility talents other people have which adds more to the equation of what talent is better. 
---
Vanilla talents can largely be free handed by any semi decent player who know their class mechanics. Anyone who tells you they could 100% free hand the current talent (and azerite traits which are basically talents as well) without sizable theorycrafting is lying to you
---
... this
---
Mage can pretty much do it all.  Hunter isn’t a bad choice either.
---
TBC 1-70 wasn't far off the vanilla 1-60.  
---
It wasn't until wrath that leveling to max was cut in half.
---
I played a lot in vanilla. 
---
I got to 60 and to raiding a Shaman, a Priest, a Warlock and a Rogue.  
---
The shaman and priest I had no intention of healing on, and it was impossible for me to find a raid spot unless I was going to heal, which I did a couple of times (and didn't really like it then).  
---
I'm really wary of people saying things like "live your dreams!  you can raid as Ret/Boomkin/Enhancement!  You just need to find the Right Guild™ and show up on time and don't be antisocial and you'll be set!"  That just wasn't my experience, it doesn't seem to be the experience on private servers, and honestly there isn't much reason to do it.  
---
It wasn't completely unheard of to have a shadow priest or whatever meme spec.  When I joined a guild on my Warlock I was surprised to see a shadow priest in the raid (For shadow weaving).  To no one's surprise the priest's damage was terrible (but that's not exclusively why they were there).  
---
As far as progressing, I think people are overstating the ease of raids.  Maybe with the focus on world buffs it will be different.  But my experience was having a group of Rank 10 pvp players who were all competent and had cleared raids on other characters fail ZG because we were mostly in pvp specs.  
---
I just hate the idea that a lot of these people are selling.  That: 
---
1) you won't have that much trouble finding a guild long term as long as you show up and have your shit together; 
---
2) guilds who take meme specs will be much more chill and fun to raid with; and 
---
3) that raid content is so easy that it doesn't really matter how much damage/healing you do, so there isn't really any disadvantage to bringing  a meme spec.  
---
In my experience none of those were true, and particularly with the first point, it's all fine and well to say "just show up on time with consumables etc!" but how many people are going to be willing to show up on time multiple weeks in a row only to get passed over because either a) the raid was full or b) there was someone else who also showed up that wasn't a meme spec to fill the missing slot.  Joining a raid guild where you aren't reasonably ensured a slot in a raid is really demoralizing in my experience as well, which is something a lot of people gloss over. 
---
Given all of that, I think it's wrong to convince people they will have a successful "raiding career" as whatever meme spec they want to play.
---
I've played the druid class for over 2 years on private servers and I have played all specs you can think of. Start with skinning and engi when leveling. Take it easy with engi untill you hit 40 and get your mount, no need to go higher than 150-200 before that. Once you hit 60 you drop skin and go tailoring. But DON'T level as balance lol it's just stupid, go feral all the way to 60. Will save you time and gold. If you have more questions you can send inbox msg
---
Do you get dk for killing enemy faction players now?
---
Betting a lot less tauren, a lot more orc. More warriors. Less druids.
---
Retail feels like the opposite. Vanilla and BC felt far more casual friendly. In Retail it feels like you are constantly playing catch-up. While in Vanilla even if you took a several month break what you did acquire was still fairly relevant and there were still guilds doing older content. There are many that have gone into detail in a better fashion on this subject than me, but for a lot classic was far more casual friendly.
---
WoW as a whole has always been a very casual friendly game compared to others though. We wouldn't need these constant catch up mechanics though if we had only 1 raiding difficulty and power-creep constantly going through the roof.
---
&lt;Dyslexics Untie&gt;
---
Krol blade.
---
are we talking about casual content?  lol?  classic raid mechanics are very simple and require minimal effort by most of the raid also most of the dps rotations are very low skill ceiling.
---
Right? When I was like 11 or 12 I looooved this set, thought it was so cool. Now I think the helm just looks dumb and I only like T2.5 and T3. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
This guy gets it
---
There isn’t one.  They’re taking a wait and see approach which is smart. 
---
My hope is they move to TBC.  Would make sense as everything is already conceptually created, they would just have to bring it to life.
---
They don't- that's where you are wrong.
---
Only having the content that Vanilla had will be perfectly sufficient for those that plan on playing classic.
---
There are alts, gear to get - I think many underestimate how long its going to take your average player to clear naxx... if ever.
---
And if we are 3 or 4 years in - they can make fresh servers for people to roll on.
---
Other than undead the trolls are probably the most blood thirsty race in the horde.  Dont go into a troll controlled forest and expect to come out alive.  Orcs on the other hand were fairly peaceful until they were corrupted by the burning legion

&lt;Sapped Girls Can't Say No&gt;
---
This is insane. Pushing back an internship at a fortune 10 company assuming you have a decent chance of advancement is losing so much equity.
---
Talents generally change per spec. Mages have a lot of overlap, compared to some classes, generally talents are spec-specific.
---
no, but if you take over a quest hub, let's say southsore / tarren mills, and someone in your raid aggro the wrong NPC with an AoE... everybody get a DK.
---
are you going to risk it?
---
Yea.  60-70 alone actually took a lot of playtime.  
---
Wasn't until wrath where leveling was devalued completely.  In the time it took me to normally get a single lvl 60 (vanilla) or 70 (TBC) alt, I easily had obtained 4 lvl 80's. 
---
I remember getting a shaman and mage to 80 in about a combined 120 hours of play time in wrath.  Always felt kind of wrong, but eh, wrath had such a massive content drought.
---
For authenticity, if it is male, the name should be some variation of "Legolas"

I wouldn't call talent tree particularly complex, especially with templates all over the place

ROFLMAO this made me smile.

I'm all for a patch 1.14 that would add new content like this. But seeing this made me wonder how would the rest of the world link into it? What I mean is that in other zones there are often quests that send you to other zones. Given that this would be entirely new would you anticipate quest lines in zones like STV, the Hinterlands etc. sending players here? Furthermore, would you anticipate adding quests to capital cities sending players into Grim Batol much like some of the quests for places like WC and SFK?
---
Pets die in vanilla raiding... a lot, sadly.
---
The problem is people use the descriptor “complex” to mean more than just complex. An awful lot of the time when the word complex is used what is meant is “meaningfully complex” which is a different concept and harder to measure. While I agree that the classic talents are more complex than the retail one I’m not sure if they have more meaningful complexity.
---
Dafuq you talking about? World pvp was very much a big thing in vanilla
---
I have never in my life, seen a trailoer for a er for a game, read anything  anyone talk up a game about said game, had anyone hype a game up to me as this has hyped me up. I have never in my life been more proud to carry my shield as an Orc Warrior and defened my "downtrodden underdog brothers" until this moment!
---
Hell yeah, what do u mean?
---
The way I look at it, if you want to go full autismo and stack every buff possible before a raid then great, go for it.
---
I think most of us will probably play like we did back then, getting consumables with the occasional world buff for progression nights, otherwise not worrying too much about it. 
---
Spending hours to stack buffs just to clear farm content faster sounds completely retarded to me. You're wasting time that could be spend getting materials for progression nights/leveling alts/having fun in general.
---
I dont agree with OP at all that core game mechanics need to be changed to counter the behaviour of a VERY small minority of autists that want to push to the extremes. Just join a mature guild with skilled players. The game's old, enjoy it how you will.
---
Most valuable: Popped a Dwarven Hand Cannon while grinding timbermaw rep/runecloth in winterspring.
---
Bonus: I looted a Truesilver Champion off a mob while grinding in epl, and a few days later I found another Truesilver Champion off the same mobs.
---
I think it'll be quite the opposite. Because everyone already knows the game, they're going to think it's easy mode compared to mythic (which it is). All the hardcore players are going to have their guilds filled to 40 man min max teams and the rest of us will bring enjoying what made vanilla great: the social aspect and rpg elements. Once people can't keep up with perfection expected from cutting edge guilds or are too elitist to play nice with the casual crowd, they will go back to retail to do mythic raids.
---
It wasn't the hard core raid scene that brought classic to life; it was the people who were dedicated to the vision of vanilla and wanted the World back in WORLD of Warcraft. Many people will play suboptimal because they have fun with particular abilities, play styles, or fits their fantasy of what their character is. That's not wrong or stupid, just a different way of enjoying the game we all love. People can have fun without googling the best spec/ talent builds and min maxing world buffs. 
---
TLDR: There's more than one way to have fun
---
If I can't remember the person anymore, I'm willing to give them another chance.  Maybe they've learned since then.
---
Kill 1000 gnomes. As a gnome
---
Generally has a lot more stamina, somewhat less main stats, comparable crit, and then the T1 set bonuses are more suited to PvE while the PvP set bonuses are more suited to PvP.
---
Used to happen all the time.  Just depended on who had more numbers at the instance at the time.  I recall some epic fights there.
---
Do you keep your title after not playing? Makes sense to keep it rare but also kind of sucks after all the hours it’s going to take in classic.
---
What’s the point of this post
---
Brilliant!
---
&gt;I will be a dirty casual player this time around and I seriously don’t want to be left behind because people are plowing through content this time around.
---
Good luck. you will be behind days after release.
---
18 month before naxx is also way too slow for the hardcore.
---
However , judging by Everquest TLP server, you can expect blizz to fire up a new classic server every now and then... and you can hope you won't be left behind again..
---
I mean if there was ever a time where it’s a good thing to abuse a glitch it’s right now.
---
Succubus will die in the first aoe, maybe 2nd one.
---
Ratatat - Loud Pipes - This song brings back fond memories of flying over Nagrand in flight form back during BC. 
---
Literally used to listen to their entire discography while playing WoW in high school so that’s what I plan on listening to when Classic launches.
---
Oh the tears...I played both PVE and PVP servers.  It was funny hearing people bitch about becoming flagged while in MC/BWL.  It got to the point where a few of constantly showed up flagged...
---
Hahaha the only reason I watch classic beta xD
---
Love those guys so much xD
---
Bravely ran away away oh brave sir robin!
---
Yeah but what about W O R L D  F I R S T ?  
---
No I’m kidding. I actually have a friend that works at Google, and he’s been super helpful in me get this opportunity in the first place, and has helped me move my internship back a semester. The biggest reason is that there is another CS class I want to take during the summer before I feel confident enough to take the internship (I don’t want to go there and look like an idiot). That’s honestly the main reason I changed things. And as luck would have it, WoW is basically releasing in the fall anyway so there goes the dream of playing WoW all summer with only a single class to worry about 🙃
---
[My buffs during our first kill of loatheb back in vanilla.](https://i.imgur.com/K1SGRJb.jpg)
---
There’s one in Winterspring too I seem to recall... and in Tanaris.
---
I think Lawbringer isn't too bad if you don't wear the Helmet and Shoulders.
---
I think it's more people loved SM, then the devs seen that so copied it a lot in BC, and then people got sick of it.
---
I played vanilla casually back then.  
---
I hated the leveling process, but I wanted to reach the goal.  I made it to the goal, very nearly quitting, and I realized that the end game was far superior to the journey... at least for me. 
---
Your opinion is not fact.  I loved vanilla and TBC despite long leveling times.  Yet, I HATED leveling as I do in any game I play.  
---
Just as you seem to be annoyed at people talking about optimal ways to rush leveling, I too get annoyed at seeing the daily post from people like you making it sound like leveling quickly means we are all missing out on something.  
---
My point?  You are making the same type of post that you are are trying to counteract (perhaps even complain about), just on the other side of the coin.
---
Honestly no. I would think it’s a mistake and a warrior should be taking Face of Death off Saph (21stam, 3500 armor, and increases to block chance and value). Maybe this was a mistake and they put the prog pally shield on prot warrior?
---
Looking at the credits, it says it’s based off Pingaan’s sheets, just like OP’s  (/u/aetheree) sheet. He might want to check his sheet as well, just in case.
---
There's been a group of three troll rogues in the classic beta running around targeting alliance. They all have the same gear and are named Meooga, Mebooga, and Mechooga. They're collectively known as the Ooga gang.
---
Get every character to max level and full raid geared and all Highwarlord
---
Lol relax this is a relevant topic
---
Woah, think I noticed the same thing! My hunter has mostly dragonstalker set but for some reason gloves reverted to giant stalker, cannot 100% recall whetherI had the T2 gloves though, but I think you might be right.
---
Hell yeah lol
---
And those are the consequences of having too many combo options!!
---
I actually wrote an addon for my priest that would complain for me, because I was usually too busy healing to do it myself.  "I am under attack by %s.  Heals may be delayed" or "I am stunned; heals may resume in %d sec(s)."  That kind of thing.  I might resurrect it if I can't find something like it now.
---
Exactly lol... most people coming to classic likely played vanilla or TBC to some degree.  
---
I already experienced the dang leveling hell once... anything I can do to succeed faster will make it all the more satisfying to me, and no amount of posts condemning my personal preference is going to change that absolute fact.
---
What you said will be good enough, lots of people bg in quest items and dungeon blues.
---
Varies from class to class. PvP gear is insanely good for casters because caster T1 and T2 is pretty awful, and it's obviously also good for warriors and hybrid DPS specs whose tier sets aren't suited for PvP. For rogues and hunters, the tier sets are solid and probably better than the R10 set.
---
People leveling fight each other for control of quests mobs all the time and people farming fight for control of nodes
---
Specially if you are a famous streamer, account sharing is a bad idea.
---
They won't risk a ban for it.
---
I miss spells having ranks. There was something so badass about going to a class trainer and purchasing a higher rank for something like Frostbolt.
---
Me and my friends stopped plasying in classic when we reached level 30-ish and ran out of stuff to do in arathi, and didn't much like the constant gank fest of STV. And I don't think we were the only ones who had that issue so this zone is kind of to address that aspect of the new player levellling process.
---
I would have questlines lead here from refuge point and from the wetlands itself (I added a quest hub in the east of the wetlands tooas a fortress that kind of guards the enrtrance to the wildhammer lands), and have this zone have quests lead on to the hinterlands on the alliance side.
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
No matter what they do, there will be raiding guilds that get decked out in MC gear within 1.5-2 months, which changes the entire game's dynamic when you have raid geared individuals joining 5 man groups and competing out in the wild, farming mobs.  
---
It will be different no matter how long they stretch out phases.
---
I try to be patient and teach shitty players to be better.  I am merciless about dealing with shitty *people* though.
---
Yup, that's what I'm trying to decide as well lol
---
Maybe I'll have an alt on the streamer's server, but play my main elsewhere. I still don't know.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/AiagBr5](https://imgur.com/a/AiagBr5)
---
Ah ok.  Yeah, I only played on Mal'Ganis during vanilla.  Moved to other servers after that.
---
Did she touch your grammar?
---
Ah but so many Classic WoW fans use the hardness/difficulty of Classic WoW vs. Retail as a badge of honor. I've regularly seen this sub comment on how fans of Retail will get upset with the grind and quit, leaving only the 'truly hardcore' WoW players. A sort of "kids these days" mentality. 
---
"Oh you'll have to actually TRAVEL to your dungeon, are you ready for that Sonny?!"  
---
"Back in my day Shamans and Paladins were limited to their respective factions! And we liked it that way!"
---
Healing, timing your cooldowns, seeing your threat level.
---
&gt;Too bad I can't play a Paladin on the Horde. Guess I'll play Priest on my Blood Elf instead.
---
I actually know Bladezz IRL (Vince C). So I’ve been able to meet the whole cast on separate occasions and they’re an absolute blast to hang around. Even Wil Wheaton (which is surprising, seeing how much of a curmudgeon he is in other aspects of life. But it seems like being on that show brought the best out of everyone).
---
Awesome!
---
Your first statement begs your last to say "what *different* people actually want"
---
This is what I said too. There is so much more you can say than... This...
---
I think it's Hinterlands, not Winterspring.
---
Ikr.....pvp server my whole time on wow....had to think for a split second on what they meant by flagged.....
---
With alt guild &lt;Keep it in the Family&gt;
---
Ah you might be right.
---
This is awfully specific
---
Please actually be trolling.
---
&gt;Grammer
---
kek.
---
Lol yeah, I would sit behind a tree in northshire hoping new players would attack a low level wolf I tamed to flag themselves. Yes, I was a huge dick when I was a teenager.
---
Short answer is it depends... on the party, the gear, the instance, etc.
---
Is it a short, easy instance and/or no one else wants or can use the gear, or is the gear extremely common?  Roll away.
---
Are you with a party of friends/guildies who don't mind you taking gear for off-spec use?  Roll away.
---
Are you looking for items that are BIS for a number of other people in the party, in high demand, very rare, or at the end of a long instance and also doesn't fit the role you're filling for your current party?  Best to announce your intention to roll on that gear early on.  A good example is if you're trying to pick up a set of Warrior T0 and you've got a Warrior tank.
---
Are you just trying to get gear to DE and level enchanting?  Ask.
---
BoEs?  Ask.  Some people are weird/greedy with them.
---
Eh. People will play the way they want. There's no sense telling anyone to "please do x and y."
---
I reckon Blizzard will start opening batches of fresh realms once the first generation of realms start to grow old. History has shown us that fresh realms are massively popular in the pserver community because vanilla is best for the first year or so. There's really no need for extra content after Naxx, just new servers.
---
Not a chance will I waste a second reading this
---
Report it as a bug then
---
I second this!!!
---
I love classic and I will pour my FREAKING SOUL INTO IT!! But give me freaking time!! I want alts! I want twinks!! I want guild and raid drama, but above else I want the freaking community back!!
---
 I WANT MY FAMILY BACK!! Dont think that is much to ask!!
---
I remember this specific video
---
&gt;I can say that those quillboars used to hit like trucks and you had to cc one in one of those bigger groups.
---
Only the casters (shock spells) were actually dangerous, and that's only if you had no healer. The rest did laughable damage.
---
People could tank rfk with a hunter pet and no healer back in vanilla, it was quite forgiving. Though obviously the worse your tank / heal, the more important crowd control becomes.
---
As much as I love the old talent system, and making hybrid specs, I have a love/hate relationship with the differences between Classic and Retail. I feel that I could be more *creative* in my classic talent choices, but I feel like Retail has given us ways to remain viable while altering our play style through talents. I like and dislike parts of both.
---
Slight Hotline Miami vibe in this too
---
not quite...
---
if you were a dick but had the skills to back it up, you'd end up with other people who could put up, and ended up clearing raids with them
---
however, if you were a dick and a noob... then yeah, good luck getting anywhere.
---
Should anyone also make a pre BiS list based on race as well?
---
Like Orc and Humans pre BiS since they need less hit?
---
Are we sure race change wont be available?
---
don't kid yourself people will research the hell of the game you are never going to get the true vanilla experience again. it's impossible.
---
Times change.
---
[Cuergos Gold](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=2882)
---
Nice highlights
---
I’ll be raiding, but it’ll be on nights that I have more than two hours.
---
Pros: Fun
---
Cons: Never get invited to anything
---
It was the main inspiration behind this post.
---
Ah this sucks, I wanted bg breaks at x9 levels in between leveling with my friend :( 
---
I don't even know if we will still be playing 6 months after launch.
---
hum...
---
Classic was designed to be solo-friendly, casual-friendly.
---
back in 2004 , in the days of Everquest, DAoC, ultima online and so on... you wouldn't go anywhere without a group... and I mean most classes couldn't solo mob 2-3 level below them with any kind of efficiency.
---
when WoW launched, old school MMO gamers laughed at it, laughed at how you could lvl to max without interacting with anyone.
---
Classic was DESIGNED to not be as social as every other game before it...
---
Interesting breakdown, thank you for your insight
---
hi Bael'dun Digger, i'm also not in the beta
---
Side question, is it true that logging far from the main cities makes it so you don’t have to wait in queue? Or on the opposite continent of the dominant factions main city.
---
Yeah, pretty much. Can't really call what they have live anything close to talents in the traditional sense.
---
Ya really, I've played the game off and on since 05 and I've met quite a few nasty tanks. I've been a tank as well and I've learned that people often don't understand the role of tank completely and can be pretty irritating at times. Trust me it's hard to always be patient. As far as difficulty goes vanilla isn't much to tank than mythic as I've done both. Mythic is far more challenging than most tanking scenarios in vanilla.
---
&lt;Did Someone Say Thun&gt;
---
I think most people will disagree with your argument that worldbuffs benefit casters more than melee.
---
The percentage increase buffs don't increase the power of casters. They only get crit from the gain of +intellect, whereas melee get both crit from the +agi *and* power.
---
Furthermore, the +5% crit/200AP compared to +10% crit is deceptive. You'd think that melee would prefer the +10% crit, but you easily hit soft crit cap with worldbuffs. In this situation, due to 40% of your attacks being glances, you only get benefit of the excess crit on your yellow attacks and it would do nothing for your white attacks, thus making +200AP way more desirable.
---
First ever 60 was a rogue. Happened about a week and a half after release.
---
Same. Almost feels like it was linked on this sub two days ago...
---
4 wings btw
---
Dying actually really sucked because repair bills that hit 1g actually HURT, or at least it did for me.
---
No I think he's right.  I believe Gamebreaker didn't really come about til wrath, maybe late TBC at the earliest.
---
Anyway, I think you're thinking about akaMikeB and his Darnell character.
---
Races will change a lot because everyone is minmaxing nowadays. Things like Night Elf Rogue are nonexistent on Private Servers despite being immensely popular back in Vanilla.
---
Yeah, I got trolled and rolled on the first one I picked up.  After that, I generally grabbed and ran away.  Also remember stumbling into random elites from others grabbing and running away.
---
“The talent system are”...
---
Yep, everyone had a niche for the most part. That combined with 40 man raids made it much easier to get into raids with the "wrong" spec. I played ret all of classic and still healed in raids. I was needed for kings for a long time, and for cleanse. I mean, I could still be a great healer as ret back then too.
---
You know what else would be cool? If we could make our mounts fly, so that we could get to those instances faster.
---
Me either....i miss WPvP soo much
---
Get this, the King of Stormwind was hanging out on an island five minutes' swim from Theramore the entire time
---
&gt;on both vanilla and TBC private servers.
---
We tanked entire WC with Voidwalker + rogue sharing the tank load and no healer on TBC private server, it was fairly trivial. I was somewhat under-leveled but with decent quest gear. Although that was 5man.
---
Of course it’s fake, it’s a fictional show...what, were you expecting a documentary??
---
While I agree with you that LFR and Normal/Heroic aren't proper representation of how group content functions at 120, Heroic and LFR definitely qualify as "End Game" based on the consensus of the definition:
---
&gt; refers to the part of the game where level advancement is no longer the goal and other activities take center stage.
---
Just the way Aman'Thul intended.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrsZ8lZfJQc
---
Depends on class but overal I’d say it’s better than MC gear but slightly worse than BWL gear.
---
Ah Yummy Felicia Dey
---
&lt;Warsnog Glutch Radiers&gt;
---
Oh thank Captain Irrelevant. Any other thoughts that you'd like to share?
---
This is why I fucking hated the honor system, it made everything about the most efficient way to farm a number.  Before that people didn't really complain much about the long ass AV because it didn't matter if you stayed to the end or not.
---
That was the first change to make WoW more grind friendly and it was downhill ever since until now you have a literal calendar telling you when where and how to hit all your daily/weekly grinds.
---
The design philosophy should have remained that just playing the game was the goal because it was fun, not achieving the biggest number for whatever the fuck in your menu screen.
---
I will love a rogue who knows how to sap effectively.
---
Wait. There’s still summoning stones outside dungeons right? This info graphic made it seem like the only possible way to get a summon was from warlocks
---
This is like the tank demanding payment for his repair bill, or the healer demanding money for water. If you're too cheap to portal your group out then just hearth/tp yourself out without saying anything.
---
What did I misunderstand?
---
That and you could completely tweak your builds to not be cookie cutter and still get into raids easily. An example being prot paladins who obviously weren't tanking, but made a hybrid build for pvp healing+reck bombs. There were a lot of builds that weren't optimal for raids that people used for pvp that people still brought to raids because of the respec cost.
---
Pros: Look cool. Fun to play. Strong against certain classes in PvP (e.g. Mages). In a geared group can run 5 mans as "healer" just via VE.    
---
Cons: Limited debuff slots and low damage make you either non-viable or limited-viable in raids. No working CC/escape in PvP (Fear on a 30 sec cooldown LOL). Your spell interrupt mitigation isn't reliable (Martyrdom).
---
Sure it’s already been mentioned but this would be fun to use for D&amp;D.
---
Sorta. If you grind enough rep with AB/WSG you can buy some decent stuff. Nothing really that amazing though.
---

If this sub is any indication... god damn people will be toxic.
---
op in pvp
---
no1 wants you in raids
---
Goddamn diggers
---
You should level as a shadow priest for sure. It is still possible to heal in dungeons as long as your group doesn't suck. When you hit 60, you can respec to healing for raids and look to collect gear for shadow spec after the mages and warlocks get theirs, or you can pvp as shadow.
---
XP rewards for turning on WM should exist. 
---
Otherwise there would be no lowbies questing to gank!
---
You're right, not sure why I said 3-4 hours when I wrote that. Maybe I was thinking about time spent per week since most guilds will probably take 2-3 days to clear farm content when MC, BWL, Ony, and ZG are all out.
---
Yup, same for me.
---
Ya good luck micro managing that slow ass succubus (especially with the pet delay that is currently present in the beta). You will need to pull it away from a ton of bosses every 15 seconds and then send it back in or it will die to raid damage.
---
source? I thought all spells were based off a 3.0 second cast time and instant cast spells counted as 1.5 seconds (GCD)
---
I'm messing around on a vanilla thing and it's pve cause you can group with the other faction. A mage tried to steal my crusader farm so I flagged pvp he sheeped me the asked "why can I sheep you" then I stealthed after sheep broke and killed him 6 times last time made him log because he was trying to hearth. His name was Icecrusher my new mages name is icecrusherer.
---
I don't think counting to 1,000,000 vs calculus is a good comparison for this.  
---
Counting to 1,000,000 is just one action  n equals n plus 1 until n hits 1m   That's only one action repeated. We're not talking about casting frost bolts here.

Spending 51 points over 3 trees if needed can seem more complex to some, but not others, but it is all relative to the fact that you're choosing to spend a pre-determined amount of points per tier  in classic / vanilla  where as you're just continuing to pick 1 of 3 things per row on retail and then having someone say you're doing it wrong because they don't look at your azerite points being set one way so that your talent tree complements it.
---
One per raid.  Just be that one.
---
Pros won't be 2 shotting anyone for a long time. That is a result of the gear gap that will slowly widen as the later phases come out. Some guy in a bunch of tier 1 isn't that powerful compared to someone in decent blues.
---
"You cannot change your race after creating your character" okay so I get the importance of picking the right race in Vanilla (undead for pvp, dwarf priest, etc) but this implies in retail you can change your race after character creation.... That's not possible right? You can't just be a Worgen and go "fuck it I want to be a gnome now."
---
Warlocks do and that means every raid wants one of you.  Shadow weaving.
---
See none of this why I like classic.  In fact I think a lot of classic is mediocre design compared to later versions of the game.  The main difference for me between retail and classic is the fact that classic had a sense of community and the game world was actually used where as in retail it's just a dungeon simulator.  They could literally remove the game world from retail and it wouldn't' matter.  Basically classic feels like an MMORPG where as retail feels like a dungeon crawler ARPG.  While the infographic may be some what correct, these aren't the reasons I turn my nose up at retail.
---
How the hell are you looting a craftable? What kind of fucked up pserver you playing on?
---
Things are different now. People shouldn't be backpedaling, clicking their abilities, and playing on 4:3 monitors with next to no screen space.
---
Dont join a pvp server if you dont want to pvp.  Maybe add that warmode shit to a pve server but that would ruin a pvp server
---
Oh no, a typo! You sure got me!
---
classic seems more and more like a boomer game by the day lmao
---
I used to melt faces in vanilla as a shadow priest, pvp is a blast.
---
Depends how closely they want to mimic vanilla release schedule. Vanilla was around for 26 months before The Burning Crusade was released. So they can copy the time frame between each major patch, divide 26 months by 6 phases and get little over 4 months a phase, or decide to go longer. 
---
Remeber later raids, especially vanilla Naxx you needed to be geared with previous tiers in order to pass some dps checks, tank/resist checks etc. So you need a geared 40man to clear naxx. Most bosses in raids, especially earlier ones, drop 2 pieces of gear for 40 people. And Tier gear was class specific drops. So your 3 Hunters might be geared and Neferian decided to drop 2 Hunter chests for the week. So even if you clear the raids quickly you will still need to grind it for a while to gear up an entire raid. That's also if you have the same 40 people all the way through.
---
Plus, you should have plenty of time to catch up. At this time Naxx is the final raid announced. So there is a set end point that slower people should be able to experience as hardcore people burn out from racing to the end. So unless they announce TBC coming then I wouldn't worry about missing content.
---
m'lady
---
He means race change with irl money, wasn't a think in vanilla
---
Eh the second phase should only be three months from launch. That said the following phases should probably be a longer.
---
&gt; I just hate the idea that a lot of these people are selling. That: 
---
I totally agree. I think at most there would be room for 2 meme spec raiders per guild. My point I guess was that for the unfortunate people who do unintentionally pick meme specs they can find a spot if they're desperate and work hard.
---
But us veterans can't go around recommending those specs under any circumstance because we know that it will be extremely difficult - needlessly so - to get raid spots.
---
Do you see the tag? It's satirical.
---
Int isn’t super important bc I believe DoTs can’t crit. So theoretically leveling you want Stam &amp; SP, int and spirit are cool I guess. It will be tough coming by SP early on though or shadow damage increase but that would be the game plan. Lifetap essentially makes int be a meh stat
---
I hear "melt faces" a lot about shadow priests, but what does it exactly mean? How does one melt their opponent?
---
&lt;up and coming PVPness&gt; 
---
First ever time I received an email warning from blizzard :/
---
It's my one complaint with classic. If i could make a change I'd give the horde tauren sunwalkers and the alliance dwarf shaman.
---
Well, they've got it right in German.
---
Burg (Castle) Schattenfang.
---
Keep would be Bergfried Schattenfang.
---
2 raid nights? Sounds right up my alley. Got any more info on the guild?
---
He's pointing out the grammatical errors in the chart.
---
Wait so in retail you can pay irl money and change your race?
---
I will be coming to classic for skill tree alone man I miss being able to choose what I want to put points into felt more unique. Until obviously raiding where clothadins where the way to go to keep mana management early on
---
There is no honor in war anyways so who gives a shit
---
https://youtu.be/LF0wa0W13yw
---
Those were two different parts of the argument. The groupthink mentioned refers to the fact that the current meta of this subreddit is for no changes, which I said I agree with. But that as time passes and people have cleared the raids many times, people will start to despise world buffs, which is more or less the thought of people playing on private servers. The same thing will happen in Classic eventually and that's when people will complain about it on the forums. That is why OP wanted to discuss it now, so that we could nip the issue before it happens, but is also why I talked about why I knew it would never gain any momentum. People need to experience it for themselves before they will come to the same conclusion.
---
We're both wrong, he actually says "milady" lol
---
Mind Flay's animation makes it look like you're melting people's faces.

in the reverse, applying Water Walking to people could often provide hilarious results :]

This subreddit in the last month or 2 is almost a parody of itself. Everyone was laughing at the other wow subreddit and how 9/10 posts were arts and crafts, this week every second post is ‘look what map my girlfriend with no arms drew with crayons’.
---
My 2nd  15 man UBRS run. Won the roll on Battleborn Armbraces. Every other plate wearer in group was so Jelly. One guy said he’d ran it 20 times already without seeing em once. 
---
Just recovered my old account with my first 60. He’s still got em equipped.
---
The dps bonus for warlocks isn’t that great, and you won’t be DPSing. You’ll be there to put shadow weaving on the boss and then heal.
---
May be tempted to make my tank a druid instead of a warrior just for cheaper repair bills.
---
Stupid satire is still stupid
---
That's not what p2w means though. Every ship is obtainable in game without spending money. I think they even said you won't be able to buy ships with real money when the game releases.
---
I'm hoping it's successful. I'm partial to the idea of re-releasing everything starting with classic
---
On several of the latest polls I've seen Warlocks are getting more and more popular. Rogues less so.
---
People seem to be trying to balance being "good" and utility at group play/solo pvp play.
---
There will be less hunters overall as their end game dps is always talked about as falling off.
---
Warriors are touted as gods and will be by far the most popular class for a lot of tryhards or people who want to tank at all.
---
Druids are continually at the bottom since the perception is "jack of all trades, mastery of none".
---
Priests have also been in the top 3/4, as they are being lauded as the best healer, and shadow as legendary at 1v1.
---
In the end, there will be a big 5 -
---
Warrior/Mage/Warlock/Rogue/Priest
---
And everyone else a few percentage points lower.
---
Paladins/Shamans are overall around 7-8% but combined would be the second most popular class overall. Meaning that the numbers look lower but they'll have good representation on their factions.
---
Locks will be much more popular on Horde as well.
---
Beyond 4 warlocks (which is most raids) the buff is enough to add any entire extra warlock’s worth of DPS.  It’s better than you realize. Yes you’ll be healing a lot though, true.
---
There were programs that would click your mouse at a specific interval. I used one to keep myself logged in all afternoon because my college's network would throttle the authentication server connection and I couldn't log in during prime time.
---
That doesn’t really say anything about the system. It just shows that raiding was easy enough that you could bring in people who had garbage specs and still kill bosses.
---
You right. Missed dat one
---
Let them learn the hard way.
---
5 chances* per cast!
---
I was hoping.  Whooshed me pretty good.
---
See, you’re doing it again. Over simplifying someone’s answer using one small area of the WHOLE experience. Farming for mats for resistance sets takes a lot of time and effort, that does make it harder than retail. Is that hard to comprehend? Same goes for leveling, same goes for acquiring gold etc. 
---
The truth is that it is harder, and good for it. So you can continue to dislike the word hard and it’s definition of requiring for effort and endurance, which is exactly what classic is. I really don’t get what your problem with a word is.
---
They forgot to add no arena as well
---
Oops! No private server, definitely vanilla wow. It's been a long time, I must be mixing up names. It was an epic boe 2 hander
---
Nice hat! /s
---
Very true.
---
May have to try that the next time I level up
---
again you're talking impact not complexity. no one argued today's talents aren't more useful or have more impact or have more utility, or any of this other stuff you're bringing up. we're saying the system itself was more complex in vanilla than it is today
---
distributing 31 talent points between 3 specs and multiple trees within those specs is objectively a more complex system than picking 1 of 3 talents in 7 rows. your thoughts on usefulness of individual talents, or your own personal experiences, etc, aren't relevant. not trying to be a dick, i just don't think you realize you're not arguing the actual topic
---
Does this mean shamans are also confirmed in Smash?
---
The talent system wasn’t really more complex everyone usually had pretty cookie cutter talent trees for pvp and pve with little change in between
---
Mah Digga...
---
They make it sound like a bad thing... I can’t wait!
---
it's a half-assed promo for a shitty website, what do you expect. Shame on you rubes for upvoting.

---
you might be right. i understood "complex" to mean complex. but others might be reading more into it
---
I'm pretty sure the Wow devs themselves said that adding flying mounts and dungeon finder was a mistake because it took a lot of the journey out of the game, and made it a "sit in org / IF / SW" game.
---
The map parts are tradable, not unique, and the quest is repeatable. You can easily farm multiple copies of the map and then go turn them all in during the same trip. It is an excellent source of 40+ greens for either sale or disenchant.
---
Can I dos competitively in r10 gear?
---
15% all damage is pretty ridiculous buff. Warlocks that don't get shadow weaving will be very sad. At that point you're may as well bring just 2 locks to pick up loot and keep up CoE/CoR.
---
I understand the feeling. In part, people were correct in saying there will be cookie cutter builds with the old system, but I think that's mostly a result of people trying to act as gate keepers for the community and telling people how they play is objectively wrong and stupid. On the other hand, I'm not sure I like the new talent system because instead of an overall optimal talent spec, there's optimal builds for each fight and it's easy to change between each fight. I would be a lot happier if it was a flexible system but difficult to respec so you had trade offs. Which, is one thing the old system had. And don't get me wrong, some trees are more flexible than others, but I think ideally, if 1.13 becomes a thing, more talents will become viable or even really strong picks and people can start going wild on builds.
---
TBC still did not allow hybrid specs, it just allowed each spec to be good at a single role.
---
Why do ppl think wf procs are so rare? 
---
Don't you know its 20% chance. and stormstrike is double attack which can proc wf too.
---
Not good because healing gear explicitly has only +healing on it while an ele sham wants +dmg and healing. So your spells do 0 extra damage if your gear only has +healing.
---
&lt;JFK Didn't LOS&gt;

Nah, that would be like adding Thanos to Fortnight- it would be dumbly OP and would wreck the balance of the game.

Neither is right or wrong, and neither is more valid. Your meal will arrive on time, and you can take as long or as little as you'd like to enjoy it.
---
There wouldn't be in that warrior fight.  Leeway doesnt occur when you stop or backpedal.  It only occurs on constant moving targets.
---
Can confirm.  I bought 1000g for $100 in November of 2005.
---
OP make sure you submit this on the official forums, maybe along with the other reddit post going into much more detail about it. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs7ks2/melee_leeway_retail_mechanic_in_classic/
---
I'd argue that what changed is Blizzard's stance on what a hybrid should be. Back in vanilla they thought that if you can dps and heal you can't be as good at dps as a class that can only dps. The TBC dev team changed to support the idea that all dps spec should be equal even if that class can play other roles with another spec.
---
You're not wrong, but in order to raid we'll all be required to use a cookie cutter build.

---
The talents are actually more complex in retail, but they appear simpler at first glance.
---
You choose a spec at 10 and then you have 3 talents to choose from at each tier, with tiers at 15,30,45,60,75,90 and 100.
---
Usually there is a little overlap between the specs for each class but there are always spec specific talents.
---
However all of the dumb filler talents are gone which is 90+% of vanilla talents. So you have to make actual choices which can have significant impact on your rotation and playstyle for the spec. Also knowing which talent is best is usually much more difficult to determine on your own(not looking up in a guide).
---
Yeah, it was a group finder.
---
I'm nøytral about it.
---
Mission accomplished. Flying away now

This is quite the pointless strawman you've created.

What is it?

Not bad for machine gun imp either
---
REEEEEEEEEEE TENDIEEEES!!!
---
Sure, if your guild has a ton of locks, but they'll only bring at most 1.
---
Druid's are gear sponges.
---
If you're willing to put effort into mastering a class and enjoy getting lots of loot. Play Druid. You won't top the damage or healing meters but if you get good enough you will amaze people with some good tricks.
---
Crusader enchant recipe. Farming that recipe at lvl 70 made me so much gold from enchanting twink gear, and heirloom weapons.
---
Don't forget BWL and MC on same raid night!
---
&gt; World buffs were not abused on server with medium to high populations, because every random joe and their mother would turn in the quest at a random time, screwing over the hardcore guild(s) wanting to stack them. 
---
The hardcore guilds on pservers at least, if they want an ony buff, they saved an ony head for their raid night, and had everyone hang out until they turned it in themselves, then they went to the raid immediately. (Most of the time logging in minutes before this was done to maximize timer for their ZG and other buffs)
---
This is the first I've heard of T2 being bad for locks
---
He might be joking at the usage of recent considering Cata changes were 2011.
---
having to show that paladin was only available for alliance/shaman for horde is just bonkers to me.  scary to think that a retail player may not know that.
---
Certain shows do geeky things well but make them approachable. See:Silicon Valley
---
Other Shows such as the guild are just bad writing and acting all around and pure fanboy "gamer" trash.
---
That just sounds equally strong with more onomatopoeia usage
---
Nah. It's pro-classic. It frames everything as harder / more exclusive. If it was anti-classic it would frame everything as needlessly wasting your time to prevent you from having fun, or having a ton of complexity that ends up being a cookie cutter non-choice. 
---
This chart gives the impression overall that more things *matter*. Race/Class combo matters. Spec matters. Faction matters. Spell selection matters.
---
More like up from 1 class to 9.  The drive to make every class/spec viable has turned into a giant homogenization resulting in 1 class with 12 different names.

Playing on Light Hope private till then
---
I love warrior, but this is one of the reasons I'm not rolling one again haha
---
## Looking for:
---
- Casual horde guild
---
- PvP Server
---
- Raid 1-2 times a week (~9pm-midnight EST)
---
## About me:
---
- I'll be playing a Resto Shaman in Classic
---
- I won't be rushing to 60. I plan to level at a steady pace and keep my professions up to date. (Alch/Herb)
---
- I played a mage in Vanilla and TBC
---
- I played a monk in Legion
---
- Both characters had an arena rating of at least 2k
---
- I don't have much raid experience as I mainly focused on PvP
---
- I'm easy going and don't like drama.
---
- I'm a father of two and they take priority over the game. This means that every now and then I'll need to disappear for a few minutes or even a night.
---
I pugged a lot in Vanilla.
---
I had people quit after the first wipe all the damn time. Hell, I had people quit because we didn't have a warlock to summon them.

Are you fucking serious? You're gonna pull the fucking streamer card on this one? Another example that people will REEEE streamer for anything.

You can laugh that stuff off because no one knew who you were. You didn't have creepy fucks showing up at your house. Maybe you struggle to understand that other people's experiences are different than your own.
---
It's a bit of a knit pick, in my opinion.
---
But the raiding progression was the peak of wow. Mechanics now may be more interesting and vanilla may have more iconic history and nostalgia, but nothing will top kill Vashj and unlocking TK, killing KT and unlocking hyjal, etc.
---

---
There are a handful of private servers that already do this, and pretty well.
---
Add there are no participation trophies in classic vs retail :)
---
Warlocks suffer from the "nobody wants to help you summon people" problem though.
---
As a Warlock, you ALWAYS have to go to the instance yourself. But everyone else in the party is just like "Oh cool you can summon me, I'll just stick around here and keep questing instead of running to the dungeon."
---
And then by the time two of the party actually get off their arses and come help you summon, it's actually taken longer than if everyone just ran to the dungeon by themselves.
---
Yeah, this happens fairly often, and it's infuriating. The ability is meant to make things faster, but the changes to social dynamics can make it actually slow everyone down.
---
There is no world first for this content. It has already been done.
---
Pro:  High impact with very low skill ceiling.
---
Con: You'll spend more time drinking than fighting.
---
Here is the hard truth. You will get wrecked, every time. Play something else. The whole "melt faces in PvP" is a myth. People back then sucked hard, and is the whole reason any Shadow videos ever saw the light of day. 
---
For PvE, no one wants to waste a DPS slot on a Shadow Priest unless it is for farmed out content, though you may MAY have a better chance now mostly because people are better at the game these days so min/maxing may not matter as much. 
---
Don't believe me? Go for it. It isn't like it takes a long time to level a character to Max in Vanilla or anything. Hopefully you will end up enjoying healing. Pollyannas here will say it won't matter, but this is Vanilla, not every spec was actually viable.
---
My classic fury/protection warrior tank cries reading this
---
Hi, also not in the beta!  I'm dad!
---
You should have went through desolace. I avoided stv for the most part on my two 60s in vanilla. Screw that zone.
---
IMO,  people who do not think that the world buffs will effect the average raider seem to be unaware of the effects of meta creep.   I guarantee even if you are in a non-hardcore guild,  there are going to be people linking and talking about the raid's meters at the end of the night.  The few people who did bother with wbuffs are going to be absurdly higher on meters than the people who didn't.   Over time this will lead to more and more people getting the buffs before the raid in order to truly compete and protect their pride.  Eventually the people who have buffs outnumber the people who don't,  and it just becomes an expected standard at some point.  I've seen this situation happen in two different guilds so far. The abundant stat tracking tools we have these days are going to stimulate internal composition within the guild's roster that was not a factor in vanilla.  World Buffs are absolutely going to impact the average raider.  Just wait and see.
---
I can clearly read that this is a troubled young man who needs more drugs.

RP rules? No. You don’t have to “RP.”

---
Highest block and armor on a shield.   the next best is like almost half the block, and 800 less armor
---
Not OP in PvP. People sucked in Vanilla. You can hope to not be noticed, or beg for a blackout proc.
---
You ran to the raid? If this makes your brain melt go play EQ most raids are 1 raid event per zone and while raid runs between each target across sometimes several zones.
---
Literally satire of brofesco. Count on autism reddit to not get satire
---
Then where you in the class sub?
---
That's way incorrect. You could get 1,000 gold for 30-40 dollars early vanilla.
---
how about u suck my balls
---
Yeah you have been able to for quite a while. Same with name change, faction change, etc..
---
Melee classes benefit greatly from gear when it comes to speed of leveling while casters really don't. I remember leveling both mage and warlock and barely caring about what gear I had on since it didn't matter much.
---
I would hope so. It's like the joke is supposed to be that it's something a boring jerk would say, but it's funny because you're totally *not* a boring jerk. Just without the funny part.
---
That's weird my buddy bought 1000 gold for 30 bucks in March 2006,i remember because he bought some random ass noob build for 100g. Got guild leader and then ended up disbanding it and making a new one a couple weeks later. Then he spent 100g on a dazzling long sword for his fury warrior
---
Was used for crafting. Would spawn elites when opened.
---
not everyone is a trigger happy mongo who just wants to attack other people constantly
---
They're pretty op.  Especially at first.   Most classes will barely be able to even do damage to them.   Bubble, fear, bubble.
---
You talking duals against mages? 1v1? Better hope they agree to stupid rules like no sheep/eat
---
Probably Destiny. If it was a sword destiny would be it.
---
I actually wouldn’t mind if they just kept it progressing and released a fresh batch of servers every certain amount of years.  I’d honestly probably play through Cata...  if they could figure out a way to do each expansion over the course of a year instead of two, each round of servers would eventually just end up merging with the current live version of the game instead of being stuck in some strange state where its forever stuck on a certain patch and becomes stagnant.
---
Wait a minute
---
Thanks for the post. I've been thinking of getting a laptop for the same reason and its nice to know it runs well enough on integrated graphics to do some leveling or gathering.
---
Did anyone else hear the auction house noise because of the title? Ding ding
---
That was the shit thing about Druids...on someone else's screen it looked like you're hitting them from 15yrs, on your screen it looks like you need to be clawing the inside of their asshole.
---
I think server latency was higher back in the day though so it might not be such an issue now. We used to have 150ms pings easily back then which I think would actually become 300ms since I'm pretty sure WoW hit detection is server based and not client based like Overwatch.
---
Hopefully now that most of us have &lt;50ms pings it'll be way more enjoyable.
---
They sure where! I definitely remember Ramses setting up slow totems for the razorgore kite.
---
A buddy and I have been talking about how they could add in new content using cata zones, adding them into the leveling areas as well as max level content like raids and dungeons.
---
I like what you did with the map and makes me glad to see people of similar mindsets
---
But she ain’t messing with no broke diggers.

HERE COMES THE PAIN BITCH!

This might honestly be the most autistic post on the internet, and I mean that in the most inoffensive way possible.

And there's also basically a 50% chance (0.8^3) you wont see a wind fury proc in 3 swings, 40% chance you wont see it in 4 swings and 32% chance you wont see it in 5 swings.  At 3.6s weapons, 1/3 of your encounters wont have a windfury proc for the 18s it takes to kill something.
---
You are strong in pvp.  Max of 1 per raid, and you might be healing most of the time.
---
Probably 30-35ish at least if you’re including consumables (which you are using if you’re pvping for keeps), and another ~5 if you’re eng.
---
Sure you’re mostly pressing poly, blink, nova, CoC, fireblast, frost bolt, arcane explosion. But sometimes you need to refresh ice armor mid fight, or you need a rank 1 frostbolt for speed, or you’re oom and need a rank 1 coc, or you need to weapon swap to a spirit staff for evocation, or you see a shaman coming and pop slow fall for an extra buff to soak purges......
---
Man I can’t wait for vanilla
---
34 gold. Impressive.
---
Lol... you had me going...fuckin netball practice.
---
I’m sad that heirlooms have made me tired of looking at these armor sets.
---
I mean... mages are literally one of the most advantaged classes in 1.12 in every single aspect of the game, but I do get your point.
---
Yep, 2 handed sword. Not the greatest item, but at the time I thought I'd figured out the spot to find them. Never found anything else of worth there after that second sword.
---
Totally man.  Make sure you don’t log out in an inn... almost guarantees a queue.
---
The content was started back in vanilla but a lot the shows did happen later. It started as a tiny podcast thing and built up to its height in wrath. Needed old school players who would remember so this is the subreddit with that.
---
Feral Tank LF guild.  Raid times are completely open.  Faction doesn't matter to me either.
---
&lt;Two Dollar Horde&gt;
---
The most expensive repair bills along with being the worst class to farm gold. No thanks.
---
A good game.
---
This would be cool if it had interesting facts and correct English.
---
I don't think polls are very representative of what the game will actually look like, since these are usually answers from a very specific group of people.
---
For example you can see PvP realms are vastly more popular in polls but in reality there were always more people playing on PvE realms.
---
Perhaps!
---
There is a LOT of people in the comments going bananas about mobile WoW in the comments  as far as I’m concerned or considering the merits of mobile wow.
---
Nothing wrong with rushing to 60, I know I couldn't care less about the levelling experience since it's not really my thing
---
The Karma is free!
---
It’s great. Lol I don’t think a lot of people are ready for the true vanilla WoW...
---
Some serious luck even if it is the same epic. 2 in such a short span is crazy.
---
I hope someone makes an add on to replace the default in game maps with these 😃
---
Perhaps you got an entirely different experience on your server but for mine rank 14's definitely did not help others after they got their rewards and more than a few people got burned as a result. Maybe on your server everything was nicely organized into one group but on my server there were definitely several alliance groups/guilds competing with each other, so guarantees for a specific spot was never set in stone. This made obtaining ranks take even longer as a result. 
---
I agree that getting burned is fully justified though, because at the end of the day it's what its supposed to be: a competition for prestige. :)  
---
I mean since it is a competition, do you expect athletes running the 100m dash to take turns winning a race/being first every year? That wouldn't make sense would it? 
---
Either way, it seems like people have had different experiences depending on the server! I'm curious to see what will happen this time around but with so many players trying out classic I do not expect ranking groups to work out for most, honestly. There will definitely be more than 10 people competing for r14 :)
---
I like how the Alliance is all wary of the Horde, but on this one we're like "oh well hold on let's not be hasty and prejudge anyone here, they could be alright"
---
When Vanilla wow launched, it was a complete guess.  I think I picked a higher pop server.   That server crashed after i got to about level 10.  So, then I rolled on a lower pop server.  I got up to 60, which took a month played, then joined a guild raiding MC.   The guild office click was whoring all the loots, so I quit that server.   Then i joined a pvp server and played horde.
---
I’d argue that the timing of phases very much impacts everyone who plans on playing WoW.
---
The average player was closer to 30 than 15.
---
Giantstalker's bonuses are really dumpy. Increased Mend Pet range and mana cost reduction, pet stam and resistance boost, and 8pc is multi shot damage boost.
---
I guess if you were doing solo farming it's not completely horrible, but in raids it's not going to do much for you. 
---
Rule of cool states you should wear it regardless though.
---
Really? nobody has figured this out yet that's come to this tiny sub?
---
it's the combination of windfury procs and crits

Interview with Omar before beta had him saying that the streamers are the eyes and ears of the community as a whole, and the will be using the input from the community to engage when to push the phases.
---
This one actually has ground behind it. I’d have to search a few videos, but it’s either Omar and Tipsout or Omar and Esfand...
---
Dude.  Look at Hollywood today.  Everything is a reboot throw-back nostalgia filled bunch of member berries.  Blizzard is going to be re-booting and re-launching WoW until we're all running our last raid at the age of 80 in the retirement home.
---
Let's weed out all the kids who need their hand held.
---
No...you never played horde, have you? It’s a starting zone near orgrimmar. Think of it as the horde’s equivalent of gold shire and Elwynn forest
---
Falsw
---
I don't really recall this happening.
---
In Vanilla i had the time to progression raid as i was a student, nowadays i don't but i do have enough time to play bench and join alt runs / PuGs. This was the case for a lot of my friends back then, some of whom have the time to progression raid this time.
---
It's an interesting change, some of my mates regret not getting the chance and have the opportunity to now but there's those of us who did then but can't now.
---
I reckon progression will be different this time round, not expecting to get stuck in AQ for months for example, making the consum grind, etc shorter and time investment required lesser overall. Hopeful at least.
---
Only goal at the moment is to get Hand of Rag on my Enhance Shammy.
---
Were you actively trying to go for the least information ever included on an info graphic?   Fucking useless
---
&lt;Gnome Security&gt;
---
I'd say rolling on offspec is fine IF you actually play that offspec.  Like a shammy heals in order to be able to pve but they pvp enhance they are just as entitled to a 2h axe as an arms warrior is
---
After Cata talent trees were getting unwieldy. The change was I think more for the devs' sake than ours. They took all the old filler talents we all picked anyway and baked them right into classes and specs and instead every 10 levels or so you get a point to put into one of 3 abilities for that level's tier. It didn't completely resolve cookie cutter specs because a lot of the choices were still sub-par. It also wasn't as fun as getting a point every other level to place where you want, even if most of it was only the illusion of choice.
---
We'll be choosing the first US PVP East Coast server on the list. Not even sure they'll be more than one given how layering can support so many people on one realm. They can service something like 1.3 million people with just 1 realm of each type for each US+EU region, not counting RP realms.
---
The days of 500 realms on a list are over.
---
Are you on the Beta or old vanilla WoW. I am fairly sure that modern WoW produces jpg files.
---

---
Rockbiter is just as good as WF on a 2h.  Maybe a bit better, because it's consistent and doesn't overkill.
---
That would be pretty amazing.
---
I swear all the "non-beta" guilds on these private servers are ridiculous
---
*&lt;beta rejects&gt;* or *&lt;didnt get invited to beta gang&gt;*
---
Like of course you are not in the beta, why else would you be playing on a private server.
---
Seeing as the vast majority of players will never get higher than rank 7 or 8 pvp anyways I think most people would be willing to risk it
---
Its not all mobs for sure. But after I found out would run past them on the way to BRM and if any of the guys were holding anything different I would kill them for the quick gold fodder.
---
I'm going Holy Paladin, one of the reasons I'm excited to get Divine Intervention back.
---
It's fine.
---
Man, Shaman have always seemed like the most badass class to me. Think about it: they have an insane start. In the first 10 levels they get weapon enhancements, Earth Totem, a healing spell, insane burst damage with Lightning Bolt and Earth Shock, thorns-like damage with Lightning Shield, the ability to use a shield, and an interrupt (Earth Shock). How fucking *stacked* is that?
---
And then later they can turn into a goddamned ghost wolf, resurrect themselves, and walk on fucking water.
---
not really, cos you have stormstrike and  flurry which increase attack speed.
---
WF procs every 4-5th attack on average. thats the main idea to have in your head.
---
Log into an on old character once retail hits.
---
It made me nauseous.  The game is WoW in the same way that American Football and Association Football (Soccer) are both "football"
---
The talent trees seemed mostly pointless to me, it looked like the talents were on par power wise with Wrath era minor glyphs.  Most of the resto druid talents didn't seem to apply to resto at all.
---
Could you rephrase that?
---
You don't get all the spells to start with, nor do you need them all to level.
---
It's really not that bad. In raids you just spam one button.
---
Dps**

Here's the answer,

Unfortunately I need to go there for the matter hunter rifle.
---
There's a 2 month queue right now. You'll be able to log in on Aug 27th
---
Those are meeting stones. iirc they put you into a primitive LFG. They started acting like summoning stones in TBC
---
Lmao what
---
All mobs with the same name in the same zone share the same loot table.
---
No one gave a shit about world buffs in vanilla. That's a private server thing than won't carry over to classic.
---
Love the story. Reminds me a bit of mine.
---
I think there is a turtle in Tanaris?
---
Man, $1 per 10g, those Chinese gold farmers were making a killing back in the day.
---
PvP gets a little complicated.  In raids you spam shadow bolt.
---
Ah thats right, wasn't even thinking of that
---
I watch it once a year.
---
vastly
---
old vanilla wow. on a p server atm but I just hosted a big world pvp event. my first time ever hosting something like this and I took a ton of screenshots.
---
AYYYYYYYYYE
---
I'm rolling horde only to dodge the countless undead rogue edgelords that will gank and corpse camp all day long.
---
Shit video.
---
this isn't what i'm referring to. I mean say a human npc generally uses a 2 hand mace. Occasionally one will spawn and be using a 2 hand sword for example and when you kill that one they drop that specific 2 hand sword.
---
If they do TBC classic, yo would be lucky to muster up 1 40 man raid after everyone leaves.
---
Looks legit to me
---
melee range is broken regardless
---
tauren has 2 yards over any other class for melee thats an actual thing
---
&gt;Maybe they've learned since then.
---
Hahahahahahahaha! &lt;Benderlaughing.jpg&gt;
---
Make Azeroth Great Again had to start kicking members when they hit 1k. I would call that confirmed. Might have actually been 999 though.
---
I did mean it in a pro-classic/anti-retail way, just that the author seems to frame it in a gatekeeping style.  
---
I assume it isn't intended to read like that, but anything created to advise people of the differences between classic and retail seems to smack of elitism in my opinion.
---
You don't need macros to play Warlock, but you do need macros to be good at Warlock.
---
The most important macros will be mouse-over macros so that you can cast curses, dots, and pet abilities onto alternate targets without losing your current target.
---
Right?  Was worth it to me.  I already had a professional job and didnt have the time in my life to grind an epic mount.  Still dont regret it
---
God I miss those talent trees...
---
*laughs in PvE server*
---
Content beyond classic won't happen, unless you are talking about TBC Classic, which MIGHT happen, if the demand is there.
---
Ok. So how would you phrase it when you compare classic to retail? I mean I don't really get your point. This graphic answers most of the question in a way they may be asked. Can you change a race after creating character? No you can't. Is dual spec available? No. It is not. However it is not available on retail either. Afair dual spec was removed in Legions' pre-patch:? Like I don't know how you want to phrase it different.
---
I will give you sub 50. But do you really want to level a class that will end up a healer if your intention is to DPS at endgame?
---
Range in general is broken.
---
Hunter deadzone is 5-11 instead of 5-8.
---
Melee leeway is fucked.
---
History disagree with you.
---
Can't forget hunters needing to buy and carry around ammo as well as some classes needing to find tomes for spells rather than going to class trainers
---
I know what your talking about, in Silithus the twilight humanoids drop an armor set that they are wearing. Im sure it happens, but it’s not for every mob. I could be wrong though that is a good question.
---
No. WoW does not do that. EQ did that with both weapons and armor though. If that goblin was wearing a bronze breastplate then he would drop it on death.
---
People played on pvp servers the last few expansions that they existed simply because the best guilds were there. Most didn't want to actually pvp.
---
Yes brotherrrrr!!!!
---
Just be prepared for limited bag space
---
You will have 60 levels to figure it out. Don’t worry
---
I play warlock and I will be your best friend
---
It smacks of elitism, but only in the way that is trying to sell the reader on that elitism. It isn't saying, "this isn't for you", it's saying "this isn't for *them*", whoever the reader things "they" are.
---
Is your print screen button broken?
---
&gt; A high sided ravine connecting southern feralas to un'goro - Filled with dinosaurs, huge trees and trolls living in the cliff walls
---
I'm reminded of Windshear Crag in Stonetalon Mountains. I loved working my way across the platforms perched against the cliff. I'd love something like that on a larger scale.
---
Hey man, time is a resource, if people are willing to trade one for the other, what's the problem in that. The main thing I have against gold farmers is when they hurt the game environment for others with their farming. Or the more annoying thing, the gold-ad spam, very bad problem on private servers that are popular.
---
Thinking that one thing is better than another is also called choice you know.
---
Pro, you get to melt face in pvp.
---
Con you need to be a guild masters girlfriend to get a raid invite.
---
But anime in background adds aesthetic
---
Can’t wait for the gear score app
---
I’ve played Warlock in BC, WoD, Legion, and BFA. I don’t use any macros and I only use damage meter add ons. I’ve done heroic raids and high level mythic dungeons. You will pick them up fast and find mastering them a blast as you get a hang of your skills and go from novice to master over the course of content. Don’t be scared. You’ll do fine.
---
Wheres the video
---
Bear tank was ass in vanilla
---
Guilds use these buffs to complete naxx in an hour and 4 minutes. They add toxic Dynamics to the game for no legitimate reason. I fully believe we should remove them all and only keep the Nef/Ony head buffs in at most and make them override each other.
---
I'm certain that it happened. not with armor just with weapons.
---
Didn't you know? Warlocks can only be played by rocket scientist!
---
def rolling another tauren warrior in classic. Does anyone know if female or male makes a difference?
---
But azeroth isnt the real world and as such would have their own way of naming things
---
I like the old talent system just fine, but there isn't anything complex about googling cookie cutter specs and copying them, which is what most of us will be doing.
---
Complex doesn't necessarily equate to better, either. For example, filler you have to waste points on to unlock a tier. Or talents so awful that regardless of your spec, experimentation, or intended content you won't waste points on.
---
Both talent systems have their pros and cons, and it'll be fun to play with the old one again, but let's not pretend it was this complex facilitator of customization and freedom, because it wasn't.
---
A pre-bis is in by no part a one slot thing, I really wish you would stop embarrassing yourself.
---
I agree with this completely
---
I'm interested in running a fairly casual friendly guild and having an active guild chat. Hopefully this will expand the possibilities of things to do but I don't think we'll be hardcore enough to do much except world pvp
---
All depends on how long it takes you to start clearing, your luck and how long phase 2 takes
---
Sup.
---
"How do we have four fucking warlocks and no fucking souls stones, how is that even possible?!"
---
Classic DD molten core.
---
Those were the days.
---
Pressing 1 isnt that complex
---
IIRC the leeway is dependent on walk speed. That's why it's not activated on backpedal.
---
"RP walk" probably wouldn't activate it either
---
Horde of what?  That doesn't make any sense
---
More on very slow 2h weapons. WF is surprisingly bad as far as efficiency on slow 2h weapons.
---
Bloodgulch? Why is there a base out there? Far as I can tell, it's just a box canyon in the middle of nowhere, with no way in or out. And the only reason that we set up a Horde base here, is because they have an Alliance base up there. And the only reason they have an Alliance base up there is because we have a Horde base here.
---
I mean, even if we were to pull out today, and they were to come take our base, they would have two bases in the middle of a box canyon. Whoop de fucking do!
---
Yes
---
This right here is the distinction some people are missing. When people talk about the old talent system being more complex, they aren't talking about it technically having more points to spend. They're trying to present it as this complicated bastion of customization and choice where the sky is the limit and any combination of talents are at your disposal to create a character truly unique and your own. That isn't how it panned out at all ever for anyone.
---
Raiding doesn't really require that much skill as a warlock compared to other classes. For pvp warlock is probably the hardest class to play optimally, but most players aren't really going to be at a level where you need to be a pvp god to beat them.
---
Yeah, this doesn't happen. If a mob is using a 2H sword and another is using a 2H mace and either of these weapons is on their loot tables, they both have equal chance to drop it.
---
&gt; If blizz intends on making money... they will never listen to any of these "no-lifers" you mentioned.
---
Those people are massive revenue generators through basically advertising the game whenever they play
---
&lt;gnomes stole my bike&gt; or &lt;orcs/dwarfs ate my grampa&gt; are classic names from every private server ive been through years
---
That's the one.
---
I'm looking at a receipt in my email rn from 2006-09-09 on Destromath Alliance. 
---
&gt;Quantity: 	52 gold
---
&gt; Your Unit Price: 	US$ 0.2706 USD/gold
---
&gt; Total Price: 	US$ 13.53 USD
---
I'm sure each server had slightly different costs, so just adding mine to the pile.
---
This makes the most sense, they are unlikely to release something that introduces new content that deviates from classic.  
---
This would create some weird paradigm where it would be one IP in two games vying for the player-base.
---
Mah mo'fukin Digga.
---
You drunk, go home
---
Holy shit, he was melee'ing him like 20 yards away.
---
Eh, with 40 people there's always something going on. I mean if you work at an office with 40 people you're rarely going to have all 40 even in the office on the same day... Not complaining about classic, but that's why you have bench warmers. Shit happens.
---
Well, you'll be able to wing clip further away
---
Gold: the cap was the max value of a 32 bit signed integer in copper, which is 2,147,483,647 or 214,748 gold 36 silver and 47 copper.
---
I still think they will have multiple realms. The tech has always been getting better but yet we've got more servers than ever in WoW.
---
Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick?
---
Ya its crazy
---
I meant fury 2h.
---
Fury 2h can actually perform decently well.
---
Obviously the pvp arms spec is trash in PvE.
---
I had the guide on your right to!
---
That's just wrong. The talent system in retail allows you to better tailor your spec to what specific content you're doing.
---
females are butt ugly
---
The spell on WoWHead should tell you the formula used to calculate the buff based off the health.
---
It should explain your answer.
---
It's sufficient for my needs. I don't plan on raiding on my tank. I just need one for 5 mans.
---
Warlocks are really fun, you'll do fine! It's not really that bad!
---
It was made as a subtle jab at retail. Nothing more
---
I highly doubt vanilla wow code was complex enough to actively monitor your hp% and adjust the berserking buff accordingly.   But I have no evidence or experience with the buff.
---
I hope to get an average of 2 hours a night lol. Will probably be like 2-3 a week. And I’d love to enjoy classic for years and years to come. Would be sad if they decide to re release BC before I even get a chance to raid.
---
1 million people on one server LUL
---
But not in 1.12
---
I thought adding these classes to both factions was a huge mistake. I wanted to see more faction and race-specific goodies, not everything slowly homogenized into a tasteless gray soup.
---
Naga stole my bike
---
So basically as Tauren you not only get Warstomp but also some pretty crazy melee range yea? Pretty good choice for a Warrior, may be able to stand outside of certain damaging effects and still smack things (gain threat) while other races can't? This actually is genuinely intended by Blizz right?
---
Dear god, if he makes it to BRD it’ll be an hour long. I’ll have to make some popcorn! 
---
I completely agree with your points above, can’t wait for more.
---
Blizz has said that this is intended themselves in a bluepost from a few weeks ago.
---
7 points which matter more than most 1 points do in the overall impact per spec. 
---
Example: Resto shaman can choose talent builds tailored to dungeons, AOE raiding, ST raiding. As well as different utility talents based on what mobility you'll be offering the raid.
---
No classes are hard because you learn them naturally as you level 1-60. It'll be fine
---
If anyone wants to join hit me up :)
---
I don't get it. I don't get the stereotype about Warrior leveling. With cooking, first aid and spirit gear (or if you're troll) your downtime isn't anything more than a mage/priest/lock and you kill things just as fast.
---
You can take on multiple mobs and can exploit weaknesses in mobs like Whelps and caster humanoids that get eaten by melee.
---
If you chose your fights and come prepared Warriors are great levelers. Once you can get enough gear that you don't have to eat between mobs you start flying.
---
It's the words they use. For example they could say "paladins are an alliance-only class", but they choose to use the word "limited" instead, which has a generally negative connotation.  They could say "your race is permanent" but instead they say "you cannot change your race". Those all mean the same thing, but the words you use is important, and the marketing team clearly chose words with a negative connotation here.
---
It was almost certainly static.   The buff is only 10 seconds on a 3 min CD, so it really doesn't even matter much.
---
I checked WoWHead first and wasn't able to find that information on the page or in the comments. Everything is pretty vague.
---
Maybe if it was a good anime.
---
LFM UBRS must have at least full t1
---
This is accurate. Buddy literally donated plasma an bought his epic mount.
---
That's more than double the range that is intended.  Looks like the lag compensation is completely fucked.
---
Yeah, similarly I'll be using a laptop when not near my desktop rig. I've got a fairly recent one for work, Surface Laptop 2 (integrated graphics, UHD620), which is running BFA on admittedly low settings but perfectly playable for questing and world exploration stuff. Hopefully should do Classic absolutely fine for when I'm travelling etc.

It's a dirty secret, only if you're an idiot like Reckful and use someone elses account on stream will you get caught.
---
i havent played wow since the TBC era so this may be a dumb question but what if i want to be competitive in both pve and pvp on one character?   would i just have to suck it up and pay the 50g every time i wanna switch specs?   would it just be smarter at that point to make 2 different character's (rogue for example) with one spec'd into pve skills and the other spec'd for pvp skills?
---
Because people didn't sit in org all day in classic?
---
Shadow priest is one of the best 1v1 pvp specs in the game... not everyone running around is going to be a rank 1 gladiator like half the beta at the moment, it will still be very strong.
---
Yeah, that's true
---
Fishing alchemy
---
I love that so much.
---
I've heard from troll tanks it's based on your health when you activate the spell, so your 1% health cast will give you 30% haste for the entire buff duration, even after being healed immediately after casting it.
---
Though just what I've heard, beta testers could test it.
---
I'm looking myself now, gotta love the trolls Mon.

My buddy was a warlock and used to like getting on a boat back to Ratchet from Booty Bay. And if there was an ally on the dock or somewhere within range, he would cast from the boat as it was departing and kill the dude on shore and wouldn't get attacked by the goblins. Fun to watch.
---
Ah, good to know. I think I'll focus more on PvP too. Thanks for the info sir.
---
1 million people on 22 servers.
---
sometimes put up a curse of elements etc. and hand out hard candy.
---
Op. Here's a thought for you. Stfu and let people choose how to play their game.
---
Oh, nice. It was actually (officially) removed from Youtube anyway, afaik. That is why I never went back to watch it a second time. They were trying to force you to go watch it on their shitty Geek &amp; Sundry site if you didn't keep up with it as it released or wanted to go back years later and watch it.
---
There are a couple clips [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoK9Nr12NHQ).

Omfg these guys have gotten me in STV so many times. I always just laugh because it's so ridiculous. Triple garrote opener 3 identical trolls on 3 identical raptors.
---
In classic there is a genuine community
---
In retail there is a special type of community
---
4 warlocks isn't that common though.
---
First of all, drinking makes digging fun. Secondly, not until we find out if Dwarfs are decedents of the Titans!

I wish they did a stream so I could get some folks with me to take them out

This cannot be understated. I actually enjoyed dying in PvP as holy more than I enjoyed melting faces as shadow because of how fast your mana gets used up.
---
Even worse, after a while they figured out they could farm more gold on other people's accounts, so they hacked people's accounts with keyloggers and phishing.
---
They sold everything from your account they could, disenchanted your gear and sold the shards on the ah.
---
Then GM's refunded all your gold and loot, effectively duplicating gold and flooding the market.

Blizzard isn't going to drop phases based on a small vocal minority, they'll do it based on data metrics and targets they have. They'll be able to see how many guilds are progressing through current content and when total progression hits the targets they're aiming for they'll release the next phase, they aren't going to be using forum whining to determine phase length so you don't really have to worry.
---
Hey I played on Gilneas as well. Was a human mage. Was in a guild call guardians of fate
---
you got stats to back you up or am i just supposed to take such a vague term such as history at face value
---
While rooted.  I remember the compensation if you were both going the same direction but I thought when rooted it didn't work.
---
I think it'll be 2-3 in the major regions, but no more.
---
That's ~30 realms for US+EU (11 regions total), which is 600,000 people with the minimum amount of layers. Every additional set of layers adds another 300,000 people.
---
it is intended it was like that back in the day, just no one noticed cause half of us were playing on dial up
---
The exact same thing I did in retail classic, but on a hunter instead of rogue so... Naxx clear, and try for rank 11, more importantly get Rhok'delar asap.
---
It hints at it though. It's more likely the writing style of the author over their intention, but it creates an "Us vs. Them" mentality by swaying opinion on the game before release.  
---
Yes, the game is vastly different than retail WoW, but they are two different games.   
---
Classic may appeal to people who, when reading the differences, may never look at it as it's a reduction in QOL features etc.
---
i was quite scared of it, but did it anyway! i only got banned once. for 3 days. from sending people coal wrapped in wrapping paper for COD at christmas time, pretending to be grandfather winter.
---
you forgot, 5-10 man dungeon takes 2-4 hours to complete, also you have to run them multiple times.
---
organizing 40 man raids, not only time consuming, but also take long time to complete.

Choosing which you like better is a choice, liking one over the other is an opinion.
---
Depends on class. It's simplest to put it like this: for which classes is R10 better DPS than T1? I would say the following classes:
---
Mage
---
Warlock
---
Fury/arms warrior
---
Shadow priest
---
Feral druid  
---
Enhancement shaman
---
Ret paladin
---
SP reckoning paladin (you really wouldn't play this in PvE)  
---
For the following classes, T1 &gt; R10 for PvE DPS:  
---
Hunter  
---
Rogue  
---
...but T1 is not *way* better, both are fine
---
For the following classes, neither set is good all on its own but needs to be mixed:  
---
Elemental shaman  
---
Balance druid
---
You can basically look the items up and compare for yourself. You just need to know which terms to search for. If you want to look up the PvP sets of a given class, here's the search terms:
---
Paladin: 's lamellar  
---
Warrior: 's plate  
---
Shaman: 's mail  
---
Hunter: 's chain  
---
Druid: 's dragonhide  
---
Rogue: 's leather  
---
Mage: 's silk  
---
Warlock: 's dreadweave  
---
Priest: 's satin  
---
And for T1, each class set is called the following:  
---
Paladin: Lawbringer  
---
Warrior: of Might  
---
Shaman: Earthfury  
---
Hunter: Giantstalker  
---
Druid: Cenarion  
---
Rogue: Nightslayer  
---
Mage: Arcanist  
---
Priest: of Prophecy  
---
Warlock: Felheart
---
Then open a notepad, look up all the items, write down how much stam/int/sp/crit/whatever you want to compare, and just do some basic math. It's all about knowing the search terms.
---
It's not bad and raids are mindless shadow bolt spam.
---
They both look pretty disgusting.
---
If it’s going to be this crazy come classic release, I may have to rethink my decision to roll orc.
---
F J F D ! ^(A N A L)
---
Okay, and?
---
Ugh. we had such similar tastes in music.  Thanks man
---
not really, because everyone still used the same exact spec for dps, heal, or tank for each class.  One set of talents was always way better than whatever weird ass combination some person came up with.
---
Much less content, no achievements and no flying,
---
He is abusing it lol
---
This made me giggle
---
Pro and Con. Mostly Pro.
---
What do you mean by lag compensation exactly? Like one or more of the players were particularly laggy, just the standard issues with having 100ms or something like that and how things appear to the player visually, or actually some blizzard server backend stuff compensating for the differences in people's ping improperly?
---
This is where you're wrong.
---
All the "no-lifers" were begging blizzard to keep the the raid limit at 40.  
---
We were against cross server battlegrounds because we wanted high PvP ranking to be something difficult to achieve and to be another way to stand out on the server.
---
When TBC got released we hated how easy all the raids were.  We were even more angry once all the attunement requirements were removed.
---
We hated the idea of power creep and wanted the level cap to stay at 60.  All the casuals were like "you're just mad you have to start over and we'll catch up.
---
We hated that flying mounts would remove world PvP and thought the world PvP events were braindead since we had already seen it fail before on the plagueland towers.
---
While TBC had it's fun moments, it was the beginning of the end for all of the hardcore players.  I was in the 2nd guild to clear Black Temple on the server, we didn't even feel like it was an accomplishment worth celebrating and it took 2 days for somebody to update the progression page on the realm forums.
---
I think this time around it's probably worth listening to the hardcore no-lifers even though I'm too grown and with too many responsibilities to fall into that group.
---
2006 was a different time. Inflation happened as the years went on and people still farmed after epic mounts. Plus occasionally you get someone doing their own gold farming gig and they undercut.
---
"The talent system are vastly more complex." Look, I like the old talent system, I think i'ts fun and all, but we need to be more honest about something.
---
If you mean the literal number of points available to spend on the literal number of talent choices, then yes, this is correct.
---
However these discussions frequently mean to imply the old system was more meaningful than the modern system. That it offered a large amount of complex choice where the sky is the limit and you can fine-tune and customize to make your character truly *your own!!!!!!*
---
In reality it was full of bland filler talents you only took to advance to the next tier, and sprinkled with talents so objectively bad that you didn't take them for any reason unless it was necessary to advance to another tier. Most talents worth considering were already included in the same cookie cutter specs we all took, and left what, 5 points of wiggle room to spend how you wanted without gimping yourself?
---
The old talent system is good. It's fun. It's satisfying getting a point every other level and visibly tracking your progress and waiting impatiently to ding for that 41 point talent. But let's not pretend it was vastly more complicated and meaningful than it really was.
---
What staff is he using? Strength of the Treant?
---
You don't want Naxx dropping in 18 months, but at the same time, you don't want to be stuck farming MC for 6 months and then farming BWL for another 6 months. People will get bored real fuckin' fast.
---
Great for 5 mans.
---
I am sooooo thirsty for Whitemane...it’s not even funny.
---
That's fucking great lol
---
Agreed
---
Any one that raids as a warrior essentially makes a mage alt to farm gold.
---
Play warlock and dont think about, lvling from 1-60 will teach you how to play your class thats one thing vanilla lvling did well at
---
You don't need macros at all tbh. I played 60 lock and 60 rogue  in classic, no macros did quite well.
---
I joined with a group of friends and we just picked Skullcrusher like you said because of the name. We stuck around there for a while then moved to Blackrock to play with some other friends. This time around those friends aren't really playing so I'm keeping my eye on different guild recruitment type threads here and there to see if I like anything that sticks out. Otherwise I'll just pick another badass sounding server, and hope streamers aren't on it.
---
Yeah but there was a lot of fun experimenting you could do for soloing, world pvp, other gimic talent combos.
---
And wow now is exactly as cookie cutter with talents as it was back then. I look up "Best warlock pvp spec" in 2019 the same way I did back then. Just now there are fewer options to get creative.
---
because they were shit classes and if you played them, you werent invited to raids.
---
Oceania didn’t have their own servers.. the community (wow forums) designated them though.. blackrock for PvP, proudmoore for pve.. originally rolled ally BR and got dominated by horde imbalance in the wetlands.. went h proudmoore instead until eventually Oceania got their own servers and rolled on Frostmourne upon its release
---
Is this the streamer that was sexually assaulted on a bus ride in high school?
---
Read the persons post
---
I see your a fan of *my hero academia* your definately good company :)
---
Obv answer being the one the only blizz champion Mr Cdew
---
And to think, there's a potion in Retail that does this for you.
---
&gt; Mount Hyjal - Similar to the original intent of the zone in vanilla, basically just finishing it.
---
Hyjal's an interesting one. I'd expect the majority of mobs there to be at least as strong as the demons in Darkwhisper Gorge, given how you get there. This would make Hyjal quite a large uninstanced dungeon. Perhaps it could have Abyssal Lord-style content where you work to summon and kill bosses. In Silithus the various bosses were designed to be killed by 1, 5, or 20 players. Here they could go a step further and have 5, 20, and 40-man bosses. Imagine your entire guild working together to summon a Spirit/Echo/Memory/Avatar (what have you) of Archimonde as the ultimate boss for the region.
---
Hey I was a human mage too
---
Salvor
---
I can't remember the name of my guild though, I transferred off the server to join some RL friends a few weeks before TBC.
---
This guy is correct, it's not pronounced that way.
---
i hope they add new content to classic. i just want them to follow the classic design principles and not just go to BC again.  a new fork of wow would be interesting to me
---
You shouldn't be slightly nervous. You should be very nervous.
---
A vocal minority of high level players controlling content (at the expense of fun for the greater population of CUSTOMERS) is what Blizzard has been known for since like 2009.
---
Literally 0 pay to win micro transactions keep trying
---
Sorry to hear about your curse of the flesh. Hope one that that cane be cured up for you.
---
*hastily puts on torn, bloody Alliance outfit in the distance*
---
Halt! No, that's an, uh... deadly injurious Dark Iron Dwarf with white face, do not fall for such a dubious plow, fellow Alliance friends. I, an Alliancian...member of the Alliance, who is definitely not affiliated with Hordes or any other negative type of Alliance, am here to tell you that this man and his crew are not to be trusted by us... *cackles* Honorable... Alliance humanoids. You would only be doing yourself a disservice if you let scum like this into the fold. He is definitely not to be trusted, in fact, do not even look at him. Keep your eyes facing away from him and his friends at all times.
---
Go with harbor, friend! As we Alliance humans do love to say.
---
*starts rapidly clanking away and disappears into the distance*
---
Like Herod's axe and shoulder but on mobs
---
Mothef... I *knew* something was fucky. I remember hamstring/earthbind kiting being waaaay easier than this.
---
you want that new skill at lvl 40?  yeah, spend 6 hours farming gold.
---
Which server type are you rolling on? I have a small group and we'd be happy to have you with us on day 1, but we're rolling on a RP server.
---
The fact this exists in the vanilla BETA is awesome.
---
Warriors, Paladins, and Shaman choose Gelkis.
---
Everyone else chooses Magram.
---
Don't think they need to word of mouth is a powerful tool that will be in play here, i see a  huge boom of new players incomming
---
What is your point? Anything someone says outside of stating brute facts is an opinion. I don't see what that adds to these conversations which are opinionated from the start. It is the opinion of many here that classic is superior to retail and they feel it is a more elite version of WoW. Not sure how a sentiment like that is surprising given that this is a sub dedicated to discussions of classic. You can bitch about it being elitism all you want but that's just like...your opinion breeeeeh.
---
no
---
Username checks out
---
YouTube has s bunch of guides already
---
I mean  more like just trash grey weapons or greens. Mobs that are holding anything that is not normal for them (like if its a mob that's model normally holds a 1 hand and shield) but they happen to spawn holding a 2 hander means they are going to drop that 2 hander 100%
---
Druid also doesn't have a weapon for ranged slot - relic, totem, idol I think. 
---
16% hit (technically 17% would be 100% hit on a level 63 but you are guaranteed 1% miss no matter what)
---
&lt;Wipes On Trash&gt;
---
Leveling? Okay, but that is like saying it is cool to have peaked in highschool.
---
Looks like a display bug, the health of the mage doesn't decrease when the 440 crit is displayed
---
This 100% used to happen, same spot in the gorge you described a twilight mob would visibly swing a blade of the titans at me that it then dropped aswell.
---
Even got a Screenshot of the dead mob with the blade in his hands somewhere on an old laptop.
---
This and your comments below are what I would love to see for new content in Classic if they ever decide to add it.
---
they shouldnt.  show people how awful vanilla really was
---
The druid one is pretty trash fyi.
---
I don't think so, the mobs just drop whatever, random loot table.
---
Naming yourself Ooga and spamming "kangz"... wonder if these guys are making fun of a particular group of people.
---
&lt;Molten Core Swim Team&gt;
---
He is talking about leeway, which wasn't in vanilla but came out near mop. Basically giving leeway to melee to compensate for lag, but it's suppose to be when running in the same direction and not rooted. Imho I don't want it at all in classic.
---
I liked the word play.
---
holy crap i couldnt remember my vanilla server but i think maybe it was malganis. what were some of the other early top guilds?
---
I was around more in the last days of BC and WotLK, but you would know my brother, Mythius, quite well :)
---
decedent - a person who has died.
---
descendant - a person, plant, or animal that is descended from a particular ancestor.
---
You're gonna die alright.
---
It's the last option.
---
The server and client did not stay in sync.  Ever x ms, they would sync up again.  There were ways to force a sync, such as strafing or jumping.  This was why you should not just run straight if you exact location is important (eg heigan dance).
---
An interesting side effect of this is that if two players stand together and run forward at the same time, each would see themselves as being further forward than the other, while third parties would see them as both being level.
---
Due to this, there was some leeway applied to ranges, while you were moving.
---
Hey man, not my fault that you don't get my humour.
---
I bet yo ass this streamer didn't even care to report this bug even with his chat pointing that out
---
They forgot to mention the bit where Classic is fun
---
Great job bro.  Very nice.
---
The ladder, Blizzard has a system in place called leeway.  Without leeway, you'd have to be walking in front of the enemy on your screen to hit them from behind on theirs.
---
If leeway is overcompensating you'll be able to hit people very far away while they're moving.  They need to figure out a middle ground because right now it plays like everyone has 1000ms.
---
Never too soon. Also, Happy Cake Day, Reddit twin.
---
At what stage did I say leveling? It is one of the strongest 1v1 specs AT LEVEL 60.
---
You know he didn't
---
Same goes each way! I’m just asking that the small minority of hardcore players don’t request Blizzard to drop phases real fast!
---
They can hardcore all they want and blaze through all the content they want!
---
Yeah thats actually pretty bad.
---
No i mean the fact that he randomly spawned with that weapon means he equips it and uses it. I sound crazy but I swear this was a thing.
---
Thinking like that is how the modern gaming landscape turned into a P2W paradise. The very idea of missing out on any form of content in the internet age has made it incredibly simple for companies to monetize people's fears.
---
As to your question, the problem with that is the people who pay these gold farmers are directly responsible for the farmers existing. No customers, no chat spam, no scams, fewer bots.
---
Leeway didn't come out till much later near the end of cata and start of mop.
---
Good thing I don't want to change and homogenize the classes at all. I just want to be able to play with my father who's been a paladin main for 12 years and I've been a shaman main for the same amount of time. I want totems, I want windfury totem back. I want classic wow mechanics but I don't want to be forced to play a shit faction in order to be my favorite class.
---
Shaman are the best raid healers in the game, and Paladin buffs are fantastic lol. Neither is a shit class, presuming you play them as healers.
---
Perhaps this is implied but the problem is streamers, but more indirectly.
---
Streamer X says "Oh we really need new content release, game came out a month ago and BWL is so boring."
---
Next thing you know you have 200 of this guys cultists crying everywhere about releases.
---
Okay, let's try it your way. Maybe you might understand it like this. 
---
Tell me one thing about the gameplay of BFA, that you believe makes it better than classic.
---
I will just as easily be able to pick it apart as you can about anything to do with classic. That's why I keep hammering this opinion point. You seem to think that because you have counter arguments about anything to do with classic, you are therefore objectively correct in your opinions. 
---
Maybe if you can see that it works both ways, you might just see why it's pointless, because your views are just opinions and nothing more. 
---
&gt;opinions can be wrong
---
. I know you have stated repeatedly that you think you know the difference between fact and opinion, I did read that. But you still keep making incorrect statements like this. It's getting embarrassing that I keep having to tell you this.
---
https://www.servextra.com/the-dangers-of-confusing-opinion-with-fact/
---
Please see point three. This is very applicable to you, and I feel that it would be a useful life lesson that you likely won't take on board.
---
I know what you mean he can spawn with a mace, but the mobs still drop random weapons or items not the crap they hold IIRC
---
Wands are super powerful. Especially if you go enchanting and create your own.
---
It's useful. I have looked at suggestions. Decided which way I am going then list the info. This makes it easy to keep the info visually.
---
I was talking to my friend (he has his head so far up vanilla's ass I can see him on the front cover) and he got drunk and started ranting about how kids these days are trash and vanilla will set them straight. I actually hate the idea of vanilla because it feels like blizz is catering to boomers who cant leave their game behind.
---
Faking that level one frostbolt
---
Hashtags don’t work the same on Reddit as they do elsewhere. On Reddit they just made your post cringe as fuck.
---
Looted a Taran Icebreaker in AV.
---
Some pieces of it are good. Head, belt, legs before bloodvine and gloves are pretty good. The rest is garbage for raiding, but very good for PvP. 
---
I guess it also depends on which phase we are in. Before ZG the legs are almost BiS if we discount the Kazzak leggings and the chest is pretty good too. Once ZG is out you'll just wear bloodvine on chest, legs and boots, head too if you are an engineer.
---
I always pronounce it The-white-mans-shampoo.
---
Seriously you are drunk if you think Barl’dun diggers have ever been alliance flagged but if you mean that they should be alliance friendly but are not then yeah that is a bug. Nothing in the faction controlled zones will cause you to enable PvP involuntarily.
---
This is what Everquest is doing. Seems like every 8 months or so they are releasing a fresh progression server. Some with various end points or rulesets.
---
Why get all that when you could just afk a paladin.
---
Wow, great job, very smooth and easy. I haven't seen anyone do the talent order, which actually seems extremely useful, great addition!
---
Only recommendation is to include "required level" or "current level", although it might be redundant with the talent order record at the bottom.
---
Can you please lay off the racism.  
---
https://files.catbox.moe/4jqpez.png
---
That's the thing that hurts the most about current WoW, they don't give a fuck about the lore anymore.  In vanilla the story still pretty much made sense.
---
They really needed Warcraft 4,5,6,7,8,9,10 between expansions to explain stuff instead of books and work hard to keep it as cohesive a story as possible with exceptions only for important game mechanics.  
---
A good story goes a long way.

For cross-faction mage agreements
---
What’s the con?
---
There's likely to be 2-5 servers with absolutely awful queues (As they'll be the biggest servers of their type), and pretty fine beyond that. 
---
With layering the likeliness of queues are far less. The concern is more after phase 1 when the 'big' servers go back to a vanilla server cap.
---
No barbershop either, so pick looks you like at the get go. Too many folks today just punch in a name and hit go figuring on customizing looks later.
---
let me tell you the story of my first character. night elf warrior. died so much my weapon broke at level 4. asked my sister what to do my weapon disappeared. she tells me i have to restart. so i did. a few characters later she tells me i could just repair it. i played wow on hard mode for a day.
---
It seems like people started changing their definition of p2w around when SC became big. I've always seen it as paying real money to get an advantage over other players. If I pay $300 for a Constellation then I will have an unbelievable advantage over someone who only has the starter ship. Similarly if I pay Blizzard $300 for full T3 when everyone is running around in MC gear I will have a huge advantage.
---
Unless you're in a toxic, yet competent guild. Which will be a lot.
---
Most top guilds are some form of toxic I'd say, and it spreads down.
---
How is everyone missing the most obvious point here?
---
The Tauren procs Windfury -- the attacks you see after the blink are attacks that already occurred -- the animation / damage is just delayed because that's how the WF animation works. 
---
He is not attacking him from that far away.
---
Still got room for a mage? Also a 30 something with a job. I'm have AQ and naxx experience from vanilla!
---
For real though, apparently [it's true](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/175887).
---
Elitist Jerks were on that server.  They were one of the top PvE guilds back in the day.  Shining Force was also on that server.  Ummmm, who else.....Oh, Giant Censored Robots.  Clan VXIX.  Keen Formation? I think.  That's about all I can remember atm.
---
Love this, very useful.
---
This plus the skills list that wowhead has would be perfect. Wowhead's skills list should also include the 'school' of the spell. So it pairs with talents that increase dmg/crit of certain spell schools, like Destruction.
---
The Dutch?
---
*Sigh*.. fine.
---
I'll use averages where applicable;
---
175 / 1000 = $0.175 per gold
---
0.15 / 1000 = $0.00015 per gold
---
Adjusted for inflation, it's 0.000196 per gold
---
So.. $100 today would get you:
---
571g 42s 85c in Classic
---
510,204g 8s 16c in Retail
---
Are you happy now?
---
Wrong. The only thing Blizzard has said was intended was the larger tauren hitbox/melee range. This is much larger than it's supposed to be, most definitely some leeway/lag fuckery.
---
I'll play hunter even if these are all in live. They will get fixed eventually. If they don't, it shows that they aren't going support the game properly, and it's not worth playing.
---
I dont think just leaving groups should be punishable.
---
There is nothing that says "Once you enter, you cannot leave by your own choice."
---
If you wipe 5 times before the 2nd boss of an instance, I'd say anyone has the right to leave at that point. If someone leaves at the first death, sure, I am annoyed and will remember, but I won't blacklist just based off leaving.
---
Otherwise, make that clear before every dungeon starts. "Anyone who leaves, I will remember and not play with you."
---
Despawn my butthole they f*cking kill the hunter.  I accidentally renewed my hunter friend and they got murdered in silithus.
---
Back in Vanilla I chose Laughing Skull just because I loved the pirate-touch to the name.
---
Later in Cata switched to Silvanas - in hope of more people roaming the lands on a high populated server: Nevertheless, that server felt pretty empty still.
---
That was when I quit WoW, because I would never meet more than approx. four people in any area other than SW, etc.  
---
Here is me hoping to see more people roaming the lands - rather than sitting in major cities waiting to be teleported the next dungeon/raid/bg using LFG feature.
---
It’s not a bug but an intended feature.
---
More Dwarves, especially Priest, as well.
---
If you find a gear that is past MC, they will still run MC due to a couple drops. You will get gear funneled to you. You can get geared pretty quickly in Vanilla.
---
Since blizzard thinks the "community" is the streamers I would keep an eye on how much they whine to figure out when phase drops happen.
---
I hope this is unintended because its way to far.
---
3 garrote, 3 rupture, vanish...
---
The audience is people who have never played Classic before.  It's intended to inform and emphasize the difference between the platforms, particularly in regards to Vanilla being more grindy and less convenient.   
---
Words like "limited" are less about sounding negative, and more about cautioning that old school MMOs will play differently than what modern gamers are used to.  
---
The tone is very frank.
---
You would summon people from the start of the instance to where you're at to save them trying to make their way back.
---
I know the zone isn't very popular, but did anyone else really enjoy levelling around 37-45 in Desolace? There was rarely anyone around and a lot of mining nodes available. The peace and quiet was nice on a PvP server sometimes.
---
11-60, 1-10 remained untouched through BC and I believe up until cata.
---
No trinkets, or banning specific trinkets, no resetting fights (mages/hunters cc'ing you and eating/drinking) what else did we ban back then? No hearthstones or pots right? Ah right, no engineering like MC helms. You know "real PvP"
---
No it’s still 5-8 it just the new system doesn’t really have minimal range so it screws the maths a lot
---
You want time from AQ40 patch to Naxx to be 3 months!? Good luck with attempting Naxx then. You need to complete war efforts for the server, have at least 1 person complete scepter quest, and then get enough people to get gear to attempt Naxx.
---
I think people forget how ward Naxx was in vanilla. I think it was 3 months after Naxx dropped for a guild to finally complete the raid. You needed not only top gear, but full consumables, and buffs. Trash respawned in 30 minutes. So that would be basically 2 attempts at a boss before you'd have to reclear. Most of the bosses and enemies hit for the same value that they did in Wotlk when you were level 80 with vastly better gear than T2/2.5 in vanilla. So I think that schedule may be a little quick. Also, you need to gear up 40 raiders. Most bosses in vanilla dropped like 2 pieces each for all those people. And until AQ40 where some classes shared tokens, you could get 1 or both tier pieces to drop for classes that didn't need it.
---
Compared to MC loot, r10 gear has more stamina but less output.
---
It's actually useful early on if you want to increase your health pool for certain fights.  However, if your only goal is output for pve then it really isn't worth farming the pvp gear (*excluding r14 weapons, which you wont get anyway).
---
I never stated that WoW Classic isn't a superior game in my opinion either.  
---
I'm saying that this infographic is an attempt to provide facts out of context that may sway peoples decision on whether or not to play WoW Classic.  
---
What is your point?
---
Gold farmers loot a lot of BoE items though.
---
Really great feedback, thank you! I'll look into that. :)

All melee have broken range when hitting Tauren.

I like these wpvp groups or guilds that do the weird shit like this. I would make a fan named Ioogatoo and is them.
---
You can change the current page's URL without reloading via e.g.:    
---
       history.pushState(null, '', '?class=priest&amp;talents=vhvMvNvOvP');       
---
You can/should continue to keep the existing Share box (in particular as non-HTML5 browsers don't support history.pushState()) but this allows users to simply copy the current page's URL for the share link.
---
Because that doesn’t fit the narrative
---
No, the total experience required was cut by 18%. Not every level between 11-60 received an 18% cut. In fact, all the cuts before level 28 were less than 18%.
---
holy shit some rise against for peak nostalgia
---
You seem to be using an outdated version of the original spreadsheet. You suggest Lionheart Helm for pre-raid Warriors, but that recipe drops from Ragnaros, so you can't expect it to be available before your guild enters Molten Core.
---
And to quote Pingaan:
---
Update: Changed Lionheart Helm to Mask of the Unforgiven in pp1/2 - Lionheart Helm recipe is a raid drop (silly me).
---
Otherwise great work! Love the visuals.
---
Like I’ve stated, this is what I’m terrified of. We power through Classic and they announce BC servers....half my guild leaves and moves onto BC and I’m left with a server that’s at like half to a quarter pop. Or even worse they roll out BC on Classic servers and you’re stuck in the circle again.
---
I HATED BC, so I have no want to play it.
---
I really doubt what your putting out since priest and lock have no downtime or should have no downtime if you do it right.
---
Not saying warrior leveling is horrendous. Definitely the worse of the bunch though. You have less oh shit buttons if something goes wrong and no way to heal. So auto attack simulator (read:paladin) May be slower but you really shouldn’t die as one, even if stuff does for tits up.
---
Like I said, I never played Vanilla. So I’m super pumped that it sounds like it’s going to be a longer time between phases!!! Thanks for hyping me up!!! :D
---
He isn’t actively swinging when he hits for 440, you know that right? That’s the butt end of a windfury proc lol, the animation is just finishing
---
Blood Gulch....  home....
---
*Crashes Banshee*
---
I don't recall this unless it was patched out before me hitting 40 but then it would mean it was way before 1.12
---
Plenty of words can have a negative connotation in certain contexts without being an inherently negative word. The people marketing this and know how to use words to bestow the feeling they want in the consumer.
---
&gt; Worldbuffs trivialize already trivial content
---
I'm inclined to agree. Ony buff for MC is a sweet sweet buff - especially for under-geared folks (or early progression).
---
&gt; Worldbuffs will be available in classic, day one, every single raid, trivializing progression, which is something pservers didn't
---
Irrelevant, but okay.
---
&gt; Timers won't help a damn thing, they will only make it a much bigger pain in the ass to get worldbuffs, and all the more infuriating to lose them
---
wjat? If folks don't coordinate when to drop a head, a bunch of people will miss the buff... And if you die, you loose the buff and have to wait hours. I don't see how this "won't help" considering it adds a bunch of scarcity to collecting world buffs.
---
&gt; Worldbuffs breeds a toxic raid atmosphere
---
This is anecdotal, but okay.
---
&gt; Ganking and WPvP with the specific intent of stripping someone's buffs is AIDS
---
Also anecdotal, but okay.
---
It’s a lot of keybinds, but it doesn’t really get unmanageable until you have macros and engineering shit and consumes.
---
At that point it’s so many buttons, lock is one of the classes with the most abilities and it’s pretty obnoxious sometimes but it’s definitely rewarding if you enjoy their gameplay. Obviously in raids it’s not a big issue just spam max rank shadow bolt and have your assigned curse on the boss and life tap when you’re low mana.
---
There was a bug/exploit where if you quickly resurrected your succubus after sacrificing it you would get both bonuses. I think it was patched out however
---
This is some UO shit. No I don’t think I have ever seen it in WoW or any other mmo for that matter.
---
Have you ever seen Raiders of the Lost Ark?
---
Well I think it’s because the names are reversed in Warcraft, stormwind castle is really just a keep in the the castle that is the city of stormwind.
---
oh shit! Dev feedback, awesome.
---
Believe it or not, that's actually how I had it before. Personally I prefer copying the URL from the browser as well. 
---
The reason I changed it is because the URL changes like 50 times while you use the App, and that sort of hijacks the user's Back button on the browser (have to spam the hell out of Back to get out of the app).
---
I couldn't figure out a way to do what you said and also not hijack the Back button :(
---
That's how it was in Pandaria when they first introduced the new talent system, each spec has quite a few spec specific talents
---
Maybe exp wise but definitely not quest wise.
---
Very nice! Used it to map out my preferred priest leveling [spec](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=priest&amp;talents=vjvkvlvmvnwlwPwQwRwSwpwAwjwHvYv4vUv9BfC8C9C_C.C~IXIYIZvQv0vVv7vXv5v6vTv_v.v~v-vqvwvxvrvvvtvgvCvDvovfvE).
---
It sucks
---
He gets a Flurry proc but I didn't see a Windfury animation. His attack speed was increased by the Flurry proc and smacked the Mage a couple of times from far away with said increased attack speed.
---
Maybe that's partially why your guild only got 2 bosses down in Naxx, no offense. Two bosses down in Naxx isn't a crazy feat
---
[Here](https://clips.twitch.tv/CorrectBrightHippoCopyThis) is a clip of frost nova (10 yard range) not hitting while the hunter is inside the deadzone.
---
Yeah because method and limit really determine when new content comes out? Umm no
---
No he isn’t, he’s finishing his WF animation.
---
Super useful! Great work
---
Given this is a very specialized product - whose target demographic is definitely not "new" Vanilla players - I can appreciate the need to set expectations.  
---
Agree to disagree, I guess, but I just see a matter-of-fact tone - nothing more and nothing negative.  
---
Vanilla is more grindy, less convenient, and more limiting.  Why hide the ball on that?  For some people that's appealing; for others, it's not.  The marketing materials are silent as to whether a less convenient game is a good or bad thing.  
---
Also, I think you're cherry-picking your language, but that's kind of a separate issue and not really worth litigating.
---
Is it for people who play BFA only
---
https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=priest&amp;talents=vjvkvlvmvnwlwPwQwRwSwpwAwjwHvYv4vUv9BfC8C9C_C.C~IXIYIZvQv0vVv7vXv5v6vTv_v.v~v-vqvwvxvrvvvtvgvCvDvovfvE
---
He hits him right before he blinks which procs the two additional swings after he’s out of range.
---
Unless you’re trying to say flurry is giving him 90% attack speed, it’s very obvious the two swings are too fast to be normal attacks.
---
Oh no... My favorite was making an account, getting it to level 30, putting my password into a keylogger site, watching for it to show up rich on AH and nabbing it back.  :)
---
/r/theydid~~themath~~notlinkthesub
---
Shut up donut
---
I don't see any wind, and it's extremely delayed for some reason if this is the case.
---
When you scroll on mobile, does the background here move around for anyone else? Weird.
---
3 1 p f 12 a f 3
---
I played a bit with y'all back in the day, do you remember Gannoth or Tzusanna, I was friends with them a bit. I played with Aurora mostly back then, but I think I stood in once with you guys in BC, idk if you played then but Huzzaj and Jharden are two of my irl best friends.
---
To start conversion on content releases, cool you understand now?
---
It wasn't awful. God, if you hate the journey so much I really hope you have an unfortunate fall so that you won't have to walk ever again. Cheers.
---
They did have leeway in vanilla and you didn't need to run in front of people to attack.
---
I hope they turn BC into zone raiding with the level cap staying at 60 and modifying mobs and gear. I know this is entirely unrealistic, but imagine the only way to play BC is by gearing up in Naxx first and partying/raiding your entire way through the outland. Would be epic.
---
Maybe of you want to survive them roll a Dwarf group of 3 identical hunters. Beerken Beerkeg Beerkin. At least then you have flare, tracking and can stoneform.
---
Why not mention how many less races too?
---
So those two swings that occur less than 0.5 seconds after each other and don’t consume a flurry charge are normal attacks? Lol
---
The two attacks are the WF procs from when he blinks.
---
Well.. I mean, it would start with me and Tyrande and Sylvanas....
---
... are you an idiot? Do you think this is a Warrior?
---
Best comment of beta so far
---
I think OP might think he's a Warrior 🤣
---
I hope so... they have a bunch of QoL from 1.12 it would be so weird to say this wasn't in at launch so phase 6.
---
Not saying people should get blacklisted for leaving with a reason, I mean people who leave after 1boss because didn't get their specific drop, flaming and leaving after a wipe etc. not people leaving because they gotta go irl/raid/whatever.
---
I loved it. Even back in the day it was basically empty
---
let me guess, this is due to spellbatching?
---
You are on crack if you think Activision spent millions on simply remaking classic only to let it die on the vine for a few years.
---
The only way this would have flew past those greedy fuckers is if they had plans to expand Classic.
---
It doesn't hurt you purists a bit for Blizz to open new servers for expansions while leaving yours alone.
---
Rogue, Mage, and Priest are my favorites, in that order. Which also happens to be the order of what I considered my “main” in the first 3 expansions.
---
I won’t touch Paladin, Druid, or Shaman in Classic. Hybrid classes got no love in Vanilla.
---
I am not denying that.   I am just saying there was no animation, and the proc seemed really delayed.   Even still, he was swinging a long way away to even hit the mage prior to that.
---
I hated that the rep grind for these guys led to nothing. 
---
I forget which one I hunted, but was disappointed I would only get to max honored (maybe revered).
---
Can you PM me the url that you tried? I troubleshoot the issue.
---
Likely a bug :)
---
There were stones, but they didn't work lol.
---
There’s a subreddit for that &gt;.&lt;
---
Bloodhoof could totally 1 shot me with a thunderfury proc any day... If you know what I mean :^ ]
---
Yeah, back in the day of BC we had a tauren tank for the stalker adds on the vashj fight because his hit range was 6m but the fear radius was 5m so it was never a problem. We just had to root them before it got to him or it would try to get in fear range. We used the shit out of the netherweave?(I think that's right) nets that tailors could make.
---
You can get a red glow (+2 dmg to beasts) for pretty cheap, probably less than 1 gold, depending on economy.
---
If all you care about is the visuals and not the benefits then it's pretty inexpensive.
---
If you choose Enchanting as a profession than it will cost you even less.
---
Good thing I have a 5 man group of IRL friends to play with :)
---
I know Titan Quest does this, but im unsure if WoW ever did this..
---
No, he was finishing his WF animation from when he hit the mage right before the blink.
---
Unless you think that the two hits (dodge/crit for 440) which occurred within 0.5 (hint: flurry isn’t that good) and **didn’t consume flurry stacks** were normal melee swings....
---
🤔
---
You are incorrect as it happens. They've always been a part of the Alliance, them and Bael'dun Appraisers are the only NPCs in the game that cause players to become flagged within their own faction controlled zone. Continuity of story reasons I'm assuming? But they're unique for this reason and I'm hoping this doesn't get forgotten or written off as an old glitch.
---
Very low level PvP was the way to keep people entertained on launch day before Layering. Alliance could go protect these guys and Horde could raid the Eastvale Logging Camp for that sweet Peasant/Lumberjack XP.
---
Hey! that's me! I remember that being posted back in the day. The names bring me back. Good ol' Rhave.
---
A buddy and I tried to do something similar in wotlk but it was weaker. Two undead rogues in similar gear. Our schtick was using as many toy/quest items/whatever to macro on our vanish so a bunch of bullshit would pop up whenever we vanished
---
That rule applies to duels, nothing else
---
As a frost mage in original WoW, I accepted that any fight where your snares and roots didn't matter was going to be boring. Unless you did something to [make it more interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opbiYnkvSys&amp;t=8m13s).
---
But in 5-person groups, I was confident that a frost mage was more fun than any other mage spec, when you were in a group that challenged you (because they were bad at the game). I felt I was able to shine with the (?) four-mob pulls in Scholomance: max-rank frostbolt on one melee mob (focus target), polymorph caster mob 1, counterspell caster mob 2, rank 1 frostbolt on last melee mob and kite/frost nova as necessary. Result, tank is only taking damage from one mob and the caster that summons skeletons doesn't have much opportunity to do so. Oh, and frost ward! Mage tank vs the frostbolt-casting mob.
---
No one considered using potions to be BM.
---
Can you cite a source proving it was considered bm? Can others confirm? This is the first I've heard of it. In a min max environment such as endgame, why wouldn't you pot? That's like saying it's bm to be BiS
---
Common OP dont make a Reddit post about something you have little to no experience on ;( so much wrong in this post, Hunters are required for many a fights in vanilla they can kite like no other
---
That’s the definition of p2w. You invest your money to be given a powerful item in game.
---
&gt; I think they even said you won't be able to buy ships with real money when the game releases.
---
Yeah...I’ll definitely believe them. They’re out there selling $1,000 digital ships.
---
This is totally putting a wet blanket on my hype, yo
---
Yea, Flurry increases attack speed by 30%. I guess the swings were too fast to be just the 30% increase? Not sure what the attack speed on that Axe is he was using. 
---
I'm really just curious because Blizzard officially said the Tauren hit box and melee range are bigger than other races so there's different things to consider. 
---
Did you see a Windfury animation? I don't notice one but I've seen Windfury procs happen without the animation before so I dunno.
---
Potions are consumables 
---
So are grenades and everything else 
---
It’s pvp kill or be killed not a demn school fight
---
I don’t understand how they haven’t been investigated yet. Such a huge scam!
---
Found Buzz Killington.
---
That first hit was well within the range of reason. Mage is jumping **towards** the **tauren** warrior and gets rooted in mid air. The next two are absurd, but they’re literally just the end of the WF animation, not normal melee swings.
---
What an insufferable infographic. Reads as a "reasons classic is more difficult and you're cool for liking it" because it has so little info.
---
Huh
---
You can get Revered if you save at least one quest. The mobs will stop giving rep at 1 point below Revered.
---
Let’s not forget the lobster traps for the fishing pole.
---
Those names don't sound familiar.  I got burned out grinding to Warlord and raiding Naxx and took a short break at the end of vanilla.  When I came back, I decided to roll on a different server for TBC, so I wasn't playing on Mal'Ganis by that point.
---
Things like a well timed FAP shouldn’t be considered bad manners. Just showing some dominance in a field you have first hand experience in.
---
HER gender??  /s
---
I duno about 'bm' but yeah it was seen is super try-hard to pot during a duel, similar to using engi trinkets or using resistance sets.  
---
I mean you could go and get world buffs and flask for a duel as well, but everyone would just think you're an idiot.
---
I've read a lot of takes in here, and most seem like they haven't played priest at 60.
---
Here's the thing, being shadow at 60 is refreshing - it's a nice change of pace to what most priests experience while leveling up. The DPS in comparison to what you're used to as being disc or holy is drastically different and very exciting.
---
Shadow priests are fairly good at single target damage and are one of the most resilient clothies, but they lack mobility and aoe damage.
---
Will you be beating the mage or warlock in DPS in 5mans/raids? Probably not, but you'll be a contributing member of the group in terms of damage. The common mantra is "lol raids only take 1 shadow priest", but that's not necessarily true. Sure, if you're a super hardcore guild, it makes sense, but there's room for 1-2 more with guilds that are just looking for bodies. In my guild in Vanilla, we let three of the priests would rotate taking turns as shadow.
---
My advice? Spend the gold and try it out for yourself. I switched in between shadow and disc/holy for pvp, and liked the play styles of both. I stayed disc/holy until Wrath, where I went shadow and never looked back. I definitely appreciated disc/holy more in Vanilla/BC.
---
No thanks.
---
What about something like this?    
---
    
---
     var delayedUrlUpdate;
---
     var oldTalentString = '';    
---
     ...   
---
     // Talent change event fired!        
---
     window.clearTimeout(delayedUrlUpdate);
---
     delayedUrlUpdate = window.setTimeout(UpdateUrl, 1000);
---
     function UpdateUrl() {  
---
              if(oldTalentString  !== talentString) {
---
                  oldTalentString = talentString;    
---
                  history.replaceState(null, '', '?class=priest&amp;talents=vhvMvNvOvP'); 
---
              }
---
          }       
---
This does two things:    
---
 - Throttles the number of Url pushes (this example is once per second, but you could increase it)    
---
 - Uses history.replaceState instead of history.pushState which when duplicate talents are selected won't generate multiple entries    
---
It doesn't completely mitigate the annoying behavior but does minimize the number of entries.
---
Its a cluster fuck to balance and makes no sense when you think about it. Why would no alliance race revere the elements, even as a group as small as Warlocks and why would no horde race revere the light or something similar.
---
\&gt;Only roughly 10% or less comes from honor kills.
---
Unless, of course, you were a ranged class that wasn't in the main raid and focus-fired one target at a time to avoid diminishing returns on honor gain. That worked until everyone automatically joined one raid. (I didn't play AV during this period, but it worked the same way with Hillsbrad/Southshore.)
---
I appreciate the post in attempts for new content here but damn I wish classic was available now so I wouldn’t lay in bed reading about castles vs keeps in this sub lol.
---
I'm  late to this thread, I was never worried about blizz doing anything. They've always been "you chose this.." the problem is definitely going to be mindless drones that support it as a player movement.  That said... if thats the case I'll be blacklisted.
---
Yes you could just on the edge of all of them
---
You know what will be interesting this time around? Botting! It used to be a huge problem but retail WoW fixed it via lawsuits. 
---
If there continues to be no commercial bots avaliable then WoW Classic will have a diff economy
---
Imagine having a clip you’re proud of and then decide to set it to a song like this
---
BWL/Ony/MC attunement, BRD key.
---
Yea I was going to go the opposite faction as I like to play Horde, but after seeing how hard it is to get a group going and the people you may deal with, I am going to stick with my friends for easy leveling.
---
i literally had more than 24 hours of lab time alone in some classes. Not including lecture time. Or homework time. Or studying. Or the actual midterm/final (3 hours).
---
I'm curious now, so lets do some quick mafs. Lectures/tutorials/labs was on average 32-35 hours/week. 12 weeks *2 semesters  *4 years is around 3000 hours. Not including studying. Multiply that by 2 to get the time it actually took me to study/understand what was going on.
---
/played  264 days 0 hours 0 minutes 0 seconds
---
I went to uni in canada for engineering. I quit WoW during WotLK because i would have failed out otherwise.
---
I frankly wouldn't trust you to be my manager.
---
Best video
---
I loathed BC. You’re on your own there bud.
---
Holy shit that's terrible.
---
Well then jokes on you then, the true endgame is doing nothing because you maxed heart of azeroth levels.
---
Hey Krafty!  Yeah, when I found this old video the names brought back all the nostalgia.  Oh yeah, I remember Rhave.  And I remember the name of that one warlock simply because he used to go AFK a lot, resulting in one of my all-time favorite lines during raiding:  EARTH TO FUCKING SEITAMAR!
---
&gt; After people have multiple max level characters, what's the purpose of new mid-level content? 
---
to provide choice for everyone else who isn't at level cap and those who are playing on alts. mid-level content is better for the overall health of the game than exclusively level-cap content. making content that is only accessible at level cap is how blizzard got themselves into overhauling azeroth with the cataclsym expansion in the first place.
---
You can easily see the actual speed of the weapon after he goes in melee range at the end. The time between his killing blow (the WF proc) and the swing before it is **much** longer than the dodge/440 crit.
---
WF also doesn’t use up flurry charges, and those two “swings” aren’t consuming any charges.
---
There’s like a mountain of evidence it’s very obvious it’s just a late WF animation.
---
Can confirm potting was a scrub thing to do in duels, wpvp fair game
---
Honestly I think its actually them being lazy. A lot of their decisions even starting in wrath were made to make the Devs jobs easier. If it was such a pain in the ass why would other MMOS be using them.
---
Do Flurry charges get consumed if the target dodges? The first swing after the Mage Blinked was a dodge and the next one a crit so that reset the Flurry charges to 3 anyways.
---
That is definitely from vanilla...I've never played on any private servers.
---

(I'm the gnome rogue in his group)
---
Ah, Felicia Day. 😍
---
I rolled on Thorium Brotherhood because I wanted to RP and that was the only high pop RP server at the time. The RP died out in Wrath and I transferred to Moon Guard because it still had an active RP scene. 
---
This time I have a group of people to coordinate but we're all rolling RP again for sure. I'm not sure how we'll pick a server if they release multiple RP servers this time. I know I want to stay away from the big streamers but something tells me that won't be difficult on a RP server!
---
Works for me.
---
You just want to murder baby Tauren
---
People are weapon swapping all the time in beta.
---
Don’t forget those wasted soul shards for people who don’t accept the summon.
---
Yeah, my comment was totally specifically directed at only WoW players AND specifically directed at the timing of releases. 
---
I'm so glad I was that crazily specific. Thanks for correcting my non-existent specificity.
---
I literally sleep like a baby dreaming of moments like this as a mage only main
---
Weird. I get a blank screen with just the site's background color.
---
i'm in support of asking for more mid-level content in classic wow. i don't think a classic wow with a level cap increase is what we should be asking for first. if it's at all possible to play through all of what was planned for wow's original release but delayed for expansions at level 60, that's something we should strive for.
---
I'm sorry but the story in vanilla and bc absolutely did not make sense.   I love classic as much as the next guy but let's not be revisionists.
---
Where are these facts and figures coming from? My entire guild quit in BC because none of us liked it.
---
Summoning stones weren’t available in 1.12?
---
I feel that’s wrong.
---
You're complaining about the entire goal of WoW. You're playing *in order to* reach a point where you've completed all necessary content so you only have to log in once a week and raid. I'm not saying I agree with it, I'm just saying that's how it is so don't expect anything greater with all this blind hype. The term raidlogging was literally coined specifically for WoW for all the same reasons that will still exist in Classic. You better expect to only level to 60, do a few weeks of dungeons and maybe a few raid attempts and then make your peace and hope you enjoyed your time.
---
Many people will fall into that category. I'd argue most won't even close to that. I think people are in for a rude awakening after an explosively popular launch.
---
Ultimately it doesn't matter when you quit as long as you had fun playing up to that point. Even the people that only made it to lvl 40 before they quit back in 2004 remember the game very fondly.
---
I'm personally excited for next time around when they reset vanilla in a couple years (they have to since the only way vanilla can survive is by doing seasons/cycles) and everyone's rose-tinted goggles will be off and people can approach the idea of the next cycle with a realistic view.
---
That sounds so much like my experience up until I read the name of your server I thought you might be Balantra, the r14 hunter from my server: Der Rat von Dalaran. We had him in our raid and he was top dps for a while because of the gear.
---
Now that I think about it, it was a female dwarf
---
Someone definitely fucked a horse for that to happen.
---
When I hit level 60 I had about 40g.
---

---
Gamon sends greetings
---
Classic WoW you play the class. 
---
Modern WoW you play the spec.
---
lol. Ganadar had some great lines raid leading. I wish i had recorded back then because it'd be a trip to remember more of if. They actually reformed in BFA and raided a bit before rl got in the way. I tried to jump in but couldn't get into the current game.
---
I plan on playing pve too. But I'm curious what the ratio will be. The majority of posts on the subject seem to indicate pvp. The guild recruitment threads seem to be filled with an overwhelming number of pvp guilds. It's really interesting to try and guess how it will be. I still think pve will be bigger by a lot. But the pvp crowd is certainly making themselves known.
---
When he crit the flurry timer did not refresh.

As someone who can't decide between orc or tauren, I'm interested in your reasoning for choosing tauren. Anything other than just liking the way it looks?

Ret Paladin BIS, where art thou...

Rogue here - I have such a hard time deciding between going for Riposte or +5% Hit first.
---
The site is very advanced and doesn’t want you to spread your “leveling as Holy” filth.
---
 2 : hard to separate, analyze, or solve a complex problem
---
This is the Webster Definition of Complex.
---
difficult to understand or find an answer to because of having many different parts: 
---
This is the Cambridge Diction Definition of the word Complex
---
Not easy to analyse or understand; complicated or intricate.
---
This is the OED definition of the word Complex. 
---
Using any of those three definitions of the word the current tress are "objectively" more complex than the vanilla trees. Yes the vanilla trees had more points you had to click more times but many of the clicks didn't matter. It were extremely easy to figure out which talents you wanted. 
---
BFA tree choices are not. 
---
Lets take the level 45 Fury row. you have; 
---
Inner Rage: reduces the cooldown of Raging blow by one second and increases its damage by 20%
---
Sudden Death: Gives your attacks a chance to make execute usable regardless of targets HP
---
Furious Slash: Strikes for damage and increases your haste by 2% stacking 6 times
---
So to make this decision you need to know; How much does inner rage increase Raging Blow's damage by, What percentage of my damage is raging blow, How often does sudden Death proc, How much extra rage will i get from the free executes, How much damage will i get from the extra executes, how many extra rampages will i get from the extra rage, How much uptime will i be able to have on Furious slash, How much does 6% haste increase my damage by, How much damage do I lose from not being able to fill free GCDs with whirlwinds, How much AoE will there be where i want to be whirlwinding over furious slashing. 
---
And this is ignoring how it will interact with other talents. There are far more decision points in picking the current talents which makes them more complex choices which makes the current talent trees more complex. 
---
Complexity doesn't mean more number or more options it means harder to discern or understand
---
This has been a topic since f2p games became a thing. What you're describing is what people nowadays call "Pay to avoid the grind," like Warframe and Hearthstone. A game becomes p2w when they let you buy better stuff that is only obtainable with real money. It remains to be seen if bigger ships will be objectively better than smaller ships in SC and how long it will take to get them. From what I've heard, bigger ships in SC aren't solo-able, they are more vulnerable, and they can't do the things smaller ships can.
---
Good question, hope someone answers it :)
---
What if the castle was named after the keep it used to be?
---
There was someone arguing with me earlier that every raid leader forbid hunters from having their pets out during the entire raid. Some people just hate hunters.
---
Tirion Fordring questline in EPL. It leads to some really good rewards and is just an awesome quest for the lore.
---
Hey, thanks bud!
---
Most players, regardless of beta or private, agree there's sort of an unspoken rule to not use potions during duels. Duels would get very expensive if everyone pots every duel. But it depends, duelers can agree to any set of rules before dueling, and in many match-ups it can be more fair to allow potions.
---
In WPvP anything goes, use your potions.
---
Only titles in Vanilla are PvP titles, iirc. The Ambassador title and other ones, like Bloodsail title, came later.
---
The best way to go about it, however, is to decide which faction's mount you want first, then *immediately* go there, rather than wait until level 10. You earn less rep per quest as you outlevel them, so those level 1 quests you did at 10 were worth less than they would have been worth when they were orange or yellow. 
---
Mind you, I'm not well educated enough to tell you if those quests would be green or grey by level 10, but I'd assume they likely would be green, and as such, the rep reward would be less. 
---
If you go immediately to the faction you want, you'll get exalted roughly a bit before 40, I think somewhere in the 35-38 area.
---
Hopefully clear naxx it's a long shot but I'm hoping, also hope they never change classic would be cool to log in in 2 years and pick up where I left off
---
‘abusing it’ on a beta lol
---
Awesome
---
Solid work. Thank you! I'll try to add that.
---
Same goal here. 60 main for farming and to run my fellow twinkers and alt out 29-39 twinks... The good life! I've been starved from that pvp ever since they the implemented exp in bgs and ruined it. I basically quit after they did that.
---
It’s a lose lose really.  Old Grand Marshal was epic, but the lengths to get it was kind of not fitting.
---
You were not judged by skill, more like dedication.
---
I can’t think of a system with 0 shortfalls, but the old system had plenty.
---
Auctioneer Wabang (the one on the right) all the way!

Here's an [intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JP6QpF9bm0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=84) covering its goals and a bit of where it is now.
---
Oh really?  I lost contact with most of those guys after Warhammer Online, I think it was.  But yeah, I think BFA is the worst state WoW has ever been in, personally.  I can't play it either.  Can't wait to get back into Classic again.
---
My bad, I thought it was weird that there were really fast autoattack animations but that would make much more sense. Still doesn't change my reply to the OP, which is making it sound like the larger "melee" range is intended by Blizzard.
---
Bolvar, the man who tanked Kazzak so I could level up all my weapon skills. That's what a real leader does.
---
The PvE server crowd will mostly be playing BFA.
---
Loved these, picked them up near other players, sprinted right up in the others players business then vanished. The elites would usually focus them.
---
Was he throwing rank 1 bolts at everyone? Why do that? And is this mage’s role in pvp to just cycle polymorph?
---
What about BGs?  I never used potions in BGs.   Bombs I think were kind of a gray area iirc.
---
That's still 1,000 people in your Barrens on days 2-3 of launch. Buckle up!
---
The warlock is used to pull all the adds.
---
A lot of the "hardcore" players prefer PvP, which is of course going to make up many of the players that are dedicated enough to download a private server client or subscribe to the subreddit of a 15 year old game several months before it's even released.
---
Once it's out we'll probably see a similar distribution to how it was in 2005, which IIRC favored PvE
---
It's maybe about duels. I don't play duels. In PvP I use all. Also, I love BM because I play undead rogue and gank alot.
---
Larger melee range is definitely intended, but there’s not any fuckery going on here, just your typical weird ass WF animation.
---
You ain't doin' no BRD then bro.
---
Yeah I'll be cleaning up here to avoid STV as much as I can
---
Rank 1 frostbolt has a shorter caster time and it costs a lot less mana but it slows and applys on hit affects the same as a max rank frost bolt.
---
I also get that, but if I refresh it works normally. Firefox latest.
---
The warrior in the video is using rampage. TBC patch sorry buddy.
---
I hope they never release anything and have classic like a stand alone rpg game that you can pick up and play at anytime
---
I would absolutely love to see your work! This is exactly the kind of shit I want to see if 1.13 were to happen
---
My only goal is taking down C’thun and clearing Naxx. TBC came out by the time we got that far. No time frame. Will get there eventually.
---
Well, 3 months per phase is almost exactly how it was in Vanilla. 
---
WoW was around for almost exactly 2 years before patch 2.0 dropped - November 04 to December 06. Considering WoW had more patches than Classic will have phases (i.e. AQ and Dungeon 2 are going to be combined in one phase for Classic, even though they were separate patches in Vanilla), giving us 3 months per phase would be pretty consistent with major patches in WoW's timeline.
---
Personally, I think 3 months per phase is perfect. That's enough time for the hardcore players to run MC before DM comes out. People who take their time with leveling might get into MC after DM but before BWL. And people who come late to the party will never feel too far behind thanks to the catch-up dungeons and raids.
---
Same as WPvP, anything goes when fighting against the other faction, your teammates will like that you're putting your wallet on the line to help win the BG. But potions can cost a lot. Stocking up on grenades, potions, etc, is an important part of ranking.
---
My god, the fact he even called himself out..
---
Bunch of cheesmo miners here
---
It wasn't considered bad manners on my server exactly, people just thought it was pathetic. To be fair, I played on a RP server so we weren't exactly huge on PvP. It's interesting to hear that people didn't mind potting in BGs and world PvP on other servers.
---
Yeah, i think it was warhammer a lot went too after we broke up before tbc. They reformed again in tbc and raided but i was more casual by then. I'm pumped for classic. I don't think many of the old guys are coming back, at least they weren't last i brought it up with them. I'll PM you the discord in case you want to post that video there. It's semi inactive but everyone is still a member i think.
---
Crushridge had outcasted a bunch of people even as late as WOTLK. There were a bunch of people everybody knew not to group with.
---
I’d argue that overwriting existing content got them to where they are today. If you add an expansion, allow character transfers, and keep servers of the previous version(s), then this wouldn’t be a problem.
---
Not sure what that means. I don't wear panties. Why would you want to wad them up instead of folding them?
---
In duels they absolutely did.
---
True, we did kill him after the 2.0.1 patch before TBC was released. Still vanilla though, IMO.
---
Druids get idols at around level 55, really late game stuff
---
Yup you are right on that 16% I can’t remember if expertise is factored in or not
---
Awesome!  Yeah, I'll check it out, thanks. :)
---
Disclaimer: i am aware that this "counter" ( fight fire with fire and bad joke with bad joke) does not work as well in the written word since it only works phonetically, but here it is anyway:
---
Stop lieing, I can hear you breathe.
---
It wasnt automated though and nobody really used it
---
"vastly more complicated talents"
---
Wat. People can't figure out gaining 1% spell cost reduction per level for five levels?
---
Good luck with that. My names are all undesirable and I'm keeping them to myself. I shouldn't have that problem.
---
BGs literally had their own dedicated potions that could only be used within. So I'd say fine.
---
Bombs and other consumables are definitely BM in duals however. Or were in vanilla.
---
Go have your mid life crisis somewhere else.

I always thought if it's world PvP and a 1v2 or more, you're allowed to use any and every consumable without it being frowned upon. For duels, I always thought the arena rules were pretty good -- if you use potions, consumables, or engineering, I think you need crutches to win.
---
I don't think it's a very popular opinion though.
---
Dueling, yes. I can get in board with that. Op seems to be referring to PvP in general though
---
The streamers and best raid guilds tend to go to PvP servers. They bring a large crowd with them.
---
Your biggest weakness whilst leveling is downtime between fights. A 6 second disarm could be the difference between surviving a double pull or not, and it'll certainly be the difference between requiring food or first aid after a fight.
---
But even against mobs that cant be disarmed, it does more damage than Sinister Strike at 1/4th the energy cost.
---
Reddit was about to revolt before that /s
---
Can say I'm ready for classic!
---
Warrior has always been my favorite, probably has something to do with Guts from berserk being my favorite fictional character and he's like...the perfect example of a badass warrior.
---
I play them in every game I have the choice regardless of if it's viable or not because anything else just doesn't feel quite right.
---
BGs and wPvP its fair game. Anything you can do to win.
---
"You're an evil Korean"  I laughed harder than I should have.
---
The one in the right, always.
---
There is one dirty little paladin talent for healing that offers up 100% mana refund for a Crit heal. So stacking shitty green items that help jack up Crit % made for some crazy ass healadin sustainability.

If i remember correctly you could communicate by just adding space between every letter. Like „h a l l o“. Is this true or just an urban legend?
---
The snares and CCs are worth a lot of damage for your melee up front. If this wasn't a premade I think most people would just go ham though.
---
&gt;Sylvanas
---
you know she is undead, right?
---
Well, i think tauren is best for pvp and the racials are not useless in pve.
---
Tauren get 5% more total health, helps pvp and pve.
---
If i decide to user herbalism (probably going mining + eng) i can gather sht faster.
---
War Stomp, shamans doesnt have stuns or any big cc so its a pretty good thing to have, also pretty good in pvp. while orc 25% resist to stun is not bad, u can't really trust it, and most of the time will be useless, while war stomp can be used to interupt, to heal, to chain lightning, to grenade or just to cc a bunch of mobs.
---
Also tauren has a bigger atack range, so it can do and receive mele dmg from a longer distance, and you can use it to hit ppl in pvp with something like an edward the odd mace, or any other weapon enchanted with ur buffs.
---
Also ive been told tauren hearthstone animation matches his healing animation so its easier to get a fake cast.
---
Spot on.
---
Complaining about someone using pots or grenades in a duel is quite petty. Especially considering that  you can always "/s pots/no pots?" before a duel anyways
---
PvP will be rough if they fly through content too fast. If they bring out the phases too quickly, it’ll be useless to PvP at all if you aren’t into the current raid. That’s something that does matter imo.
---
If you have a hunter that can’t control his pet efficiency I understand why you kick them but that’s just stupid. That’s just shows how many bad hunters there are though. 
---
It’s what has me so conflicted right now for vanilla as much as I love the class the bullshit stigma I had to deal with outside my guild was ridiculous and I honestly don’t know if I can deal with it this time round as I’ll probably only be a casual and not have the time to be in a high end guild like I was before
---
Oh my gawd. I'm just imagining now a huge forest pit ravine where you can only cross along the sides of the walls safely. Feels kinda like dark souls. I would love some risky altitudes to play on
---
That's not very Plus Ultra of you.
---
Personally, I think the phrase easy come easy go applies here. When you click a button that finds a group for you and teleports you to the dungeon, you have little investment in the run or the people you're grouped with. When you spend 30+ minutes forming a group and waiting for everyone to arrive at the dungeon, you're significantly committed. The majority of players are not going to rage quit at the first thing that goes wrong with that kind of investment.
---
Regarding your point for offspec/mainspec, the way I see it is everyone is leveling spec. If a druid is healing a dungeon, I fully expect him to roll on agility leather. The odds are he's leveling as feral, not resto and his goal is most likely to level faster/easier and not heal dungeons more efficiently.
---
This is nice. Thank you.
---
Found a few also, 2 are good 1 smells like cat piss
---
You should use anything allowed. Since everyone can use them it's fine.
---
This is a fine handout for tourists
---
Lucky these didn't smell like cat piss, just mold lol
---
Why are summoning stones not a thing. I remember them from classic
---
We have a true vanilla player right there. he comes here to the forums instead of using ~~yahoo~~ google/youtube.
---
/s
---
I enjoy proving people wrong too much. There isn't a more fun class in the game. Fuck what other people think.
---
I know I'm in the minority on this one, but I'd prefer casting frostbolt *without* a bunch of procs flashing up and cooldown timers going off.  It feels like I'm playing a game of Simon during the raid, and it kind of detracts from the RPG elements.
---
IIRC ganking people fighting stuff was also kind of bm.   I would find a lot of people in wpvp that wouldn't fight back.   It was kind of sad. 
---
One time I was fighting 2 gold farmer rogues in Feralas.   They were farming the water elementals, which I also farmed as resto, because I could kill them about as often as they spawned, despite my low dps.   I also liked to get the tubers and mana tubers.   Anyways,  I was fighting off both of them.   They kept spawning at the GY, and coming back though.   After like 5 minutes of constantly fighting them, and killing them, I eventually ran oom.   The guild offered to come help me, but I figured they must need the spawns more than me, and went off to farm something else.  
---
This story isn't that relevant, but it was a fun story.
---
No
---
What about people with jobs that let them play wow at work?
---
Shouldn’t you be buying store mounts with your minimum wage paycheck zoomer?
---
No pots is the unspoken rule.   If you want to use pots, you should say so upfront.
---
Arcanite xmute 5g!
---
I was fucking rich back then. 
---
I bought 3 epic mounts for my main because I wanted a pony.
---
Dont listen to this bad advise. You clearly bind shadowbolt to 1-9 so tjat you can conviently roll your head over the whole keyboard instead of having to snipe a special spot
---
That’s the World of Warcraft that you play!
---
Ya, Ya, Ya, Ya, Ya!
---
Well luckily the server won't have a new expansion where quest greens are replacing old raid gear.
---
If Blizzard was smart, after 1-2 years they would merge the classic servers down to a few with whoever stuck around. Then they'd let those stay classic forever, and start some new vanilla-&gt;TBC servers. Maybe let people from classic copy characters over.
---
Some people complain it'll split the community. Maybe, but if they upgrade classic servers to TBC, then classic is forever lost. TBC effectively wipes out Classic vanilla. I say the community split wouldn't be as bad as people think. Not when servers can maintain high pops via merging. Surely classic can fill at least one server even years from now.
---
When Chuck Norris is driving the Barrens wears a seat-belt.

It looks like it was just a delayed animation from the windfury hit before he blinked.

What about all the races that don’t exist?
---
And battlegrounds?
---
And dungeons?
---
Oh wait, it’s a circlejerk.

Imagine unironically posting this.

Looks great! Some typos need fixing though:

2. talent system is*

3. Gold is* vastly

Laughs in 30/0/21 Shaman
---
Always been common for no consumables during duels. World pvp anything goes
---
why?
---
I'm imagining the bottom being full of elite dinosaurs. You *could* go down there if you wanted but it's advisable to stay on the cliffs where the only thing you have to worry about are a few trolls.
---
Yep. Mages are cc bots in pvp. Much like locks are expected to have tongues on healers and fears on casters
---
Check this at 50 seconds and tell me again that it doesn’t bother you. 
---
https://youtu.be/UnyZR36_Tz4
---
hey, turn that no into a yes. you're supposed to agree not disagree
---
Exactly what I was thinking! Would be a really unique zone!
---
Just to chime in, as someone who played primarily pve on vanilla, it worked as a nice balance. If you ever want to allow the other faction the chance to gank you, because you welcome the fight, you can always turn on pvp by typing /pvp. On pvp servers, u can be prevented from doing content if people are persistent enough, unless you come back with reinforcements.  
---
I'll likely play pvp because my friends want to, but I'm worried none the less
---
It's great to hear you're not going to take me to court over this. Thanks for letting me know.
---
He's not talking about duels.
---
All that does is add more distance to your mailbox, time is money friend.
---
Classic isn’t supposed to be a rushed experience dipshit. They’re replicating the original experience they’re not here to cater to the ”hardcore” players.
---
World buffs are definitely going to carry over to Classic and they should. DM buffs are super easy to get and incredibly strong. Ony and Hakkar buffs require very little planning for a guild to have them for at least one raid every week. Felwood / Blasted Lands buffs will be reserved for the more hardcore players though.
---
Both can be good for flag running for different reasons, but most run a combination of talents to get the best out of everything. 
---
I.e. something like nature's swiftness, bear charge, and rest into Balance or Resto.
---
Maybe your thinking of water walking(shaman ability). The best is when you cast it on someone just as they jump off the cliff in mara after princess
---
I won’t be raiding and I’m also planning on playing off meta specs like holy/disc dps priest and balance Druid. I’m already at a significant gear disadvantage, not to mention my specs are not top tier. I’ll need to use whatever I can to be competitive. So potions and grenades, etc.
---
You’re probably right bud, to be honest I think I’ll roll dps war or lock and then level a hunter to just experience different classes. The guild I was in was pretty dam hardcore at the time and it was a case of we are clearing content so keep up or find another guild. Most of us didn’t have much time for alt characters but hey I had the time for that when I was younger and 2-4 hours sleep was more than enough to function lol
---
Others have mentioned duels, but I know if I got into an open world 1v1 and the other guy had to potion, I'd chuckle to myself. But I wouldn't consider it bad manners. I'd rather pot and live if it came down to it
---
In duels using consumables was considered bad manners. (besides 1st aid)
---
In world or BG PVP anything goes though.
---
I forget what pvp rank but one of them gives you access to potions you can buy for like 9s each.  I would refill my stack of 10 between BGs and use them constantly.
---
I was always a lefty.
---
Uh, yeah. The Alliance.
---
Talent systems are not really more complex.  There is always a cookie cutter spec that is best.
---
I'm starting to wonder if ice nova in itself is bugged, feels like you gain range when in one lmao. Anyone test this?
---
Aw man, I only have 17 minutes a week to play games in between my two full time jobs and my 10 kids.
---
This is sooooo dope. Seriously, great work.
---
Forsaken Priest. Nothing is scarier than a man/woman who exclusively uses powers that are extremely painful, because they are that devoted/faithful. Arthas made a big mistake letting the forsaken free, they're not going to stop attacking him until the Lich King is dead.
---
How is it BM? That’s like saying that you can’t have higher gear because enemy doesn’t have the same stats.
---
The end of the Gelkis chain gives a chain chest piece with a bunch of strength, [Gelkis Marauder Chain](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6773/gelkis-marauder-chain). or an off-hand item for casters, [Uthek's Finger](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6774/utheks-finger) (but there are more quest reward staves, so your chances of making use of the caster off-hand are slim).
---
The end of the Magram gives a leather belt with agility, [Magram Hunter's Belt](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6788/magram-hunters-belt), or a caster cloak, [Ceremonial Centaur Blanket](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6789/ceremonial-centaur-blanket).
---
Gonna roll a shammy so I fan drive by purge world buffs off people going to raids.
---
Once had a hunter drop on rend fight without dismiss his pet. Pulls the instance and then feints and hearth out. His dps up to that point was sub 100. Leaves group and we all just carried on without him and finished. Yes he wipe us but that's what you get for bringing a hunter. I felt responsible for bringing him.
---
your mistake is that you are basing your conclusion on a very narrow limited anecdotal sample , as i never have major problems with PuG back in Vanilla or Retail.
---
the key is communication between group members , most people will listen to advise (eg Warlock need to change pet or put it in passive , hunter need to rein in tank pet etc)
---
Hopping onto the box was the trick for the boats iirc.
---
PvE is always way more populated in any MMO. It won't be any different in Classic. Most people don't want to deal with getting ganked.
---
For some reason I read this as 40v40 AB and my brain said, "\#changes, yes please!"
---
This clip is deceptive. Tauren melee range actually isn't as long as you'd think by watching this.
---
Okay so here's what happened. When Stino was nova'd, he casted grounding totem and then an autoattack registered immediately after. Since he was still in the grounding totem casting animation, his auto attack animation was delayed. This attack, whose animation was delayed, proc'd windfury, which on beta (not sure if bug or not) triggers 2 additional attack animations DESPITE the fact that the first 3 hits register immediately. 
---
You can see how little his first hit in the clip of about 200 does to the gnome's health bar for reference. And then watch how bad he gets chunked by the 440 crit (which mind you was the THIRD auto attack). The 2 other drops in his health were from the mage's cone of cold and fireblast.
---
oh, interesting. i didnt realize/remember anything about reduced reputation gains based on being over-leveled. makes sense, though, other exp gains were scaled based on toon lvl vs. quest lvl.
---
forgoing the ambassador title, i am glad to hear i might be able to reach the rep. requirements for a non-racial mount prior to / just at lvl 40, meaning i could potentially earn a mount "on time". I thought i might not be able to get a mount through reputaion until lvl 60.
---
also, idiot me just realized there's "simple question Sunday" weekly threads, so i'll be reposting in there this weekend. thanks for the response!
---
Eh, wasn't the worst. Warrior was always preferred, Druids were solid, especially for AoE tanking with a group that lacks CC. I never recall Paladins being decent in vanilla though.
---
I’m not sure I understand the question, but for me I like the fantasy of a class that uses celestial magic. So I would be the guy who plays a starshard night elf priest or a balance Druid that mostly uses Moonfire and Starfire and talents into Moon Glow (still won’t play Moonkin though). I like playing specs that are not optimal, but doing my best to make them strong and playable in dungeons and in PvP.
---
I remember there being BM hunters doing Baron runs solo.
---
I remember we had one in AQ, but I think that was due to how the bosses worked.
---
No contest. Magram dwell in their own filth while the Mighty Gelkis commune with nature and exult in their caves filled with priceless gems.
---
That's pretty much my mentality. When I want to PvP, I'll PvP (bgs, flagging, attacking a city, etc). When I want to PvE, I'll PvE. It's all about having control over our own gameplay
---
Mobs run away in fear when they're on low health.
---
This is the most dangerous ability in the game.
---
I'm going to try out Warlock for the first time too. I'm a bit anxious as well but we've got this.
---
Biggest telltale sign it's a delayed windfury proc is by looking at when the damage comes in on the gnomes healthbar.
---
You see a massive damage spike come in when the gnome walked into melee range and took the hit and the rest can be seen coming from the mage. The shamans late autos don't show.
---
Yep. Exactly this. It was a different time in the industry.
---
I recently re-played through Halo 1-3 and thought, "Man, the gameplay as well as the storytelling holds up with games coming out RIGHT NOW." As a Bungie developer once said years ago, "It's about FUN."
---
Yeah mine were in my moms garage. I stored them in there when I was buying a house.
---
I was a holy priest running through DM before MC.  After getting my buff, one other person left. Came across an eye, couldn't kill it fast enough with shit DPS. Me and the other person died. 
---
Screaming ensued on discord about how this could happen. 
---
Stopped playing soon after.
---
"Get behind me"
---
That's my class fantasy.
---
How do you agro the whole boat in deadmines ? a runaway hunter's pet or warlock's pet ? i remember experiencing it once or twice in vanilla but it was so funny everyone break out laughting even after the wipe
---
Lfg na america 
---
Just any casual queer friendly people. Probably will roll ret pally.
---
Yeah, but being a Warlock made you more desirable in a crowded DPS pool.

It's all good, man. Let them rush it, blast through all the content, get bored, and move on and I'll just keep on truckin at my own pace. Regardless I feel like there will always be someone to party with.
---
The talent system isn't more complex, it's different.
---
Many old talents are now secondary stats or/and masteries, or/and artifact talents. And despite the big amount of talents there are only 1-2 effective builds for every spec.
---
This. Absolutely this. It's one of the biggest things I miss about those days, back when your reputation and actions mattered. If you got a reputation as a jerk, were prone to wasting other peoples' time, or the like, people would catch on, and pretty soon no one would group with you. This meant you couldn't get into the better dungeon groups, people wouldn't be inclined to help you with group quests, etc.
---
This went for guilds too - back then people tended to care about the reputation of their guild, and if someone in a guild was a jerk, oftentimes their guild leaders would step in.

OH MY GOSH I REMEMBER THIS ONE
---
Right, if a classic vanilla server is upgraded to TBC, then vanilla is basically forever lost on that server. Because it's better to just power level up and do TBC quests for greens that are better than vanilla raid gear.
---
So what they should do is start separate TBC servers, and offer copying characters over. Not transfer characters, copy characters. Classic vanilla would remain vanilla forever. Merging would allow them to keep high populations on the remaining classic vanilla servers, even if it eventually went down to a single server. They could do it this way for WoLTK too.
---
People say it would split the community. But it's better than forever losing classic vanilla. And a merged server is still not cross realm. You get to know the new people.
---
It was delayed because he casted grounding totem right before the auto that proc'd windfury. And also you can see his hands glowing green, which I think indicates a windfury proc? But not sure.
---
Just seeing this infograph makes me happy. Can’t wait for classic!
---
Sounds like you just lost a fight.
---
I must admit, I'm tempted to get a second account just to test botting again. Bots are bad m'kay? But I got bored with the game circa 2006 and tired botting. It taught me a lot about scripting and conditionals and LUA, and long story short, gave me the skills to get a job in IT which was the stepping stone to the job I have now.
---
Economically, I was not a very good botter. I think at most I ever had like 2000g on the bot bank. Procedurally, I may have had more fun making the bot react to circumstances as closely as a human would, than I ever had actually playing the game outside of raids.
---
Back in Classic, every time some scrub health potted in a duel, I'd pop a limited inv pot. You wanna pot in a duel? So will I.
---
DMT + Ony + ZG buffs are very easy to get though. One group runs DM before the raid, then summons everyone else to get buffs, while the guild makes it a requirement that anyone who loots the head or the heart can't turn them in until the next raid so that the guild gets the buff.
---
I really don't see a problem with those buffs. They do make the raids much easier and trivialize progression - I won't argue that - but getting those 3 buffs every single raid should not be an issue for anyone.
---
We spent a long time thinking of this name &lt;Substantial Liability&gt;. It is comical and yet sums up the efforts of a few individuals as well as the whole guild.
---
From memory, Paladin damage is pretty decent low levels too. It's only around 40+ where you really start to notice you're lagging behind.
---
5 Paladins trying to do BRD in their mid-50s would take about a week.
---
now you've created the problem of realm bloat which blizzard is trying to avoid, thus developing layering.
---

---
I would solo a lot of bosses in BRD on my druid.  I would solo the head and leg enchants and other bosses for fire resist gear etc.
---
Other classes like pally might be better but you can skip all the trash on a druid using stealth.
---
I was full resto most of the time so you can basically live forever as long as you had a couple seconds to pop out and heal before going back to bear form.

To me 1K gold is worth a lot more due to the fact that the first 1k gold goes towards epic mount... getting around faster is a sound investment that builds up over time.  Just like flying in TBC 5k was a lot but it paid itself off and then some at the end of the day.

This was a later addition, in TBC or so. Classic required you to fund or craft your own.

I'm pretty sure I read a (blue?) post about it, but I can't find it, any chance you have a source?
---
This is the video that got me into WoW
---
The big ones are all saying they will go to PvP realms. Think of camping as free content.
---
I think this is the best solution.
---
I think I threw mine away.  I guess I am fucked.
---
It’s basically why you let so much shit slide in vanilla because as long as people weren’t wiping the raid, it was manageable.
---
Entering combat as a warrior is like entering combat as a mage... if you entered with no mana, espeically in the earlier levels with no talents / shit gear.
---
I'm more of a fan of the classic+ approach.
---
Blizzard has already established all this multiple timelines, alternate dimension crap.
---
Lets just say Classic is the timeline where the dark portal never opened.  
---
Karazhan is already in deadwind.  They can release it scaled down to 60.
---
Caverns of time already exists, they can use it a hub to enter raids scaled to level 60 and 40 players.
---
All the Ulduar lore and a portal to nowhere already exists.
---
Or, if Classic remains super popular a year and a half down the road it might be worth releasing it's own expansion that keeps the classic game-play decisions in mind.
---
Didn't people 5 man Loatheb in the 2.0 patch? Probably shouldn't brag about 2.0 Loatheb kills...

Welcome back, Banjo c,:
---
You can.  I mean I did it on my Druid.  My guild cleared Naxx and I had 30 points in feral for a lot of it.
---
Most of the time I would heal or be spamming decurse / depoison depending on the fight.
---
I would DPS bosses when we had to many healers show up and tank things such as the trash mobs before Cthun etc.
---
Truthfully though it wasn't that amazing outside of PVP/solo content and for progress I would respec full resto because it was much better for the majority of raiding.
---
I hope we're not playing on the same server.
---
Really?
---
Know this. I am an alliance holy pally. In BG's, I will piss you off. I will cleanse your shit off, I will throw all my blessings around to destroy your cc and I will allow my teammates to murderize you. And if I can drink a potion every few mins to help piss you off even more, I will swallow it like it's Gatorade. Good Gatorade. And that, will go along greatly with the taste of victory.
---
May the best Mumbo win.
---
Definitely a bug. Oops! This is fixed now. Thanks so much for the feedback.
---
Yeah, I actually started in TBC but idk if I'd call the talent system "more complex". Everyone had for the most part the same cookie cutter build. I'm all for classic, but let's not lie to ourselves
---
I made one that yelled “I need an adult” when I had agro as a healer. It was fun to use sometimes, until I got into groups with a bad tank.
---
Is that how bombs worked in vanilla?   I thought it stopped casting the second you moved, just like any other cast.   He started casting, then moved, and then stopped to throw it.
---
Hearing ooga and thinking it relates to black people makes me think that's you projecting lol
---
There was a video I saw at one point where a guy became a millionaire by selling wow gold. He had dozens of machines going all the time and was botting. Think this was before blizz cracked down though.
---
And even Esfand admits that the amount of effort to make the DPS ‘ok’ competed to other specs is huge.
---
Paying to get a level boost? Paying real money to buy useful items on AH? Nope. No pay to win mechanics at all...
---
Shaman best class from 1 to 59. Then it all goes downhill once you hit 60. Shaman in skirts make me sad.
---
Hey mate, that is very cool looks quite well made, UI is very nice and lightweight.
---
Not a dev myself but a sysadmin though I can appreciate the hell out of this. Good work OP.
---
As someone who only has played PvE realms since BC, my friends and I are rolling PvP server. Something about classic makes world PvP actually fun. I always have a few members I remember from the opposite faction for either being a good guy or constantly fighting.
---
Always the guy on the right side!!!!
---
Oh, I like having one or so in guild for those niche situation where the strat works better or due to having sub optimal comps. No raid is perfect so it's nice to have that or a resto druid wanting to respec.
---
Quality &gt; quantity.  
---
Flying ruined WPvP.
---
This is partially my reasoning- I was originally alliance back in vanilla and it would be nice to not be on the dud end of WotF and hardiness
---
Possible bug: if you fill out a talent tree, then remove a point from the top, everything lower down that requires X number of points higher up, de-selects. However, the "order" list at the bottom doesn't fix itself properly if you have other T1 talents in, that don't require the points. So you can end up with a talent order that tells you to put points in Tier 2 talents at level 12.
---
Example:
---
https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=priest&amp;talents=vYv4vUv9BfC8C9C_C.C~wgvRwXwYvQv0v1v2v3vXv5v6vTv_v.v~v-vSwTwUwVwW
---
Then if you rightclick and remove 3 points in Improved Renew, the order tells you to get Divine Fury (T2 talent) at level 12 (impossible to do):
---
https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=priest&amp;talents=vYv4C8C9C_C.C~wgvRwXwYvQv0v1v2v3vXv5v6
---
You could have just said "Classic: everyone wants to play it. Retail: no one does." And you would've gotten my upvote.
---
I've only done the "full content cycle" (start at MC, clear all the way through Naxx) on Warrior and Paladin so far, so that leaves me 7 more classes to do it on.
---
unless if you were a class that doesnt want to trade autoattacks, like any class that isnt a warrior and maybe a shaman
---
Yes! I basically did that but on private servers and I would come back and, "oh look, another server shutdown". Then began the process of looking for another suitable replacement.
---
I'm just glad to finally have a stable home I can come and go out of, stress free from worrying if the sever will shut down and loose progress again.
---
Their hitbox is also larger. It's good for melee vs. ranged but it's not outrageous.

Might be a repost, but it kinda accurately sums up the biggest reason why I like vanilla: it has "problems" for you to work around and overcome. It just has the perfect ratio of work-to-reward for me.

Imagine actually spending money on wow instead of paying for everything with gold
---
There used to be a bm hunter that made vids soloing 5 man's.
---
SFC sounds stupid /thread
---
i don't understand the point of replaying the game in PvE. The whole fun of classic will be at release when everyone is leveling and you can actually interact with people/have world pvp battles. PvE servers will be dead.
---
Warrior is probably the coolest in my opinion.
---
 In a world of spooky magic and dragons, a warrior with no special ability, but through the sheer strength of his willpower and determination is able to accomplish supernatural feats.

I literally watched Asmongold get summoned into ZF two days ago. Though, his full group was already in the dungeon and he was summoned to a different part of the dungeon.
---
This isn’t true. Theorycrafting videos, namely Melderon’s in depth shaman leveling guide, have shown that there’s virtually no DPS difference between the weapon enchants
---
Cool man. Never thought of saving a quest for the bump. I also thought that getting to that point would unlock more quests.

Legit once pugged a shaman on a TBC server for Lady Vashj to kite the striders. Not only did he do it perfectly, he joined the guild to raid with us for the next to years. We were a US guild, he was from EU.

You're welcome.  With a name like "pedantic--asshole" you really reap what you sow.  
---
Also, +1 on the deflection.  It went very noticed.
---
it's funny to see everyone whine about how "cookie cutter" builds were in classic. I played classic, yes there were builds that were the best build for that spec...and most people were not playing those builds. And they were not getting kicked from raids for not playing those builds, because filling a 40 man raid was pretty difficult except for the top guilds . . . which most people were not in anyway.
---
Right ofc. Closest if you are running in from the bank or the entrance of Org.
---
Bombs cancel on movement, grenades do not.
---
I predict something else as it happens every single time. Once Ragnaros dies about 7-9 days after release, a lot of the non-Hardcore people will be crying instead.
---
They will argue the game is easier than back then. It should be impossible. They will argue that MC should have been closed. They will express how they feel that they are already too late to the party. It will significantly de-motivate them.
---
Rly? Shit, i've forgot so much.
---
Nobody said anything LFR about being end game content but I do think it takes away the awe of seeing a raid for the first time. The only way to get ready for raids in classic is through dungeons and the majority of the player base favors creating their own groups. Reason being is it adds an additional social element lacking in “auto groups”. Not only that you can make a more dynamic group where loot can be distributed evenly. Don’t be such a salty zoomer next time.
---
Love each aspect of it 🖤
---
Forsaken preist all use shadow spells, they mask them as Holy. (In lore) though it has never been showed other than just being said by blizz.
---
Atleast thats how blizzard shuts down undead paladins in the future.
---
Classic really does not have as much content as you make it out to be honest. 18 months is already quite long. It's not without advantages, it caters to the people joining late. But if you are asking for 3-4 years then you will be disappointed.
---
Bombs are different from grenades. He is using grenades, which behave the way you're seeing.

Weird how you’re leaving out the “kangz” bit when that’s used by racists to make fun of black folks on 4chan/other alt right turds. Lemme guess, you’re a ‘race realist’?
---
Just allow to copy your character once (unless that is already what you mean).
---
Okay. That explains why no hordy answered 😂
---
I think they used "keep" as a synonymous of "fortress". Fortress differ from castle because they are typically build on difficult zones to reach as an environment defence (but not always), and principally because fortress (keep in out case) are not dwelled by the feud lord, but from an agent of him.
---
Ps. Don't base this debate to much on definitions and stuffs, because over the centuries the name of fortificated places have been greatly changed, so in a century you can find a citadel called fortress and in an other a fortress called castle.
---
So a keep is not only a tower, but as his name say, it's a strategic outpost with watchtower functions too.
---
k thx
---
Seems like you can pretty much break it real hard by just undoing and redoing talents, since they get automatically removed from the list then added back to the end of the order.
---
I really don't know if it's worth all the hassle of automating though. A warning + instructions to refresh to redo might be easier.

Edit: Oh yeah, neat tool by the way though! Definitely going to use this to help friends.

They couldn't get hybrids to work. There were continual complaints over the "5% hybrid tax". So they embraced specialization. [The Rise of Specialization](https://web.archive.org/web/20100709002722/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=25626290449&amp;pageNo=1)
---
But, perhaps because when you only have one goal it's more likely that one choice is better than all others, talents still weren't a 'choice', as you would still pick the talent that increased damage by 2% per rank over all others, so they decided to remove all the filler talents and focus on a few big ones, while further solidifying specialization. Instead of being able to branch out from your specialization after spending 31 talent points, you never could. In some cases, like with druids, they still tried to encourage a hybrid playstyle with a cooldown that greatly helped your non-primary roles, but I don't think their efforts were very effective.
---
I don't think removing a hybrid playstyle was the right choice, but at least they consciously went that way instead of it happening gradually or because WoW's maths didn't support hybrids (example, stats on gear which led to Vengeance mechanic so tanks would see bigger numbers, which evolved into removing most defense stats as Vengeance had its own problems).
---
I’m pretty sure this is literally where KEK came from. 
---
It translates to L O L cross faction.
---
It wouldn't *increase* the flow, it would just change the way you interact with quest dialog.
---
If it features auto-accept and complete, then it would be a min/max level of improvement (like 1 second or so, depending on your personal speed to click buttons). But its nothing like super drastic or must have.
---

That being said, this addon looks HAWT! 10/10 would install.
---
A few days ago, I (mage) was fighting a rogue and we were both 1 hit from death. I'm running in a straight line and he is chasing, I hit arcane explosion (10 yard radius!) and it completely whiffs, no resist or damage. About 0.1s after the AE, he sinister strikes me and I die. Not cool.
---
Honestly the only positive thing on this for classic is the multiple levels of abilities, the rest are negatives or neutral.
---
People will try to say the talent system is a positive but anyone who played in those times and now know it's no different.  There are still only a few visble options to pick just as there are now, then they just gave you more buttons to click and feel better about clicking, it meant nothing for gameplay.
---
I raided as a warlock back in vanilla it wasn’t too hard don’t let your dots fall off spam shadowbolt life tap when oom rinse and repeat.  PvP as a lock was a blast the succubus and felhunter were my two choice pvp pets. In classic I’m torn between playing shaman which has been my since late BC  and going back to a lock.
---
Excuse me if I don't feel insulted by the words of some incel kindergarten dropout.
---
I can't wait for the economy of classic to not be completely fucked
---
I pity all of you.
---
Losing a BG means less honor. I'd never hold back on a few gold for consumes if it meant I could win the game for my team. At 60 you really aren't world PVPing as much as when you're leveling, so it just seems like a waste not to use consumes in BGs.
---
Ahh, fair enough, yeah - I think that is fair game while leveling.
---
I kind of like the facial animation, because it reminds me of WC3, but I am not sure about the rest of it.
---
Nope. Orc circle jerk is out of control. They’re great for 25% of stuns, but against classes that don’t deeply rely on stuns in their Kit Tauren is better in PvP. All the Orc theory crafting all these years occurred on pservers that didn’t have the Tauren range.
---
Because it's not viable. It does suboptimal DPS, which is fine. However if that's the way you're playing, then BiS doesn't matter.  
---
That said, the Arms BiS list would be extremely similar in terms of gear - You'll need 9% hit rating (6% as human with sword/mace or orc with axe).  
---
Bis 2h axe:  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=12784](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12784) . I think phase 1 there's no sword comparable to this, so until you get MC sword, you'll be using this as arms.

---
I mean uldum in vanilla makes so much sense to be because there was a quest chain that talked all about uldum and opening the door, but nothing happened with it. Don't forget the Emerald dream, they already designed it a bit, would love to see that a zone or something.
---
Lvl 60 in Arathi? Wut
---
Middle. Always middle.
---
In PvP Tauren is better against pretty much everything besides Rogues. In PvE Orc is better
---
It doesn't matter what I want or what the vocal minority wants. Bliz already stated that they will keep up Classic 'forever and ever' even if only a handful of players remain interested.
---
What I think is if the majority of classic playerbase will play both versions then Blizz will count that in and it can affect the timeline of the phases.
---
This is the best comment of this entire thread.
---
There was no dual spec in classic wow. So best way to change between specs is max lvling two same class characters :)
---
Also practically raiding was limited to certain specs. For example
---
Warriors were only tanks. Druid and paladin tanks were not welcomed due to there was no gear for these specs. Actually they were can only be accepted as healers.
---
I not looking to min/max the speed in which I accept and turn in quests. That’s not what this add-on was created for IMO. It’s called “Immersion” for a reason. I edited my post a tiny bit to maybe better ask my question. 
---
I never used any questing UI addons in WoW, and with Classic coming I’m trying to find ways to update various UI’s. This addon gives the quest UI, IMO, a very nice visual update but I’m also curious how it’ll change the way the questing experience feels in a way.
---
Can Taurens ride mounts on classic?
---
The 5 man was legit too. No exploits. 2.0 talents were just that overpowered.
---
Too many of us are so addicted we have to sort by new because we've seen every other post already.

Oh yes, back to the days when the difference between a good dungeon group and a bad one was knowing how to use CC, paying attention to the marks, etc. I miss those days - it's been forever since dungeons were that tricky. Now it's all go go go, face roll or quit.
---
i agree, but i have a feeling we are on totally opposite sides of the issue. i feel like a small number of casual players ruined the game for the majority of players. it sounds like you are saying that a small number of hardcore players ruined the game for everyone else.
---
All the way right, every time.
---
I wouldn't. Orc is still going to be best in PvE and great in PvP with the stun res. Tauren will only be good in PvP and that is IF they keep this as is, but you know they are going to change it before launch, so it isn't worth rolling tauren either way.
---
Another one, but Alliance specific.

---
lol even as a joke this sentence annoys tf out of me
---
Works great, but on mobile browsers something funky is happening with the talent tree icons. They keep flickering to all one type when you add a point.
---
Also a mild annoyance on mobile is that there is ability to “right click” to remove a talent point.
---
&gt; yet in vanilla they had to have lasted around an hour long (maybe longer).
---
Do you have concrete proof of this or is this just your personal opinion?
---
Dungeons are definitely more accessible as a result which caters to the average consumer so I get why they did it but...
---
Do you know how many times I’ve died in shadow fang keep?  I could right now describe the layout and how many mobs are in the courtyard and where they are because I HAD to pay attention or we would wipe.  I couldn’t just aoe shit, mobs ran away and brought back other mobs.  I know the old layouts, I remember the detail put into the dungeons, and I remember the reasons they were there because they were so involved.
---
I go as far to the right as I can in almost all things. Frost tree is even furthest right possible spec.

---
I never stayed in Desolace long enough to care about which one I picked. Mostly just killed whichever one I felt like at the time and was mostly unaware of any reputation grind.
---
Yes no DPS difference however with WF you can overkill
---
I ran straight to the troll village, did some underwater quests, and ran straight to Feralas (the greatest zone of all time).
---
"Filler" talents were optimized for a particular part of the game, and in some cases there were viable talents even there. Some talents were just bad. I think Improved Rend falls into this category; a comment from 2006 says it made Rend do 60 damage per tick? But the talent description says it only increases damage by 35% for three talent points, and the base damage per tick is 20. Turns out that comment is from 2.0.1, where the talent added +75% damage. Was probably still a useless talent.
---
So you did have some 'cookie-cutter' specs, like the daggers rogue spec that you could recognize just based on the numbers. I think it's 21/8/22 from a quick look at the talents, and a search for that string turns up many results. But a rogue who also did PvE could easily be forced into a different spec to be more successful there, and you would frequently encounter players with very different specs. Even for mage (with talents like "increases fire damage by 2%"), after the mage class review there were elementalist mages, a spec featured in videos like Vurtne 3 and 4 and Albis - Rage of Angels.
---
Rawwwr
---
Nonetheless, that's how it went in vanilla and even in BC. It was far more effective to sacrifice the pet rather than to try and manage them. As others have mentioned, pets didn't have avoidance or any of the other things that today keep them alive in raids.
---
I pretty much completely spaced out on mobile integration. That might be fairly challenging, but I'll try to think of something. Thank you for the feedback!
---
Yea yea yea, what's up it's yo boi Darnell.
---
I wish they disabled addons in classic tbh. I don’t like having to use them. 
---
“But you don’t have to” is the usual obtuse response I hear. 
---
Yes, I think they do a fair bit of damage to the universal experience.
---
If your guild is using them, why would you "refuse to use them"? Just stand in Org/that island for ZG and get the buff. When people say "just don't use them", they mean don't join a guild that's going to require them, or don't lead a guild that uses them. 
---
If you're trying to do some kind of competitive raiding in Classic, this is literally what you've signed up for. They were in Vanilla. They should be in Classic. Just like Vanilla's awful and toxic R13 grind, which they explicitly said they're keeping.
---
Well, depends on what YOU want. Retail still uses the old way of reading quests. So if you find that a bore, then by all means look or make an addon.
---
If you want an "authentic" experience, meaning as close to how it was as possible, then dont.
---
It only changes the experience you have interacting with the quest text. Which only you can really decide if thats what you want.
---
Imagine being *that guy* always in the comments complaining about the music.
---
100% agree with everything you just said.
---
Jesus Christ we got to accusing people of being “race realists” fast. Holy cow. This is a forum for discussing Classic WoW you wanker.
---
There are some areas in the game that female models can squeeze under and males can't. Nothing to really be concerned about though.
---
If you are rolling Tauren because you like them, go ahead, but if you want to roll them again just because of this, it would be fixed before launch. The extra small range increase was in Vanilla and will always be there, but not like this. That range is also not as ridiculous as it looks. He got a Windfury proc and the animation is delayed but always goes off, so it looks like he is attacking from really far away, but he isn't. The mage ran to him to nova which is why he got hit once, the next two were just the WF proc.
---
I'd also suggest Orc if you don't particularly care and just want efficiency. The extra Axe skill is HUGE in PvE and will help you reach hit cap way easier. Orc is also great in PvP with stun res racial, whereas the only benefit to rolling tauren is the okay stomp for PvP and the small melee range increase which is only helpful against ranged classes since melee hit you from the same distance due to hitbox.
---
I love you
---
Yes... when they were afk.. but not when they had to do raids, dungeons etc... you had to actually meet up with people and travel to the location, especially on the ground. Flying mounts and dungeon finder made getting to places completely pointless.
---
It was made as a way to advertise a website. Nothing more. But if people learn from it, that's fine.

You’re right. Thank goodnes no one gives a fuck.

If you're going to throw sass at least make sure you're in the right. I actually did search for a while before coming here and I couldn't find any comprehensive lists. Yea there's a ton of guides for things like the Ony Attune or the BRD key but I'm not looking for guides, I'm looking for a "to do list". Off the top of my head we have
---
* Ony Attune
---
* MC Attune
---
* The Scholo key
---
* The BRD Key
---
* Searing Gorge Key
---
* Maraudon Staff
---
* Skull of Impending Doom
---
* Carrot on a Stick
---
* Nifty Stopwatch
---
And I'm sure there's a bunch of stuff I missed (Which is why i'm asking about it here)
---
Get em ;)
---
I don’t even remember commenting on this comment... weird
---
At max level in good gear he will have a lot of spell power and his max rank spells can burst people down, but at low level he barely has enough mana to kill a single person.  His control spells are all super cheap and can setup kills for other players or harass enemy players and prevent them from getting to the fight in the first place.
---
!remindme 70 days
---
Get this man a job making new zones for wow classic !!!
---
True, although there are PVP potions available at rank 6 which are very cheap but can be used anywhere.
---
I like DPS meters, but the game is better without things like QuestHelper, GTFO, and DBM imo. I don’t think addons that tell everyone what to do are healthy for the game.
---
Is suicide an option if neither of your proposed options are even worth considering?
---
(Obviously /s)
---
i'm building something with Vue for classic that looks pretty nice but this UI is just gorgeous OP and sooooo clean. jealous.
---
Not sure if pvp potions were a thing in 1.12
---
But im not a good source, as I didnt do much PvP. I got the rank grunt before they stopped the ranks. And that was just by doing a BG every now and agian.
---
They didnt get the license they just got permission to use it.  Most likely they had to pay a bit and promise a percentage of the character sales/Amiibo sales.
---
Smash Brothers is such a huge game franchise that I hardly doubt any company will turn down the chance at  being represented.
---
Do you ever worry you might be a bit of a bastard?
---
Yes, you'll probably see far more people playing the optimal class/race combination. I'd say roughly between 75-90%+ will take that option, so for instance, for Alliance all the mages and warlocks will be Gnomes, while the warriors and rogues will be Human, and all the priests will be Dwarves.
---
Dude banjo is gonna be in smash. I'm still hyped lol
---
Just as likely their spell batching implementation is accurate and most people just never realized how bad Vanilla combat was.
---
I disagree completely when it comes to flying and to be honest anyone who says flying ruined the game is in my mind kind of stupid.
---
I guess the devs of the game, and the overwhelming majority of players are stupid. You must be some sort of genius!
---
*Power Rangers theme intensifies*
---
Alt-F4 is the answer
---
Virtually no difference means there is a difference. Yes were talking about single auto attacks better but over hours and days it makes a difference. Also all his testing was done on pirate servers so take it with a grain of salt.
---
I want to clear each phase's content while they're current. I know it's not as important in vanilla as it is now, but it's still nice to keep up with the pack.
---
LEVEL 18?
---
So excited to have found it. I use to love it.
---
I remember leveling 1-80 in wrath and just skipping so much content because I had already outleveled it.
---
I don't ever want Classic without cross-realm BGs and I don't care about layering/sharding, so... both?
---
trash
---
Solution: kill them all.
---
Alternative Title: Why Vanilla was bad!
---
Most of the arguments are 
---
"Wpvp is dead because I cant gank people because they fly"
---
"I don't see anyone on the ground because I play on a dead server but wanna blame flying."
---
"The world used to be dangerous, even though on a ground mount the only thing dangerous was riding through packs of mobs and getting dazed. FUN AND IMMERSIVE"
---
Flying is fine and every single one of these complaints are just bullshit excuses for so many things that are actually wrong with the game. 
---
I also find it ironic you wanna argue the "overwhelming majority" of players and Devs can't be dumb because a good handful of players on reddit said they hate it. 
---
Or that the devs can't possibly be stupid given how much they get dumped on for a lot of other decisions.
---
Something being obtainable in-game doesn't make being able to buy it not pay to win. If I can buy something on launch day that will take somebody else a few hundred hours to grind for, I'm paying to win.
---
Sure there is a lot more to add to it. But I think this would be a good addition
---
*"No flying. Travellin around world is mainly done with flight paths, zeppelins and ships. Unless you have some coin and find friendly mage to create portal for you"*
---
Thank you! Best of luck with your app. This one was a lot of fun.
---
hmm...  I would pick Cross Realm BGs.   But I don't care much about pvp, though I might try to get Rank 13 in classic.    I guess you lose out on some realm rivalries, but if the realm was sharded, then would that be any different?
---
Man, helmet bro is just as disposable to Blizzard as he is to Riot.
---
It’s fucking all the way down.
---
I would think they would eventually stand up a bunch of separate BC servers, and let us pay to transfer our classic character there, yeah? Or maybe even "clone" your toon over?
---
I would like a version for Classic. With Immersion, I used to READ and UNDERSTAND quests in BFA, instead of just clicking as fast as possible then reopening the menu later.
---
Potting in a duel is BM, as for world pvp it’s a fight for survival, go for your life
---
`history.replaceState`?
---
Based off of a pserver, no thanks.
---
To put it another way, why would Blizzard, whose main goal is to replicate "the Vanilla experience", listen to players who rushed to complete content as fast as possible, which was also "part of the experience", release phases faster just because those players complain, when having content droughts or farm periods was also part of the Vanilla experience?
---
Basically, you're inventing a non-existent problem to complain about.
---
Personally I prefer GW2UI version of an immersive quest interface:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wurNlTLzAsE
---
This is really great. I think the best talent calculator I've seen. Usually they end up being really heavy and loading new class takes ages. If you still haven't I would try to package this into nice plugin and maybe try to contact popular websites like wowhead that you have enhanced version of talent calculator that they could start to use.
---
God I loved the Absolution set. Best in the game imo
---
The silithus armor set that drops is part of specific content that was released just before or simultaneous to AQ, and to my knowledge isn’t repeated anywhere else. It’s a pretty cool content concept though, that I really enjoyed when it first came out
---
Exactly 10G for 1 dollar isn't really a killing when you consider the effort required to make 10G.
---
The main difference is low levels buying from max levels who can make the gold a little easier..

Malown's Slam or Demonshear if you're going human. There's loads of solid 2h's.
---
The system is widely understood publicly and translates between the two without flaw.
---
actually a brilliant solution
---
I am sure they could quite easily just draw graph about player activity and once it starts to look like it's dropping then smash that new phase in. It would be best to Blizzard and gamers.
---
They 100% despawn if anybody helps you during combat. Either by hitting the demon or casting buffs/heals on the hunter. 
---
It was the most frustrating thing in the world when you'd spent hours waiting for it to spawn and some random tries to help.
---
Succubus and any warlock pets do minimal damage in pve, even if they don’t die and you have the talents for it. Vanilla has a bunch of talents that are largely worthless for raiding that you’ll take to get to the stuff you need for any given spec
---
The old team loved games and really liked money. The new team loves money and kinda like games.
---
I feel like everything is boring and the only light in the tunnel will be classic
---
Downvote.  That guy looks fucking retarded.
---
I found one on the AH for 30g. Lead to a very happy warrior twink going sword and board
---
I thought I would agree with you, but then I watched it...
---
Someone should make an addon that basically just tells you what to do for optimal leveling.

I reallllllllly wanna try playing classic when it comes out cause I feel like I have missed out on a lot of excitement and interesting lore.
---
I didn't start playing WoW until Pandaria came out (one of my good friends wanted the recruit-a-friend mount and bullied me into getting an account) so I know I've had it pretty easy comparatively, and that almost makes me scared about classic since I'm gonna be sooo lossstttttt...
---
Would you say it's a mind blast? Kappa
---
That’s my plan! First class I ever played, so I feel I have to play one. Especially because people think they suck.

Even as a longtime Horde player, old Ashenvale is the most beautiful place to me in classic. It blew me the fuck away.

Why not warlock?

You clearly did not read the entire comment
---
Sequisha is 35. He's a Millennial, not a Gen Zed.
---
Not everyone wants post-naxx content. Personally I want Blizzard to say they will keep classic servers up, and either transfer your character to a TBC server or start fresh on a TBC server. 
---
I only have a few hours a week to play. I'd like to accomplish my Classic goals and that's not doable without sacrificing work or family time if they force TBC.
---
Never said he was.  But I can't see an adult watching that trash.
---
Scorch with PvP gloves is immune to pushback and crits for 900-1100 , spammable, and has a 10% crit talent.
---
BGs too. Speed pots and Free-Action potions were last resorts of sore losers in WSG. Only time you’d have a flask is if you just finished a raid and wanted to queue after.
---
Don't fabricate a story, post the video and that's it, as usual most of them get ignored regardless of who creates them or to what purpose
---
That's the exact same build as my "after level 40" build...
---
Vael is free loot as far as my guild is considered, always has been.

I think someone is envious they can't grow facial hair. Insecure much?

Mal'ganis was best dreadlord, hence best server.

*lets out a measured, cautious chuckle, wary eyes carefully scanning his surroundings as he does so, on an RP server.*

You didnt hear this from me but *looks around suspiciously* I caught her smoking! I didn't see a cigarette but I definitely saw smoke.
---
Yeah, that's the one that /u/TimeRemove mentioned. I'll add it tomorrow, thanks!
---
So should I have a spirit gear macro, is it that big a difference in our of combat  health Regen?
---
you would like to think thats something they would implement, but its blizzard. im not a fan of layering.
---
Sounds about right.
---
There were no RP-PvP servers at launch; Blizzard said something about them not wanting to deal with the customer service issues that could result on such a realm. They were only added later in classic, and if you wanted to play on them you had to reroll.
---
Bad bot
---
Idk that offhand might be better for casters who can snag a good 1Her, the cloak isn't great by any stretch
---
Blizzard would have to A/B test against their legit 1.12 client, but I do recall sitting on a corpse for over an hour all the way in TBC even.
---
Human memory is crap, so the only way to prove anything in regards to this, is A/B testing.
---
You're ignoring the journey. Just because the very endgame doesn't use a group/dungeon finder,  the entire rest of the journey and your down time does. You raid maybe 3 times a week and mythic+  groups are In fact listed browsed and created via a group finder. 
---
 Simply put, If you consider people looking for group in local/trade chat you should probably stick to retail.  Classic isn't for you
---
That's not intended as an insult it's just plain facts.
---
I'm wondering how quickly people will learn the value of gold, or if crazy high auction house prices will trick people into thinking it's more like retail.
---
You won't be allowed to use mortal strike, because it takes a debuff slot. Arms without mortal strike is nothing
---
&gt; Looks like the lag compensation is completely fucked.
---
Looks like it's just windfury animation finishing
---
Wrong
---
Man your grind sounds like a dream. Back then i played on Blade Fist and competition was brutal.
---
Took me 3 and a half months playing like 12-15 hours a day to get rank 14. There is no chance in hell i would have the time for serious ranking now.
---
And this wouldn't have been the case if they had maintained the requirement that to equip PvP gear, you needed to currently be at that rank.
---
But people complained.
---
Man I keep reading your posts and thinking we would be a great match. our hunter slot is empty and then it makes me sad you and your friends are alliance :(
---
Well you'd have my lowly upvote if you ever made those posts. I'm intrigued.
---
Terrible show, terrible actor
---
I enjoyed spending time to level in Desolace. The mainland is lonely and quiet but it feels oddly calm and peaceful. I remember the coast to be quite beautiful.
---
I also enjoy that we actively have to decide which centaur tribe to support.
---
😂 😂 😂
---
If range calculation uses decimals, that could still be valid.
---
10.5 yards would mean hunter can't attack, and Frost Nova can't reach him.
---
How did the begin with summoning stones? Some one actually went there.    Picture that except no one could be lazy.
---
&gt; but I do recall sitting on a corpse for over an hour all the way in TBC even.
---
Can you show me proof of this or are you only relying on your highly fallible memory?
---
And no flying mount !!
---
Dont care much about pvp - might try to get rank 13 :DD.
---
Nevertheless, I would pick cross realm bgs as well.
---
Not something even funny to joke about buddy.
---
You need to think at an even larger scale. Imo the  answer is simple (not easy, just simple). It'a keep because it's one of the last points of defense for Gilneas. What do you think?

You were laughed at for potting in BGs and considered a sore loser for popping Speed/FAPs in WSG.
---
You enjoyed the fights vs other premades. But they didn't help you compete with other people aiming for the top ranks. When having fun in a game directly conflicts with progressing towards a goal, there's a problem.
---
Some people thought Warhammer was going to be the PvP MMO that killed WoW. But it didn't. Maybe WoW will kill WoW.
---
&gt;This day game industry is about businessmen making money, back then it was enthusiasts making art.
---
This hits hard. Overall every time businessmen and money get involved everything just crashes down. It's sad how game industry has gone to this point. Luckily indie developing has become more accessible and more popular. For years I've got so much more value from indie games and I don't even remember when I last time bought AAA game (if we don't count WoW expansions)
---
Mace spec does nothing for PvE so you're going to lose 5% crit and a bunch of stats, doubt that's a good trade.  
---
And demonshear applies a dot that I believe takes a debuff slot so definitely not worth using in raid. But feel free to keep theorycrafting it, It'd be nice for more options.
---
Shame! Either way, haven't heard SoS name pop up in awhile, cheers mate! See you in classic.
---
I play pserver. When you take a flight path,  the whole time you're flying you're seeing players below you fighting plainstriders and boars. Doing quests you remember completing not so long ago..
---
Flying mounts killed the world.
---
? Yes, that's exactly what's happening but the range should be 5-8, not 5-11? If hunter stays just outside his deadzone (as he's in the clip), Nova should hit him because he should be between 8-9yd, so within Nova range. He isn't, meaning he's over 10yds so somewhere where he should've been able to shoot long ago.
---
Yeah, there just aren't any good one-handed caster weapons for level 40. Like, at all.
---
I don't really understand how "limited" has a pejorative meaning or "cannot" sound negative. But it's just me perhaps. Thank god they didnt use word "Forbidden".
---
My friend bought 
---
100g for £5
---
cross realm bgs arnt as bad as you think i remember seeing the same people over and over playing 39twink bgs back during wotlk.
---
You looking for someone where you always level together? or just someone to join forces with on occasion, because I can't do the first but if you just need some Danish in your friend list then I can help with that.
---
I don't know man I might have to disagree on my server those gold farmers would make pretty formations spelling websites and other things.
---
Depending on class 100-500g.
---
As a hunter you’ll have the easiest time
---
and you don't see people doing that while on a flying mount? Lol what? 
---
Have you ever played retail on a decent server? Its the same thing!
---
The frustration of not knowing where to go or what to do for somewhat optimal levelling is a frustration I didn't enjoy
---
I spend so much time wasting time in vanilla and I did not enjoy it
---
It all depends on the economy. However, a half hour of a full raid team's time should cost you no less than 1000g.
---
By that logic you could argue for people buying all their raid gear.
---
Your definition would mean that nearly every free to play game is p2w then. Most people don't consider a game like Warframe p2w just because you can spend money to skip the grind. It's generally acceptable to use this "pay to skip" scheme as long as the amount of time it takes to grind is within reason. In SC's case it is literally funding the development of the game, so I can't fault them for doing it.
---
Doesn't happen to every mob but some does this. One of the most famous is maybe Herod who drops helmet, shoulders and axe that he's wearing.
---
You just don't get it.  Classic isn't your cup of tea and that's fine.

Best comment
---
If money can in any way give you an advantage over other players, that's pay to win.
---
i always got a thing about being a healer.
---
You don´t need to mention this while leveling. It is pretty much a given that tanks and healer don´t run dungeons to get better at running dungeons. They want to level faster.
---
I had a /played of 15 days when I reached 60 in vanilla wow. If you can play 5 hours a day, that would be about 2 1/2 months.
---
Sure, it will probably go quicker this time, but 5 hours a day every day is a lot for someone with a job even if they are single. If you have a family, the time required can easily double or more.
---
So my guess would be, that the majoriy of player will take a few months to get to 60 and getting ready to raid might take a while still (all those prequests, dungeon runs for gear etc.).
---
I don't get what? That your excuses about flying mounts are bullshit. 
---
Classic can still be fun. Flying mounts can still be cool. Those 2 things aren't linked.
---
That same person was in Hinterlcand's not dieing either. I was watching the Asmongold stream and she was there messing with or fighting the lord lakemaeran or something like that. Slull boss and never died.
---
Overall character model team of HotS deserves gold medal. All their models are really well done and look awesome.
---
That would be true if you couldn't buy it with real money.
---
I want to experience all the cool quest lines, and clear all raid content, and a little PvP for fun
---
Layering will be gone before it matters
---
Do you think it’ll actually help you out after reading it?assuming you have great knowledge of the game atm. Or is it more of something vanilla related you want as a fix rightnow
---
Curious as to how you know Sequisha is a goofball, /u/Assburgers09?
---
I can confirm, in Vanilla using pots in duels nulled a win and made you get clowned for a loss. Using them in BGs was considered try-hard, except the combat vendor health and mana potions. Major potions were seen as burning $$$ to avoid losing. Popping FAPs and speed pots in WSG was seen as unsportsmanlike, and usually only came out if people were losing. Flasks... huge try-hard expense for PvP flaskers. Engineering and grenades were fine, because they were mostly cheap and minor.
---
For WPvP anything goes though.
---
Just my opinion but I think the world pvp is a core part of the experience. Devilsaurs and lotus spawns become pvp objectives, and people will even fight over fishing nodes, mining veins, and high profit farming spots or rare spawns. Plus it adds another layer of depth to your build, especially since respeccing just to world pvp on a pve realm isn’t really a thing. You can minmax for pve, sure, but it might mean you get caught with your pants down farming flask ingredients or losing all your buffs before a raid. Likewise minmaxing just for pvp means you suffer in raid content, so finding a balance can be tricky but fun imo.
---
Perhaps to you. I quite enjoy morbid, crass, and dark humor. Feel free to police your own jokes, I however, will not.
---
You are totally clueless..bro you talk about getting dazed off your mount. That says it all.
---
They sell that shit to people that buy gold.   If you aren't buying gold, then you probably won't be able to afford it.
---
Yeah there were cookie cutter builds for sure, but the great thing was having the freedom to build a meme spec or a totally shitty character. In retail they hold your hand so you can’t bastardize your character and it’s a real shame.

Desires: I am looking to join a guild that is open to having me play an SP Ret paladin or "spelladin" as my spec. I have done tons of research on the subject and truly believe it would be a fantastic experience since paladins were always considered a non option for dps back in vanilla prior to the knowledge we have now. I will be farming constantly to ensure I have the proper consumables for any raid and am also going to have a dedicated healing set for premades if the comp desires.
---
Lmao and you? Talking about how magical your private server was?
---
Good for you kid. You probably weren't even born when vanilla was out and I played that. 
---
smh. you just don't get it
---
If they do an expansion, keep content at 60 and release raids that offer gear for alternate specs. Tier 4 could have paladin tanking gear, shadow priest gear, and warrior dps gear while being somewhere between tier 1 and 2. Imagine, for example, we get WotLK 2.0. This time, Karazhan is our into, while keeping naxx where it is. We get the unfinished troll raid, or the nerubian zones plus raid, as our patch 2.1. Ulduar for 2.2. Then, a revamped ICC that does the place justice in scale and scope instead of the linear mess we got in the original patch.
---
Zones could level characters from 40 to 60, with dungeons being appropriate to those levels and expanded on so they're not so short and /faceroll. The zones already exist in the game, all of the development time could go to lowering the levels of the mobs and finishing the worl they didn't get to the first time around, and we can skip trial and ruby sanctum because seriously fuck those raids.
---
I am not sure of the actual time, but I was essentially trying to say that you could come up to battlefields of PvP that had happened previously due to a sea of skeletons that would persist. 
---
This also happened in raids if you kept wiping on a boss for a long time.  Sorry man, can't find you proof that would back me up on this, but I will say that I know this happened all the way up through wrath.  Not sure if it was still a thing in cata though.  
---
This topic has been brought up several times before, and while anecdotal, most people seem to be on the same page as me on this.  Skeletons absolutely persisted far longer than they currently do in BFA.
---
Ah, such a great site and story.
---
What a ripoff.  There's a good chance NOTHING would drop for his class.
---
You cherrypick comparisons to make a nonsensical point. It’s like saying running 100m in 10 seconds is slow because Usain Bolt can do it in less than that. You only focus on the extreme and forget everything else.
---
I can assure you I know a lot more about this game than you've forgotten. Get ganked
---
Ooga Gang, bitch!
---
Using consumes in PVP is not frowned upon
---
Lets also have the imbalanced battlefields so I can join as horde and have it be 23 vs 40 so I go sit afk until it ends.
---
Stop crying, he doesn't know what triggered it and he doesn't know how to replicate it. He even purposely tried to replicate it so he could record to have evidence of what's causing it.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/437775133
---
Or druid!
---
It was a shame when 2.0 made the PvP epic mounts accessible to everyone, turning something that had once been rare into something commonplace. But it fit with Blizzard's philosophy of "let's destroy everything that players valued at lvl 60 so they'll buy the new expansion".
---
50gph is a pretty standard minimum wage for a level 60 farming spec. As I mentioned in my comment, a full MC clear from our group would cost you 2000g. That’s 40 hours of play time, not out of the realm of possibility for anyone.
---
&gt;Your definition would mean that nearly every free to play game is p2w then.
---
Pretty much, yeah. Most F2P games are P2W garbage.
---
When their source of revenue is people buying things in the game for real money, the game will always be designed around getting as many people as possible to spend as much money as possible on it. I'd much rather play a game designed to be entertaining enough to make people want to buy or subscribe to it.
---
Some subscription based games are guilty of drawing out play time artificially to keep people subbed longer, but at least every player is paying the same amount and getting the same game.
---
if you have a server that has 80:20 ratio, how does layering help at all? To make the ratio on one layer better you'd have to make it even worse on another layer...
---
There's the entire stream here too: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/437775133. It went away after he DCed, might as well actually have been Blizzard fixing it.

---
Yes, I agree with that definition.
---
I think they fixed this in the recent beta update.
---
5% more base health, not total health
---
That mail chest has no stamina though. Which kind of sucks. Strength/agi doesn't increase your kill speed by very much, but stamina increases your survivability a lot. Guess it depends on how you prioritise though.
---
Lol I am sure you do kid.
---
A good chance? No, that’s not how you math.
---
&gt;	Using consumes in PVP is not looked down on.
---
It was in 2005 and 2006 on my server.
---
&gt;	If they can farm the thousands of gold it would take to get a guild to carry you for weeks and give you the items you want, why wouldn't they deserve it? They did more work than the average raider, they just did it all solo.
---
Because they usually bought it from gold sellers.
---
Same to you! :)
---
Cool, flying mounts! And I wonder when I’ll be able to do the orc in Stormwind quest.
---
We did a bidding system with a min bid. Items like toep could go for 300-500+.
---
I mean, there will be 3 layers no matter what, or so they claimed.
---
No matter how you slice it, you would be making one faction's gameplay far worse for the sake of the other... doesn't seem fair to me. 
---
Faction imbalance is going to happen over time no matter what they do, and it is what it is.  The game survived back then and I am sure it still will.  No need to arbitrarily screw over others because of it.
---
The Armory goes into the same category as the late Vanilla ( or early TBC ) onset of public spam of damage meters and gear score. If you want raid leaders that micro manage your class instead of focusing on boss strategy and attendance then a Classic Armory is for you. When it was introduced players used to log off naked, to avoid showing gear to the opposite faction and because of privacy and a hundred other reasons. The Armory was a big part of streamlining WoW. If it was up to me ? the inspect function ( in game ) would be cancelled and weapon AP would NOT be normalized as to give more power to non raid items.
---
Yeah because vanilla raiding is not difficult.

The only thing I reaally don't like is the talent respec thing. I want more talent trees!
---
Good luck getting rank 13 without caring about PVP. You’ll need to be part of the cartel, wait your decided turn, and play in premades 30+ hours a week.
---
Paladins still have Concentration Aura to help healers avoid pushback, cleanse for magic/poisons, and HoJ for huge 6s stuns. Though I agree great shaman &gt; great Paladins, I’d argue mediocre Paladins &gt; mediocre shaman. Plus Shaman aren’t too insane until around AQ timeframe.
---
Or they rolled dwarf because «everyone» told them to, and could not stand it for the long haul
---
That's why I think Warframe does it right. You can pay to skip the grind by buying the frames, but then you're also paying to skip the content of the game.  The game is designed be enjoyable to grind for frames and it feels  rewarding to do so.
---
Don't get me wrong, I don't think this model would ever work for WoW. There is a ton of time investment and a huge focus on PvP. If WoW let you skip to level 60, I think most people would agree that it's p2w.
---
Was time zone for me. 
---
I play for raids, and I need it to work with my schedule.
---
Yeah this wasn't really a thing on high pop servers, there were way too many players.
---
Well, this type of behaviour I rare encountered on PS when I played on one of them. We wiped sometimes, but usually were chill about it and just continued clearing a dungeon. So dropping a group after the first wipe is quite unusial for typical PS crowd.
---
I met the same kind of behaviour in many modern MMOs with an automated matchmaking system (WoW, FFXIV, TESO, etc.), so I guess those players went straight from one of those MMOs. Maybe modern WoW, maybe some other game, it doesn't matter.
---
Only MALE Tauren got increased range. It might be connected with long .... horns.
---
That might be minimum wage with gear or you are mage that can aoe farm dire maul.
---
&gt;until people were intentionally losing battlegrounds when i was in one
---
Heard about this type of thing. You might remember that you originally needed to maintain a rank to use gear for that rank. It would have stopped all of this.
---
What I hoped Blizzard would do, and what I argued for, was a skill-based, or rather performance-based system that didn't decay over time. (Maybe it could have minimally, the way that on some ranking ladders you decay to a certain rating if you're inactive for a month.) Then the players with the best ranks would have been those who were best at defeating other players, and perhaps accomplishing PvP objectives (it might have been better to separate these two goals), without dying, instead of those who had played the most the previous week and avoided going on any city raids where they could get dishonorable kills.
---
As it was, 'rotating' players into the R14 slots was the most rewarding for the group, despite that it was 'gaming the system'. Generally speaking, despite fighting the opposite faction, players were competing against players from the same faction and this led to unfavourable results and the kind of behaviour you describe.
---
Bonescythe is criminally underrated.
---
Nah, I can easily beat them.
---
Uhm, at all times? You realize they're the evil faction in wow right?
---
I think it is better to say that it was important not to be a dick in some way.  Didn't need to actively become known or anything, just don't constantly screw with people.
---
Classic may as well have retails quest information showing on the map toggleable (is that a word) with the number of people that will use questing addons. It seems to be one of the implemented conveniences that many people prefer. Credit to anyone that works out quest locations and objectives from the text only.
---
I hope they do. Otherwise I could play on a 50/50 server but the layer I am on might be 30/70 that would be really annoying.
---
those are only the ones you can see....
---
We'll be playing Vanilla for the rest of our lives.
---
People have been playing vanilla literally since it's release.
---
There's always been private servers. Why wouldn't you think think we'll get more shots and more opportunities with new servers down the line?
---
What because the hype-train has come and gone?
---
Tell that to me 4 years ago when I rolled on a Pserver, yet here we are.
---
Look at the sub numbers for the 2 subreddits. People are getting carried away with their hype.
---
WoW may not have 20 million subs any more but it is in no danger of collapsing, and classic is not for everyone. It is a huge time sink to play at endgame, and the leveling will probably halt the vast majority, as it did back in the day.
---
Most currently subbed people will be back on their mains before they hit 30 in classic.
---
Pest or cholera, what do you choose ?
---
Yeah CRBG are less bad than sharding, but still ...
---
Dad server.
---
There is definently some merit to the idea that talents in retail are better in some regards.
---
In some cases, changing a single talent will completely change your spell rotation, which because of how easy it is to change talents, allows for a lot of variety of play. Something i personally enjoy a lot.
---
However, claiming that the talent system is more complex is just outright ludicrous. 
---
In retail you have 3 option per row in 7 rows, technically allowing for total around 2000 different talent combinations. 
---
In classic you have 9 options to choose from at level 10 (for most classes). And at level 15 you can unlock a new row of talent in one tree, but still able to put your points in another tree. You'll never find yourself with less than 8 options for your next talent point. And by max level the amount of different talent builds you could cook up is so large my phone can't even do the math.
---
Of course 90-99.9% of all builds are subpar or complete trash in both versions of wow. But the original talent system was more complex by absolutely staggering margins. And I'm not even saying that this is necessarily a good thing.
---
I had an Alliance Rogue I would bring in here and gank people. Once a warlock feared me and it took me to the back. I obviously died within 30 seconds but it was cool to be back there with the auctioneers seeing what they see for a bit xD
---
Whatever happened to PvPing for fun?
---
Blizzard plans a quick launch of phase 2 (2-3 months at most). Most people won’t be 60 by that time and hardcore week-one guilds will only be half geared.
---
I just bought that guide off ebay, im sure it has useful info still
---
Nobody cares.
---
2000g is assuming only 1 carry right? Realistically you'd try to bring one of each armor type and subsidise the cost for each.
---
Yes, a good chance.   Let's use an example. 
---
There's like a 9/10 chance the boss doesn't drop something for you, and there are 10 bosses.  
---
0.9^10 (100) = 34.86784401% chance nothing drops for you.
---
80% chance something you can (actually use, not just equip) then it would be a 10% chance nothing drops for you.  
---
70% -&gt; 3%
---
good to know =)
---
still choose tauren, war stomp dude, aoe 2second stum, its huge.
---
No one had a problem with a specific hybrig class called warrior in classic
---
I don’t think you understand... If you don’t respect the cap system hierarchy, you don’t get invited to premades. If you don’t get invited to premades, your BGs take at least twice as long. There is absolutely no way for you to reach rank 13 if the cartel doesn’t want you to reach rank 13.
---
I don't think 2 months is fast enough.   Imagine playing wow with our current knowledge and only mc/ony with no bg or honor system.   What is there gonna be to do all day?
---
Do you have any media on the layering? I was under the impression it was only for the beginning roll out so people would actually have access to quest objectives during launch
---
Layering will only be around for a couple of weeks to a month. Even then it will only affect zones with huge populations of players. That means basically level 1-20 zones.
---
I think this wait has gotten people going stir crazy, some of these topics, going soo deep on shit lol  Whatever is going to happen will happen
---
Funny enough these numbers probably aren't too far off what gold goes for on those Websites. When classic finally releases there will be players who trade gold between the two games (illegally) and these are the sort of conversion rates we can expect.
---
The game is what you make of it. Sure people will do the pve content and take a break until p2. 
---
I’d like to think those people will be a minority. There is plenty to do in p1, the world will be alive with people to gank as a lot of players will still be leveling right up to the end. People will be farming gold for mounts and other things. I doubt there will be massive clamour for more content within two weeks and even though pvp doesn’t really mean anything, players will be still partaking in it, i for one will actively seek it out, and as we know with classic one thing leads to another and you have a massive battle on your hands.
---
We had the Proudmoore Summoning Team.  they had a warlock and two alts at major hotspots and would summon you for a small fee.
---
Warrior is a hybring and the only one who is S tier in 2 roles so there is that.
---
I am excited to do all the content I didn't get to the first time around.  What pace that comes at will likely be different just because of the difference in information available to me, but I like to hope people won't fly through everything too fast for most to get to experience it.
---
It's almost like you don't need to play all day.  
---
Get a life and leave the house lmao.  
---
There will be plenty of fun to be had stop worrying.
---
&gt; subsidize the cost
---
Lol no. Even if there was absolutely no overlap in gear desired, they are both paying 2000g.
---
Is this the guide that had Crusader Strike on the Paladin tips?
---
There is so much to do other than MC/Ony
---
You can make 50gph doing a lot of things that have nothing to do with combat. And a mage farming dire maul makes a lot more than 50gph.
---
I really think they should start the game with battlegrounds
---
I agree but where did she say she got rape threats?
---
Warriors dont pay the hybrid tax tho
---
Most people won't even hit 60 in 2 months dude
---
I have them too, cool nostalgia piece but boards and videos since then, along with just playing.. they don't really help.  I still read mine tho!
---
I remember creating an undead warlock in the beta and loving the "Dark Lady, watch over you." npc line. Its still my favorite voice line in the game to this day.
---
Oh yeah and hanging out in the throne room for when people do the Onyxia quest....weapon skill galore.
---
Bolvar's the man.
---
Ya idk what that even is, was just kinda making a joke
---
Additionally, if I’m remembering correctly,  warlocks couldn’t summon party members within dungeons/raids. They actually had to run out of the dungeon/raid in order to summon.
---
That's some A+ pearl clutching.
---
Practicing moderation so that you don't burn out early
---
&gt;Are the honor rewards actually good enough to make people go out there and do that
---
No honor system either at launch
---
I have seen these cartels negotiate with individuals before.  The guy didn't agree to their order, and he beat them to 14.
---
Most people wont even be 60 after 2 months

---
They gave players a LONG time to corpse run.  Long enough for night elves to abuse wisp and dead run across zones.  Long enough to get lost in STV and still have time to find your corpse.  I don't think you got over an hour, but it was definitely over thirty minutes.  You could try and wait out a camper, but they were free to sit on your body until you released.
---
You still had battlegroups. What you likely experienced was people saying, "Oh I can get a BG queue", and so the number of people queueing in the whole battlegroup became much higher than it had been before the change.
---
It's nice to see the same people out in the world as you do in a battleground, but many players probably weren't going out in the world much if they were doing lots of battlegrounds. It's still nice to see the same people in different BG matches, and WoW could have done (and could still do, both in modern WoW and in Classic) a better job of forming groups from the same consistent players, even if you had to wait a little longer in the queue.
---
It was more significant when battlegrounds no longer required you to queue at its physical entrance, because it helped to kill PvP. One of the first of many steps towards making WoW feel less like a world.
---
Can you provide proof of the exact spawn time instead of throwing random numbers out with no evidence to back it up?
---
Left
---
If you use `replaceState` instead of `pushState` like recommended, it won't hijack your history so your back button will be normal.
---
A very good 1-60 play time is 5 days. Playing 3 hours a day is 40 IRL days to reach 60. That's assuming zero days off.
---
This means realistically to get to 60 the majority of players will take over 2 months. A minority will play continuously and get 60 in 2 weeks. That still only leaves 8 MC runs before the next phase is released.
---
Additionally one of the joys of classic is there is always things to do and natural pvp develops- look at the Beta right now for good examples of this.
---
Yep it takes an hour to get a group and get everyone there. You don't get to instantly quit the moment shit doesn't work out like in retail or you will get a bad reputation. To increase the chance of not wiping don't take tanks with no taunt or resto druids.

Ugh we had people wiping but our server was such shit we had to made do. You're right though.
---
You may check if there is  carbon monoxide leak somewhere where you live.

IMO they should have old-AV enabled on some of the PvP holiday weekends.

I'll see if I can work something in to make an option for a pre-level screenshot.

If someone wanted to cash in, making a new classic book for the re-release would sell

I was looking at the 0/30/21 spec with the imp used for the threat reduction.. Is that a viable option?
---
Don't forget mounts cost your first born
---
1 - Most people will not be 60
---
2 - People will be farming reps and mats for professions (lots of the good recipes are rep locked)
---
3 - Alts will happen, people who didn't play vanilla might need to try different classes.
---
4 - Farming for epic mount, or trying to recover your finances if you already bought it (which I doubt)
---
We still did AV in classic when we wanted to just run around killing people. It’s nice to have a BG where there’s not always an imminent pressure to make a *winning* play like in AB or WSG.
---
Especially during the prepatch, we would camp the Horde entrance with 5-10 full T2.5/T3 geared players to see how long we could hold out.
---
I miss the old days indeed
---
True besides talents. There's 2 main builds for every class .... Maybe 3. 99% it's a buff you take for raiding or don't. 
---
However the tree was nice to have little positives.
---
We need in between talents added for current wow. A mix of both.
---
crafting, making money, farming, re-runs for other guildies, make some content,  world pvp,
---
I'll take art posts over more posts about streamers. I hope the mods are able to keep up with what the subreddit will be like on launch.
---
Don’t forget the mounts! Don Julio’s Band and the Lei were good, too.
---
Let me correct some of those comments. You are a mpnster in PvP 1v1. In group pvp no one will take you over a mage or lock.
---
The old lore was fantastic. It wasn't until around cata that the story took a massive nosedive. Green Jesus, completely throwing away the dragon aspects after building them up for an entire expansion in wotlk. Garrosh. It's hard to take retail seriously anymore it feels a lot like fan fiction.
---
He played way more than 80, lol.   Pretty sure there were 2 people on the account doing shifts, but I never knew for sure.   
---
Caring about pvp is required?   I thought you just sort of fucked around in AV.
---
theres no wooden scaffolding leading from the room of the ghost general which leads to oro the blind. UGH, HATE IT 0/10 (it's really good)
---
This already exists. Two of them in fact.
---
I afk'd for awhile after Lich King. Came back to find my account was hacked, but I had no issue with recovery. During the time of it being hacked they'd farmed me epic flying, changed my useless professions to mining, and all 5 bags maxed on valuable ores. lol

"So this is the Shadowfang Castle, it's full of wer-"
---
"Gross."
---
"What?"
---
"That sounds gross."
---
"The name of the castle?"
---
"Yeah, Wailing Caverns, Ragefire Chasm, Deadmines all sound pretty cool, but Shadowfang Castle sounds dumb."
---
"Oh, well, I mean we kinda got the whole werewolf thing going on and it's a castle draped in shadow, so... like Shadowfang Castle makes sense, but maybe we could change "Castle" to something."
---
*Googles "Castle Synonyms"*
---
"I mean, we can do like, Shadowfang Fortress, Shadowfang Tower, Shadowfang Keep, Sha-"
---
"Shadowfang Keep sounds better, go with that."
---
"Okay."
---
#-------------------------------------------------------
---
The final boss takes place in one of the towers, I'm not really sure if it's technically the keep or not, but I imagine the tower is included in the keep itself and maybe that is what they were going for. 
---
It's also worth noting Keep is literally listed as a synonym for castle when you google it. Obviously, it isn't really if you actually read the definition, but someone designing levels on a deadline is mostly using placeholder names and doesn't look that much into being absolutely correct until later on. By the end of Alpha/Beta they probably got used to calling it Shadowfang Keep and loved the name, so they didn't bother double checking if that was actually an appropriate name or not. Since only one man 15 years after the fact seems to give a shit at all, I think they made an okay call, but if you single handedly end up bringing WoW to its knees and killing it by pointing out the poor naming of a level 20 dungeon, then I applaud you.
---
Those are pretty worthless scenarios. Hunter can track whilebon roof of wsg anyway.
---
I need names sir.
---
I've already done brd and ill make sure retards arent in my group
---
I hate math
---
Ah, I see, yes, parsing by single bosses helps a lot.
---
Though looking at the raid you linked, the ret is pretty much lower mid field in dps at most bosses being between 12th and 18th and usually ahead of several pure dps classes.
---
Sure, you get more dps out of a top pure dps class player, but if a ret/druid/shaman/shadow priest isn't dead last in dps in your raid, you don't lose anything by bringing them.
---
We used to gather at a specific spot, e.g. Stormwind, pop a head there, run to the flight master, and move to the blackrock together. Nobody was to fall behind, because else they might lose their buffs to a crowd of hordes.
---
Sometimes the routine included gathering at the zandalar island to pop another buff there. Also, for naxx and AQ we had our hearthstone set somewhere near and just tp there. :)

Well, have to wait to do real comparison between raid bosses between private servers, but in MC, what boss will take over 60s ? I was watching our best time with world buffs (in private n-d), we killed every boss sub 60s in mc. Ragnaros, 55s, Magmadar was 33s and every other boss was 30s or less.
---
Thats obviously with much better gear than you can get in phase 1-2 ( it was about 2 months after AQ launch with accelerated timeschedule, so little less of bwl gear than you would have).
---
But even counting that, if you DOUBLE the kill times you are doing 9/10 bosses in 66 ish seconds. 
---
We would never use pally buffs to heal, the kill times are so fast that mana isnt a problem anyways, so those debuffs should obviously be used to ANY dps slots. We had quite strict rules on what debuffs we are going to use, i could go check that list from our excel sheet.

It's generally used to make fun of black supremacists, but okay?
---
True, you could only mount on the edges, the stairs cover edge, and the little space that ramps up between the metal edge and the wooden floor.
---
Okay. Lots of comments here bringing up problems and solutions that don't need to exist. OP stated he wants a delayed release between phases. That's perfectly fine to wish for.  
---
Other players may want a faster release. That's also perfectly fine to wish for.  
---
Your opinions may differ, and that's fine. What really matters, is how can we best find ways to ensure we all get to enjoy the game without ruining it for everyone else?  
---
Is it really too much to ask hardcore gamers to allow other players time to catch up to content? Is it really too much to ask casual players to accept they simply will not experience everything?  
---
I mean, I'm all for a slower release, because that would suit my available play-time. But at the same time, if it takes 2 years to release Naxx, it is highly likely I will lose connection with other players who "take breaks" or quit altogether. We need a balance so everyone can have fun - and more than likely, that means Naxx release in around 1.5 years, even if some of us (I'll probably be in this group) are barely clearing MC content by that time.
---
Did people really AFK in battle grounds in classic after cross-realm BGs were introduced? I basically skipped most of that period in WoW, and only went to one battleground when I started playing again (though I did go to AV a bunch of the 2.0 PTR).
---
It's my understanding that AFKing is because people have a goal, "buy this item", but to attain they goal they would have to do something they don't enjoy. That might be PvP in general (sort of unlikely as a poll in \~2010 showed that something like 90% of players enjoyed some form of PvP) or PvPing while undergeared in particular. It wasn't much fun getting one-shotted. I don't know how gear and level scaling in BGs affected AFKing.
---
In classic, the reputation rewards were sort of a grindable goal, but . . . AV took a long time, I guess? And you could be killed in the starting areas of WSG and AB. But these weren't really "You can't PvP until you have this" items; the Unstoppable Force only did 15% more damage than a lvl 58 blue, compared to like 100\~200% more for items from more recent expansions compared to quest blues.

No.  Go look for yourself.
---
Why is the English on this document so bad?
---
"Is our spell batching... wrong?"
---
"No, it's the players who are wrong!"
---
Agreed. It's difficult to play Shaman well and to know when, where and how to use totems to the fullest effect. 
---
The average Shaman really don't know how to utilize the class and you need to do that in order to come out on top. 
---
You're not quite a warrior, not quite a Mage and not a druid either. You're something in-between those so you need to use all your tools.
---
Paladin allows for more misplays if you will because you always have bubble, lay on hands, BoP and Freedom which requires almost no thought in using.
---
AMOLED Black Smear.
---
Fun Fact: It was a issue at some point for a few vr headsets and they now have reduced black levels to remove it.
---
Thanks bro!
---
Wow that almost sounds like... a RPG?
---
That's not much different from what we got in cata. It's interesting that they had most of that expansion laid out years in advance.
---
Turn your brightness down really low it looks even more exciting.
---
5 days is like speedrunner times.  Most people can't do anything even close to that.   I think my 1st 60 took like 15 days played.

Beautifully done, very clean

Orc is objectively better for pvp.
---
Wondered the same.
---
Weapon traded blows with OEB which was readily available in MC and totally outclassed by BRE and Spinal Reaper. Once you factor in BWL then even trash weapons outclass TUF.

Druid leveling [hybrid spec](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=druid&amp;talents=z_z.z~z-AaAbAcAgAhAiAxIAAuy9AIAJAKALAMASATAUAVAWplA5A6A7ADA8A9A_AEAFA.BgBhBiBjzrzsztzOzPzQzRzSzH) for world pvp utility. Which as a Druid basically means running away better. I feel that getting more utility spells as a Druid nets a higher return than just diving down the Feral tree. HotW is amazing but this spec would still outperfom in any situation I'm sure of it. Peaking right around 45 like most classes.

I'm on your side, wish we can all play it cool, and the 1% can go find something to keep themselves busy with...
---
We will do our research in your entrails !
---
do you understand what the fuck a beta is for?
---
&gt; But I'm curious what the ratio will be.
---
Heavily skewed towards PvE, as WoW has always been since its inception. The people on this sub will by-and-large claim that PvE is "a means to PvP" but in reality WoW is simply a social game and the gameplay is really second. Because of that, the vast majority of people who play WoW (from 04 to now) will always prefer no PvP because they just want to do their little grinding session in peace then socialize with their buds in some laid back dungeon or do some raiding with their friends.
---
I know so many people who thought the same - or even once it was known, still farmed rep assuming Blizzard had plans to add content.
---
Im still confused where you guys getting those weird ideas. I can use potions so can you.
---
Dude, don't be a party pooper. People will play whatever they want, and they will raid. Content is easy enough to do with a "non ideal" raid roster. And people who choose to play "non ideal" class/talent combinations will make their own raids.
---
oboy
---
Third significant bug on this reddit sub tonight. I sure hope you guys are reporting these through other means as well as posting it here. Sometimes the meme posts can bury a bug post, and Blizzard might not see it.
---
I'm a healer, I dont need that shit!! Easy life.
---
Seriously, this sounds right up my alley. Been tanking on retail from BC to the end of Legion. Will gladly put on the sword and board in Classic for something like this.
---
It DEFINITELY is on the private servers, but I can't say on the beta. I got to the point where I just purchased all spirit gear off the AH (I know this option won't be that useful for first characters) and leveled that way. Way faster. Killed barely slower (I guess as I really didn't notice), but regen'd far and away faster to make up for it. Much less downtime, going from one fight to the next. All of this I noticed, and you are keeping your rage going in many cases.
---
I was skeptical of the concept myself even with how much people bragged on this method. What changed my mind was turning in the bloodstone quests in Camp Taurajo and getting the 25 spirit increase, and I was like wait a minute; this really works.
---
He said he could never afford a subscription until he got a part time job.
---
&gt;The whole fun of classic will be at release when everyone is leveling and you can actually interact with people/have world pvp battles
---
So the whole fun of Classic is in 1/24th of your total time playing the game? That doesn't seem like a good reason to roll on a PvP server at all.
---
I've been reading about this build from a few different people, it definitely is something I'm interested in. I'm curious about what weapons you use, you say there's no competition, does that mean you still use 2 handers with this build? I saw one person doing something similar but they had a 1 hander and an off hand scepter or whatever.
---
That'd be great, except you're wrong.. The chances of a boss dropping something you want is much higher than 10%.
---
How did it not make sense? Most of the lore in vanilla had already been established by the Warcraft games and any new lore was fine because vanilla WoW was the first version of a 15+ year game world? Now the lore is muddled and so much has happened and then been changed or retconned as the years go on that's it's hard to get into and once your into it theres so many media releases not attached to the games that add to the lore that it's hard to keep up with it
---
More shamans. Like a lot.
---
It's been 7 years and I don't see any posts about it being finished. This bitch lied.
---
According to wiki, multi-queue was only added in 1.9 [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Battleground](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Battleground)
---
It was then abused by premade groups to leave a battleground against an unwanted opponent without getting deserter debuff.
---
Before multi-queue, it was probably harder to get AV on lower-population servers.
---
First time i hear this. Also why is trying hard considered bad? On top of that its equal chances i can use ots so can you.
---

Just sort of fucking around in AV won't get you very far at all. Rank 6 maybe.

The Vanilla API was objectively more open and capable than the modern API is. They didn't put a single restriction on it until TBC. I stopped after you said this was false.
---
thats GOLD DKP!

Resto druid. Gonna play hpal though I think as they're all round better

There is a show that started a few months ago in England called 'Dead Pixels'. It's about a group of people playing an MMORPG and it made me go back and watch a few of these then.

1.12 is the reinforcement patch ? Damn time flies fast. This is bad bad bad news.  There will be rushing to left and right :(
---
Lore aside, I think these guys would be sick playable races
---
I was 16 at the time myself. My point is that vanilla purists are worse than boomers when it comes to the "back in my day..." most of the time. Granted... the other side of the argument sounds like entitled children so theres that.
---
I don't agree with OP, but you're wrong here. Layering won't be going away until Phase 2 and Blizzard said said that's 2-3 months.
---
Imagine going through all that hassle for the buffs, just to get ganked at the raid entrance. omega oof
---
That is false. There were APIs restricted in vanilla wow. [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/World\_of\_Warcraft\_API](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft_API)

Once you hit level 10 you start to receive talent points, and you continue to get one every level, so every time you level up you get to use a talent point.

The mass of Khaz Modan including Arathi, Hinter and Hillabrad.  Love me my. Northern zones.

2 Set bonus is hard to beat for alot of DPS classes.
---
Generally used by whom to make fun of black supremacy?
---
Paladins and Shamans sit at 7-8% of overall population but they also are only on one faction each respectively. Point being, they show up at 7-8% but of their faction they are a significantly higher percentage. For example on a very popular pserver that has 2 separate servers both servers show Paladin as the 4th highest population of class on Alliance side, only beaten by Warrior, Mage, and Rogue by a very narrow margin. Almost exactly the same for Shaman on Horde side; Only beaten by Warrior, Mage, and Rogue by a narrow margin.
---
In fact, on the older of the 2 servers Paladins and Shamans have the better part of double the population of priests for respective faction (1.4:2)
---
I seems consistent with pserver stats from various different ones as well as the 19k response census survey done of this sub (although likely a heavy overlap of individuals there).
---
I guess I'm just trying to say stats would show that Paladin and Shaman will be the 4th most popular class in numbers for their factions. Pretty interesting!
---
bur
---
Please don't tell me, you're assuming she was some kind of Dreadlord!
---
Sounds very interesting. I may try this out in classic.
---
A couple of questions:
---
* Specwise, I assume it's a standard ret-paladin spec, just with SoR or is there more deviation
---
* In terms of weapon choice are faster weapons preferred or doesn't it matter? Are caster weapons like Lok'amir il Romathis any good?
---
* How would you go about equipping for MC? T1 doesn't have spellpower and pre raid there is nothing with paladin suited stats. Is cloth spellpower gear the way to go?
---
Mage portals and hunters pack.
---
They gonna get ahead starting early 20s and keep it that way till 60
---
Displayed title can go down. In 2.0, everyone got their lifetime highest title as a selectable option. (Before that, you could turn off everyone's title, or leave everyone's title on, but not turn off just your own title.)
---
And it only took many hours because you could keep your gear if your title went down. If you lost that privilege from deranking, people wouldn't have played such crazy hours to get R14.
---
I want Corrupted Ashbringer so it can talk dirty to me.
---
I hate this view on things, it's essential early day micro transactions
---
I mean, you need 3 people (including the warlock) to summon someone anyway so why don't the last 2 people just walk to the dungeon as well.
---
I’m communicating historical perspectives. This is how players literally felt about it back in 2005-2006, it’s not something to be argued right now.
---
It was about throwing away $$$ on relatively scarce consumes in low-stakes situations you could otherwise do fine without.
---
It’s like a student insisting on more homework or a coworker consistently showing up early and working through lunch.
---
Or like how hardcore raiding on retail got to be stupid, with players power-leveling a bunch of alts and doing multiple split raids every week to stack gear.
---
If enough people start doing it, the behavior is normalized and everyone else needs to begrudgingly get on board, when really everyone was perfectly fine and happy beforehand.
---
High end M+, yes. Anything else, no.
---
I don't think you give the old aggro system enough credit here. I hope I'll eat my words, but for the average Retail player, born and raised in LFR and M+ &lt;= 10, this will be a shit show. 
---
There's a reason why people started to blame the tanks if something went wrong and that reason will be back with a vengeance.
---
Why would it? I would imagine phase 2 will happen soon enough that people are not bored with mc yet.
---
As I recall , most of my Dungeon runs were with my guild mates and friends or for specific quests 
---
Pugging everything only became a thing for me during WOTLK , it became far less group or social based
---
Server reputation was a thing and I won't be the only one who remembers who had UBRS key and who didn't
---
So let me get this straight. Your argument is that the Modern API is MORE capable than the Vanilla API and yet you link to something that was possible in the Vanilla API but is not possible in the Modern API.
---
Okay buddy.
---
The thing is it doesn't matter the pace at which you play since there will always be a group of people who play at your pace. This is not wotlk and beyond where only current content matters. Everyone will still be running MC, Onyxia when BWL drops followed by ZG.
---
Also when a new guild is founded even if during the naxx phase, they will still go through the progression starting mc, onyx, bwl, zg, aq and then naxx. lots of mats, buffs, enchants, gear to farm there. 
---
tldr: content from previous phases does not become irrelevant or vacant when new content phase drops.
---
Having said that, yes i do understand what you mean, in case blizzard bases their content drops on streamers who play 9-18 hours a day, the whole classic experience will be over in less than a year and a half.
---
However, i do believe that they will do specific seasonal servers after the 1st vanilla experience is over in parallele of tbc server. (my personal suspicions)
---
Fem orc is the best you're crazy.
---
I don't see the irony. I've always ranked for fun. But WoW and also ranking is a social game, so respecting each other is just a part of that.
---
And I presume you are referring to having to hold back for others, but that hardly goes against that. The R14 guy has a responsibility to keep a high pace. The 2 times that I exceeded the R14 guy it was just a whisper asking me to take like a 2-4 hour break on tuesday. Hardly a bother, especially after a full week of hardcore farming.
---
I'm sorry I'm not an expert in these things.
---
I think it was because Alliance would leave WSG to join AV, which they won more. Do you remember if this was after multiqueueing was introduced in 1.9, 2006-01-03?
---
Yeah I remember that.. the dwarf was a 61 elite wasn't it? I only touched one of those once. I ignored them everytime I saw them after that.
---
No, the world pvp will be amazing.  
---
People don't need BG's, they will make their own fun.
---
Nope, you are wrong: 
---
**"Layering will only be used for a couple of weeks or maybe a month** at the start of Classic WoW, in order to balance the huge influx of players in the same zones. Once the situation reaches a controlled state, it will be completely disabled and realms will once more have one instance of themselves. Layering also **will not happen after Phase 1"**
---
With the old API couldn't hunters macro their highest DPS rotation into a single button? I know with the modern API you cannot do that anymore.
---
As Horde, you had to take a ship from orgrimmar and then fly to a different zone from where the raid was and then walk across to MC/BWL.
---
That was fun.
---
The annoying thing is we always need to find proof by some sketchy video evidence of what we know to be true. I can distinctly remember skeletons lasting ages on the ground even going for dinner and coming back and they still being there. But obviously my memory isn’t proof so we are going to be screwed on a lot of stuff.  One thing I can’t prove but I know 100% to be true because I spent a great deal of time in goldshire trying to find cool looking outfits, was the farmers broom.  I remember this broom looking so aesthetically pleasing that people would enchant this level 3 broom with fiery weapon or shadow weapon to make it look even more bad ass.  This item was changed late TBC I think and now it looks like shit. The shit looking version is in the beta because I had it drop on my undead mage and was excised to wear it only to be met by disappointment. Who knows how many more models they haven’t got right. This definitely won’t be the vanilla we know and love
---
You automatically gain new spells as you level, and their power also scale automatically with your level. So you literally never have to visit your class trainer.
---
See a lot of other people have mentioned the talents, so I wont go into detail about those. But though they are less complex, and don't reward you very often, arent actually that bad. There are a lot of balancing issues that persist for some reason. But theoretically the retail talents allow for a lot more variety of play than the old trees.
---
Yeah... thanks for pointing that out - I was literally scouring the comments for this. Although I assumed it has been tested on Beta, I can't seem to find any examples or claims on how it works.
---
Here are examples it is possible to do in modern API but not possible in Vanilla APIs

I remember this never being a big deal. There was always something else to do in the meantime (I mean, you *always* have something to farm) and the people I played with were happy to chill for another hour instead of playing with that warrior in front of the instance everyone knew to be basically a hunter pet. Or that paladin that rolled on anything. Or that rogue who took his class fantasy a little bit too far. 
---
Life's too short to spend time with assholes.
---
^(...he said, on reddit.)
---
People aware of the meme.
---
Probably a mix of both, I don't mind solo leveling. My b-net is Bluetooth#2351  :)
---
See, you're doing it again. Completely ignoring the other persons point and simply restating your own as if repeating it will somehow make it more valid. 
---
is it that hard to comprehend that farming for mats isn't difficult?
---
The truth is that it is easier, and good for it. So you can continue to dislike the word hard and it’s definition of being difficult to understand or solve, which is exactly what classic is not. I really don’t get what your problem with a word is.
---
Middle, because *that* auctioneer is *hung*

https://www.twitch.tv/videos/437796763?t=5h22m
---
No buffs or debuffs, they took off all their gear, size difference both on the boat and on the dock.  
---
Interesting part though, is that at [5:25:40](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/437796763?t=5h25m40s), the non-streamer player seemed to indicate that to him the characters were the same height, meaning this is likely a display bug and not a real height difference.  Then after going through the boat and reloading both characters were now displayed as the same height.  
---
I went further back in his stream.  Near the end of his AB he picks up Berserking, which grows your character 10%
---
&gt; Berserking - Increases all damage caused by 30%, all damage taken by 10% and increases your size by 10%. Lasts 1 min.
---
He still has a few seconds left on it as AB finishes.  He ports out and [when the debuff fades](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/437796763?t=5h3m16s) his character clearly does not shrink back down to normal size.  
---
I saw a somewhat similar bug in a cdew stream the other day
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/435545288?t=2h
---
Grimlok shrinks all the melee, but instead of cdew seeing himself as small he sees himself as big and everyone else as small, but based on party chat other players saw themselves as large and cdew as small.
---
&gt;People assume there will be mass world pvp battles but will there really be? Are the honor rewards actually good enough to make people go out there and do that? On 1.12 mc and ony are massively nerfed so they will get cleared almost instantly.
---
There will be in p2...
---
&gt;I feel like this may give a situation where people hit 60, clear mc/ony, then quit because there is no other content/no good pvp. If there is no server community because of too many people and layers, I don't know if I personally will stick around after the raids are cleared.
---
Assuming people will clear that fast... maybe the top 5% of all players will have MC cleared by p2.
---
&gt; but I know 100% to be true because I spent a great deal of time in goldshire trying to find cool looking outfits, was the farmers broom.
---
How many times have hundreds of players sworn up and down the same shit about other aspects of Vanilla that were proven to be wrong?
---
That's the problem with this: Any phrase that starts with “I know this 100% to be true because memory* is automatically suspect.
---
Oh, but *your* memory just happens to be true this one time. Yeah, I'm sure you believe that deeply. So does everyone else and they were wrong too.
---
Pservers got things wrong.
---
Glad I'm not the only one... lol

I've heard people say it will take 3\~4 months to reach R14.
---
I enjoy getting World buffs :) I think it is fun.
---
If they have a 6 hour cooldown I wont be trying hard to get them though. Will just get the DM, blasted lands and Songflower buff
---
And a whole lot right. You nullify everything right by one thing wrong ?
---
Tauren Hunters were always super chill as Aliance.
---
The story was supposed to be extra. (But then they found out that the thread title is wrong.) It's about getting R14 being so cool that you want to stage a screenshot with the best backdrop you can find.
---
That was TBC not Vanilla.
---
Even better if you make it an alliance character too
---
Yeah, I've been contacted by 6 different ex-guildmates since classic was announced. The addiction is strong, and people want to play with those they share good memories with.
---
So which is better? For who is this infographic?
---
I mean, if I was new to Warcraft and read this post, I'd definitely decided that Classic is inferior to Modern WoW.
---
Good find!
---
Very wrong.
---
And you can still make new alts and twinks when Naxx is out because it will be out *forever*. The classic servers will stay classic.
---
The coroutine library wasn't added in *by Blizzard* until patch 2.0.1, but people have since reversed the library to work with 1.12. It wasn't even all that difficult.
---
[SendAddonMessage was added in patch 1.12](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/API_SendAddonMessage). The only difference is that they're not logged server side, which is only useful for Blizzard and has nothing useful for developers or users.
---
Try again.
---
Some things in WoW you don’t forget. This is my one. I would bet my life that the broom looked different to what it does now.    
---
Attention vanilla veterans. Someone back me up here if they remember this broom or someone with good searching skills try and help me find the old model of this broom
---
Oh this was incredibly frustrating back in the day. Unless people were already at or around the instance I was always the first one to arrive there. Everyone else was arguing about why they were the ones that should be summoned.
---
&gt; The majority of posts on the subject seem to indicate pvp.
---
It's probably because private servers heavily skew towards PvP. Official servers on the other hand, skew the other way around, with PvE being vastly more popular than PvP. 
---
My personal guess is that we'll see PvP servers start out strong, but decline as time goes on. One huge problem for PvP servers is that there is no third faction that would balance power gains out. Instead, we have a scale that, once it starts tipping, usually *stays* declining more and more: People do not like being on the losing side constantly, so they either reroll the server, or they reroll faction. There's been servers where prime raiding time consisted of one raid desperately trying to find enough people for Karazhan.
---
This two-faction flaw was also what, in part, broke WAR. It's why private servers take measures to keep faction populations level, which Classic likely won't and can't do (imagine the outcry if Blizzard suddenly kept players from rolling new characters on a faction).
---
Because they don't need to, and therefore will avoid it if at all possible. The ideal scenario is that everyone makes there way there independently and the Warlock summons are only used if someone needs to hearth out to repair or top up on ammo.

I'd probably be a rebel too, if my government were trying to kill me. Kinda like how it must have felt when the high elves joined with the demons of the first invasion to kill the night elves - at which point the night elves were considered "rebels" by queen Az'shara, since she wanted them to die and they refused. How dare they! (Meanwhile, the night elves assumed their queen had been taken captive by the high elves, and fought to rescue her).
---
It’s not bad it’s just unnecessary and unsustainable.
---
What if you‘d abide by the unwritten rule not to use pots? Then nobody has to waste time and money farming them and restocking their supply.
---
Plus it’s a slippery slope. Okay everyone is potting. What about tubers? Okay now everyone is farming tubers. What about jujus? Okay now everyone is spamming jujus. What about sharpening stones and oil? Okay now everyone is using sharpening stones and oils. What about flasks? Okay now everyone is popping flasks. What about lost-on-death consumes like elixirs and food? Okay now everyone is popping elixirs and food when they respawn. 
---
Except you’ll realize that 90% of the time none of it was even necessary and the fights or BGs would’ve gone the same way without wasting all that gold. And what did you really even gain from using all those consumes? A few extra HKs, a few avoided deaths?
---
It’s Ike the pretentious cycling douche who drops thousands of dollars on gear, like a carbon fiber frame, specialty shop tires, custom CNCed gears, etc. just to ride around the city a few times a month.
---
Imagine nowadays bots if we would be able to use the fancy NN libraries and teach them the game. This would be amazing...
---
Never heard of it. That said I started with BC and I'm not a native english speaker so it might not be too uncommon to have missed it. Will give it a look.
---
&gt; Attention vanilla veterans. Someone back me up here if they remember this broom or someone with good searching skills try and help me find the old model of this broom
---
That's not how this works. You've just fucked with everyone's unbiased fifteen year old memories. You've done what the law calls “poisoning the jury pool” by injecting doubt and bias into the equation.
---
&gt; Some things in WoW you don’t forget. This is my one. I would bet my life that the broom looked different to what it does now.
---
And i can tell you, research has shown time and time again that the *more* emotional someone's memories are, the *less* accurate they turn out to be.
---
coroutine isn't a library. It is an LUA language feature. How could reverse it without the calling side doing something in C glue? Show me where they reverse the coroutine to work with 1.12.
---
What about other APIs like voice-chat APIs etc?
---
This is really true. Retail is a constant catch-up you have to play and you aren't really allowed to take breaks. It feels more like a job, because you basically have to play every day and you have to play at every patch or you'll get left behind. Catching up again requires a lot of playing daily.
---
That’s literally how we farmed Vanilla AV towards the end. Ghetto premades, Naxx-geared tanks.
---
Who else read this is Vork’s voice? 😂
---
Personal goals for WoW Classic? Get max level Mage &gt; get BiS and clear all raids &gt; level alts &gt; get BiS and clear all raids with them &gt; do some PvP when it rolls out, that's pretty much it.
---
I'm probably going to be playing WoW on and off in between all the new games coming out this and next year. There's a ton of them that look absolutely sick, but WoW will always be there to go back to. No more bullshit Mythic+ pushing to stay relevant. The game is just there and you can come back and continue working on your initial goal again with no new goalpost to push you farther away.
---
Also, you will clear Naxx very easily and fast this time around. I think the timetable puts it at 18 months out, so you will definitely clear it within 2 years no matter how casual you are, unless you literally play an hour a day for once a week or something. 
---
WoW Vanilla used to be hard because our databases were shit so we had very little information outside of word of mouth which was usually wrong, a lot of people were clickers and we didn't gear ourselves properly. This time around it will be infinitely easier. What is appealing about classic is the struggle, not how hard it is. You can't pull the entire dungeon, you can't solo 5 mobs at once, you run out of mana, you need to get more people for raid, you need to run everywhere etc. etc. It's not like Classic is mechanically harder than even modern retail, it just feels that way from memory. They 15-man MC these days in private servers, and they even buff elites/bosses to be harder there, so it should be easier in Classic.
---
fucking what? You had a bunch of shamans for totems and a bunch of paladins for auras, buffs, and seal of light. You're literally talking straight out of your ass
---
LOL at thinking swapping out 1 Ret for 1 Warrior in a 40 man raid is going to meaningfully slow you down.

Good luck. Back in the day we also didn't have any special buffs and got to down some bosses in Naxx.
---
Private servers did it different and IMO good guilds will require this because you want to have max 2 raid nights per week. More and it becomes a real hassle if you have a real life, even 2 raid nights is hard to maintain once you have MC/BWL/ZG/AQ20/40 and have to farm for some consumes for naxx and other raids. Buffs solved this quite nice even tho they are suuuch a pain in the ass.
---
Huge problem is also because casuals that dont raid with wbuffs and consumes also take a lot longer to clear content. Its not really a problems if you only have MC/BWL but eventually it does become one. Hardcore ones want a good raid that clears shit efficiently because honestly we've done it all before and wiping on same shit every week gets boring really quickly.

There's nothing wrong with this clip lmao, it's just delayed animations of attacks that already happened lol.

I think it sounds tacky in english
---
Blizzard never blocked coroutines from being used in Vanilla, they just didn't include their own library to support them.
---
Are you really going to argue that we should be using the 1.12 API instead of the Modern API because of voice chat?
---
The Modern API is a result of restrictions put into effect by Blizzard in response to addon exploits. Very little, if anything, of consequence has been added.
---
I’m just asking for some search god to help me find the old model. Calm down
---
&gt;It was in 2005 and 2006 on my server.
---
On my server (I got GM...ugh what a waste looking back haha) we just laughed at people with consumables in my pvp group.  You lost them when you died so it was basically a waste of gold.
---
I swear to God, if one of them is named Swifty I am going to fucking lose it.
---
Sick reference.
---
And avatar...nothing screams healing powerhouse like that set.
---
Man blizz was reall spot on with tier sets graphics in tbc
---
I was in &lt;ROFLCOPTER DOWN SEND AID&gt; on my alt rogue in Vanilla.
---
Great tool, but the actual information seems really wonky. I only looked at warrior tank, but listing a completely worthless trinket as pre-BiS for p1 and p2 and choosing Deathbone Chest and Stonegrip Gauntlets over the T1 pieces seems incredibly weird. Also the listed BiS ring for p1-p4 is a) not very good and b) drops off the D2 summon boss in Scholomance.
---
It's a little sad, since it's like the work was done 90% and it looks really nice and is easy to use.
---
BGs are the most fun part of the game for me. The faster the que the better as far as Im concerned.
---
Dude like 95% of people would find your nick just as cringey so it's hard to take that comment seriously.
---
YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RACE IN RETAIL?! That is ridiculous.
---
Just let the man make an infographic. It looks nice. I can send it to my roommate who's a WoW virgin. And OP gets to practice his design skills. All are happy. Bring out the drum circles and sing kumbaya with me, /u/Hellioning.
---
I am also confused. This only works for people who already prefer Classic
---
He means the R14s "helped" by playing at lower ranks with people so they didn't need to contribute after the fact.

Yo dude check this out. I was looking through some comments from 2007 and they are confirming my 15 year old memory of what I know to be true about this broom even though they don’t have any pics of the old model themselves

Hey guys, I know we're all very excited about the release of classic wow and eagerly awaiting exploring our old world. However, I wanted to make a video voicing my concerns over classic and presenting some arguments against the massive hype that is being curated.

And as a paladin who got GM I remember the horde using FAP a lot because pallys had blessing of freedom and it only made sense the horde should be able to use a FAP.  I can't remember if shaman had a similar spell to the pally's BoF though.
---
I think you're right and I think these guys really are not aware of the running gag about "we kangz n shit" on 4chan.

I'm pretty sure it's racially targeted, it just so happens that most "normies" don't even realize it. And that what make these edgelords think they're so sly and funny.

"Blizzard never blocked coroutines from being used in Vanilla, they just didn't include their own library to support them. " You admit that there are a lot of things you can do in live which you can't do in vanilla?
---
Little consequences are NOT true. Here are lots of consequences which brought by these restrictions.
---
One example is nameplates APIs changes which destroy the gameplay of colorblind people.
---
 [https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20755546851](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20755546851) 
---
Another example is BFA's restrictions towards LFG APIs which break spam filter add-ons while WQ add-ons can still work.
---
What about making the raid pay for the main tank repair ? With 30 people, the repairing fee for raiders could be as low as 30 silver per repair to make it less a struggle for the main tank.
---
Exhibit 1: Old school runescape
---
Hunters or mages I believe

Don't know of ones that are updated yet, but for actual Vanilla Addons pfQuest is one, and Joana has one too. Azeroth Auto Pilot will no doubt be updating too.

Has anyone tried the glitch before hovering over another character with a different race and pressing enter so when you log in it looks like your an opposite race but everyone sees you as normal I used to do it all the time
---
You could also blink trough if you climbed up on the side. (At the time you could also use the unstuck function for a "blink" on any class)
---
Farmers broom is not using the old model and instead is using the new shitty updated model
---
"The talent system is vastly more complex"
---
Should read "Vastly more fun and engaging" 
---
I used to love messing with talent calculators when wow was down for maintenance. I never went with cookie cutter builds, I always did what I wanted. 
---
This was actually in TBC but my favorite build on my warlock back in the day, always included going far enough into the affliction tree to be able to mana tap your imp's mana, using him as a mana battery. It required phasing him put so he didn't attack and couldn't be attacked, but most of the time I had to have my imp parked close to the tank for the stam buff anyway. I can't remember the range it had back then but it wasn't far. 
---
But the imp's mana regenerates super fast and running out of mana was actually a thing for dps casters back then. We had mana tap, but that made it harder on the healers, especially when we were doing progression content. Being able to sap my imp's mana was a game changer for me. Way more uptime on my dps while also not taxing our struggling healers.
---
Seems you care. Why don't you fuck off back to your shitty little private server and pretend some kids leveling in the barrens are your friends and talk about how magical it is when you talk out of your ass
---
One comments says: 
---
&gt; The new graphic for this item came with patch 2.2. I assume many players will use it for witch costumes.
---
and a later comment says:
---
&gt; just a warning, on the current PTR (2.3.7382) the graphic on this is back to the old style broom. it's no longer "witches broom" looking. not sure if it's a bug, or if they only made it witches broomy for Halloween and intend to change it back.
---
So Classic should reflect the non-witchy model, which is the older model, yes?
---
Cross realm BGs. I'd rather have nemesis' in the world anyway tbh, and friends. As someone playing BfA still, sharding is cancer.
---
Layering will be better but not perfect. But you said sharding so, that's the answer.
---
Then why did I hear about this litterally 2 weeks ago? I can´t be bothered to dig up my source because it is really not that important to me. I simply paraphrased from memory. The problem persists because they had to rebuild the game on the new engine which was implemented during wrath I believe. This has some issues which are not easily resolvable, but they are working on it. 
---
I was watching Kargoz stream where they started discussing this, and one of the people in the call stated that they had been in contact with blizzard about it. You can look through his previous streams to find it if you want it, I can´t be bothered.
---
&gt; You admit that there are a lot of things you can do in live which you can't do in vanilla?
---
No, I don't admit this at all because it's wrong.
---
Again, you're not supporting your argument that the Modern API is less restrictive than the Vanilla API. Both examples you just listed make the Modern API MORE restrictive.

it didn't look like any of those long range hits registered though

Looted Stockade Pauldrons while farming in EPL on my priest, gave them to my irl buddy who was playing warrior tank.

Two days later he looted crusader enchant recipe while farming the elite and gave it to me
---
MindControlCeption - But I like it. Hope someone tests this.
---
Me too. Sometimes you just gotta laugh at terrible things.
---
This is coming from someone with many people around him who suffer from mental health issues, constantly trying to help people. If you don't laugh you cry, as they say.
---
That was the worst for me. Compared to Outlands where I actually touched every single zone a lot from 60 to 70.
---
I understand there are games that have done this successfully, I'm just not certain WoW will be able to achieve this.
---
Also I am talking without any idea of numbers, but the fact OSCR had a mobile app would have helped that, one of the main things in the video i talk about is lack of time, and having access to the game on your phone would help combat that.
---
Awesome work! Thank you!
---
This guy gets it.
---
Lich King is dead and Bolvar Fordragon died with him...
---
I was almost rank 11 the 1st time, and I mostly just fucked around in WSG and AB.
---
I know right? Thats what I was thinking. And most of them are making youtube vids about it. Jeez bro write it down, no need to make a video...
---
The reason that Warcraft is suffering right now is because they're insisting with moving us through with plot of the lore. WoW was great because the lore that they took was all the obscure parts that were mentioned in passing but what we, as a player, were then able to explore with our own eyes without touching on the main storyline that involved the Alliance and the Horde all that much. As we moved past Cataclysm, however, we saw our characters getting more and more involved as big players rather than glorified footsoldiers ... and our immersion fell, because by making us big players, we were narrowed down in our scopes: we were the big shots now and moving along with the plot.
---
I do, however, like the Legion twist that TBC was a miscommunication between us and Illidan's forces that had us butting heads instead.
---
Lionheart Helm recipe is a random world drop, not a drop from ragnaros or any other raid. So you can you´ll be able to grab it before the first MC raid in case there is a 300 armor blacksmith who was lucky to get the recipe.
---
Streamers pretending to "hype" the game doesn't factor into the success of classic.
---
If anyone says that the only successful games are the top 5 viewed on twitch... is crazy - gaming is much larger than the 1 million viewers twitch has across 5 games.
---
With how shit BFA and future expansions will be - the market for Classic will only rise. 
---
Those big lulls of content that modern wow faces gives an easy reason to jump in classic while they literally have nothing to do in modern wow.
---
Of course players will drop, but there will also be players that join over the lifetime of classic.
---
The biggest factor in Classic succeeding is NOT streamers, but the fact that there are zero mmorpgs in 2019/2020 that offer the same gameplay experience as Classic - that's the key and why Classic will be a runaway success that will shock blizzard when they look at playtime of BFA vs Classic within the first 1-2 years.
---
Look at the tank ultimate shield : they chose the Naxxx healer shield instead of the right one ...
---
there is enough content to do before P2
---
Even if you are among the ones that are 60 realy fast, there is still a huge grind fest to ve done, for your weapons and such  
---
Not sure about P1 / P2 , but world PVP will be a thing, assure you
---
&gt;I can’t think of a system with 0 shortfalls, but the old system had plenty.
---
I can think of one that's much better than what WoW Classic will use. It might not have zero flaws, but that's partly because a system like PvP interacts with other systems like PvE, and problems in one system can affect others.
---
Basically, one purpose of the PvP system was to give people who didn't enjoy PvE raids a way to have equal gear. But why didn't people enjoy PvE raids? If you make PvE raids more enjoyable, you decrease the requirement to give highest-quality gear in every slot to the "best" PvPers, however you define "best". (Once current rank requirement to equip gear was removed, "best" became "plays the most hours".)
---
Quick description of better system, since this is a Reddit comment that only a few people will read:
---
PvP ranks are better for prestige than to grant access to gear. People with top PvP titles should include people who have very good gear from PvE (that has stats that also help in PvP, like stamina). Eliminate or greatly reduce decay from time; introduce 'decay' from dying, that includes several variables that encourage fair fights and reward people who overcome great odds. A high PvP rank might grant access to high-quality items in a few slots, but it isn't the main purpose. You would expect people at the highest ranks to remain relatively constant on a server, instead of people rotating out of the highest rank in an orderly fashion using a queue (and then dropping out of sight as they stop PvP intensely).
---
You would be able to get high-quality gear in another fashion: many victories in a premade bracket, using a quest system. The system is designed to make victories in this bracket challenging, but lack of gear should not prevent a skilled group from winning. Lower-quality gear would come from quests in non-premade battlegrounds, probably collection quests of insignia or something so players can't AFK to victory.
---
In some cases, you would buy items from points earned in PvP, but these points would be from battleground (and possibly world-PvP) objectives, not from killing other players. No incentive to fight in midfield in WSG, unless you care about your rank.
---
Then other systems to encourage fair world PvP and perhaps discourage ganking without doing something stupid like turning you into a chicken like I think Warhammer did. Sort of like the bounty system in BfA if you get several kills without dying.
---
Huh good to know thank you! Sounds like a warlock is becoming more and more appealing
---
Your last point is wrong. It might make sense at max level but while leveling hybrids need 2 or 3 sets of gear. 
---
How can you complain about a paladin wanting something for his tank set when tanks are the hardest role to fill in leveling dungeons?
---
You also shouldn't complain about tanks and healers in dungeons rolling on dps gear because they need that shit to level outside of dungeons.
---
It's simple you choose to play dps and you get gear completion. The healer and tank might not have gear competition for healing and tanking items but they need to have 2 or 3 sets of gear. So it all evens out. 
---
This whole main spec &gt; off spec shit is why pservers are full of dps warriors that won't tank. Because people tell them they can't roll on dps gear while tanking.
---
vanilla API is less restrictive than modern ones are something you players claim. Where did I say modern API is less restrictive than vanilla API or vanilla API is less restrictive than modern ones? Show me the source.
---
Not mentioning other APIs like C\_LFGList APIs, C\_Community APIs. C\_Wow\_Token APIs, Twitter APIs, etc which have to be blocked on classic.
---
You have to admit using modern APIs would just reduce the work of addon authors' work so they can migrate a lot of code from retail without testing on classic or even write/test code on retail and never play vanilla.
---
They say it is complex compared to how talent system in modern wow work.
---
“Vastly more complex” whoever wrote that is fucking stupid.
---
Sounds like a bunch of casual talk to me!
---
Based on your profile history, I doubt you were out of diapers during Vanilla.
---
I tried figuring out how the site ranks items and failed, but clearly it's doing a really bad job for defensive stats. Like, the Dark Iron Ring is clearly not among the top 2 rings with AQ40 loot available. Even only considering defensive stats, the exalted Bronze Dragonflight one offers +2 Def and +4 Stamina, compared to 110 armor off the Dark Iron one.
---
Wpvp is fun but ganking low level players really sucks. It's the reason I'll play a pve server instead of pvp. I only get a couple of hours to play wow at a time and getting ganked just totally ruins the game for me.
---
Why do you want MC purples if you're not going to be raiding? What will you do with it?
---
As a priest I don't think you can individually buff a full group with one mana bar. Enjoy the downtime !

---
The mobile app is a very recent edition and it was over a year delayed. 
---
OSRS was booming before the mobile app. A lot of the PVE content is off limits for 99% of mobile users due to the mechanics. Though some players have completed the hardest content in the game using mobile but these players are the 0.1%
---
Most people using the mobile app with be casual players or people doing the boring afk skills while watching tv etc.
---
Thanks for the answer, very helpful!
---
Why would you mention the lack of race change over the lack of hairstyle change? I never went into any game thinking I'd be able to change my elf girl into a cow man. Hairstyle change on the other hand is something that I was surprised to find was not in vanilla.
---
I feel like we are talking past each other. I wrote that hunters are at a disadvantage in world pvp. You criticized it, but saying that dueling is a worse scenario than wpvp. I replied with stating three disadvantages in wpvp which are not present in duels. But then you criticize that by saying that duels also have disadvantages for hunters? Yes, they do. I never said they do not. I hope you do see that this doesn't prove my point wrong in any way about world pvp.  Duels indeed do have limited range, you are right. Depending on the current terrain World PVP also has limited range due to aggroing mobs and blocking terrain such as hills or walls.  
---
 "**You're blowing completely irrelevant things out of proportion while ignoring much more important things.** " - I disagree. Pointing out the existence of pet happiness to new players is useful information, even if it becomes a smaller issue as you level. I do not "worry" about it, I just simply state its existence. You are wrong if you think that this should not be mentioned to newcomers. Also, what are the much more important things I'm ignoring?  
---
 " formatting your text cleanly just makes it easier" - I format my text out of respect for you and other people who are reading. I can't believe you try to criticize a positive thing.
---
*Moar fun.
---
According to a poll that I saw, Shaman are going to be the most played class.  Honestly, I find this kind of odd, because shaman aren't particularly great in raiding.
---
I used to play a priest in vanilla retail, and iirc Mind Control's tooltip is not accurate - what the ranks actually do is increase the number of levels above ur own that it works successfully on. With Rank 1 you can do it on mobs +2 levels of your own, so with the current beta lvl cap, you can MC lvl 42 mobs with a lvl 40 character.
---
&lt;Holy Rollers&gt; 
---
Nothing but Priests and Pallys.
---
It's there but only to put you in a group with people who clicked on the same stone recently, it's a "meeting" stone not a "summoning" one.

---
https://youtu.be/5x9f2jT7SX4?t=59
---
You literally highlight "The Vanilla, or 1.12 API, in fact, is less restrictive than the one we have for modern WoW." and say "this is wrong".
---
And now your argument is that the Modern API is less restrictive because Blizzard has to remove certain API functions for the Classic API that work with features that are NOT in Classic at all?
---
Just stop.
---
&gt; You have to admit using modern APIs would just reduce the work of addon authors' work so they can migrate a lot of code from retail without testing on classic or even write/test code on retail and never play vanilla.
---
Yes, making use of the Modern API in Classic makes development *eaiser*. But it does not make addons more powerful.
---
He probably wants to just farm or do some light pvp since having raid gear will make the eventual honor grind that much easier.
---
I dunno, if you got 2 hours to play WoW, you've got enough time to clear MC once per week.
---
I think it does. The 'success' as you call it of classic (before we've actually played it) is being watched solely through streamers which is why i focused this video around that issue for a while. 
---
I'm not saying to have a successful game it has to be on twitch or youtube (Rocket League is a great example of this) but with today the main way games are able to attract a new audience is through youtube and twitch personalities playing their game. 
---
How will the market for classic rise? As I said we have the same player base playing it, we wont see a huge jump in new players (i'm not calling players who havent played since wrath new btw i mean actually new to wow)
---
That being said, I hope youre right. This video is just to highlight some issues i see with the game, as I said i'm a huge fan of WoW and I hope it's a success
---
Haven’t lived at home in years, came to stay with my mom for a few days and noticed this bad boy in a box of stuff she was gonna take to a friends garage sale a few months back.. So glad I found it again after all these years lol. With Classic right around the corner it was perfect timing! Needless to say I peeled the mf $0.75 sticker off faster then you could smash need on Barons mount.
---
Exhibit A: Private Servers
---
Exhibit B: Blizzard backpedalling on their decision, the only way a company decides to something is of there is financial game
---
Exhibit C: Niche market, there are not a lot of MMORPG's available that fulfill the role of classic wow, harder than most yet casual oriented.
---
It makes me Tilfreds
---
farming dungeons for daaaaaaaaaaaaays.
---
What? Haha when did the teleport function become a thing?
---
You are right in that it can drop from random mobs around the world! But Ragnaros, the World Bosses, and Nefarian, where only Ragnaros is available in Phase 1, have a significantly higher drop rate for this recipe.
---
I think it's very, very unreasonable to list it as Phase 1 pre-raid BiS, just because of the low chance that anyone will be able to craft it before you first enter Molten Core, at which point you're no longer looking at "pre-raid" gear. Listing it for Phase 2 is fair, though.
---
Then again, getting it during the end of Phase 1 might still be possible. And on some servers, like you say, the extremely lucky might have the possibility of crafting it before entering Molten Core.
---
i played a shadowpriest. you are horribly wrong.
---
Some people lived through Warlord's, even if half the people survive phase 1 without quitting, you will still be left with a massive amount of people to play with
---
You want to have a minimum of intel then stack stam cuz stam=mana with Life Tap.
---
Once you feel like you have the good balance between mana/stam and your regen you should aim for some +shadow power/spell power gear to reduce kill time.
---
You can pvp or farm gold with a blue weapon or an MC level weapon, tell me which one will you prefer?
---
That is one quest chain i have never ever finished, so classic comes, it's time.
---
I think you are being far too general and assuming that all players have families, commitments etc I am a full time working single father and I play on private servers casually with 2 of my friends. We did not rush to 60, we took our time to enjoy all the game has to offer through the leveling experience. You say it’s a grind to get that xp, well ye, it is but when you don’t focus on the xp bar and just getting to the end game then of course you won’t want to play or just hop into an easier quick game. The thing is if you don’t keep looking at the xp bar and just play then before you know it you are 60. Your concerns are fair but you are placing all except steamers in the exact same boat as yourself, and I am afraid that is flawed. I think the exact opposite will happen and blizzard and even other game companies will see the power of this game and try to achieve a similar style just with modern tech, perhaps even a WOW 2 (high hopes I know). That’s just my 2 cents
---
Absolutely shocking behaviour. Has she no *shame!?*
---
IIRC, you could mount on the very tip, but it was hard to do without falling off.
---
It's probably based on Taladrils tankpoints sheet. When all stats are taken into account (that includes the extra armor) then Shield of Condemnation is better than Face of Death.

I've never had one but I read that the drivers are no longer working on modern systems
---
What's a FedEx route? Is it just a route consisting only of quests that involve talking to other npcs that are far away?
---
All I know is that I could write rotation bots with the old API. That alone warrants its removal so OP is objectively wrong.
---
Druid is a class fantasy I've always loved in all games. Being a servant of nature, summoning a thicket of thorns to snare your enemies. Shapeshifting into incredible forms, speaking to animals, etc.
---
Shame Druids in vanilla WoW kind of suck. Probably gonna roll a Paladin or a Priest.
---
Or choose both!
---
Damn, imma have to test it out and see. Either way, I’m glad I ran across it.
---
Patch 2.01 for BC
---
Top notch bug reporting. Someone get this man a beta key.
---
she still alive right?
---
I think that writing about the existence of pet happiness and the need to manage it is useful in a post directed at new players, even if there is an addon that can manage a part of that for you.  
---
You are right about the succubus CC, I didn't remember that limitation. This does indeed increase the usefulness of freezing trap in a couple of dungeons that are heavily populated by non-humanoid mobs.
---
Who the heck plays with their abilities on the side action bar?
---
I guess I still identify with the elitist "But BGs aren't real PvP!!1" mindset. The fact that people were going to BGs let Blizzard ignore that dishonorable kills were stupidly implemented and helped kill off city raids, for example. As I saw it, if you were around the same level as the guards that spawned, attacking a town was fair game, but the DHK implementation disagreed.
---
Arenas are similar. Some people would say that a "true PvPer" in WoW is one who spends lots of time in arenas and gets the highest rank. But other people who enjoy PvP intensely dislike arenas; and a subset of these people also disliked battlegrounds.
---
My point though, is that if someone complains that they have to spend more time PvPing for 10 hours a day, it suggests they don't enjoy doing so.
---
It was meat grinder. Just like every real life " epic " battle . ( especially in great war). I know wow is not real life. Just a though.
---
Same for me. I'm not even that big of a pvper but the PvP world is the core experience of the game imho . Without it ist just not the same and absolutly not wow for me.
---
However everybody can feel how they like so it's a good think that there are pve servers of course.
---
If you put every single classic private server together would you get 1million players? Not being sarcastic, i actually am not certain on the numbers. 
---
I understand this is a game people (myself included want), but I'm not certain that we'll all play it as much as we used to be able to and make this game grow like we once did. 
---
How is wow casual orientated? I know its more casual then most of the games like it at the time, but in todays gaming market it surely has to be one of the hardest games coming out in the past few years to properly play.
---
Who actually would buy a used keyboard! It‘s worse than buying a 2nd hand toilet in terms of bacteria 😂
---
"WoW Classic won't be a success because rather than being full of kids that had to convince their parents to pay for a subscription, we're all adults that don't give a shit about $15"
---
Also, lol @ 18 months to get to 60. If you follow any of the mass available guides, you can easily get under 10 /days played. That means you're expecting to only play 27 minutes a day.
---
20 minutes a couple nights a week? That isn't fun.
---
&gt; Exhibit B: Blizzard backpedalling on their decision, the only way a company decides to do something is if there is financial gain
---
That's only because Retail is bleeding subs.
---
I’m sure they’ll be releasing it slowly. They said the reason they aren’t adding unarmored mounts is because they don’t want people rushing to 60 and grinding gold since the mounts would be removed soon after launch if it kept true to patches.
---
But the thing is it doesn’t really matter. It’s not like bfa where you farm your raid each week and when the next one comes you never enter that raid again. People will still be pugging it, people will probably still need gear from it, your guild might do alt runs.
---
killed Ragnaros maybe like 200 times, never seen it dropping there as far as i remeber, got it twice pretty early. In original classic i got it from a random gargoyle in strath, and the second one (on a private server \~2 years ago) , from a spider inside scholomance.
---
I´m pretty sure since its BoE and most of the ppl are aware that this item is huge (one of the most valuable items in the game imo), it will be available pretty quick. A hardcore guild will pay any price for the recipe to give them a huge increase in dps.
---
To clear a raid. Back in the day I was a noob rogue, so finding a guild was pretty hard because 90% of all guilds required you to have cleared atleast MC and Rogues was a crowded class. I'm an honest person so I never considered lying my way into a guild. Those guilds that would have me disbanded after 1-2 weeks.
---
If I can't have that I atleast want to get the Tier 0.5 set, it was a fun questline that felt very rewarding.
---
Yeah, I posted before my morning coffee.
---
Well the last expansions like legion and BFA had a pretty good start compared to cata and mop. I remember being stuck in 1 q for 2h in mop launch... in BFA it was a bit laggy here and there but it was playable.
---
I dont know how classic will be, but they are doing stresstests will spawned ragnaros and MANY characters on the spawnarea etc. So they hopefully will be prepared for launch.
---
All of this is spot on. I've been in bleeding edge progression raiding guilds on retail and I can relate to this. If you're in a top world guild, not only will your spec matter, but so will your racials. You will be expected to max out professions or whatever to look for every theoretical damage increase that you can. 
---
For the vast majority of guilds this will not be the case. Even among top 50-60 world guilds you'll see a big disparity between one Fury Warrior to the next. The person controlling that class/spec is what matters for the majority of guilds.
---
So does the training to use them
---
The only class with more raid representation than Shaman in an ideal raid composition is Warrior.
---
Doesn’t nullify the fact that they are skilled at making more money than you
---
I think its the tauren range combined with lag on this clip
---
Patch 2.3 in TBC also removed a lot of elite quests and mobs so many places could be soloed.
---
We sold loot in Vanilla. Most of them bought gold from Chinese farmers and were awful, awful players.
---
I truly support this! I intend on being one of those players flying for the content as fast as possible. But i truly think only the first few phases should come out quickly. get PvP into the PvPers hands, but the later raids phases should be 6 months apart in my opinion. 
---
But i think the best decision will be to judge it as it comes. i hope they don't stick to a rigid hard and fast schedule and dynamically release the content when appropriate.
---
I'm only a minute in and I'll finish watching just to hear this guys thoughts, but his points have all been really retarded thus far. Was about to take brief comments and respond to em, but post was already getting to a books length in under a minute lol. Yeah now he's moving onto other shitty arguments made a million times.
---
I know what this is about, sounds like my friend. Constantly complains he "doesn't have the time" to play games, but the reality is he does and just has other things he'd rather be doing or he chose to pursue a life (such as the typical family man) where he in fact doesn't have time and is upset about his life choices and projects it onto people who valued gaming enough to prioritize their free time towards it. Every so often you'll see those "I'm married and have 30 kids will I be able to play classic?" posts. Lmao I typed this before he actually made the "people have lives now!" argument. Alright I'm done, this is dumb without a live commentary w/ video.
---
How do you know it wasn't his 15th scholo trying to get it?
---
Did you reported this to devs somehow ?
---
Sorry, I had to chuckle when I read that the talent system is "**vastly** more complex". More complex? Sure. But "vastly more complex"? Hahahaha, no.
---
That is true and point taken! I had no other real ways to base it off though except for my personal experiences, which is why i went with that but i do understand i dont speak for everyone. Thanks for sharing though, I'm going to try to do the same thing that you are now when classic is released but I just wanted to start a discussion about this topic and see what everyone had to say!
---
This thread died 2 weeks ago and I don’t agree with you.
---
I don't think cross faction twitch meme bounties are realistic. Blocking twitch memes (or replacing them with other text) would be possible though and I'll definitely do it if this subreddit's paranoid predictions about streamers being everywhere comes true.
---
Still a hundred times more meaningful and difficult decisions than the vanilla talents.
---
Sure, every guild will likely take 5-8 shaman, but they're still not that great at topping meters.  They're also healbot bitches in pve.
---
Thank you! I've been saying this stuff for several days now, it's good to see other people who have an understanding beyond just parroting talking points about meme specs. 
---
it's hard to fill a 40 man raid. I've been a part of several 25 man raiding guilds that have died, even those weren't easy to field 25 people as other guilds would try to poach your members, or personalities would clash, people would stop showing up, and what not and sometimes they'd eventually die. This will be an even bigger issue with 40 man raiding guilds. It's just absurd to think that a decent guild would turn down a good Ret Paladin because in reality guilds never have these perfect situations where they have all the best rogues, warriors, and mages at their beck and call.
---
Because a keep isn’t a castle and you are taking “fortified tower” too literally.
---
I found it really interesting you used Wikipedia for the point that furthered that view rather than to use the link of keep itself.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep
---
As you can clearly see as indicated by the castle of york, the keep or york sits inside of it. 
---
And this is just a historically accurate example and by this example I think you would be hard pressed to not call shadow fang keep indeedly a keep.
---
I also noticed you made a very false argument in regards to having a moat or not being of discernible note. 
---
I highly advise you read the Wikipedia page I provided.
---
**Keep**
---
A keep (from the Middle English kype) is a type of fortified tower built within castles during the Middle Ages by European nobility. Scholars have debated the scope of the word keep, but usually consider it to refer to large towers in castles that were fortified residences, used as a refuge of last resort should the rest of the castle fall to an adversary. The first keeps were made of timber and formed a key part of the Motte-and-Bailey castles that emerged in Normandy and Anjou during the 10th century; the design spread to England as a result of the Norman invasion of 1066, and in turn spread into Wales during the second half of the 11th century and into Ireland in the 1170s. The Anglo-Normans and French rulers began to build stone keeps during the 10th and 11th centuries; these included Norman keeps, with a square or rectangular design, and circular shell keeps.
---
Sorry, it was 2005 not 2004 as I was a sophomore in high school, but yeah I guess the inflation happens fast.
---
Question.
---
It will still be beneficial for a dual wielding human rogue with 308 sword skill to go above the 6% hit cap right? I'm thinking about the 27% miss chance for dual wielding. Do we know if there's any dual wielding hit "soft cap"?
---
Thanks for a great and informative post!
---
Actually I wouldn't mind having slight height discrepancies between characters now that I see it. Looks pretty neat.
---
The taller guy looks to be floating, his feet seem to be higher
---
You are overthinking it a bit...
---
IIRC they said that layering will only be in the first week or 2. After that the players will be scattered around so the layering will be deactivated.
---
Also ppl will not quit after 1x clearing MC, (except they dont care for the gear). Most of us will clear it weekly because they want that gear, and you will not have everything after 1 or 2 runs...
---
Second you can do is skill your professions, farm gold for your epic mount, do world pvp. Farm dungeons for gear etc.
---
By the time you have cleared mc 5-6 times you will have decent gear and then phase2 is around the corner.
---
Yeah it's definitely true that there was a direct conflict between fun and grinding honor efficiently. Farming pugs is around 2x faster, but tremendously boring (to me at least).
---
&gt;to be basically a hunter pet
---
At least hunters pet hold agro well and don't behave like prima donna ! :o
---
\+1
---
I have a full time job and a relationship. I'd love to play WoW like I used to but I don't have the time as a 31 year old that needs to adult.
---
Loatheb was hotfixed to dispel Vampiric Embrace after that kill. He didn't need to dispel it in 1.12 (and he won't dispel it in Classic) because Shadow Priests didn't have Vampiric Touch. They actually ran out of mana.
---
2.0 talents man. They're OP.
---
Strong agree. I play warrior, I like big numbers, but still, I would really, really prefer disabling world buffs in a newly released 40-man raid for the first 4 weeks, or even during the whole phase while it's endgame content. I understand the no-changes issue, but incentives to NOT play your characters are really frustrating.
---
Would be awesome if characters were born with different heights
---
Always the one on the left :D
---
The Shaman with his ability to draw energies from the elements. It's primal, raw, terrifying and chaotic. Just like nature.
---
Lol do you bring a tent and a campfire with you on that roadtrip to the middle auctioneer?
---
Why?
---
Summoning from one part of the instance to a different part of the instance is perfectly fine. The behavior that has been fixed was the ability for a group inside an instance to summon someone that was *outside* the instance.
---
The nut house has a patient missing.
---
[Hypnotic Blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7714/hypnotic-blade) is a pretty easy to get item.
---
I mean some people are into getting whipped as well, I'm not judging
---
I want rule 34 of the ooga gang
---
How do you know that she doesn't identify as something else? With this being Warcrat and all, maybe something like... well... say dragonkin or something? Wouldn't surprise me if it were true.
---
Be a true millennial. Slap her and call her a thot.
---
Why should people be disallowed from optaining them if the content is already doable without? Just let them get their buffs, and join a guild that dont.
---
Also people started to understand how to farm gold
---
I am against any expansions in the way they did it before.
---
I welcome the visions they had back in the vanilla since the ressources exist now.
---
Not tbc.
---
Rather fill up azeroth first.
---
No lvl cap
---
Lvl caps destroy 90% of the game by turning it into a useless thing.
---
I agree
---
Please explain why i'm retarded and not just stating a viewpoint different to yours? 
---
At the moment I have plenty of time to play games, I'm just playing devil's advocate and promoting discussion about will classic find success long term or not! I do enjoy wow (not so much bfa) so I’m going to make time, just not so much next year with juggling new responsibilities! 
---
Of course I’m going to say this isn’t what I want. I have no one else’s experiences to base this off except my own, so of course I’m putting in my personal view. Did you want me to make this an essay and not put opinion into a topic that is obviously opinion based? I’m showing my opinion and asking people their own view!
---
Got the impression they read this sub as much as official forums, but I posted it here:  https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/character-size-display-bug/197372
---
Sounds like FInal fantasy and their subclass system
---
Indeed. Here's hoping it will be released in classic in some way.
---
Who is going to farm raids so that shadow priests can have a gear set?  I'd clear it once, but after that I'm not going back.
---
Literally never quested in Desolace or earned reputation with either of these factions. I started playing in '06. Got my Shaman to 60 just before TBC came out and continued playing on and off until early Cata.
---
Thanks for reminding me that this game is *huge*. I'm going to make sure to hit this zone this time around. You know, just to keep it fresh.
---
You are delusional, shadowpriest is incredibly strong and tanky due to shield and vampiric embrace in PVP, they wreck most classes and its not even hard. SWP damage is out of this world.
---
Higher stam=less crotch on troll 
---
Injured=more crotch, activate racial to stand back up fully
---
I'm happy to!
---
Me and my friend bought two of these things.  It was a piece of shit.
---
Holy fuckin shit, can you read?
---
In wpvp its fine to use what u have but using potions in duels is shitty.
---
in duels you test your skill and not who has more and better hp potions...
---
Also you wont die and have to do a deathrun of 5min like in wpvp.
---
In my experience people are blowing this way out of proportion. PVP servers are not some anarchistic wastelands where everyone corpse camps all day every day and will seek every opportunity to grief the opposing faction.   
---
I've leveled through STV twice in vanilla (rogue (well, rogues obviously have it easy) and a warlock), and I got ganked maybe 3-4 times across them both. And not a single corpse camp.
---
&lt;Baer durid saz no moo moo&gt;
---
&lt;I has candy in van&gt;
---
the MC will be canceled the moment you get MCd yourself. its a total loss of control of your character and thus counts as an interrupt. so youre entire idea is flawd in a sense. not bashing, just letting you know how the mechanic works
---
Why should they not be allowed to gather the buffs if they want to? I really do not get the fun destroying part. Let's say you get burning adrenaline on the vaelastrasz fight and lose you buffs while the other mages/warriors/ect. still have theirs then of course it will be annoying to be lower on the meters, but hardly enough to ruin an entire raid night. I guess it depends on the guild you are in whether or not it becomes an issue.
---
If you run SM enough to get a Hypnotic Blade, then you're probably going to have either the offhand from SM GY or the one from the Horde/Alliance quest chains without even trying. All are miles ahead of that green offhand.
---
That mail chest piece is nice though. Leather belt ain't bad either.
---
this is the classic content i just can't wait to disappear  
---
wtf is this guy thinking with this low effort garbage lol
---
Why add a camera if your face is blacked out anyways?
---
Maybe Blizzard should just separate servers, create a few with premade level 60s and a release schedule of 1-2 months between phases for the speedrunners so the more casual players can have a fun and more laid back experience with phases that drop when a good portion of the playerbase had time to actually enjoy the previous content.
---
What you call leveling hell is half the fun of the vanilla experience, rushing through it is the last I want to do, if I wanted to do that, I could just play retail and buy a level whateveritis these days.

I've always thought kangz just referred to hip hop and "we was kangz (kings)"
---
Need on Barons mount haha
---
Tomatoes grow a vine though...
---
Wait, retail wow talent system is even simpler than classic?
---
You are delusional, you know people have played private servers for years and are not drawing their info from vanilla back then right? Shadowpriest is stronger than it ever was because people know how to actually play. Tell me a class that 1v1's a priest.
---
Once they run out, how do you get soulshards as a lvl 20 in a high lvl zone ? Do you just hearth, get your ss in a lvl 20 zone and run back (with all the corpse runs that ensue) to your assigned position ?
---
You guys know how to make the game unfun !!!
---
xrealm of cause, it is the much lesser evil, and TBH dead realms or unbalanced realms need xrealm bgs. Sharding is an omnipresent evil, the world in WoW is clearly the most important w in that mix ......
---
You must play Horde. Feathermoon Stronghold sucks major ass. Ruins the whole zone when you have to swim for a mile every time you want to turn in a quest.
---
A lot of classes have to do that, welcome to vanilla, obviously u never played.
---
There is nothing wrong in the clip.
---
Its been taken way out of context.
---
Evidently you don't though, if you are suggesting that the class with the longest range, wild assortment of cc and tracking abilities is bad in world pvp.
---
One of my favorite zones, right after Tanaris.
---
Cholera. It's the more survivable sickness, the plague killed millions, but cholera deaths could have been avoided. Patients die from dehydration due to severe liquid loss, drinking a lot of water can help until the infection is under control...
---
The biggest difference is that they've streamlined social interaction out of WoW.
---
I'm so glad there's no group finder or any of that crap in Classic.
---
Me mumbo, me die in 2 hit

Why is this site recommending +3 defense enchant on wrists instead of stamina? FOR A DRUID TANK??? FAIL.

Dwarf dwarf and gnome

Four rows, tbc added two
---
" No more so than other classes." - Keep in mind I didn't say that other ranged classes don't have similar disadvantages.  
---
" You have track beasts, track hidden, feign death and frost trap to control the environment. Double points if you're NE and can open on some poor bastard from shadowmeld." - I agree with this. I've never said that hunter do not have tools for controlling the environment. I used all these in wpvp back in the day, and I managed to kill players who were sometimes 5-10 levels higher than me. I still think that other ranged classes have better tools when you want to change kiting direction in wpvp due to terrain or mobs. The hunters main tools for this are scatter shot and freezing trap. I think that a mage's frost nova and polymorph, or a warlock's fear and succubus kiss are more reliable, since they can be cast on you again if it gets resisted. When an enemy resists your freezing trap as a hunter, that can be the difference between winning or losing.  
---
" You've also not address the wipe-saving potential of both your pet grabbing agro when needed, or FD resetting when possible" - This is a good point, it can indeed be very useful.  
---
" Additionally, hunter dps requires no ramp up time and is more than viable against other DPS classes" - I didn't say that hunters were worse dps than other classes, I said that hunters don't have exceptionally good dps. That doesn't mean they are not viable against other classes.  
---
" Sheep is pound for pound the best CC *in most circumstances*, but we've already established you're bringing a mage anyways, more than likely" I agree. Freezing trap can be very useful in a couple dungeons which are heavily populated with non-humanoid mobs, or as an extra form of cc when playing next to a mage. But that still means that sheep is the best CC in most cases just like you said, which to me means that a mage's CC is overall better than a hunter's, which is exactly what I said. I feel like you bring up a lot of good points, but most of them do not really challenge my own points, but rather add additional information (which is of course appreciated)  
---
" No offense mate, but while its clear you did *play* a hunter, it sounds as if you weren't really a *good* hunter. I'm not saying that to be an ass either, because frankly the majority of players in Vanilla were bad, and demographically Hunter's had more bads-to-goods than other classes. " - I feel that memories and opinions from 14 years ago can be useful for new players who are interested in playing a hunter in classic, but are not at all sufficient to determine someone's skill level in the past. Maybe you are wrong, maybe I am wrong. My guild considered me a decent hunter player and I found much success and joy in dueling and world pvp. It took a while to master the mechanics of a hunter, but in PVP I viewed them as a challenge to overcome, which I think I successfully did at around level 40-45.
---
The dungeon finder is one of the main culprits in the destruction of the sense of community in WoW. So there not being a dungeon finder is absolutely one of the reasons you like classic.
---
How long do you think each Phase should last then. Phase 2 really doesn't add that much content.
---
Some people have more gold than skill, that's part of the game u know
---
Honestly I don't agree about the talents being more complex. Most of the talents are just % modifiers and it general you quite fast find the cookie cutter build and just run with that. Just because you have more points doesn't make it more complex, which is kind of why it was removed. Of course modern WoW have cookie cutter too, but many classes have to make choices even based on what dungeon they run and at least you have choices between meaningful talents (somewhat), compared to the old where you just pick whichever is the highest % modifier.
---
Now, I do really enjoy the old talent system. It gives a lot like progression during leveling and I feel like it is just fun in an RPG to have these kind of modifier talents too. It is one of the things I'm really excited to have back, but don't try to say it is more complex. It is just more bloated.
---
There isn't a class that compares to Shaman in raid damage healing. Chain Heal is OP.
---
I always take issue with the talent system comment. I would use "rewarding" rather than complex. If your taking wow any bit seriously, you are following a build guide on where to put your points(which you should be doing to be competitive) is no different in vanilla than it is today.
---
This is honestly the truest spirit of an MMORPG. Nothing to do with mechanics, game design or anything. Simply the community doing things that are fucking awesome.
---
NO THINKING ALLOWED: Leveling guides, talent guides, routes, farming guides, dungeon guides, talent order guides, etiquette guides, dress codes, all yet another step in the wrong direction.
---
If you wanna go hard in PvP engineering is absolutely essential
---
There was?
---
Good to know, actually. I never personally used it and mostly relied on general chat.
---
I think I remember that the actual LFD in it's "press button to join" form came around sometime during late WotLK. I think it was during the ICC/Halls of Reflection patch. I can't check WoWPedia thought since I am at work.
---
Many people prefer a written guide. Even more when youtube video aren't going straight to the information.
---
 -Now they're made by Marketing for Shareholders.
---
Every week for four years? WoW.
---
Still, your anecdotal evidence doesn't change the fact that we have old data with drop rates from Vanilla WoW... It's about 3-4% chance to drop from those bosses.
---
So many people in this sub seem proud of violating the ToS, cheating while fair players played the game as it was designed to be played, inflating the economy...
---
Goldselling/buying will always happen, but I wish more people would be ashamed to mention it.
---
Well, you said you won't be able to raid but then asked if rogues are needed in raids, so I'm not sure what to answer there.
---
Dwarf Priest is a given, so is Gnome Warlock.
---
If you have any PVE aspirations on your Rogue, the Human weapon skill racial is a ~5% DPS increase against raid bosses, which is very significant. But otherwise I'd go Dwarf.
---
You should play a warlock, most people by far never get skilled enough to require "tons of macros", and utilize their skills wrong. Don't get me started on vanilla warlock skill anno 2005... Enjoy the class and play it to your best bro!
---
I would say human rogue (extra sword skill), dwarf priest (fear ward). For warlock I don't really know.
---
In vanilla every class could do that, including healers and tanks since you could apply logic to macros that can react and make calculations faster than any human could.
---
Look how they massacred my boy
---
Hell yeah, fighting demons as a warlock is great fun. Sad there are so few zones with them.
---
True, people get older and vanilla wow isn't as new or will take as much time as it did back then. But older people (with jobs, families etc.) also have a lot less time than many of them had 15 years ago. If leveling takes only 10d /played instead of 15, but you can only play 2-3 hours a day instead of 8, you won't be much faster.
---
Same with raids. Sure, you might not need 3 days raiding per week to progress through the raids, but if you can only afford one evening away from family/kids, it balances out.
---
For me, if phase 2 hits in less than 6 months after release, it will probably feel pretty rushed. Assuming 2-3 months for leveling, a few weeks to get raid ready with attunements and dungeon runs. You really only need catch up Dire Maul if you have already had quite some time at max level, otherwise they could just have released it from the beginning.
---
Sure, there will always be fast people way ahead of me, but it is a difference if they cleared the tier you are working on or if they are crying for a switch to tbc when you are just starting bwl.
---
Blizzard: "What if the Warchief of the Horde becomes too hungry for power and was... CORRUPTED?!?! Just like we did three expansions ago!"
---
Seriously sucks playing Horde when our own faction leaders are the villains half the time now.
---
The talent reset cap was 100g only private sever pleb who nerfed the gold cap.
---
Yes and not only for pvp
---
Mace rogue gang represent
---
Right? I never even watched anything else in the video, just sat there thinking wtf...
---
Warlock is Gnome by a mile. That 5% intellect beats Human's 5% Spirit and Escape Artist is a far better active racial than Perception.
---
What, doesn't everyone like the 10min video guides that could have bee summarized in to one simple jpeg or some text that takes 15s to check
---
Which doesn't help if every server is rushing ahead with phases faster than you can experience them.
---
This. Most people, even if they focus on leveling, will have closer to 8 days /played. People really underestimate the effort speedrunners put in to bring those times down. They have leveled dozens of toons to achieve &lt;5 days.
---
The one closest to my flight point so it's easier to grind for cloth. Both give useless rewards for priests :(
---
Yes, engineering is a massive advantage in PVP. And I'm not really sure what advantages you think Blacksmithing is going to give you in PVE.
---
I know for a fact that Nost had around 800,000 accounts registered. Non of my friends nor I played that server. Im fairly sure it'll spike way past 1 mil. players :)

[OK, Mr. I-always-do-my-own-thinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/buxpb8/druid_pvp_questions_from_a_new_druid/)
---
First tip of \[wikiHow's How to Make Time Pass Faster\]( [https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Time-Pass--Faster](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Time-Pass--Faster)) article is to lose yourself in a great book.
---
Read the Warcraft books. See you in 2 months.
---
Why do you care about this topic? If you have time play, if you want to do something else, do something else. That will be the same for everyone, look at retail, look at private server, you will always find players and raids whenever you login 
---
Are you afraid of getting behind the curve because you don’t have as much time as the others? You don’t have to be pessimistic
---
As I'll be lvl5, the one in the middle as it's less crowded so less of a target for infernals/doomguards.
---
Engi is also very good in PvE
---
I wanna play a healer but switching specs gonna cost a lot. Choosing between priest, paladin, or mage.
---
Cross server PVE? No. But there will be Layering for the first 2-3 months.
---
Cross server BGs? Absolutely.
---
PvP realms always have the higher population of players. Therefore by default will have the most raiding guilds etc etc. I prefer PvE server for leveling but since new realm it will not be to bad on first character as long as you get ahead of the curve
---
Won't have crossservers in general, will have crossrealm BGs.
---
No cross realm servers,every player you see will have made that character on your realm. See layering for more details on how players will be distributed throughout the world. 
---
Classic wow will have cross realm battle grounds.
---
I thought Garrosh had potential, but that went down the drain completely when they decided he would be the main antagonist in MoP. In Cata he executed his Stonetalon commander for murdering innocent Druids, after that they more or less decided against giving him any more character depth lol.
---
It's not the real bolvar until he take a fight stance like he was bare hands, shoving his sword throught his head
---
Would that be the thing that made the biggest difference?
---
As I wrote in the post I want to optimise things so I get the most out of the limited time I spend in the game. It would mean I have to grind gold to be able to afford the lionheart helm and such + blacksmith cost.
---
It used to be a good spot for me in the Barrens with the dwarf diggers. They changed it from PVP to non-PVP just because I hurt a few liddle orcies. Level appropriate btw.
---
this would be an amazing incoming update post on retail wow news page. i wish.. but hey, we have classic coming so, we got that going i guess \^\^
---
Is there any old lore to support the Horde having such a massive base in this area? I mean pre-vanilla. Like, why would the Wildhammer let them just set up a port here?
---
What, no it's not. The final two attacks that he makes during frost nova are like 12+ yard range attacks. This is insanely busted.
---
Earning a reward is a good thing.
---
That "shit little private server" is literally equivalent to the  Classic beta. Except free and more populated.
---
You're in for a big surprise when classic launches kiddo. You're In the minority. Nobody wants flying mounts. Go suck more fat ones
---
We're usually had 40 in raid and like 2 per class waiting if someone doesn't show up on time. We're had a zero tolerance policy. If you at late 1 min your seat is taken. Only main tank had his special deal.
---
Casuals won't hit 60 until Phase 2. Hardcores won't quit because they're hardcore.
---
I believe the change came in when the STV arena went live. One of the first ones a paladin just ran straight out, bubbled and claimed it.
---
I always liked this factor, it means I have to plan ahead in fights and use my brain a bit.
---
For The Alliance!
---
I dont get how a keyboard like that would help u play better
---
well, im playing WoW since release and sometimes even in retail im clearing MC for i don´t know what reason. x)
---
And i played on many different private servers too with the minimum state of MC clear.
---
But yeah maybe raidbosses like ragnaros may have a higher chance on dropping those, but 100% lionheart will be available to dedicated players within the first few weeks.
---
No, that's not even remotely true.
---
I know *plenty* of people who had a reputation for being a dick and *still* got into raiding groups because they were ready to:
---
1. Kiss a guild masters ass.
---
2. Put in the time to farm consumables for their guild.
---
3. Were ready to play healing and tank speccs at any level.
---
I know rogues who had forum posts taking the piss out of noobs they ganked in STV, and they still had PvP guilds.
---
Espescially once people were settled in their guilds and raid groups, ousting them by reputation became *almost* impossible. 
---
You know what some people seem to forget about classic? The fact that some guilds stocked their roster up with randoms and new members who were locked out of gear for the first raids. The fact that if you were in a group with four guild members and you were all alone that your word was always against four other guild members who - personal inter-guild issues aside - would always stick together.
---
Don't get me wrong: if you had a reputation for being a creep to female guild members, no female guild leader would take you again. These things happened. I've had tons of situations where I reported a player to a guild leader for being a prick in dungeons, the guild leader said "I will look into it", and then nothing ever happened. The guy was still in the guild a month later.
---
Yeah, i didn't mean to say they will be BiS for your level, just answered previous guy, that if you want a caster 1h weapon for that level that's gonna be your choice.
---
okay at this point it just seems to me like you're trying to "win" an internet debate using bad faith arguments. like, come on man, you seriously gonna quote dictionaries and just *say* their definitions fit your argument more when they clearly don't? what exactly is "hard to discern or understand" about pick-7? you pick 7...
---
it feels like you were just trying to get me to bite and start arguing semantics with you instead of sticking to the point. but i gotta tell ya man, i'm not interested
---
maybe i'm wrong about you and you actually believe all this. no need to try and out-debate each other. let's test it out. sit your grandma in front of both systems and ask her to fill them out. ask your niece or nephew. ask a random soccer mom you know. they don't even need to make the "right" choices, as you pointed out earlier. just tell them on one system you pick 1 of 3 in each of the 7 rows. and on the other tell them you have to distribute 51 points between 3 different specs in multiple trees within each spec. let me know which one they say is more complex. you can use any of websters' definitions you want
---
yeah the only way to attract that channel is by VOM right now, which I assume works fine, but still ;)
---
" Hunters biggest strength in PvP, is their ability to kite and abuse their movement speed and range advantage. Thus a hunter prefers unlimited kiting range of wPvP, as opposed to a duel; where they can’t kite duel to limited dueling range. Mob Aggro is so easy to avoid." - I agree with that duels limited kiting range can be a problem for hunters, but world pvp can present similar if not bigger obstacles. This is of course depends on the current terrain which you can't choose in wpvp.  
---
" Pet feeding is not an issue. Once your pet is loyalty lvl 6, you rarely need to feed your pet." It being an 'issue' is objective. It may not be an issue for you, but may be one for a new player. I pointed out its existence, which is a fact. I never said there is an issue with it. I stated that it is there, and you have to pay attention to it. Otherwise I agree that it becomes less of an issue as your pets loyalty level increases.  
---
" Did you know that hunter trap is the only CC that works on EVERY type of mob? " Yes, I did. This makes freezing trap a very useful tool in certain dungeons which are heavily populated with non-humanoid mobs, but in the majority of cases polymorph is better, thus making  mage CC better than hunter CC. I never said that hunter CC was really bad or useless because that is not true at all. I simply said that mages are Better at it.  
---
"Did you know that some very important dungeons like UBRS, prefer hunters for their kiting abilities?" - I knew that there were special scenarios where hunters were very useful and needed, but I didn't know this specific one.  
---
"Ammo: If you make a habit out of refilling when you vendor stuff you will never run out of ammo. 1 less bag slot isn’t that annoying. Warlocks have 1 less as well; and many classes carry multiple sets of gear and/or reagents in their bags so they have limited bag space as well.  - I agree with that you never run out of ammo if you pay attention to it, but that seems kind of obvious. But I think that one less bag slot is really annoying even if warlocks share a similar fate. Also which reagents can take up an entire bag? I mained a hunter in vanilla, so I don't know, but are there really classes that store entire alternative item sets all the time (not just keeping it in the bank and obtaining them when needed for dungeons/raids) which take up an entire bag?
---
It's just a general example of bad or annoying stuff, really. It's not against the rules to kill level 15 players who want to get into deadmines as a 60 rogue, but if you were doing it for eight hours...well...
---
lol this is great
---
clearly streamers have height prio ofc
---
It gives all your characters +10 to everything.
---
It matters since as u might have guessed it is nick named the gold bomb and the reason lies with its price, if it does not scale then it should never be crafted and if it does then it will have occasional usage for the rich.
---
I’m sure I read somewhere that the guy from pfUI and the ElvUI team said that it was tricky to work from retail to classic. As complicated as it was to do the reverse work from the modern engine to the classic one
---
Go Blacksmithing and Engineering.
---
Meeting stones existed, their functionality was different to summoning stones.
---
It's not that bad and the quests are pretty straightforward. I do like that place as a mostly alliance player.
---
You remember meeting stones.
---
Shadow Priest, Ret Paladin are two I know of that aren't optimal.
---
Lmao I played the original vanilla. There is bo surprise kid. If anyone is gonna be surprised its some private server chode sucker who thinks he knows what "the best wow ever!!" Is actually all about. 
---
I bet you're just some retard who can't even play the game outside key board turning and clicking 2 abilities to level. Can't wait to see kids like you all over the server crying because no one will carry sad little scrubs like you. 
---
You'll probably be the annoying kid in guild chat begging people to run dungeons with him like everyones annoying kid brother.
---
That's because you watch Anime
---
I see where you are coming from, but imo we should be looking at the "choice" options a talent tree is providing; currently, you have 3 options at each tier, while you can surely count different combinations among tiers, don't forget there are far fewer tiers compared to vanilla vanilla talent points that could be spent.
---
I feel the talent tree budding is one of the biggest changes to original wow, vanilla talent tree really felt like a built, where you grow inch-by-inch by each level you gain, whereas the current version is a much more generalized version, and as much as it offers more complex abilities, improvements to current abilities, it does not feel like you are growing your character.
---
The one in TB. Best city.
---
Thanks for the clarification. I didn't know that.
---
I'm looking at Warlocks atm and there's like 6 builds or so, depending on focus ratio (leveling, raiding, PvP), so I'm curious which is the cookie cutter build?
---
Druid: Never Balance, maybe one Feral in the raid.
---
Hunter: Never Beast Master or Survival in the raid.
---
Mage: Never Arcane in the raid, never Fire until ZG/AQ.
---
Paladin: Never Protection or Retribution in the raid.
---
Priest: One Shadow in the raid (if more than 4 warlocks), Discipline is okay, but you don't want more of them than Holy.
---
Rogue: Never Subtlety in the raid.
---
Shaman: Never Elemental or Enhancement in the raid.
---
Warlock: You don't really ever need more than one Affliction, the rest are just gimping their damage if they're not Demonic Sacrifice. Every Warlock needs Ruin.
---
Warrior: Never Arms in the raid.
---
Yup. Raids were more than happy to take none optimal specs as long as you were reliable. Reputation was WAY more important than doing 5% more damage etc.
---
A lot of the gold farms were owned by former White House Strategist and notorious liar Steve Bannon.
---
Just connecting to your “gold farming and purchasing is cheating”; the owner of the gold farming is the worst of the group.
---
I once spent 2 days fishing for deviate fish in the barrens. They sold for 25g each. I felt like a millionaire when they sold
---
Nice meta, loved that post
---
Hey man, love the idea and how smooth it feels. 
---
I don’t know if it wasn’t cooperating because I was on my phone, but when I was clicking talents in BM for Hunter, it was changing the icons in the other trees.
---
Just some feedback, top job though!
---
Why does this sound like a massive waste of time conjuring all the water to do this though?
---
ah ok :)
---
and ye there are a few items of interrest ^^
---
The six demon bag is kind of a gamble cast tho as it has 6 spells such as spawning a pet &amp; causing cc to chain lightning, frostbolt, firebolt &amp; shadowbolt.
---
A fire mage with high sp getting lucky with getting a firebolt would be exceedingly nice for example as its an instant, even if its base dmg is less its scaling is 1:1 so with high gear it gets close to being equal.
---
I agree, 18 months before naxx is way to slow for the hardcore. However I really hope, that isn't the target audience for Blizzard. And it probably won't be the super casual that can only play a few hours a week either, because they would need a year between phases.
---
Multishot damage is always good since you basically use it of cd.
---
TIL Quebecois are not fluent in English ! (I'm French)
---
The biggest difference will always be skill, but having engineering vs not having it makes a big difference. You just get a big toolkit that people without don’t have.
---
Mages only got profitable once you hit 60. The cost of upgrading spell was exorbitant and god forbid you picked enchanter as a skill, you’d be broke for a large majority of your gameplay.
---
It’s crazy profitable at high levels, but getting there was hell.
---
Not going to lie to you buddy, the game wasn't as easy back then for various reasons. But....it's significantly more rewarding. You really do feel immersed in the world.
---
If you're one of the classes with fewer people in your raid, you could easily get a full tier set before getting rank 10. If you're a warrior you will almost certainly hit rank 10 faster though.
---
This is the best thing about Classic in my book.
---
In dueling? Perhaps: rules should be agreed on for any actual tournament or serious duel. Random duels outside Org/IF? Might be seen as a bit cheap but it's not like those duels matter much anyway.
---
In BGs and WPvP? Anything goes. Play to win.
---
Mage aoe leveling anyone?
---
I think that’s a very low estimate. MC is really not that hard.
---
They could put in a trinket or weapon or whatever for your class in there
---
Nice
---
Don't quote me on this, but I think they said they were going to allow in instance summoning in Classic for warlocks. Not too big of a deal tbh.
---
O rly?
---
This^^
---
&lt;Gubbers Bumps&gt;
---
What
---
Can't wait!
---
Out of all the races added, I never minded BE. Didn't like the rest.
---
FaPs are going to be used by everyone who’s remotely serious about PvP. They basically treat it as a cooldown. Better get used to it.
---
Well goldbuyers don't really care about that. It's genetically in their character that they have less empathy for others and are more egoistic. If they had more empathy for others and where less egoistic, they would not have bought gold after all since they would value the saved time by buying gold *less* than the annoyances others would get by all the botting &amp; spamming (&amp; hacking).
---
They probably will disagree with that assessment, but buying gold actually proves the point.
---
Every priest that isn’t 60 belongs in the bottom right.
---
decently well still isn't optimal
---
Today they just announced Silver Hand, a fresh realm opening June 22nd.
---
So there goes my fucking 48 priest I spent months leveling to a dead server.
---
Admins are fucking idiots on that project.
---
I’m recalling the sentiment from 2005-2006, there’s nothing to get used to.
---
Around the 10 days would be my guess as well, but 6-8 weeks seems pretty fast to achieve that. 10 days in 8 weeks is more than 4 hours each day, on average, which for someone with a job is really a lot. Sure, there are weekends, but do you really expect the majority of players to put everything else on hold during leveling?. Sure, I'll probably do it, but I would put myself into the semi-hardcore category of players, and I can't imagine that being the norm.
---
Pve alliance pvp horde
---
Should be 50g cap per week/month I remember this turned a lot of people off from logging in that were healers
---
Looking at things people are doing on the Beta (Shadow of Hakkar at 40 for example) I think what a tank can do when played properly might surprise you
---
Engineering &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; blacksmithing in pvp and pve
---
actually u want all mages in your raid to be arcane for arcane power, except one special mage who puts up winters chill
---
A lot of retailers wont be able to handle it. There has already been a lot of qq /ragequits in the beta.

The amount of money you’ll save giving another player your mats for Lionheart Helm versus leveling Blacksmithing and buying the recipe yourself could fund your entire Engineering profession for life.

Blasphemy!
---
I asked because i may potentially find myself in a pug or something when the opportunity presents itself.  Not into serious raiding but dont mind making the attempts now and again.
---
It would be so cool they put it back, but i'm pretty sure they won't do that...
---
" Any class can body pull. If you aren't a dumbass, hunter pet pulls should be just as rare as someone body pulling. You pointed out that they might run around if you take shortcuts... again, that's on the player, not a failing of the class whatsoever. You have several ways around it, with EotB and dismissing. Don't be a tard and it's a non issue. " - I didn't say that there are no ways around accidental pet pulling. I simply stated that this is a plus thing that you have to play attention to, which means it can be a disadvantage. You should only judge what I've actually written, and not your assumptions from it, because you criticize things I never said.  
---
" Who gives a shit we're talking about DUNGEONs here, not raids... There's only 5 people, you aren't going to be split DPSing and need to have the pet hold aggro OVER anything but the healer, which they absolutely can do without any issues. All they're there for is to split damage so that the healer can focus on the tank and throw a renew or something on the pet while the rest of the party thins out the pack. Again, the fact that you think these are good points shows that you just don't understand why different roles and options are useful, or where they should be applied." - I misunderstood your previous statement. I interpreted it as you saying hunter pets can act as fulltime offtanks, which I disagreed with. If you meant to say that hunter pets can temporarily act as offtanks and hold aggro in cases of emergency, then I agree with you.  
---
" You don't know what CC is? Seriously? Ice trap, poly, hibernate, etc. Hunters have access to a hard CC with ice trap and a soft CC with scare beast. " - You said said that hunters can hard CC virtually all mobs. Your wording wasn't clear on that point. I tought you meant that they can hard CC multiple mob at the same time which is not true. If you meant that freezing trap works on all mobs, then I agree with you, but mage CC is still better overall, which is exactly what I said.   
---
" So you've never wiped in BRD or mara and had to run the whole group back through cleared zones I take it? This is extremely useful." - Did you actually read what I wrote?  I said that there were times when aspect of the pack were useful, namely "running greater distances without encountering mobs " such as running back after a wipe.  
---
" **TL;DR: The issue is that hunters are a high skill cap**" - I agree. It adds depth to them, which makes playing them interesting  
---
" **You have not figured out how to play a high skill cap class. Hunters are a bad pick for you, not everyone.** " - With that I disagree. I considered myself a decent PVP-er in vanilla and my guild felt the same. I was able to beat frost mages in duels (maybe not rank 1 players, but decent ones), and killed players who were 5-10 levels above me in wpvp. Since I had success and fulfillment in playing a hunter, I doubt they were a bad pick for me.
---
The real question is: If Lady Prestor gives you head, will you get a world buff?
---
the drop rate is pretty low and only on lvl 50+mob, not sure someone will loot it in the beta.

Maybe, while his mom was walking toward the thrift store she was sapped, he opened with a cheap shot into multiple hemorrhage's, the shock alone almost knocked the keyboard from her grasp, but, what finished her was the Kidney shot into a cold blooded eviscerate, little did she know he now had enough energy for the blind.. it caught her off guard, she panicked and hit her trinket. What happened after these events is shady at best, did he let her live? We dont exactly know to the full extent.
---
But what we do know is this, the keyboard was returned safely to OP's desk.
---
No flying mounts (godmode button) and no cross-realm is such a huge positive.

This shit always happen at lower lvl. The higher you get, the rarer you encounter it.

If memory serves right, 1 Enhancement Shaman is good for the improved Windfury Totem, no? I believe it is, later, when you have 4 other Fury Warriors in the group to farm raids/gear.

It would be more for zone balance that lore accurate, but lore has always been bent to fit the gameplay in wow, besides this leaves the very interesting quest theme of bringing the dragonmaw into the horde, maybe start them neutral for horde and you have complete questlines and a rep grind for some loot
---
Not everyone os a germophobe. I never bought anything second hand but i dont see the problem. Its not different than buying a phone or a car or really anything that gets daily use. If i had to buy somethibg in second hand i would have to look decent, i assume most people clean their shit before selling it anyway because it will be a lot easier to sell that way.
---
I dont think anyone claimed it would.
---
We should ban this. Its really not part of Vanilla experiance. Nobody did this and it would hurt the economy of the game
---
If it's more powerful than naxx you have powercreep, if it isn't what's the point? I can see it as good content for more casual players tbf which extends the life of game
---
SuperIgnore does that for 1.12 clients. I'm sure there must be a 8.x version or similar addon
---
Dishonourable kills killed world pvp
---
If you look at the link I sent you you’ll see the top 5 warrior parses are 1k dps sustained for over 2000 seconds.
---
So the class can do it. They are perfectly capable of sustained 1k dps. It’s just rare.

Josh already confirmed that Method are super bored of BFA and are much preferring Classic.
---
World firsts in Classic are going to be ridiculous. Like, as soon as is humanly possible ridiculous.
---
But now 15 years later, WoW Classic is the Everquest of 2019. So it all works out :)
---
I'm in Scandinavia so I'd like a server near there, but idk how to select for that since EU is mostly one time zone. May have to pick randomly. Probably going for a PvP server and somewhat concerned about faction imbalance, as well.
---
Said this ages ago. Even if it's not their core team they'll have dedicated people with the name tag, streamer dolla!
---
How come the experience bar is showing even though you hit max level? 
---
I don't remember that happening, unless this was early TBC
---
Wow you didnt even bother to read one single sentence. Anyway thanks for the downvote. Move along
---
They'll hate not being able to do dungeons at all more because no-one will want to heal for them.
---
Escape Artist isn’t perfect, but it can help against a lot of classes. It’s far better than Perception, which has 3x the cooldown, much less utility, and is your only other option.
---
Besides, a permanent 5% intellect buff is huge compared to a 5% spirit buff, which you don’t care about at all as a Warlock.

Did you mean freezing trap? You are right about using distracting shot to pull the target to the trap. I did that too many times. I stand corrected: One of Freezing Traps disadvantages is not that you have to run in close to place it, but the fact that it only activates at close range, which means that you have to use extra measures to pull mobs to it such as using distracting shot and/or move from your current exact location for optimal trap placement, which means lost damage on auto-attack.
---
Most elite quests which required groups were easily soloable in TBC since most of the mobs were nerfed/non elite anymore.  
---
Some quests shortened. Also the XP rate was improved.

buffs existed, reagents were required, 40 main raids, hunters used mana, warriors had stances, no level cap boost, no heroic or mythic modes, get your 60% speed mount at 40, no flying mounts, pvp and pve servers, no cross faction or server stuff (except BGs ), dishonourable kills, only 4 races per faction, limited class/race combos, the list goes on
---
Alliance side I honestly think the story is very good in BFA (except for the part we went to Uldir for no reason whatsoever).
---
Horde side? yeah fuck that shit.
---
Blood Legion needs to come back. Paragon will get it if they are in it tho
---
Personally, I would really like goblins to make their way back into the horde on classic. Even back in vanilla, I felt they were missing as the gnome counterpart. I remember a lot of people back then wanted goblins as a race.
---
I also enjoyed the goblin starter quest line a lot because my favorite areas of the game are the ones with gnomish wns goblin technology around.
---
In what ways, if you don't mind explaining?
---
No keypad?? How will I mark targets?
---
Basically all the hybrid dps specs.
---
You caught me red handed, Reddit.
---
Looks like something Samurai Jack would fight. I dig it.
---
Oh come on! Spam dispel and self dispel if root, spam frost horion and wf the shit out of the target... sometimes drop a totem to avoid a Pom pyro /fear
---
I wonder if other people that read this just think to themselfs how much more interesting this sounds compared to retail
---
Ruh Roh!  Every purchase we make can be linked to some asshole somewhere along the supply chain.  I voted hard against Trump in 16 but couldn't care less about your revelation.
---
Not a 30 something who never moved out. Okay ;)
---
Enjoy wow I guess.
---
I'm glad you liked it! :)   
---
As for the hate, I think some people may view this post as me talking crap about their favourite class. The natural defense response to that is something like 'my class is awesome, if you say anything bad about it, then you must be bad at playing it'. Others may view this as an opportunity/challenge to show that they are better or more experienced at playing a hunter. There are a couple guys who are debating to avoid misinformation which  I appreciate and find beneficial.
---
Not saying it shouldn't be reported, but do you have anything to prove this? I'm pretty sure the ones in The Barrens are Alliance flagged, but I don't know about these. Can't find any archived Wowhead comments or anything to suggest that they would be.
---
Thing is a lot of people were reluctant to play private servers due to the sheer time you need to dedicate and the constant chance the server maybe closed making all that time a waste. Now with official servers I believe more people will give it a chance.
---
Except for warrior
---
The « you can’t change race later » isn’t true. It has been announced that you will be able to pay for a race change when classic comes out from battle.net (not directly from the game) by Ian.
---
There are only three BOP Blacksmithing items and the only one that matters is [Dark Iron Plate](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11604/dark-iron-plate#comments) and it's not a big deal.
---
Holy nova farming is a hell of a thing.
---
Say you reset your talents to the 50g cap, does is stay 50g forever or reduce back down to 1g over time?
---
As if there is a choice to be made. God damn Gelkis scum SMH...
---
I was alliance too all the way through to wrath when I switched to play with a new group of IRL friends I had made that were all active. I've been horde to this day but I might go alliance again!

---
Hi!
---
 I would decide between Dwarf or Gnome because they are best Alliance races for PVP. 
---
Dwarf get stoneform which counter rouges (blinds). Dwarf Priest also get fearward which is very good in PVE and good in PVP aswell.
---
Gnome give you a little bit more Intellect  and have escape artist which breaks slows and snares. You will not be kiting so much as warlock and Priest so I feel that escape artist is more suitable for a rouge.
---
It's not that important which race you choose, you will do best with the race that give you the most motivation to play.
---
Stort version:
---
Rouges: dwarf to counter other rouges, Gnome to counter kiting classes like mage
---
Warlock: Gnome for pve, dwarf for PVP to counter rouges.
---
Priest : Dwarf because of fearward.
---
An extra 94 melee Attack Power on 20% of your attacks is not worth it. And it will only be for 3 other melee classes because they'll want a Hunter in the group for Trueshot Aura, which gives 100 Attack Power all the time.
---
WORLD FIRST GUISE
---
cringe
---
Rogue was my main in vanilla and I have such fond memories unique to the class from then. I've been warrior since wrath though so I'd love to go back to the rogue I remember. The fun isn't there for me as a rogue in newer content.
---
I tell people in the group to not expect a summon and that only two people will benefit from it anyways, so head over there like I already am. It’s really annoying tho when your on the other continent and still make it to the dungeon before anyone...
---
would prefer a holy weaver
---
Grenades/Dynamite deals damage, Trinkets(Chicken and Whelpling) deal damage, if you're a tank the shield helps with aoe tanking
---
Cool, thanks!
---
&gt;  because right now it plays like everyone has 1000ms.
---
so like in actual vanilla, #nochanges
---
It's going to be immensely lucrative for the first month or two. I'm going to be farming SM and BRD for days and I guarantee I'll have more money than almost anyone else. At least until the economy really starts going...
---
So you're saying #changes is really #nochange ? :p
---
Classic
---
MC should come down to speedleveling and the later raids will probably be cleared in an hour after they are released.
---
If NA gets raids a day sooner as usual EU won't realiaticaly stand a chance since world first will be claimed before they can even enter the raid. 
---
AQ opening will depend on the entire server so if it happens that a server is more active at the time of the AQ release than the method server than they can't get that either.
---
Where did I write that hunters are Bad at world pvp? I have never said that. I said that blocking terrain and aggroing mobs can be a disadvantage for hunters in world pvp. That does not mean that hunters are bad at world pvp. I managed to kill players who were 5-10 levels above me in world pvp, by kiting them to death.  
---
I will always take responsibility for everything I write, but I won't ever take any responsibility for your (or others) interpretations and assumptions (be it correct or incorrect).
---
&gt; You must respect other players roleplaying.
---
Nope.
---
Creativity in talent trees more often than not means choosing something suboptimal.
---
fucking THIS.
---
stop posting your shit monetized videos here and type it out.
---
I don't want to see your stupid face or hear your stupid voice.
---
I want to read your opinion (which is probably also stupid tbh)
---
Didn't he also said that CoS mythic encounters are so much fun....
---
later phases might be more competitive but they have no chance beating pserver players in 1st week rag for example
---
POS it was
---
Don't think many, if any IRL friends would ever go back to wow now. I'm trying to convince them! I would love to relive the memories of an alliance rogue but I always looked up to our guilds main tank warrior, and my main in newer content is a warrior but with the horde.

---
It comes from vendoring items from three bosses: Gizlock, Princess and Rotgrip. There's also some possible mining/herb spots.
---
1-2enhancer was in tbc in vanilla its 0
---
Ah so mining/Herning is a requirment for good GPH?
---
It isn't. It's a fun bag of tricks but when you are geared to the teeth you don't need many buttons to kill just about everyone if you're a class that does well in PvP by default.
---
If you're on the bottom of the list, it'll help but I wouldn't say it's essential. You'll still be seen as a free HK by many.
---
When someone admits they're bad before you even read their post, you don't need to try and tell them they're bad, that was just weird..
---
Resto shamans will sometimes go 0/22/29 for the imp totems.
---
Even without it, it's about 37 gold per hour. Not bad until you can start farming DM.
---
What about Death &amp; Taxes
---
Barrens chat anyone?
---
Yeah sure, assuming that the pserver people got the numbers right for drop rates/values of items being vendored. I did some ZF pick pocket runs on a pserver and got like 5 gut rippers from the lockboxes. I don't think the drop rate really is that high.
---
&gt;Chapeu   
---
   
---
Hmmmm
---
&gt; I wonder what changed.
---
Classic became popular.
---
What app is this? tinder or grinder dating app (or however they are spelled ?)
---
Not really no :) The calculations of GPH from there is only from vendoring boss drops.
---
Well, "ideal" job isn't the word, unique is more precise, imo. Mainly because there is noone else that can do it, there is no "pure" healer. There will be others bringing buffs, dealing damage or tanking. Only hybrids have healing abilities.
---
Is 37 gold per hour considered good? Like what is an average GPH for farming in vanilla?
---
Yeah, vendoring, mining and herbing. It's never amazing money, but it's consistent. You don't rely on any rare drops or anything. You can also sell loot by bringing lower levels there, [Blackstone Ring](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17713) can usually be sold for 10-20g depending on your server, [Blade of Eternal Darkness](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17780) has a rare drop chance but could probably ask for 100g+.
---
Cleaning a keyboard is not a big deal, just takes a good chunk of time. (I am talking about complete disassembly lol)
---
agreed once the content is trivial to heal its all about gettin more DPS for the raid
---
It is something we are all entitled to be part of in order to play Classic before release because we have the patience of a 5 year old, right?
---
The healing priest with shadow weaving seems to be the hot meta instead of having actual shadow priests though.
---
Aside from that theres also smite priests.
---
announced on april first, so no "out of season" jokes this time
---
The beta rolls on and brings with it a couple of fresh talking points for the show and its listeners to tackle this week.
---
Warsong Gulch has been open for a couple of weeks now in the beta and Arathi Basin just opened days ago, and with those come the bloodthirsty PvP testers looking to see how things perform on the battlegrounds.
---
After that we break down stream sniping, after some comments made by streamer Sodapoppin ignited the forums this past week on the issue.
---
Then, we welcome back vanilla WoW level designer John Staats, for the first of a lengthy ongoing segment all about the design of vanilla WoW’s instances.  Listen in to part one of this series, as John tells us all about how he built one of the most beloved dungeons in MMORPG history, Blackrock Depths.
---
The show then rounds out with a great call with a sitting member of the state of Maine’s House of Representatives, about that one time that WoW got caught up in politics, and also a follow up call from last week, for a slightly different angle on the Trollgodx issue at the dueling tournament.
---
Highlights Below:
---
* Calling Countdown #1 – Beta BG’s w/ Ayle, Fried, Khano, &amp; Nano – 2:50
---
* Calling Countdown #2 – Stream Sniping w/ Boosh &amp; Gleb – 31:35
---
* Calling Countdown #3 – The Making of Blackrock Depths w/ John Staats, Gromboli, &amp; Vilius – 50:55
---
* Calling Countdown #4 – When WoW Met Politics w/ Colleen Madigan, Maine – House of Representatives (D) – 1:52:35
---
* Calling Countdown #5 – Trollgodx – Blizzard Should Consider Some Action – 2:20:25

Retail players will complain that Classic gets content that they don't though
---
Mythic + is nice. 
---
Imagine an uncut BRD mythic+ 
---
I say uncut. Because fuck the upper/lower kara nonsense. Dont be splitting shit up like oreos.
---
oh look another video posted with zero comment
---
If you consider that epic mounts cost ~600g(I don't remember the exact value) and people actually had to farm some time for it, it's considerable to be a good GPH value
---
What he said.
---
Time to shank a bitch!
---
Back in the day, as resto Druid I had a macro that would select the correct rank of a spell given the amount a health the target had left. I confirm it was made impossible to use it at some point during the course of vanilla.
---
What are the "many fights" in leveling dungeons that they are required for in vanilla? Keep in mind I never said anything about raiding and max level dungeons. Unless you can name "many" fights in leveling dungeons where hunter kiting is absolutely required, your point is invalid.
---
I think this is more of a server-by-server kinda of thing. On my server, which was PVE, it was considered cheap and lame if you had to resort to using a potion or consumable to win a 1vs1, and FAPs in WSG were considered one of the most downright,. try-hard, scummy things you could do. Our Pre-made BG groups on both factions considered it a point of pride to rely only on their normal skills and talents, rather than having to use consumables as a clutch.
---
However, many other servers, especially PVP ones, considered it all part of the normal game, and that you were deliberately gimping yourself for no good reason if you DIDN'T use consumables, which were just a regular game mechanic.
---
I guess it all depends on your point of view!
---
I like that classic will spawn from the carcass of its former self. Retail sucks.
---
imo this racial is better than the orc one if you plan to play a rogue. Because the AP bonus from the orc one is based on your base ap, so whatever the bonus ap from your gear, it will be the same bonus. Also the -50% heal is not nice
---
I just spent more time than I should have saying potato and Poe to try and find the difference you're talking about. Those are the same kind of O sound. The E in Poe is silent, it doesn't make a poey (like Joey) sound or anything.
---
Very good points, thank you.
---
This is what I want Vanilla to become. Expanding all the zones they couldn’t do the first time around.
---
Maybe if classic takes off they might look into it. Imagine what they could do with a world with no flying. 
---
With the layering tech they have now they could just continue to grow the same world and as you level the zones change making the world more used at high levels.
---
Is this like a retail thing, Primal and Soul?
---
I would call the Warrior-Rogue-Mage column 'Secular' instead of 'Primal', and instead use 'Primal' for the nature/elemental power source.
---
||Secular|Divine|Primal|Demonic|
---
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|

|\*\*Fighter\*\*|Warrior|Paladin|Druid, Shaman||
---
|\*\*Thief\*\*|Rogue, Hunter||Druid||
---
|\*\*Mage\*\*|Mage|Priest, Paladin|Druid, Shaman|Warlock|
---
So yeah, in a way there is room especially for demonic flavours of the class archetypes, and I don't think the Deathknights and Demon Hunters fit this niche entirely by accident. 'Unbalanced' is a weird way to put it though.
---
Lol you do realize the LFG tool is only for heroic level dungeons right?
---
So Master demonologist serves at anything. Demonic sacrifice looks very strong in fact, despite it sucks to go so deep into that branch with talents that serves at anything just for that fuckinpassive. I am thinking at [this 9/21/21](https://wowclassic.judgehype.com/simulateur-de-talents/en/warlock/825c2m2350303112001e5050205102d100) for shadow damages buff from suc's sacrifice + imp corruption + imp tap. What do you think ?
---
Since Classic will have a limit to number of debuffs, affliction seems unplayable, also since MC and BWL are immune to fire, I can't go full destruction. Sucks:(
---
there where people who went to kill SM: Cathedral while they where capped at lvl 30, killing 2x lvl 42 elite bosses at lvl 30 is a lot more troublesome than killing a lvl 50+ at lvl 40, and there surely will be as people will try to get info on dungeons at high lvl asap.
---
and that means theres a chance for drop ^^
---
It's going to be interesting to see how private server guilds will be able to compete with method who can spend all their waking hours on the game and do god knows how many split runs to quickly get BiS.
---
I always choose the one with the least customers!
---
I don't mean it'll be lucrative purely because you might get useful loot. I mean purely on the silver earned, the greys you get, it will be the best consistent source of gold available for quite some time. Every other source of gold will be heavily competed for, and noone will have any money to buy basically anything in the AH.
---
When a server is new, all the money anyone has comes from vendoring, looting and quests exclusively. The total wealth on the server is extremely low. This makes pickpocketing extremely good, especially if you get movespeed boosts, sub talents, etc.
---
Totally off topic but yeah i agree 100%
---
So glad that WoW released just as I was graduating or this would have been very true.
---
People seem to agree with it so it's probably you who's in the wrong.
---
This is not how it works. Sure, there are, theoretically, more options in classic but that does not mean anything when the overwhelming majority is useless or bad. 
---
On retail you can choose from a variety of talents to suit your playstyle or the type of content you intend to do. In classic respec is expensive and so you are discouraged from experimenting and basically forced to play in a cookie cutter build. Even if you wanted to experiment with your talents, the end result is more often than not suboptimal at best. 
---
When it comes to MEANINGFUL choices that impact the gameplay retail talent trees are just better.
---
Do also keep in mind people it’s okay to leave if the dungeon is a total shitshow and you’re there for 2 hours more than supposed to. 
---
And honestly I remember ALOT of my dungeon runs in vanilla ended before the final boss because people quite simply had to go for one reason or another even if it was going well.  Shit took a long time, sometimes too long so mother real life would come for you.
---
depends on how good of pvp gear you want. 
---
the blue sets you can get with just alittle bit of pvp each week and then a final 3 weeks of pvp for about 6 hours per day to get the last 2 pieces. 
---
The epic pvp sets will require a deed to your life for, hrm, i dunno, 4 months? epic pvp weapon? forget about it. though there might be some grindy ones you can get depending on your class. from PVP rep. 
---
Its not hard per say, just takes time, but if you have a good grp, well then it will be much faster.   
---
Thats why you see most people in pve gear for pvp, the pvp gear takes so long to get, the pve gear takes afew hours 2-3 nights a week.
---
No clue. I'd guess not, but idk.
---
Yes, that's why druids, pallies and shaman wear for ages an ugly teal cloth robe for healing, isn't it?
---
The latter. Retail will remain as-is: ridiculously complex hardcore raiding at the top level, and everything else casual as hell. The two extremes.
---
Wrath talents, for the specs I've played, generally have more choice since there are fewer lack luster talents (To me a lackluster talent would be one that would still not be picked even if you double one or more of the values). For example for the demonology tree in classic you have just one truly desirable talent and that's the demonic sac, which nullifies so many other talents on it's way to the point that you have to pick dead talents just to reach it.  In wrath pet scaling is better and demonology makes a lot more sense.
---
Any use for healing?
---
It does has very serious uses in big guild on guild pvp.
---
I expect most people who cap at 60 to be done in 8-10 weeks. I feel like if you get hooked on vanilla you get hooked in most cases. Hard to guage though i could be totally off base.
---
Dont we go to investigate? We got some clues from one of the dungeons or something?
---
I don't follow the story in the modern expansions even when I (quickly) play through them but I assumed we had some reason to go there.
---
More than that people can\`t be complete douchebags because auf the restriction to the community of one server, I am looking forward to that you can make yourself actually a name for being a nice and skilled player, which is actually worth much more than just not to be known as an idiot.
---
Also if you play on a PvP server your farming won't be impacted by other players.
---
Idk man, i liked it at first but i think now that the downsides far outweight the upsides. It limits dungeon design, alienates some classes/specs and turns the game in to a speedrun contest. Not saying that the idea itself is bad but i dont like the implementation. I think it would be better if it didnt have a timer and was just either you finish it or not and get loot if you do or not if you dont.
---
Went through and tested all the things I could and compared what I could to VoD's and this is what I found. I didn't go into the health/mana regen from spirit differences simply because I couldn't get enough data on it, but hopefully this'll help some of you guys out!
---
Disclaimer: I in no way encourage playing on pservers
---
Everything is incredible when you're pretty much the only one doing it. There is no "pure" healer. 
---
And well, their PvP is hurt by how little gear they have available and given for it.
---
 There really is no difference between pvp and pve gear, it’s all the same, it’s all about the stats. There’s sets of gear you earn while doing pvp battlegrounds etc, and sets you get in pve dungeons and raids.
---
Pvp gear became a real thing during The Burning Crusade, when they added resilience to pvp gear sets. 
---
I haven’t been on in over a year but I dont remember seeing resilience in pre TBC gear.
---
It takes a minimum of 7.5 seconds to get full Shadow Weaving and it only lasts for 15 seconds. You also need to find 6% spell hit from gear, which will gimp your healing. So in that tiny window, you're healing about as effectively as an Enhancement Shaman... yeah, just bring a fully specced Shadow Priest and be done with it.

&lt;Hellion&gt; [EU][H][PVP] Hardcore light!
---
Introduction
---
Hellion is a guild for people that want to be able to mix serious raiding with real life obligations. It's a guild for those of us that want to clear all content at a steady pace, but in a sensible and time efficient way. 
---
We are now looking for more players of high standard that know their class and play it well, prepares for raids in terms of consumables, pre raid bis gear, enchants and strategy. The goal is to build a tight community of highly skilled and like minded players.
---
It's a big plus if you have experience from raiding in vanilla, but it's not a requirement.
---
What we expect from you
---
= You can level to 60 somewhat fast and commit to 3 raids a week, 3 hours per raid. Wed/Sun/Tue 20:00-23:00. 
---
= You know your class and play it well.
---
= You can think and act in stressfull situations. 
---
= You show up prepared to every raid. Strategy, consumables, pre raid bis gear and enchants.
---
= Willingness to build a positive reputation for the guild. You represent all of us when you wear the &lt;Hellion&gt; name. Act accordingly.
---
= You are a team orientated player, what's best for the team has priority over you. We gear the raid to progress. Be cool with a transparent loot council and realize that you will get your stuff faster if we kill stuff faster.
---
We offer
---
= Mature and experienced vanilla guild and raid management.
---
= An opportunity to clear all the raids in Classic without insane commitment requirements.
---
= Laid back atmosphere.
---
= New friendships that will hopefully last a lifetime!
---
Raid schedule
---
Wed/Sun/Tue 20:00-23:00.

---
Nice guide, can't wait to go to Northrend on my Pandaren then, seeing as those aren't mentioned what so ever
---
There's a ton of good BoE drops in Mara as well.  Sword of the Magistrate comes to mind.
---
Vanilla WoW did that with weapons at some point. I remember it happening to me when farming cloth in burning steppes from Ogres. one of them were holding something unusual without being a rare or anything, I killed him and looted some rare or epic weapon, checked forums a few days later to read that it happened all over the place with world drops. Im pretty sure that blizz patched it quite fast though as it wasn't intended.  It
---
Reposted? Guessing the mods don't like pserver stuff, informative vid though
---
If you have the time to farm the gold then yeah you could do that with any class and respecc often. As a hunter its easier because marksman works well in pve and pvp anyway.
---
I would prefer the option to copy the character across to TBC while leaving the original on the Classic server.
---
You are listing world pvp under the "Cons" of playing a hunter. Bro, honestly the more you fight here the more you are getting exposed. Everyone is calling you out. You made a post that has not much merit behind it. It is obvious that you have not played hunter a lot, or at least that you don't have a lot of competency in playing hunter. That's ok, there is no reason to get rallied, hunter is a really difficult class to master.
---
However, we do have the duty to inform other readers and potential new players that what you describe in your post is mostly not accurate.
---
Wait is he actually in game during vanilla? I never knew!
---
Man, all of this sounds epic.
---
I guess if you really want you can safe for the weapons... right?
---
Maybe community statistics and overall community feeling in 18 months is that Wow classic moving to TBC should be done ASAP.
---
Maybe in 6 months most hardcore people have burned through content and -like on private servers- hop to the 'new' server, which there isn't so they stop playing or return to private servers
---
Maybe in 12 months, most casual players have seen enough of Classic and now want to see TBC.
---
We don't know.
---
What we do know is that 18 months is a darn long time and the number of players that actually play on the same vanilla pserver for that time period is relatively small. So small, WoW should not listen to them, but rather follow overall statistics and mood on what to do next with the WoW Classic experiment.
---
50gph is considered great and most classes won't ever reach it.
---
f1-f4
---
Private servers : wrong values but may give the "hard" experience feeling
---
Classic : real values but feel easier than before
---
Would love to play on rp pvp server.
---
Not because i wanna participate in rp crap but i wanna feast on tears and be known serverwide as an asshole (to the point only available on rp servers)
---
No, thats not how the system works.  your gain rank or loose rank each week. its that rank which lets you buy them off the vendor, the weapons cost fuckall to buy, you need the rank.
---
Read: https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_System
---
Some PvP gear is reputation tied to BG's factions so slow to come, or available given your PvP rank which require quite the time investment each week. Getting rank 14 for the weapons is quite a feat, and until you get there you'll probably have to get PVE weapons when chasing after upgrades.
---
Very nice format, its so easy readable and well put together with graphics.
---
Wow this is really helpful, thank you! I plan on playing mage too
---
Anything with good flat stats (mostly sta int agi) is a pvp gear in vanilla
---
Well this is pretty neat... But shouldn't it be, like, 20 times longer?
---
Health at the time. 
---
I can't remember the exact formula for the amount of haste though. I believe you can get the maximum at something like 10-30% not sure what it is.
---
Resistance gear, mounts, pets, consumables, off-spec gear.
---
Also, even if it's worse than Naxx, you only get one Naxx lockout a week, with a very limited number of drops, having more raids can help you gear up faster, even if that gear eventually gets replaced.
---
Ah, so like paying Blizzard for grand marshal gear. I can't imagine anyone in the Classic fanbase wanting that. 
---
The bigger ships only require more crew for the extra cannons. One player can steer and use some weapons. Like the Constellation has 4 big guns that the pilot fires and two turrets that are manned by extra crew. Those guns will two-shot an Aurora and even how evasive the Aurora pilot is he won't stand a chance against the powerful missiles a Constellation can field. 
---
I bought a Freelancer back in 2012 because I was swept up by the hype. Half a decade later I actually got to play with my ship and let me tell you, there's no way in hell an Aurora or Mustang can take out a Freelancer. Similarly a Freelancer has no chance against a Constellation. And a Constellation has no chance against a Redeemer and so on. 
---
Then of course you have the big ships like the Idris, Javelin, Polaris and even Bengal carriers. Any organisation that wants to carve out a piece of space for themselves to mine and extract resources from has to have these big ships. If they don't, then some other org who has them will take over. So players gravitate towards orgs who can afford these giant vessels. I've seen orgs with 20 Idrises, fleets of mining and trading ships, Javelins etc. They can even buy land before the game is released. 
---
If that's not p2w then I don't know what is.
---
I was confused until this 
---
So basically: frost nova is used to prove he’s just above 10 yards range. if he’s above 8 yards he should be able to shoot, but can’t.
---
135k dmg as warrior on Nef P1 was good but not mind blowing, I did 133k on a much lesser geared warrior with arms spec and The Untamed Blade without having a perfect group for my dps output, I guess I could have landed on 155k~ with optimal group setup and full bwl tier gear. 
---
Warriors were absolute beasts at dps throughout all of vanilla, not just the late stages. I had the honor of having a druid combat ress me to allow me to reset my threat in most dps heavy fights as threat was my main concern.
---
Yep, I used to play a PS, but after it got closed down I decided not to invest time on a different one until official servers. And I made that decision before classic was announced.
---
I believe that is the case for many people
---
Yes, my example wasn't to indicate that you're bound to big BoE drops, only to point out that they must've had drop rates wrong. Which could mean that the drop chance for everything else could be wrong aswell.   
---
I fully understand that the money at the beginning of the server must come from looting, questing and vendoring. I'm speculating that some vendor items aren't as valuable as they were on pservers, rogue's diary for example. I'm only questioning if it will be as valuable as for example grinding some other hot spots and vendoring those greys. I do however recognize the fact that you're not competing with anyone for mobs in pick pocket runs and that you can't be ganked etc.
---
It decays at 5g per month, I think.
---
As a long time Priest player I also know the joys of having people not do corpse runs. With graveyards often being a far away from a dungeon it can be really fun having to walk 5 minutes to the dungeon, walk another 5 minutes to where you wiped, spending all my mana to rez people, drinking, spending all my mana to buff people, drinking, rezzing and buffing the one idiot that went afk, heal everyone to full because "lol, buying food in 2006" and drink because your mana is gone again.
---
But people are even worse today. Was doing a PUG Mythic+ on my Prot Warrior alt a few weeks ago and got my Dark Iron arse to Boralus, then Vol'dun and over to the Temple summoning stone. Waited for 5 minutes, after which 2 DPS were still doing WQs in Drustvar, and the remaining 2 players were sitting around doing bugger all in Boralus. None of them speaking a single word besides "sum plx".
---
I decided to just let them continue doing WQs in peace and got another group. But even when doing random mythics in a duo with a friend, me and him are usually the only ones even flying towards the summoning stone. People are just awfully lazy and selfish.
---
The games cater to different people. I don't think Classic will influence BFA or whatever comes next.
---
Neither does shadowmelding in the middle of the desert with the sun blazing, don't think you should look at this in a RP-sense
---
Yeah there was a reason but was a very weak one: Uldir was part of the horde campaign and ended with Zul releasing breaking G'huun's seal using Mythrax powers. 
---
It was a very cool introduction to the raid to be honest, but Alliance did not witness any of that. There was a "something happened in Uldir, and we don't trust the Horde, so better go check what's going on"
---
Yes, because of leeway. That’s what he’s saying.
---
No changes
---
Ah alright thanks. I'm speculating since the majority of a rogues dps comes from white hits.
---
I cast flare.
---
Not sure if 31 counts as midlife crisis, but good advice nontheless. &lt;3
---
Well I mean, I started in Legion, I love BFA (would like a bit more content right now tho...) but cannot wait to jump into Classic as well. I guarantee there are tons more like me!
---
&gt;Looks like it's not such a waste of time anymore. I wonder what changed.
---
They're going to steamroller everything in sight they just realised how much money they can make streaming it.
---
TY FOR GOOD INFO!
---
Yall can bang in goldshire inn on any server you know that right?
---
I saw a &lt;Batman took my virginity&gt; once.
---
It definitely sounds great. Wish the reality was the same.
---
I think the smart move would be to release new adds using the exact same format of the old ones. Old players will find it nostalgic and funny, and it will get the attention of new people, since the way ads are made is different now and the contrast will make them more noticeable.
---
For many classes the T1 and even T2 sets are pretty bad for PvE, but can be awesome in PvP. Meanwhile the PvP sets can be pretty bad for PvP but very good for PvE. It's quite strange and you have to evaluate it on item by item basis.

---
Maybe our educational systems are different.
---
Here in Serbia, our bachelors degree is earned in 3 years. In every single year, you have around 8-10 exams. Learning that shit takes around 30 ours on average. So if we have 8 exams in a year, we need 240 hours for that. And since we have 3 years, it is 3x240 which is 720. 
---
Now factor in some of us learn faster. It can be done in less.
---
Let's hope it is a bitt longer, I really think there should be about 6 months befor bwl comes out and if p2 is longer then 2 months and already starts after 2 months we can wave goodbye to almost all the casuals or ppl that don't have 40h+ every week to play. If you are not 60 when p2 launches you are not going to have a good time
---
Depends who can no life their way to 60 and attune 30+ people first
---
There’s no such thing as a Dwarf Warlock.
---
I'm pretty sure every guild in existence has experienced at least one wipe. So you are objectively wrong.  
---
If flasks and basic buffs were enough to clear everything on the first try, nobody would have experienced a wipe.
---
&gt; Your definition would mean that nearly every free to play game is p2w then.
---
They are.
---
Pet battles would be okay I guess
---
There will definitely be a lot of people who like the community and world in vanilla, but also want mythic raids.
---
Pretty sure both space bar parts just register a ‘space’ entry, unfortunately.
---
I think it's been agreed upon that the tablet footage was pre-recorded? Why do you choose to ignore the PC footage that has, at worst, like 4 frames of input lag?
---
Why wouldnt they? Their goal is an authentic vanilla experience.
---
I play as rogue on beta pvp server, I could do a 1-2 hour test pickpocket sm farm and write all the items gathered and money.
---
hes a rogue, automatically a bastard.
---
Vanilla makes way more sense in an RPG standpoint
---
Logic prevails. Ofc Blizzard will absolutely cater to the normal player, not the hardcore ones. Classic will have, MAYBE, 10% of the player base hardcore, that will be far ahead everyone else. They can quit until next phase...but they won't, because this isn't Retail.
---
There is so much to do.
---
But even if they do quit...it's 10%. No way Blizzard will release the Phases every 4 weeks, because Method or Grizzly are done with the content.
---
Vanaskos is the add-on name.
---
So people want to be ganked by groups or by people 10 levels higher than them? People want to get destroyed in pvp because scissors beats mushroom and class balance doesn't exist? The wow pve player base hasn't been shown in every conceivable way to out number the pvp player base near 10 to 1?  Oh and people play a game with shit combat for pvp and not the co-operative pve which has some of the best encounters for that particular niche out there.
---
if you "long press" on mobile it will remove/unlearn selected talent point
---
I'm not your bud, friend! What made you feel that way about BC?
---
The problem is, Raiders seem to unreasonably be attached to PvP servers.
---
Before playing a bit of classic the past few weeks, I didn't even know what continents some of the major cities are on or the lore associated with so many different areas within eastern kingdom and kalimdor. It's just crazy, I never realized how much of a fleshed out world WoW has until I played some classic wow.
---
Do you know if such a keyboard even exists? I thought to myself many times while game that man i wish the spacebar would be split in to 5 different keys
---
That's what he said
---
Epic mounts are 1000g. There’s a 10% discount if you’re Honored and another 10% discount if you’re PVP Rank 3. So a minimum of 800g.
---
&gt; 10.5 yards would mean hunter can't attack,
---
I see how Hunter can't attack from 10.5 yards when Auto Shot says he should be able to from 8 yards - https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=75/auto-shot
---
Actually I don't. Care to explain?
---
Sigh
---
True. I started Vanilla in October, 7 months after the EU release. The world was FULL of people. I leveled very slow, took me 57 days in real time.
---
I was 9 months behind everyone else. Does this affected my game play ? Sure, I didn't cleared Naxx or AQ20, because top guilds rosters were full and everyone was super geared.
---
But I did find a guild to raid MC, Ony, ZG, AQ20 and BWL.
---
That was PLENTY of content. I was playing 8-10 hrs/day, and I always had to do SOMETHING MEANINGFUL.
---
It won't be the full Method, a lot of them aren't stopping MDI stuff but he means a Method sponsored team.
---
No.
---
Is there a summary or something? I don't want to sit through a 10+ minute video for something I can read in a minute.
---
All I remember is that when I got level 40 in vanilla, it took me a day of grinding rock elementals in badlands to afford my 40 gold mount.
---
I was a warrior, mind.
---
Gold dkp runs and reserved items (where you pay a set price to get a certain item no matter how many runs it takes) was very common in vanilla a friend of mine bought askandi that way
---
You are assuming that the new raids will ONLY have SP gear.
---
Are you THAT thick?
---
Hey thanks man, really appreciate that. Looking forward to your response!
---
 Por que no los dos?
---
It was a forum meme back in the day,
---
i dont see them as something that will change the classic experience IMO
---
quite different if we were discussing about daily quests
---
Good thing you can only be one faction in PvP servers
---
" You are listing world pvp under the "Cons" of playing a hunter. " I listed world pvp under disadvantages, which means just that: that hunters can have certain disadvantages in wpvp. It did not say that they were bad at wpvp. You have to stop looking at the world in black and white. I can say negative things about hunters And not think that they are bad at the same time.  
---
"honestly the more you fight here the more you are getting exposed." - I think the exact oppositve. I think I managed to respond to critics and form counter points to their points, while staying respectful. More and more instances arise where someone only criticized the post due to a wrong assumption, just like how you wrongly assumed that I think hunters are bad at world pvp, which I didn't write and didn't think either.  
---
" Everyone is calling you out." - Well, comment sections on the internet can be a tricky thing. Most of the time the people who write comments represent a vocal minority. "Everyone" seems immensely far-fetched.   
---
" It is obvious that you have not played hunter a lot, or at least that you don't have a lot of competency in playing hunter. " - Well it depends on what you call competent. I stated at the very beginning that I don't have experience with raids, max level dungeons, or hc pvp in vanilla, but I didn't talk about these later.  
---
" That's ok, there is no reason to get rallied, hunter is a really difficult class to master. " - I agree. Few people master them. I like to think I was one of them.  
---
" However, we do have the duty to inform other readers and potential new players that what you describe in your post is mostly not accurate. " - I agree that you should try to point out misinformation, but writing *"Stopped reading on hunter disadvantage "outdoors PvP". "*  was really not doing that. I am open to changing my mind and I already made small corrections to the post based on feedback and I always admitted when someone made a compelling point.
---
It can be slightly powerful.
---
And don't tell me about powercreep, dumbass. TBC was REAL powercreep, all over the place. Adding a 5% increase in stats for a potential T 3.5 is NOT the same as having 400% more at the end of TBC.
---
This is such a retarded sentiment and it's been repeated over and over ever since they implemented their stupid new talent system.
---
They removed the old talent system because there were too many "cookie cutter" builds, scrapped the talent trees and went with their "choose one out of three talents per X levels" thing.
---
Which also just boils down to cookie cutter builds. The only thing you change now is one talent for specific encounters, at the most. 
---
Talent trees felt more rewarding, even tho they just ended up being cookie cutter builds for most classes. Leveling a character and gaining a skill point felt way better with each level, because you were looking forward to getting that one skill that gives you ability X. Nowadays, it's just whatever.

---
I guess I didn’t know that. So basically there is still hope? Tbh, I think we’ll have to wait and see. I believe every discussion regarding the latency is just expectations and nothing we can say for sure.
---
Cool news!
---
Btw, guys, how fast original content was cleared? Such Onyxia or BWL
---
And what your prediction how fast modern guilds will do it?
---
We all romantizes sometimes about the good old days in Vanilla, but let's get real, most of us will get tired of the game after being remembered how grindy and boring it can be. And why not have same option for BC &amp; Wrath?
---
Oh, look. Another comment to downvote with zero critical thought or input.
---
Look at Any given pve server there has been last 5 years. Mention 1 that didnt shut down before finishing All raid content, Due to lack of player base. Majority of players obviously wanna play on pvp server cause thats what the game is a about xd. I understand that a lot of People dont like world pvp and therfor choose pve servers but dont say Majority plays on pve when thats the complete opposit. Atleast thats My experience playing on "fresh" servers for 5 years.
---
Man that's humbling. I thought I knew what I was talking about there.
---
Dude you are sitting in the negative karma here. Just let it die already, really.
---
Not gonna lie bro you posted cringe
---
Yeah I did that when I dinged 60. Horrible spec that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. If you force it upon someone they will quit pretty quick.
---
Respect doesn't mean you have to actively participate, it means not being a disruptive asshole for no reason.
---
Skill based achievements impress me more. "Famed Slayer of" in retail for top 100 world kill on mythic is far more impressive to me.
---
I had one of these Z-boards. The button feel was mushy af and it was really noisy. Easy to clean though.
---
Selling Blade of Eternal Darkness is silly. It’s 113 runs for a 99% chance, which is ~23 hours.

"Wait, did you dismiss your pet?"

It's total health. 
---
Was nerfed in tbc
---
They still excell at 2 different roles. Its not different than pure dps classes. They all have their tradh pve specs too.
---
And there are no rules on an RP realm that prohibit anyone from being a disruptive asshole for no reason.
---
LFM MC come to if bridge for inspect.
---
Well, it's not exactly for healers (except, maybe, druids), but engineers can make **Goblin Jumper Cables XL** - a trinket that when used can resurrect dead players. If You're dps class and can't res, you can sometimes save your party a lot of time.
---
 That’s a big fat no from me.
---
People used to afk in AV when it was non-xrealm
---
Yes, there is a "totem build" for windfury. They also tend to use the ax that proc the extra magic dmg debuff.
---
This is wrong. In Vanilla, you could only buy weapons and armor if you were that Rank. If you let your rank Decay - you couldnt buy them again. 
---
(You could still wear them, but not purchase them).
---
"Gold are vastly more valuable.."
---
Who the hell regularly uses the right side of their keyboard while gaming.
---
Ion said that both Phase 2 and Phase 3 will be ~2 months each. We’ll probably see BWL drop right after the New Year since Blizzard never seems to like releasing content around Christmas, but since it’s old content, who knows.
---
No. They should create a website where players who want achievements could post a sceenshoot as proof then the website will add the achievement to their profile.
---
But **i don't want it into** Classic.
---
Every time Blizzard tries to fix retail, they revert it or get a huge backlash.
---
Look at them Buffing heroics in Cata after the joke that was in WotLK. People cried on the forums until they nerfed it to the ground.
---
In WoD they said "No more flying mounts". The plan was to NEVER enable flying mounts. However, due to massive crying they made an achievement that would enable it.
---
In BfA they did a tiny buff to the joke of a leveling experience we have today. The mobs did not get 1 shot and you can't pull 10 at a time like you could before this patch. It is still easy as hell, but still people on the forums have been crying ever since, claiming it was done to make people waste time to earn their "heritage armor" and "make people just buy a boost instead".
---
In BfA they tried to fix the portal maze puzzle by removing many of the old ones in places like Dalaran and instead put them all in Stormwind/Ogrimmar. Less portaling around means a more alive world, but surprise surprise they cried again claiming it was to artificially increase playtime.
---
We still have people crying every single day about the unlocking of Allied Races. Unlocking these races is one of the only things that feel like an investment in the game. Then they cry and say "remove the requirement from previous expansions at least!", something that would be a catch up mechanic and a "fuck you" to everyone that put in the original effort. A catch up mechanic like that would mean most people would stop unlocking them when it released, and instead would just wait for next expansion to unlock them, just like the trend become in regards to Tier sets and other transmogs.
---
They keep trying to improve the game, but most of the time end up doing a "fine, have it your way".
---
Therefore they will never remove multiple raiding difficulties, LFR, increase leveling difficulty more +++.
---
It's like when you have a baby, the baby is happy. Then you give it a popsicle, and take away the popsicle you just gave him. Now the baby is crying.
---
They need to let the game die and create a new game where they can make the rules from scratch.
---
What race would be added to alliance to balance it? 
---
Where would goblins start then?
---
The buggiest keyboard around.
---
I can assure you, it did not.
---
Well, I don't really care about karma, but I do care about defending my points against criticism.   
---
Writing out my toughts in a structured form and debating are highly beneficial for me and if this post helped even one person, then I consider it a thing that was worth doing.
---
Not everyone will be vanilla veterans now in their early 30s with 4 kids, a wife and house to attend to. Median age in our guild on a private server was 22. There are lots of students and welfare kids who love vanilla because they have infinite time to dedicate to it. Also the strong community means you can actually make friends in the game.
---
Wasn't it 50?
---
Spoiler, they will lose to the people who have been farming private servers for the last 10 years.
---
I don't need that. Purple&gt;Blue&gt;Green and optics is the most important attribute anyway.
---
Absolutely not, shit was the beginning of the end
---
Look at his action bar to understand what's happening. He stops moving backwards moment his Autoshoot bind turns white (usable, meaning outside of deadzone). This should mean the dude is just above 8yd, so they use Frost Nova which has 10yd range - and he didn't get hit by it meaning to get outside of deadzone he needed to go beyond 10yd range which is more than it should be.
---
Memory could be wrong but didn't guilds want 1 survival hunter for the trueshot aura?
---
But the rest sounds about right.
---
Just get my main through naxx, full bis and then log to pvp every so often and i'd be happy. If TBC or LK servers never drop, i'd be kinda disappointed, but also grateful for classic wow and the experience of vanilla.
---
Same. In TB I always go for the one on the left because it always has the least customers and I feel bad for the auctioneer lol
---
Shit i had this too
---
Then the loot council has failed. Your average guilds are going to have raiding roster of 50-70 people. Unless the loot council is bad they are not going to stack all items on just few players but it still makes sense to favor players that put in more effort and give better results.
---
you have make sure you get to 10mins otherwise no ad money though, all of this could have been done in 2mins...
---
With Maraudon available Hunters can definitely compete. Uncontested, consistent and undependent from the economy.
---
There was no real difference in PVE or PVP gear in Vanilla. It all had the same stats (ie no resilience like in tBC). 
---
The epic PVP gear is pretty damn hard to get, and didnt increase in stats. 
---
The Blue gear was good, but the T2, T2.5 and Naxx gear was always a lot better than what you could get from PVP.
---
Hell I was 2 years behind and I had a fucking blast in just ZG, AQ20 and the tiniest bit of MC.
---
Retail is to far gone to be saved as an mmorpg imo.
---
Well the problem is that doing so makes you a shitty person in real life.
---
What else would you do with it then?
---
Trueshot Aura is Marksmanship and every Hunter should have it.
---
Wouldn't be very classic if it was
---
it is **literally** on topic 
---
Did you just learn that word today?
---
Not to disagree with you, but man
---
It’s already working on Classic. It’s amazing. Makes for a insanely better experience for reading quests and reading lore. 100% recommend it.
---
I love games without achievements. So I'm happy there are no achievements in WoW Classic.  
---
As someone else said, if a site or app would exist where you have to show proof of your accomplishments and then you would get rewarded with achievements that way, separate from the game, that's all good.  
---
But I wouldn't want any in-game achievements to actually exist, even if optional.
---
Wow I feel like I've went back to 2006 and experiecned internet cringe all over again.
---
i never focused much on pvp but even so, i think it adds flavor to the game. Having levelled up in both server types and not being a great pvper i still prefer a pvp server because of the higher stakes. When you can't complete a quest because of a player it can suck, but the feeling of walking into the wild west town of gadgetzan or questing in STV or (hillsbrad) or EVEN finding players to aid you in taking out that guy who's camping you is really rewarding.
---
its just so much *better* when you have to keep your head on a swivel, and though like i said i'm not a good pvper I just couldnt go back to the boring safety of PVE.
---
Raid difficulty &amp; having rotations for most classes.
---
Spoken like a true illiterate
---
I guess whole point of classic is to return exact the same experience as it was
---
So, no. Achievements, arena, anything with interface.. nothing from modern wow shouldn't be there.
---
To manipulate with different aspects of wow they have next expansion
---
Player base increased with TBC and WotLK though, so it's good they didn't listen. Had they listened, playerbase may have stayed the same. 
---
Not judging any changes though, just looking at subs here.  They did have a point in making raids easier. Naxx was a perfect example of not earning the money invested in it (since like 1% of the entire player base saw Naxx from the inside). It's all made from a monetary point of view.
---
Vendor it. Finding people to sit in your dungeon runs is just going to eat away at your gold per hour.
---
Private servers you can just make new accounts if everyone hates you.
---
i really dig this
---
Hey, might as well add it to the post. Thanks :)
---
If you know any of the others, that would be great as well. I am working on a guild roster spreadsheet, and need to make sure users have enough space to enter their info.
---
Developer question: How did you get started actually creating the talent-tree, as it works in vanilla/classic?
---
I've had thoughts about creating a talent-tree similar inside Unity3D but not sure where to start to be honest. Can't find any good talent-tree creation tutorials.
---
Also it's fun to play. Unlike Modern WoW
---
There are certainly an overlap of players who will succeed in both types. Social rewards of mythic raiding are still very strong.
---
Soon-To-Be Ghost Town Classic is not going to surpass anything, don't dream to high.
---
I mean I just answered OPs question. It's not going to happen obviously so I'm not going to think about it in depth.
---
It definitely happened. Nihilum paid people to turn in war materials for raid epics. Gdkp is older than WoW itself.
---
Would be interesting to know whether it is 999 or 1000, but I'll just make space for 1000 members in the spreadsheet for now. Thanks :)
---
Ahahaha I remember doing this as I was still quite a nub at level 59 in EPL. I remember after it on vent to my friends like "OMG YOULL NEVER GUESS WHAT JUST HAPPENED!"
---
Oh I see... I didn’t put it all together and realize you’d have to have somebody in your group and have them loot it to sell it.  I agree then, very impractical.
---
I agree 100%, but no changes untill after classic. That is the core of this whole project imo.
---
Somethings not quite right
---
No. Artificial "achievements" where the game rewards you a worthless badge for arbitrary activities is something I find empty and meaningless. I prefer the sandbox aspect of creating my own achievements - I decide what I want to do and why.
---
It’s a world with no consequences and complete anonymity. If fucking with your RP gives them joy,   then so be it.
---
It wasn't for crafting was it? Was it not part of a questline for an epic chestpiece? My memory is a bit fuzzy.
---
"College teacher gets fucked by students"
---
Amazing lockpicking for rogues in NW beaches.
---
I'd assume this is how it should work, unfortunately on Beta it scales with your total AP.
---
This would be a massive change
---
That was very much intentional, my guy.
---
Pro: PvP
---
Con: PvE
---
Mainspecs in raids are always prio over offspec. Unfortunately that's how it is. And I can see why it exists, for progression. Although some guilds do alt runs which is a good way to get offspec gear.

---
The reevaluation that I've seen from so many people simply because this thing is hyped and popular really brings to light how much the perceived worth of a product has to do with marketing/hype in many peoples' eyes. Classic is just as Vanilla as it ever was, and yet now people are crowding the train cars to get onboard because it has big Twitch numbers. What changed? Again, it's just as Vanilla as it was a year and five years ago. It's hype. People are quite prone to liking or disliking a thing based on popularity. 
---
Shocking revaluation, I know, but it's been an interesting concrete example and a good reminder to be conscious of forming and questioning my own opinions.
---
Yeah but you have a 33% chance of getting it within 10 runs. 55 in 20 runs etc. You can take a small fee for the boost as well to make it even more worth it.
---
Demons, Centaur, Mauradon, Elvish ruins, and Rexxar fuck yeah Desolace was lit.
---
None of your PServer addons will work, at all, and hardly any of them, if any, are going to be ported over because the Retail/Classic API is drastically different than the old API. 
---
A lot of Retail addons *are* being ported over and there are some plans to re-make Vanilla addons that are no longer relevant to Retail, but it’s a slow process. You can keep an eye on willitclassic.com for updates.
---
Ew, why?
---
Just as a side note to the portals part. They "crying" wasn't because they moved portals around to create a central hub for them but because they flat out removed certain portals without any reasonable replacement. Portals that used to be in convenient places got either removed without an alternative or with a way more inconvenient alternative for (and this is the main problem) seemingly no reason.
---
Ah yea just looked up survival. No idea why I thought it was in there why all those talents.
---
Thank fuck. Wpvp is alive and well!
---
Pretty sure that you can do it with kul tiras sailors too.
---
If they weren't core than why do people care about them
---
Be quiet muffin
---
Really? I refurb boards all the time. If you are comfortable tearing them apart, cleaning everything, and reassembling them it can be worth it. I have a '94 AT-101 that I have working again and I found a Ducky 9008-G2 in the electronics pile at my dump that just needed some dusting and a replacement switch on the A key.
---
I wouldn't spend my time on just any keyboard but some are worth the effort to fix.
---
TB was the best anyway...Everything is closest together...vendor, inn, smeltery, bank, mailbox, flight master.
---
**Simple answer**
---
If you aren’t doing high end progression raiding then play what you want and like the look of most.
---
**Complicated answer**
---
* In raiding there are two types of tank, mitigation tanks and TPS (Threat Per Second) tanks, both have their uses based on what the encounter requires.
---
* Mitigation Tanks - You are going to get hit HARD in this encounter or have to survive a particularly difficult phase kind of tank. One might expect the BiS race as a Tauren for the 5% HP; however, in reality threat still matters so the axe spec of orcs (less glancing blows etc) or troll berserking (Pure TPS option) is actually better. WoTF is actually not aweful because there are a number of fights with fears which you can use, but they don’t help with TPS or survivability.
---
* TPS tanks - You want to burn this bastard down ASAP so you need as much threat as fast as possible. The BiS race is really Troll with Orc close behind as berserking is just that good. Again undead doesn’t shine here but you can’t kill what is already dead...right? This said until mostly BiS and T3 a Druid tank will out TPS a warrior and is less gear dependant. 
---
* In the end so long as you aren’t trying to min max, you do have a somewhat useful tool in the UD kit for raiding and cannibalise is relatively useful for levelling. 
---
* If you plan to PvP at all while WoTF CAN be played around unlike Orc’s random stun resistance, it is still very useful vs spriests, locks and warriors so if your fine with missing out on blood fury burst or Taurens extra long reach then UD is fine.
---
Differences from PServers. All points are from classic
---
* Mobs have slightly less HP and slightly more damage
---
* Mobs have less avoidance on classic (Meaning mobs don't dodge, nearly as often if at all)
---
* Quest XP is on par when compared to specific a specific Pserver, vs an different one.
---
* Mobs do not dynamically respawn (more people around, faster spawns)
---
   * Mobs are on a 5 min spawn timer
---
   * Named mobs are between 30s and 2 minute spawns
---
   * Gathering items are instant spawns
---
* You will be bag starved at the start
---
   * You will need to buy or have a tailor make you bags at the start
---
* Aggro range is reduced, thus pulling singles from packed mobs easier
---
   * its also noted that mobs have different placements. potentially to better help manage "Pulling too much"
---
* caster mobs do less damage
---
* Nodes have a hard limit
---
   * E.G, only 3 copper veins can exist within fargodeep mine at one time.
---
* Skinning is unneeded as your bags will be full from trash, as opposed to Pservers needing skinning to help supplement income.
---
* Quests have prerequisites
---
   * Some quests are hidden until you complete a prior quest
---
   * Some quests are restricted to specific race/class
---
* Elites deal manageable damage. making dungeons and group quests slightly easier.

I want them, but Blizzard said no.

It's called griefing though.

Just to be clear, I don't care if you gank rpers, but don't start jumping all over them and spamming twitch emotes in /s or /y.
---
The whole Westfall situation is her fault to begin with! Had she not lobbied all those inbred nobles into not paying what was owed we wouldn't be in this mess! And then when the king goes missing suddenly there she is, wispering lies into the ears of young Anduin! I don't understand why Highlord Bolvar lets her stick around. There's something very wrong with that woman, I tell you.

"Can' be world first on Retail anymore, so let's try easier and old content on Classic"
---
Yeah I’m confused
---
yay
---
If we only put on Reddit what we couldn't find on google, Reddit wouldn't exist. 1% of Reddit is OC.
---
You literally watched it on a stream. Did you think they were being serious?
---
Nost (and other classic private servers) use an old WoW client, likely 1.12. WoW Classic uses a modified Legion client (7.3.5).
---
Modern concepts and restrictions like addon tainting, protected functions and new APIs will be in effect to some extend. Which means addons need to be adapted to this specific client.
---
Vanilla, 1.12 addons will most likely not work. Simple Legion/BFA addons may work, but more complicated addons will require tweaking for this specific client.
---
This is really tight. Good job!
---
Maybe a region/ battlegroup/ server thing as I never came across people being mad about potions or engineering items. 
---
Pots in duels is a bit try hard though.
---
Some say the imagination is a powerful thing.  I assume that’s what makes dwarf warlock so strong in PvP.
---
Im actually put off Rogue with how little you earn from pickpocketing in the beta.
---
I like Rogue as it gives you a non combat and fun way to make money, if that's not viable then not for me honestly.
---
Well it‘s not like the old content dies like it does in Retail. Depending on your gear you may run old raids to get better gear to beat the new ones.
---
I think you'd be better off just going for hit chance on gear.
---
Lost the interest or the love?
---
correct.
---
Fine, I deleted the post since you apparently couldn't read my reply to the guy who previously replied to me.

LFM MC LINK ACHIEVEMENT
---
&gt; I’m mostly worried about the power of streamers. I know everyone is tired of talking about streamers here, but they do hold power within the community and the devs do listen to them.
---
The power of streamers also comes from the fact that their popularity negates one of the biggest layers of difficulty in vanilla: *actually building a community for content*.
---
Vanilla's raids weren't difficult, but the challenge came from organizing 40 people with the right gear and spec to do said content. Or get enough people with resist gear. Or tier 2 tanks for the horsemen.
---
A streamer entirely skips the logistical issues. They *snap* their fingers and have 40 people there who want to do their bidding, pulling them through content, clearing stuff.
---
If you have hundreds of people following your streams and playing on your server *just for you*, the big raid management aspect goes out the window.
---
I am basically in the same boat. Just replace priest with hunter. As you have mentioned the occasional pug for pve, I would suggest warlock (pretty rare on alliance from my experience on pservers, but pservers may be highly biased given its target audience). WOTF sucks, but can be dealt with (or go SL for easy wins). As most people here have said, if you want to minmax go gnome. I personally don't like their appearance, but their racial is way better for pvp.

---
Does mage utility like slow and frost nova work on bosses? I can imagine they’d have a hard time facetanking them
---
Did you make that site or have any way to contact the owner, a lot of it is wrong or will lead to unnecessary problems/grieving, like the hunter P1 listing freaking Hand of Justice on a hunter. Rune of the Guard Captain is much better if you are horde and Devilsaur Talisman gives a higher average AP from a quest, sure you can dual hit an attack once in a blue moon, but no way you should take that over a melee class.
---
Yea apparently there's different sorting options on reddit and someone might read this comment first and go "wtf", TIL huh
---
Well thats a major let down :/
---
Yeah I really dont want to play a dwarf.  The suggestions on this thread are leaning me towards playing a gnome lock.
---
Exhibit 2: EverQuest 
---
Which has been doing this for close to a decade now and very successfully at that having released many fresh iterations of their progression servers over that span. 
---
And Classic EverQuest is infinitely more hardcore and time consuming than WoW ever was.  I still laugh uncomfortably when people make vanilla WoW out to be a difficult hardcore game.  It’s still VERY easy and casual friendly when compared to the big MMO’s that came before it like EQ, DAoC, FF XI, etc.
---
A lot is wrong, and should list options because its in no way as set in stone as this.
---
I didn't realise but Swifty is actually great fun isn't he.
---
They actually do that in rust, where every character trait is randomized and permanent, so some are like short with big heads or tall with narrow shoulders or w/e. Super fun idea imo.
---
What I'm interested in, is in a clicker-add-on like "Clique" or "LunaUnitFrames", that allow to bind spells on mouse-buttons.
---
So I don't have to clutter up my bars with stuff like dispels, heals and buffs.
---
They all are, the hunter one lists Hand of Justice in P1
---
Sad truth
---
A lot of info is wrong, its well made for sure
---
Your achievements in classic will be visible on your character.
---
"See this guy riding the skeletal horse? He has probably run Baron 200 times"
---
"See the hunter with his Rhok'Delar? He has been through a great questline".
---
"See the full Wrath warrior? He's probably a MT in an awesome guild."
---
"See the guy with the Rank 14 gear riding the winterspring frostsaber? He probably doesn't have a life"
---
We don't need achievements in classic.
---
The post specifically asked about raids.
---
That was a whole year away and I was in the thick of WoW with my friends and guild who all had epic mounts.
---
In the cupboard, eh?  Next to the coffee cups?
---
RP-PVP has always been my server type of choice. The only rule enforcement I've ever seen acted upon was non-rp names being forced to rename, and that's all that should really be required.
---
In my experience, the majority of people on these servers don't actively engage in RP (myself included) but coming across those that do makes the world feel more alive and makes for a more immersive experience that a normal PvP server does not provide.
---
Yep. They need to pay the debt to sponsors.
---
It's supposed to be 5-11, it's also 5-11 on every private server out there.  
---
You can even check this yourself if you're a GM with ".range/.distance" commands.
---
Minimum range for charge and shoot is 8 yards, but that's just the spells themselves, without hitboxes/combatreach taken into account.
---
Following formula is used:  
---
Ranged attack: SourceCombatReach + TargetCombatReach + AttackRange + IfSourceAndTargetAreRunning(2)   
---
In most cases this would be 1.5 + 1.5 + 8 = 11  
---
(IfSourceAndTargetAreRunning(2)  is what people refer to as "leeway" and is only used for maximum range of abilities, not minimum range. So doesn't apply in this case).
---
No, that wasn’t until patch 2.3 and by then mounts were super cheap and training was expensive, but still less than Vanilla.
---
The beta is seriously a time capsule - I've had exactly the same experience on the beta as I had way back then. People are awesome, kind, helpful and people do remember you from grouping/questing/helping.
---
If you have old Auctioneer data and know how to extract and read it, that might be useful, but otherwise no.
---
If you're humble about it, just cap the donation limit. Will allow those who want to show gratitude that way the opportunity without leaving you with some impostor syndrome or something. But honestly, just accept the donations and the fact that you made a good tool!
---
another difference is that modern wow succ dic and classic doesn't
---
What do the rows even mean?!?
---
I think it would be insanely cool if Blizzard does this down the line as well. Servers with different modifiers or even hardcore servers. It would be a good way to create new content with very little effort.
---
Left always.
---
Spamming emotes or /say or /yell around RPers stopped being considered griefing by Blizzard during TBC.
---
Your missing Luna, KLHThreatMeter, Mobinfo, Aux, Auctioneer, Lazypig, Cartographer and foremost for hunter rais\_AutoShot. And bongos is a better version than Bartender.
---
Let's pretend phase 2 is at the most 6 weeks away from launch - (based on blizzard wanting layering removed asap and saying 100% by phase 2)
---
*of course they could remove layering before releasing phase 2, but phase 2 doesn't being a new tier, world bosses and honor system - so anyone thinking they will wait 3-4 months in between p2 and p2 is delusional.
---
So let's max that to 8, even 10 weeks between launch and phase 2.
---
August 26/27 launch - 10 weeks post launch = November 4th.
---
If you think more than 5% of players will have MC cleared before November 4th, it's unlikely - the amount of guilds running multiple groups will be low while everyone gears.
---
I just don't see casual guilds leveling to 60, gearing up (even a little) and clearing 100% MC before 10 weeks after launch. (Especially if most will take 4-6 weeks just to hit 60)
---
Good luck stun locking Orcs
---
I highly, highly doubt hardcore players open up those threads repeatedly. 
---
But I guess this sub found a scapegoat.
---
What makes you think they won't hire farmers from privateservers? They have the money for it
---
Willitclassic mentions both so I expect, yes they will work at launch to some degree at the very least.
---
Everything is easier in Classic starting zone than pservers with the correct datas.
---
You didn't really love them then ;]
---
think i give a shit? the mere fact that people start crying instead of viewing it as banter because you feel offended at the 30 year old basement dweller line is just funny haha.
---
I am very well balanced thank you :)
---
It doesn't need to be more powerful than naxx if it has gear for specs naxx doesn't support. It doesn't need to be better than naxx if it has equipment that have interesting effects or legendaries worth grinding for. It doesn't need to be more powerful than naxx if it has spellbooks that grant abilities found in Wrath or TBC that players otherwise couldn't learn. Mounts, vanity items, pets, crafting recipes, trade materials, quests, reputations, ect.
---
There's so much that could be placed in these raids that aren't better than what naxx offers that would still give people a reason to run these raids, in addition to them offering gear that is better for some specs than what is available because it actively supports those specs where current gear wouldnt. You wouldn't need your dps warriors taking gear from your tanks if they have their own sets in another raid.
---
These raids also give an option for people who have alts. Giving a secondary supply of purples that are still a challenge to get, even if not strictly BiS, is always going to entice people to play more. If you have to farm less in order to gear up a character for naxx, you have more characters to play and aren't shoehorned into the one single character who happens to have the best gear.
---
Of course, then you have the "welfare epix" problem of too many raids meaning people too many purple items, but if the raids are challenging enough (can you imagine trying to get 40 people to stand still during flame wreath?) then people gearing up won't do so that much faster, and higher tier guilds are drowning in the things anyway.
---
Why is griefing RPers fun for you?
---
You said they paid hybrid tax but warriors dont. If you say that do because they have on shitty spec then its not a hybrid tax because pretty much everyone has a shitty spec. Fact is that warriprs are excellent at all the roles they can do while no other hybrid does that, no other hybrid excells at 2 specs.
---
Fuck 'em, their game is shit anyway.
---
I 110% want cross realm BG’s, so it’s pretty simple for me.  I started my honor rank grind before x realm BG’s and finished after they implemented it and it was a fantastic change in my opinion.
---
Luckily for me, they’re doing it the way I want!

Just fyi, WoWhead now has a classic WoW talent calculator as well. [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc)
---
Nopers, wouldn't fit.
---
Yep, arms is still trash though, as in below retris in dps.
---
It’ll take days if not weeks to find one level 49 twinker that wants it. No one else cares.
---
This should be put into the WoW history vault.
---
Playing my unholy dk is more engaging and more fun than any class in vanilla. That is very true. I still dont like what they did with the classes (pruning and shit) but i certainly enjoy playing most of them in raids.
---
Engineering is massive immersion breaking, just say no.
---
My knowledge of pcs ends at extracting the downloaded file into addon folder so im guessing no haha
---
Are the horde winning in PvP at all? Every time I watch a match it's always from Esfands pov and he always seems to win. Think when they dropped wsg they lost 2 or 3 matches.
---
So you're saying that you've lost...that lovin' feelin'?
---
It’s not, but it *is* fun for plenty of others and I respect the rights to fun in WoW for everyone.
---
The end began way further back.
---
They are. But after progression it's like what, 2 hours a week?
---
Link curve!
---
The mage is not quite right. Most mages in MC/BWL will go arcane/frost.
---
Yeah i thought about this after i posted above.
---
Its kinda dumb that they have this level of clout, i have no doubt that if resources were equal they wouldnt win, but i guess ✡ money wins.
---
Agree. But saying its hybrid tax is still wrong.
---
Yep, a ton of staves are BIS levelling for Shaman for a long time.
---
Classic will be more popular than Retail
---
Shitty people who can hide behind the guise of anonymity.
---
You don't actually *need* the 4 piece. Nat Pagel trinket from ZG works as well (is better in fact, and more mandatory for the 4HM than tier set imo).
---
I doubt Blizzard caters to them, either, just because they're such a small percent of the population. ;P (But boy am I jealous of them LOL. I can get away with a lot at work, but not WoW.)
---
Also, a bunch of pserver guilds know the raids like the back of their hand, that experience is gonna pay off majorly once they release, unless method is practicing on pservers right now there's a 0% chance they'll beat those guilds for wf, no matter how much more skilled they are as a team and/or individuals.
---
Using lower rank spells for mana conservation is key
---
Even then, that's 1 week of content for these guys, then they're back to being bored for another 6 months.
---
The more engineers with sappers the better for AoE fights. For instance you can bomb all of Viscidus' blobs at once and kill him instantly. Also grenading the eyes on C'thun makes it easier. The teleporters are really nice for Alliance, especially the Gadgetzan teleporter.
---
You’ll be fine dont worry about being perfect!!!

I had these both when I was a kid too. I just used the absolute shit out of them so mine are in horrible condition. I used to always read my blizzard game guides on the toilet so i left them in the washroom
---
They will keep modern wow just like they have been - same formula since WoD - no need to make it like classic :)
---
Nobody that chooses retail over classic would want to give up leveling to 130 in 10-14 hours /played, or flight whistle, or pokemon.
---
And objectively anyone not ever have played wow that comes into the fold, will probably start with retail first, unless they've been told about classic by a friend or streamer.
---
Bs. Games are changing. It's fact.
---
Yeah, I think I'm in a similar boat to you, but with more time. I still can't commit to raiding on a severe schedule; I could maybe make one regular night a week, but that's it, so I'll be more of a benchwarmer. I'm okay with that, though. Part of me will miss not being a complete no-lifer, though. :')
---
it's not griefing on a PvP server
---
See, that's an intesting thought, pull in 20 experienced pserver players throw them some sponsorships to fill up their 40 man raid.
---
&gt;Exactly this, also EU Ally (Vashj)   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Need= Direct upgrade for what i'm currently using (so for this roll)  
---
&gt;Greed= Side grades or upgrades for offspecs (or just selling/DE'ing)  
---
&gt;Anything other then this needs to be discussed in advance, or you get put on my shitlist :D (and since i played a tank and a healer, that would suck for you :P)
---
“See that guy? He’s done every quest on the continent.” Oh wait, no.
---
“See that guy? He’s leveled every class to 60.” Oh wait, no.
---
“See that guy? He’s looted a million gold.” Oh wait, no.
---
“See that guy? He’s killed one of every faction/class combo of the Alliance.” Oh wait, no.
---
“See that guy? He’s exalted with 20 factions.” Oh wait, no.
---
There are plenty of instances where achievements are great, you just don’t want to feel inadequate.
---
I think you are vastly overestimating those facials.
---
I sometimes visit the auctioneers on top floor  in Darnassus, because I think they feel lonely otherwise
---
And tighter teleportation of trollgodx to winterspring
---
Wtf how is it 37g? IF you look at the loot table and drops, it's literally 
---
9g per reset, obviously you do 5 and that's 45g/hour. 5 if you add the stone boss as hunter.
---
In MC and BWL all except one mage will go deep arcane for AP and other generally great talents and put the rest in frost.
---
So technically arcane is the best spec for those raids, but using frostbolt to deal damage.
---
back when i wasnt allowed to play wow and just googled world of warcraft and watched everything that came up
---
Na, next to the lasagne sheets.
---
Easier to obtain PvE raid gear than to get the equivalent pvp gear.
---
Similar stats but PvE gear tends to have more primary stat while pvp gear tends to have more stamina.
---
Well that doesn't take into account all the others I mentioned
---
It will be a &lt;Method&gt; team..  but likely not the roster we see on live.
---
I’m 100% certain there will be a few pserver ringers in the roster
---
They know about this. Right now there are tons of buff effects that don't get removed from your character when they should.
---
Well, disagree on mages and priests.  
---
The former depends on what you consider "arcane" for mages. For the fire adverse raids the best call is actually the arcane-frost build for all but the token winter's chill mage. 
---
The latter is simple: shadow weaver build &gt;&gt; pure shadow.
---
Simple answer: No.
---
Same I don't rp. I don't mind bombing in and doing a bit of in character fuckerery for the sake of other rpers and I don't hold with playing outside the spirit of rp and messing up rpers game.
---
I'm saying that, while rp servers might be more mature, there are a lot of mouthy gits
---
Still makes you an asshole.   
---
Are you seriously trying to argue that being an asshole deliberately to people should be considered ok, even if not a direct violation of rules?
---
In my much more recent experiences on pservers... you're in for an awakening.
---
Isnt that basically how healbot (which got restricted later on) worked?
---
Instead, enjoy hours and hours of AV!
---
WoW after TBC and a bit of Wotlk has lost its feeling (for me at least) so slowly, even though I have a lot better pc compared to when I was playing WoW at my prime, I have stopped playing and nowadays I am just browsing the internet waiting for classic on my high end pc. 
---
So lost interest not the love. 
---
I hope to find the interest when classic comes out.
---
Except the rpers on the half dozen severs there are for them
---
I always picked Magram just because I thought it was easier.  I never knew there was such a good mail reward.  I'm gonna choose Gelkis this time! Thx for info.
---
Depends on the guild - if it's a competitive guild MC and ony will be down within 4 weeks of launch.
---
The world first guild will probably have it down within 20 days.
---
You can Google it, but it took months for each of the big raids, due to people not knowing the game, *way* weaker talents and items, and bugs (CThun was "mathematically impossible", but I think there were some other less well-known bugs).
---
World firsts are going to be ENTIRELY about who has the least life this time. At least the first time around people got stuck on resist gear, strategy, or bugs.
---
Now its just how long till you can get a raid with 20 or so 60s and some 55+ for MC.
---
...but I do what I want, and I watn to use JH's one
---
[willitclassic.com](https://willitclassic.com)
---
There you find every compatible addon.
---
You won't be able to use the 1.12 Addons, because the Classic-Client isn't based on 1.12.
---
Then it would be considered a fortress, castles are first and foremost a fortified family residence, not for military expansion, defense, ect, &lt;-- via the definition
---
Underrated song!!!

---
Why do you think griefing RPers is fun for some people?
---
I said I respect the rights, not that I think they should be protected in any way.
---
You have /ignore, that’s the best you get.
---
I'll happily concede that method could easily afford to "buy" world first by hiring pserver players, but if we're talking about an actual "retail method team" coming in and recruiting to fill up to 40, then I stand by my statement that there's a 0% chance they'll get wf unless they're currently practicing the raids on pservers.
---
Of Warcraft
---
Except for the achievements that aren't acknowledged in game - e.g. fully exploring every single zone in the game, finishing literally every questline, getting exalted with Shendralar (however it's spelled).
---
That said, the achievement system was terrible. If Blizzard did decide to acknowledge/reward some of those more obscure activities, I'd much rather see them do so through secret quests, ala "Avast Ye Admiral".
---
Yes. If you want to be anything in WoW, you can be. That’s what makes WoW great. Even if you want to be an asshole.
---
They were. You needed rank 6 and they were essentially superior healing and mana potions, so level 35 ish pots that were much cheaper.
---
Interesting! Are you in the beta? Have you compared it with pick pocketing on pservers? And I agree, the viability of farming gold is a huge factor for me if I decide to go rogue or not.
---
Rank 6.
---
Exactly. I don't think those getting bored of lack of content can hope for any world first but MC (that they're not likely to get too). You need to grind a lot and strive for perfection, it requires a very different mindset.
---
i can't wait to see /trade spammed with LFM NAX DISENCHANT RUN BIS ONLY KINGSFALL RESERVED FOR MY WARLOCK ALT,  
---
while i'm level 43
---
Because getting an emotional rise out of anyone, especially someone you think is weird and taboo, is fun for some people.
---
I feel, Blizz made some problems for themselves with the way phases are setup.
---
1) Phases are not equal. Phase 2 is very minor, Phase 4 is laos minor. Phases 3, 5 and 6 however are big events. So, naturally Phase 2 should hit pretty quickly, but there needs to be more time between phase 2 and 3.
---
2) tying pvp to the phases. That's the biggest problem I see personally. Phase 2 again needs to hit quickly, as with no honor system at all, pvp is pretty much pointless. But battlegrounds hit in phase 3 and spending 4 months or so with nothing but world pvp, I don't know, if people will like that very much. Sure, the good old Tarrens Mill - Southshore zergs are a lot of fun, but nothing but that for months?
---
Hehe, when did you start playing then?
---
Flying doesn't exist in the game since MoP pretty much. They only enable flying in x.3 patch, that is the last content patch of the expansion, which is a reasonable thing to do. Before then, for 2 years, there's no flying.
---
In the endgame that is, where 99% of the game happens.
---
tarren mill open pvp was the shit and i hope it comes back.
---
OP is a perfect example of the current mindset of gamers. No loot = why even bother?
---
You play a game cause its fun to play
---
Take him to the infirmary, he's delusional.
---
Dude it was a top tier game during the time of good games, get interested son 👍
---
But yeah these pcs are more than needed for classic 😂😂😂
---
Disc priests are actually preferred because power infuse is such a powerful cooldown. You also gain 10% more mana in exchange for 10% healing and a small amount of +heal.
---
He said they can't wait for 8.2 so they will have plenty to do especially with the new tier coming soon
---
r/jpgsthatendtoosoon
---
Is it actually supposed to have 9 sp? I could have sworn that's the updated version that came later.
---
What's Gatorade?
---
All I want is to make a scarlet themed guild and spend 100% off my time in the plaguelands killing horde. I want to be that guild this time. I doubt it'll happen if there aren't rpvp servers at launch.
---
something you can do for 2 extra keys is unbind the strafe right strafe left  "Q,E" since you can also do this function with "A,D" and "right click" at the same time. good pvp players used this back in the day because the Q and E are easiest access and good for reaction spells.
---
How do you KS into a cold blood eviscerate?
---
Seems like whoever made this graphic don't know that port stones in front of the dungeons are a thing in 1.12. So only 3 people of your party / raid have to travel to the entrance.
---
I prefer SM Ruin spec, it's better for everything else other than raiding and with 16 debuff slots if you can get away with using corruption on some targets then it could be better for raids too.
---
Not to mention you can use imp for dps and stamina buff.
---
Does it smell like Cheetos and Mountain Dew?
---
Dual spec.
---
they won the one in the video so yes.
---
You wont be missed.  
---
That said, you wont be missing out on BG's or anything, so you'll still get a PvP fix. Just not as much WPvP
---
&gt; unless method is practicing on pservers right now there's a 0% chance they'll beat those guilds for wf
---
WF Ony and MC will be based on whoever no-lifes to 60 and attunes first.  They don't need to practice for those.
---
And they'll have plenty of time to practice before the next raid opens.
---
I am offended by that good ser.
---
This need's more upvotes so we can educate the masses to finally embrace the left auctioneer
---
I like to think that warlocks are just mages who dare study the "forbidden" knowledges. One can use evil power to do evil things, but you can also use evil power to do good. I see the former warlocks as the evil guys in cults all over Azeroth and the latter as the player character. We use the power of demons to do good. 
---
Or spawn a doomguard in the Crossroads hehehe...
---
For these reasons, and others besides, I find the idea of "racing" for a *world first* to be kind of pointless. Classic is, and should be, centered around your realm/server and that is where these rivalries should be confined.
---
No fuck that.
---
Yea man, I'll be in wsg every minute I can get once I hit 60.
---
can we just stop for a second and appreciate that a damn light bulb killed a gnome? :\^)
---
Is it me or does this sound like scottish deadpan humour? I think the entire clip is a joke, and I highly doubt that "Scrype thinks none of the private server guilds are much of a threat".
---
0 Improved Blizzard for Mage?
---
Just not going to AOE farm at all?
---
Or some payers bind A and D as strafe and use the mouse to turn the character
---
We wuz kangz is a meme started on 4chan to mock black people who claim ancient egyptians were black. It gets thrown around in other circles now as a way of just mocking black people in general.
---
Right, that's called being a dick.
---
Why do you think some people getting to act like a dick is more important than other people getting to have the fun they want?
---
How are they going to practice bwl before bwl releases?
---
No one likes pservers here
---
I think there are cellphones that lets you play world of warcraft now days
---
60? 49 for life!
---
Yup. When I'd newly built my PC like 4 years ago I ended up playing pokemon on my DS.
---
the video is only 4 minutes long though..
---
I would recommend using private servers for this
---
Going for world firsts that were claimed over a decade ago 🤣😆🤣😆🤣😆🤣This is so sad
---
They’re in the beta
---
We also need Nihilum and For the Horde (EU-Destromath) back.
---
Is that Frostmourne
---
It's sought after by ever caster in the game. It's one of the first (if not the first) spell dmg and healing weapon available. Expect everyone that can equip the dagger and uses spells to roll on it.
---
No offense, but do you expect to not fall behind playing sub 2 hours a day? I agree thats more than enough when you are max level and raid with your guild 2-3 nights a week, but not when you include leveling, rep grinds, farming pre raid gear, getting professions up to date, attunements etc.
---
There wouldn't be any living bacteria of the sort on it after being in storage for so long.
---
Paladins can't tank anything beyond dungeons so such theory crafting is irrelevant.
---
Put that way a server first MC and AQ40 is doable for an EU guild.
---
You’re probably right, but I don’t think the top % of players will be just 5%. There’s so many people coming in who have done this shit for ages on private servers.
---
Whats a paladin tank, is that like when the holy pala gets healing aggro?
---
Can confirm, it's the "same" button, it's just split up so the cover can be folded.
---
Get'em boys!
---
If you look at it like that there is nothing to do in any mmo. Im only afraid for the poor casual souls that are still \~48 by the time p2 drops. They will quit because of inability to level.
---
why is killing players on rp-pvp servers a dick move?
---
The naga south of the stronghold is one of the best grinding spots imo.
---
I think private server people really underestimate the way Method grinds if they aren’t in touch with their dominance in retail, they will be getting world first 60’s and they will be entering raids before anyone else.
---
1 wrong thing? It was many wrong things. Many.

I Think you underestimate the European welfare system. The pserver guys from EU can do the same.
---
Creator of this video is objectively wrong.
---
As if what pserver players plan to do is secret or exclusive info?  
---
My guess is the pserver players will have opposition and a tough time collecting the world buffs they need to rig their raids.
---
Okay so where does "ooga" fit into the black supremacy thing? People use Kangz to make fun of black people in general, just because thats how it started on /pol/ doesn't mean it didn't evolve.
---
The discussion is not about killing people - it's about grieifng them.
---
MC attunement doesn't even need to be mention on the list of challenges. It can be soloed with stealth.
---
Wait a minute boys, don’t all pvp pieces have resilience?
---
RemindMe! 90 days
---
griefing them how?
---
Yeah I agree!
---
I enjoyed it, it's very over the top and very much British humour.. Several of the characters are actors that have appeared in other British comedies. Doesn't take long to watch as it's only 6 episodes I believe.
---
Correct.
---
this is exactly it, I know where the joke came from, but I've also seen plenty of people just using it to make fun of black people.
---
Go read the rest of the thread.
---
Yes,theyre wasted stats as you're gimping your healing with such itemization. Int and + heal are much better)
---
They can practice on private servers before then.  What I meant is that they don't need to practice on private servers until after MC.
---
If you have the time to get gold you should have the time to raid casually and get items from the lower tier raids.
---
I never understood people buying items, to me it would feel so bad to not be able to earn something myself. 
---
MC can be easily pugged too.
---
People buying boosts in retail disgust me aswell. 
---
I'd rather not have something then be carried like a noob.
---
It's not more important, it's equally important.
---
It's not my fault that an RPer's version of fun is so easily disrupted by another player's version of fun.
---
Yes! Ppl were taking it for granted.
---
This Method announcement is kinda "big" tbh, cause it will attract even more people, sponsors and money to Classic. Increasing the chance of success, awesome!
---
I see myself rerolling to get the highest human and losing my username in between
---
I always choose the least busy auctioneer. I don't know why I do this I just use my Human brain and it tells me what to do.
---
Don't blame yourself, blame modern game devs/publishers...
---
Things I'll miss:
---
* Decent itemisation (ie, no random stats sprinkled everywhere, some specs having enormous difficulty getting BIS, some stats not really available)
---
* Every class has multiple viable specs; many classes have multiple viable roles.
---
* M+ (especially in its legion form) providing an ongoing, scaling source of content
---
* Raid difficulties
---
* Mythic raids, full stop
---
* All specs having an actual rotation
---
There's a lot to like about Classic, and a lot to dislike about Retail (no need to recap here; we all know the list), but they have spent years polishing the raiding experience, and I think M+ is arguably the only genuinely important feature added since Vanilla.  I had a lot of fun in BWL back in the day; perhaps I will again, but...it's a very different experience.  Similarly, a buddy of mine spent most of vanilla playing a paladin and *really* wanting ret to be viable in raids.  A lot of people are cheesed off with Retail about the gutting of fun Legion-era specs, but in comparison, Classic is going to be...different. Good in its way, but I won't say I won't miss it.
---
It's called "high fantasy" because the designers are high as fuck when they put together this shit.
---
you're arguing against killing players on rp-pvp servers regardless of how you want to phrase it
---
Why do you think the fun of a very small minority is as important as the fun of the majority of people on the server?
---
They are reporting it with the bug reporting ui in game
---
That's the most striking difference to me
---
They are good for the tank that the Paladin is healing.
---
I cant get nightfall proc to work in this
---
Instead of this, I would advise that you go outside and feel the warmth of the sun on your skin, the soothing summer breeze in your hair. Run in the park. Swim in the ocean. Enjoy the taste of a fresh healthy meal. Go and give your loved ones a hug. Because come August 27th, all those moments will be lost, like tears in rain.

Oh shit I didn't know I legit thought it was like proud Africans "we was kangz back in Africa" and "we was kangz in the hood/on the street"
---
Sidenote I really love rap and hip hop but guess I'm sheltered in Sweden
---
No changes!!11!1
---
I think I'm okay with 1.14 content patches like this. It's just Blizzard should think really good how to add new content and don't make old content useless. I'd hate if after some content patch people stop coming to Ironforge and instead gather at some Dragonmaw port.
---
Alliance  &gt; horde
---
Change my mind.
---
the rogue recording... if he had the enemy as target and initiated AA then his weapons would be held but they are not.
---
Leeway is a mechanic that was added to deal with latency issues and on classic thats not really a likely issue
---
The old challenge modes were good where rewards were just cosmetic. Brawler guild is another. Bits of the game that give players a challenging content without gear rewards.
---
A paladin needing something for his tankingspecc is a good indication.
---
because they're playing on the same server
---
I didn't know you could kill your own faction members on rp-pvp servers.
---
Exactly! Didn't understand shit either.... Care to develop your thoughts OP?!
---
Do you also mind checking if the Org flight path is unlocked from level one for Troll/Orc? I just tried on a pserver and it wasn’t which makes this whole route impossible. 
---
Thanks!
---
What do hunters do in Maraudon to make coin?
---
It would like to know this as well, seen several people stating that we'll have 15k and upwards to 25k server populations without backing any of it up.
---
You can't ban people for doing something that is not against the ToS.
---
How is that an answer?
---
WoW was always one of the most casual MMORPGs relative to the market at the time. Even classic WoW was *casual* compared to other online games at the time.
---
I'm looking forward to it.
---
Youre most likely exploring all of the zones anyway on your way to 60
---
Within 2 weeks. They will have 40 people hit level 60 after 10~ days.
---
you can't. what threat could a player possible pose to you other than killing you?
---
So you don't even remotely understand the conversation going on, do you?
---
Naxx was piss easy compared to Gruul, KT, Vashj
---
I've been playing on a pserver for the past 3 weeks or so too, and there hasn't been that much ganking either (although I haven't reached at yet), despite many people in world claiming that there is much more with influx of classic-waiting players.
---
Well i do all of that and i have an MMO mouse too. Still bothers me that i can cover a large range with  my thumb but only use it for 1 key pretty much
---
Most important stuff is already available. I'm just waiting for something like TourGuide. I loved that Mod in Vanilla and TBC.
---
I am also thinking that making RPPVP servers is the only reasonable solution.
---
For threat you want block above all other defensive stats, I guess.
---
I imagine it'll be more of a nostalgia fix. Bringing out a guide for an MMO that's constantly getting hotfixed and patched will make the guide obsolete sooner rather than later.
---
But that was when WoW was fresh and new. People today are more efficient, have more access to information, and are generally more used to leveling.
---
The leveling process will be *much* less extreme this time around.
---
VanillaGuide and TourGuide. Both are currently set to run on the 1.12. patch private servers use, but I expect at least one of them will be updated for Classic servers. There are some minor discrepencies between the two, and the UI of them is different.
---
!RemindMe 2 years "Did he get his leaf?"
---
Team Blue for life.. as a Paladin it is my Holy crusade to smite all filthy heathen horde scum that i cross path with (with the help of my trusty MS warrior).
---
Really you should stop worrying how others want to play their game. If it gives them nearly nothing its their problem not yours. If they want that extra edge, let them. Stop calling people names because someone wants it.
---
Do warriors even want this? Doesn't seem to be much better than the warrior chest you can get with the rage active
---
On top of this, super toxic or creepy behavior can get caught on stream much, much easier now.
---
what is SM ?
---
Yes so it is confirmed that Classic would have a limit debuff slot ? Tss that sucksso hard. I would like to play affliction with ruin talent, indeed. It's more fun.
---
&gt;Does ret aura trigger on dodges and parries? 
---
Don't think it does.
---
Parry/dodge are double-edged for all tanks. Avoid attack (= no rage) = less aggro. I think paladins are the least affected by it. If you're tanking a dungeon, you won't have aggro issues anyway. If you're trying to tank a raid, you anyway will.
---
Jesus crist this sub sucks ass.
---
Really easy for me. Cross realm BGs are fine. Quicker queues, less skewed server/faction pop issues.
---
Sharding isn't for me. At least not after the initial launch. I'm thankful it'll be there initially, to be honest. As much as we all want thousands of people visible on a server, competing with 300 people for 4 boars is going to be a pain in the arse. They're doing it exactly how I'd like it.
---
100% agree! It is one of the better put together sets.
---
&gt; but i guess ✡ money wins.  
---
Please take your anti semitism elsewhere.
---
Seems like you don’t know about patch 1.12. The stones in vanilla 1.12 are “meeting stones” these stones are meant to be a group creation tool for payers within proximity of the stone. What you’re thinking of would be the Summoning Stones that were released in w/ TBC.
---
Nobody needs to do it if they dont want to. Its their.business if they want it.  I also dont remember anyone compalining about it years ago.
---
Modern WoW has collected vast numbers of people who value convenience over inconvenient (but for us, more satisfying) Classic mechanics.  Taking away those convenient elements would tank the whole thing.
---
i just got used to walking in front of the enemy while theyre running to hit them
---
I am so doing this. Thanks for the idea.
---
Please take your soy elsewhere.
---
Right?
---
If you happen to play mage i would say go Alliance. you can portal everywhere and put your HS close to SM :) (southshore or Wplague)
---
Had not much luck with the drops, no epics or stuff. But on the other hand, I've found a blue one-handed axe for like level 30 or 35,I think I found it in Scarlet monastery...
---
I sold to to a young shaman and talked a bit to him. A few weeks later, this shaman talked in OG about making the best guild on the server. People laughed at him and even offended him for this. But I've applied to the guild before it was a real thing. Later that day, I quested with the shaman and two rogues tried to gank us (but failed some times until they gave up). We had a nice evening. I think the day after we founded the guild. Long story short, that blue axe was the beginning of a really nice guild and we had a blast. Really good times!
---
instead of responding with a new question every time why don't you defend your position that that customers should have their right to consume and utilize the product however they want revoked because you think the utility player A gets is more meaningful than that of player B?
---
With 5 warriors you could have 1 tank and 4 burst everything down before you need healing.
---
You clearly didn't play enough. I can still clearly read the W, A, S &amp; D on  the keys. :)
---
Usually when someone punches your kidneys, you are going to be standing on your knees in pain. It's the perfect time for a hit to the neck :&gt;

Ah a man after my heart! Horde warrior is where the heart is for me. I roll the female orc warrior to be extra unique. People think that their model looks shitty but if you see them in full plate sets they actually look the best!. If warrior is your plan be careful they are a hard main to have they dont really farm the best vs a mage or other classes but it is 100% worth it.
---
Viable = You may be invited for a raid and people recognize that you bring some value.
---
No Viable =  You will not be invited to any raid because you do not bring any value or enough value to justify your spot. 
---
You can't take a debuff slot with mortal strike. If you can't mortal strike you are worse than a ret paladin.

It's a closed beta m8.

Wouldn't WOTF become useless since warriors get Berserker Rage to counter fears in raids?

2 weeks is 14 days, within 2 weeks would be after 7 and before 14.
---
Words.
---
Same position as you. Honestly I would be happy just to complete MC. I was about 52 when TBC came out so I missed it all. Thinking of playing a priest purely in the hope my chances of getting a raid spot will be greater. Any advice on that would be very welcomed 😬
---
Only kool kids go horde.
---
Any ideas when WoW classic is coming out, or how do I buy it? I have never played WoW before, but this looks interesting!!
---
will there be a quest helper in-game already put in?????
---
Thanks for the serious answer man. I hadn't actually even thought about the less rage thing for other tanks, that makes a lot of sense. I guess I'll probably just adjust based on what I'm feeling I'm having the most difficulty with. More dodge/parry if I'm taking too much damage, less if I've got threat issues. Thanks!
---
Pretty obvious that I’m speaking of 14 days, no?
---
Swing and a miss
---
Warlock. Greatness, any cost.
---
wf ony/Mc is only about speedleveling which a guild like APES will beat method by easily. For all later raids, they’ll go to some tryhard US guild since they get every patch 1 day earlier and vanilla raids can be cleared on release day.
---
His example was a deadmines run so we're obviously talking about leveling here not raids. 
---
I understand why it's a thing in raids but for leveling dungeons it's retarded.
---
???
---
You assume too much buddy
---
If you roll on a server that already has 60s, pick up alchemy and make swiftness pots.
---
I wanted to test some leveling on pservers and to make some easy gold i bought briarthorn and swiftthistle off the AH and made swiftness pots. 
---
You can easily double or tripple your investment and swiftness pots always sell.
---
I know this is only for lower levels and require an already established server but I had 100+ gold with only having a few 10-20 chars on a server.
---
This is a sad but true statement...they kinda cant win unless they end the game or do a complete reset, armageddon the entire next expansion
---
World first will have it down within 7 days, you don’t even need a full 60 roster to do MC
---
For sure not a miracle, but great to see them bring it back nonetheless :)
---
So much better!!!!!
---
Dont call me buddy pls
---
Blizzard is considering to have RpPvP realms at launch. Omar Gonzales and John Height said it in an interview.

---
Shamans tho
---
What's the quickest pserver record?
---
&gt; You will be bag starved at the start 
---
I'm more and more validated about my decision to go Tailoring, after all...
---
Kind of, WoTF doesn’t require you to come out of Defensive therefore you don’t lose the damage mitigation of defensive when you are looking to prevent a fear. Hence the “not aweful”, warriors have a tool in their kit already to deal with fears, but WoTF just adds another therefore is a more of a luxury ability as far as countering fears. That said the point still stands that undead have little to offer a warrior in PvE compared to other races, but if you aren’t min/maxing then this doesn’t matter really.
---
Definitely, blocking is massively helpful. I think just for that, Anticipation is worth taking for the +10 defense. Even if it offsets threat generation from ret aura a bit, it'll probably make up for it with threat generated by blessing of sanctuary and other block based threat generation.
---
No, it's because I think the utility player A-Y is more meaningful than that of player Z.
---
Have you figured out what griefing means yet, or do you still think it's a synonym for PKing for some reason?
---
&gt; customers should have their right to consume and utilize the product
---
Why in the world do you think you have a RIGHT to use the product of a private company?
---
I'm very conflicted about the idea of having new content. 
---
I personally prefer the classic experience as it is and id be sad if they decide to add content to the new classic servers. However, i think that if the community wants new content, it should be released on new servers and then add the option to transfer your character there. 
---
Im also down for TBC servers, as long as the "classic" servers stays the same with up to naxx-content. Im fairly sure, as a casual player, that i wont even get to experience the content given to me now, so therefore i interest in new content :) 
---
But thats just my two cents.
---
Right now, what you are experiencing is essentially what a *lot* of people who are not blindly going into this are worried about.
---
Vanilla content is *finite*. At some point in order for WoW classic not to go into maintenance mode, which means no new content and dwindling players, some new content has to be released. A few new world events. A new raid. A BC server with character copy function that moves your 60 over permanently.
---
There has to be *some* way to progress.
---
Wow man. 800g is gonna be a griiiiiiind. Best get my plans in place! :D
---
There's a lot to consider when it's your first time playing vanilla/classic when it comes to questing. It's more immersive when you actually have to read the quest and explore the area to complete it. It can be very social as you'll ask for info in local chat and/or group up with others to complete. And I assure you that it'll also be terribly optimize since you have no idea which quest to do together and how to sequence quest to maximize efficiency.
---
If you don't want to experience that or perhaps like me, have already done so, then there are plenty of guides to help you be more effective and efficient. My 1st char in vanilla was just me derping about, taking in all in, and slowly figuring out the quest but that's all apart of the journey. Another fun part was leveling my alts and figuring out the best questing routes, how to be more efficient, and skipping quest I felt weren't worth it. This made leveling with alts such a different experience and added new enjoyment to leveling.
---
Now, I'm in the boat of trying to be more efficient and will refer to guide instead of my flawed memories from 13+ years ago. I still know all the quest, and I still know how to do them, however trying to sequence/order them properly is not something I'm likely to get right, or would have ever done as well compared to using a guide.
---
Ultimately, you gotta do what is fun and enjoyable to you, but I would recommend leveling as a complete noob at least once/your first time, it really is fun in it's own way.
---
I don’t think there’s any “easy” way to do what you’re asking... I mean you’ll need to do some research on what the dark moon faire turn in are and send them to an bank alt until the faire comes.
---
I make $10/hr or so playing Oldschool Runescape and that’s 100% legit lol. 
---
Hoping WoW Classic has some angles to work to make cash so I can justify sinking the time into it lol. 
---
Made around $15k off scape the last two winters.
---
Windfury mate
---
Of course. If you are shown to be a creep (e.g stalking, bothering female players), then that will stick around.
---
What I am addressing is the notion that ninja looting once or being a bit of a dick got you into major issues. Most of the time, it absolutely did not.
---
and cross realm. no reputation to uphold when you'll never see those people again.
---
proudly hosted on photobucket !
---
Maybe just maybe Blizzard expects them to say certain things to get certain privileges :)
---
All good, just playing with you lol. Grats on rank 14. /Salute
---
I like achievements but I would rather them not be in Classic. Getting an achievement for a pet or exploration is cool but I dont want to deal with "LFM BWL LINK ACHIEVEMENT" shit. This is Classic, you make your best judgement on a pug and go with it
---
You can refresh the max stack shadow weaving with mind blast once every 15 sec. It's a big window.
---
You're both technically correct.
---
It was mainly used in a quest for chest/legs and an enchant, but it was also a reagent for a potion to extinguish the fires in ZG.
---
If that's the only thing holding you back, give it a go. Just like most classes, you'll have lots of time to play with your abilities and you'll probably have a few you don't bind, let alone put on your bars. It'll be a nice time!
---
Looking forward to being handled in STV
---
Fair doos. Wouldn't say it's retarded as such. I'd more state it at the start of the dungeon that I'd be rolling on offspec stuff. Or I'd create the group to make sure no one can get what I'm looking for. I'd be pissed if I were a tank and an arms warrior took a shield for offspec or something whilst leveling even.
---
20% is just 8 people, there's a lot of room for choice.
---
If you want it as wonky as possible, try elems and balance druids. Don't bring shadow priest because 1 is good. Assign a few ferals to put bleeds. Make mages spam arcane missles.
---
Nice Rogue leveling spec. I wonder where I’ve seen that before...
---
How many of 40 player raid is going to bang their head against BC raid level of difficulty to give Ele Shaman a PvE DPS set? It is hard enough to stop people drifting away when Naxx is cleared &amp; they still need gear. 
---
Wrath or BC abilities are a massive, massive power creep. What does that do to PvP? PvE isn't the only thing in the same. 
---
Creating raids for vanity items &amp; mounts is a retail thing. I'd not really be a fair of that in Vanilla. 
---
DPS warriors barely take any gear from tanks, you are suggesting DPS warriors the most overpowered class in the game is given even more optimised tier gear? That is insanity.
---
None beacuse Im too busy leveling
---
Seen more ganking past level 20 than I've ever seen before in any incarnation of wow. It's been gankfest to the point where some places you literally cannot quest in at any time of day. It made memories of STVietnam look like a small skrimish and this was a world war.
---
Can't wait to kick all the party poopers out of my raids. I hate when people don't let others enjoy the game the way they want.
---
As long as we can beat the boss, and everyone does the mechanics right, I think no one should be told what to play, and anyone trying to do that will get a swift kick. I think it's alright to ask a guildmate to change, but people in this subreddit are using class imbalances as an excuse to be assholes.
---
Good luck with your palatank journey :D
---
Well it depends on what you're tanking.
---
My point is that if your healer can keep up with the damage well enough then you kinda want to get hit a lot and even get a few crit against you to generate more threat.
---
If your healer is struggling and you are on the verge of dying most of the fight, then you want every source of damage reduction you can get and the ret aura threat is really unimportant in comparaison of staying alive.
---
Now of course since paladin can't really tank in raid outside of being offtank on a few specific fight,  there won't be much place where you absolutely want to be defense capped and having as much mitigation as possible so for 5man so you can skip some talent once you have a beginning of tank stuff.
---
Concerning parry, you get a reset from the your main hand timer, so it's always interesting to have for threat.
---
These days (retail model) Sylvanas just looks like a Dark Elf: someone looking at her with no knowledge of Warcraft lore would never in a hundred guesses think she's meant to represent *the Undead*.
---
Check out tips outs podcast with legendary skarm where he goes deep dive on why druid tank is viable even in high end raiding. Guy knows what he's talking about
---
Oh goody, moron is back who thinks classic raids are going to be 10x harder than pserver. 
---
If you gave every offspeak in the game tier gear that dropped from another raid how many people are going to grind for it if it isn't upgrades? Most people raid for character progression. Sure we'd all clear it once or twice to say we've done it and see the new bosses but farming it? Nah.
---
They can solokill tinkerer,princess and rotgrip. Think you make around 40-50g per hour just from vendoring the blues. They can also try to sell the blackstone ring which is preraid bis for a few classes. The ring usually goes for around 10-15g on private servers.

---
Was it the chromatic flight breastplate or something? I remember chromatic anyway! 
---
I never properly cleared ZG in Vanilla. I joined a shitty guild that couldn't do Hakkar and when I moved server I joined a guild that had better stuff on farm. I can't freaking WAIT to do this content again! :D
---
You're joking right?
---
Naxx in Vanilla was totally different than the re-release.
---
Everything was scaled up to require more coordination across 40 people.
---
In TBC:
---
Gruul was just having the gear to beat the enrage timer, there was no mechanics at all.
---
Vashj was tank and spank for everyone but the melee who looted the tainted things.
---
Kael'thas required less coordination than 4 horsemen and 3/4 of your raid could just sit there tugging their balls.
---
I'd perhaps take you seriously if you mentioned Archimonde or Muru.
---
Cartographer and Threatmeter was another of my main addons actually :D
---
Well reminded! I've almost forgotten what aggro actually is after playing retail for so long.
---
Would be too easy then. Can just bloodlust every hard part, wait for CDs. Run out to change talents, gear etc.
---
Uh what? Yes it did.
---
Blizzard has stated that they’re adding layering during phase 1 so lots of players can have stable experiences on the same server, allowing Blizzard to launch with fewer servers. Once players are somewhat spread out through the world, Blizzard has said they’ll remove the layering- I’m not sure if it was phase 2 or 3 for that.
---
The intent is to launch fewer servers in order to reduce the likelihood that small servers die and need to be merged.
---
Adding optional expansion servers would both increase the number of servers and fragment the already existing communities. 
---
It’s a tough question- I have a feeling they’ll go with the expansion server concept if they go with the re-release expansions concept, but I don’t know and frankly don’t care yet.
---
... This Is the wow i remember. What happened to it that they have to bring it back like this?
---
Glorious welfare system
---
Main thing about Chicken/Dragon is that they buff the DPSer, their own damage isn't that important.
---
Alright, thanks for the answer. :)

druid btw
---
Hey guys let’s speed clear all of the content in vanilla wow as fast as possible, so we can raid log, and entirely kill the life cycle of any given server within months, and go back to playing retail! Maybe they will release a brand new fresh realm if we go REALLY fast and complain about nothing to do anymore. Then we can do it all over again. Yeah!!!
---
The insult for classic is no longer noob its "go back to retail"
---
Me (mage) and a hunter friend went into BWL and walked through the gate to Vael.
---
Then we woke him up and died. 
---
Next we had the hunter stand inside the gate and feign death and I pulled Razorgore.
---
We waited for the adds to almost kill Razorgore then the hunter woke up summoned his pet and used it to pull Vael. 
---
Since he was inside the gate he could do this and then get back to Razorgore's side. 
---
We timed it so Vael would be in the room of Razorgore when Razorgore died and the eggs exploded and killed everyone. 
---
What we wanted was obviously that it would kill Vael and we could loot him. 
---
Unfortunately Vael lived and the explosion just killed the hunter and the remaining orcs.
---
If you find yourself in a fair fight, you're not fighting right.
---
If I have a potion damn right Ill take that. You are my HK not the otherway around.

I adore it, I hope the author backports it because it has made a world of difference in quest readability and enjoyment.

Theres soo many changes it might ruin the game
---
Thanks for identifying whether the game is for me or not based on my choice of words about a certain aspect of the game. Now that I read your comment I can save hours of my time and invest them into a game that definitely suits me better - retail WoW. Very kind of you.
---
&gt; You're ignoring the journey.
---
The what? "The journey" in retail wow is finishing the main quest line. After that all you do is grind dungeons. Neither of these things have a "dungeon finder" function, just as I stated in my original message.
---
If you feel personally attacked from what I've said about Classic, then maybe Classic isn't for you. People hate snowflakes like you, but maybe you have better odds at finding your place in Retail.
---
Now now. As a healer, I'll gladly have a shadow in my 5man group. I can like 90% afk shit with their shadow heaking.
---
You're actually right, I just quickly glanced at [this Wowhead guide](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/maraudon-gold-farming-classic-wow) and assumed they did the math correctly.
---
Tinkerer Gizlock:
---
* Inventor's Focal Sword - 3g 21s 6c
---
* Gizlock's Hypertech Buckler - 2g 26s 30c
---
* Megashot Rifle - 2g 64s 25c
---
He drops one item and they each have an equal drop chance, so this boss is worth an average of 2g 70s 5c per kill.
---
Princess Theradras:
---
* Bracers of the Stone Princess - 1g 2s 25c
---
* Blackstone Ring - 1g 46s 41c 
---
* Gemshard Heart - 1g 16s 31c
---
* Princess Theradras' Scepter - 4g 48s 63c
---
* Elemental Rockridge Leggings - 1g 42s 44c
---
* Eye of Theradras - 1g 2s 25c
---
* Charstone Dirk - 3g 54s 83c
---
* Blade of Eternal Darkness - 4g 67s 96c
---
She drops two items and all but the Blade of Eternal Darkness (2%) has an equal chance of dropping but she can't have repeats, so this boss is worth an average of 4g 15s 67c per kill.
---
Rotgrip:
---
* Gatorbite Axe - 4g 29s 51c
---
* Alibino Crocscale Boots - 1g 24s 58c
---
* Rotgrip Mantle - 1g 3s 83c 
---
He drops one time and they each have an equal drop chance, so this boss is worth an average of 2g 19s 31c per kill.
---
**That's a total of 9g 5s 3c per run or 45g 25s 15c per hour.**
---
Just when you’re getting used to upright orcs...
---
&gt;Was it the chromatic flight breastplate
---
Mostly right yeah, the Breastplate of the Chromatic Flight.
---
Legguards/Legplates of the Chromatic Defier were also an option for a related quest.
---

---
It's true, I don't appreciate 99% of his content but Asmongolds guild kiting teremus from Badlands to SW on the beta as level 30s and wiping out most of the alliance on the server is the clowny shit that makes them fun, I think Devs often forget this nuance.
---
Man there is alot of edgy neckbeards here complaining that they only changed due to popularity reasons.
---
Quit fucking complaining. We want the game to be as successful as it can be and Method commiting to playing the game is a big fucking deal. Get hyped and quit trying to look down your nose at people who have been playing retail.
---
I'm there too and I use a well-theorycrafted sheet with proper stat weights and 1.12 itemisation to answer people.
---
What makes you think that a Method roster, of which a majority of players either never played or don't remember the first thing about vanilla, Sco himself being bullied by plain mobs in the Barrens, would level more efficiently than a group of pserv welfare neets that leveled dozens of characters on dozens of fresh servers over the past few years and have been playing and raiding vanilla content for just as long?
---
These private server guilds basically prepared for this release for the past 4 years at minimum. Vanilla is not about a high skill ceiling and the Method caliber of players are not going to get an edge over other guilds in this version of WoW. The rush is all about knowledge and experience, not mechanics.
---
*laughs in stealthed undead*
---
There's a questline - "The missing diplomat" where you go searching for a missing Alliance politician. It's really long, but the twist is that the missing politician you are searching for is actually the King of Stormwind Varian Wrynn himself. 
---
The quest leads to a dead end. It was never finished, and Varian is left sitting on that island by himself all the way until Wotlk.
---
Probably yes, wing clip spam+dual wield yields more auto-attacks. I do admire your swagger though
---
I got started programming by writing bot scripts for Diablo 2 and Lineage 2 (around 2003-2008 timeframe).
---
I'm not a professional "Systems Analyst", with a pretty diverse background.
---
I never did anything for money, or RMT, just for the challenge - like you said, it was trying to make things more human like and less bot like. I would also watch it for the most part, and almost never do anything unattended.
---
Yeah because its the only DPS gain trinket a hunter can use in P1 besides the 2% crit trinket. Should he leave it blank?
---
Why ,you wanna hack my phone?
---
Yes there is also a turtle escort from the south of tanaris near the zep crash to the south of steamwheedle port. You have to escort a lost turtle that went on his way to find food back to his wife.
---
Shadowfang Castle AKCHUALLLY and here’s my 3 page analysis on why it’s a CASTLE
---
The thing about Windfury is that it doesn't stack with weapon enchants. So you'd lose the Shadow Oil on your main hand. Will the extra attacks make up for it? Possibly, if you have enough on-proc items.
---
Not raiding Tuesday really helps.
---
On my server we raided Wed/Fri/Sat/Mon with clears early and big progression pushes in the later days of the week.  So if we went to get world buffs for a prog push, it was Saturday or Monday with a much greater likelihood that it wasn't on ICD.
---
With the same guy we got into AQ40 right after the gates opened, walked through a wall to the right of the entrance which got us outside of the temple to a huge white flat area.
---
You could run to a spot where a tunnel intersected the floor and we could slow fall jump into the big room before Princess Huhuran.
---
These people went millions of gold into debt for the WF race last time, transferred their entire roster twice for a single gear quest and bought out the consumable supply of entire servers.
---
There is absolutely no denying that a group like Method will no-life the shit out of this.
---
I used to grind them for the clams/pearls, iirc. ;)
---
Finally got the right height, time to get my imp and see what name i rolled..... fuck.
---
I think they will be spilt into different games (as they are now) and then the casual-softcore players will play on Retail as usual.....HOWEVER......I believe that Classic will pick up momentum and more people will convert to the old MMORPG aspects of the game, eventually making Classic the main game and Retail the easymode.
---
Although be warned, you'll find a lot of people following you until you're at 50% then turning on PvP.
---
In hindsight some form of CD for attacking after turning on PvP would have been nice but c'est la vie
---
I heard for pvp servers its better to roll horde is that true?
---
You know that alliance is superior, as Reddit, like other forums, is full of basic, dumb individuals spamming stupid memes and generalising about an entire faction incessantly. While alliance remain quiet by and large.
---
One is classy and succinct and one is obnoxious and loud and in your face, craving attention.
---
What are your PvP goals? If it's solo wPvP, yes engi is very helpful. If it's mass wPvP, engi is helpful but there will be others who have it. If it's premading, engi might be a requirement but might not be.
---
If it's soloque BGing, **engi is not needed at all**, even if you aim to rank up as high as you can. 
---
That said, blacksmithing is useless except for antifear trinket. Tailoring is useless except for caster PvE. And every other profession provides nothing you can't buy.
---
Mount training cost 100 gold before rep discount. You could learn it at 40, but I didn't get it before 48. I never got an epic mount in vanilla at all.
---
Speak for yourself pls. Top guilds in wow history came from pvp servers.
---
Did you really just link a Star of David when referring to money? What the fuck?
---
Everything became carebare. 
---
Flying mounts
---
Inflation of gold
---
PvP and PvE gear separated with resistance
---
my thoughts exactly, i laughed when I saw op taking this seriously but I guess a lot of others are too..
---
&gt; practicing the raids
---
Pray tell: why would a team that regularly clears the hardest content in the game today need to extensively practice *classic* raids? Have you seen the average ability list of some MC bosses...?
---
I was banking on it.
---
First time I played I would get a character to around lvl 12 and decided I would like a new class/race combo. Hit 60 for the first time 2 weeks before BC came out and woke my gf at the time at 3am to tell her. Oh lord the memories.
---
Ya brother
---
music is what we make it out to be my dude, dont sweat it
---
Thank you, I'm glad you liked it. I am sure there are quite a few of us who have a similar background when it comes to this game.
---
Hi, I'm Legolass. I have shadowmeld and a panther with stealth, nice to meet you.
---
Absolutely. I have always adored PVP-RP servers. The fact that Blizzard don't know if they will include them yet blows my mind because the demand for one is pretty bloody big now.
---
I have a bug tentacle fetish so Silithus.
---
Cba reading through that but upvote for effort
---
Sponsors give you money lol
---
For example ?
---
Name 5.
---
No one cares what's on there mate.
---
If you aim for similar system requirements as Retail WoW you'll be safe-even though its a "classic" version of the game, it still uses the same engine as Retail so it will behave in a similar manner.
---
He's bored with BfA but world first race is his favorite thing, especially when they lost last race. And Josh seems already bored with classic (or it's just because stream snipers)
---
Hopefully
---
Will servers support more players?
---
Wow, solid work dude!
---
🤔🤔🤔
---
Mate, this is good work! Thank you!
---
You don't seem to know the first thing about world buffs if you think it has any impact on the first MC/Ony clear.
---
I mean...this does not come as a surprise and does not need to be called out. They have sponsors. These sponsors want to make money. It was inevitable that once a product becomes popular, they would get onto the train.
---
there still aren't any rules against griefing on rp-pvp servers so no, I still don't know what you're talking about since you for some reason won't tell me.
---
&gt; Why in the world do you think you have a RIGHT to use the product of a private company? 
---
that's part of the agreement between the buyer and the seller, lol
---
Fingers crossed. It would be a bit of a let down if not :(
---
CAD? What is this Canada?
---
Yeah horde seems to be the I can shout loudest faction these days
---
I dunno hey, still think their melee ranged is bugged somewhere. Be that the hit box, the leeway in certain scenarios, spellbatching affecting melee swings (not sure if it did in the past? but I think something is off somewhere.
---
Shut the fuck up
---
No moonkin? Even though many consider it as troll spec I am sad to not see the community not being open minded, it's not a personal rant to you because clearly that was alot of work, just my global take, I am not a TC and didn't played Vanilla so I was hoping there would be some content for our spec :/
---
Easy bruh
---
:(
---
Yeah sorry bit of a wall, but quite a few videos on there, thanks :)
---
&gt; wf ony/Mc is only about speedleveling which a guild like APES will beat method by easily.
---
Again: you are *seriously* underestimating the way Method operates. They will have had hundreds of hours to study how to level, what mobs and quests are best, what professions to take and how to level them.
---
Their level of dedication to WF is *insane*.
---
Yes, or it is the way some people level a padin for grinding a little more efficiently.
---
That's basically what a dozen private server guilds have been doing on every new private server release for the past years. There is nothing special about Method in that regard, plenty of players do that all year long.
---
Even 1.12 AV isnt efficient. You're still better off hopping in WSG or AB. Let AV be there for fun, we have 2 other BGs for efficiency of rewards.
---
Wow that's cool!
---
Could you make it to save the order in which the points were spent? Like the other guy who linked his website earlier.
---
I love seeing that keyboard in front of a 4K monitor
---
No, but people like you aren't welcome here
---
Thx for the Essay, Esse.
---
Because again, everyone has the right to whatever fun they see fit.
---
You have the right to RP to your heart's content.
---
RPsuxlol has the right to ruin your RP to his heart's content.
---
It's not my fault your rights are so easily trampled by his rights. That's your fault for putting your measure of fun in something so fragile.
---

How are you not perma-banned from the subreddit? Just gonna let racists shit on Jews in this sub now?

Bald Eagle Bucks\*
---
This is flat out wrong. They can. They won't be optimal but they can.
---
Because it requires very detailed knowledge of every single pull in there.
---
Going for world first BWL isn't about downing bosses in as few pulls as possible, it's about clearing it as fast as possible.
---
Hypothetical situation, relating to retail, who do you think would clear *x* m15 faster, the team that has spent the last 3+ years perfecting every pull in the instance or the team that regularly clears *y* dungeon at +25?
---
Cool story, Rory.
---
PvP gear is too strong to be in the game before BWL is in the game.
---
I think I kind of get what hes trying to do. I have a similar idea that all the classes are based off of a more base class. 
---
In his kind everything is either a warrior, Rogue, or mage. And then you add the identifier of holy, primal, soul, or hell or whatever he has going on to make all individual classes. 
---
I look at it like this. The four main classes are warrior (dmg absorb), rogue (melee dmg dealer), mage (magic dmg dealer), and priest (healer). Then you mix those 4 main classes to make the others. 
---
The simplest would be a warrior/priest mixed =pally. Mage/warrior/priest = shaman. Mage/warrior/priest/rogue = druid. Hunter is just ranged rogue. Warlock is evil mage. 
---
I feel like this guy has just been awake for too long endlessly refreshing this sub and looking up classic wow info lol
---
8 days on *a server I'm not allowed to name apparently* by the guild Progress, I think.
---
Seeing as the leveling seems much easier on the Classic beta, I have no doubt a first week kill is achievable for these guys and similar guilds.
---
*laughs in dead nelf outside of orgirimmar as "Why Can't We Be Friends" wafts softly through the air*
---
are you British?
---
Is molten core available week 1? I could see them clearing it before reset.
---
I totally expect to fall behind, and most casuals already know we’ll fall behind. However, I don’t want it to be an acceleration of falling behind because people are well-versed in Classic. Tactics, min/maxing, etc. will make everyone that much better, and I’m terrified that hardcore players will be wanting phases pushed fast.
---
&gt; that's part of the agreement between the buyer and the seller, lol
---
So then you understand that part of what you agreed to is:
---
&gt;Behavior that intentionally detracts from others' enjoyment (such as griefing, throwing, feeding, etc.) is unacceptable. We expect our players to treat each other with respect and promote an enjoyable environment. Acceptable behavior is determined by player reports and Blizzard's decision, and violating these guidelines will result in account and gameplay restrictions.

Which is the exact thing we're talking about. What you're claiming is directly contradicted by Blizzard themselves.

Why would he need a comparison infographic if he’s never played WoW?

What a massive buzzkill you're being for no reason.  Sad.

it did, people wouldn't group with people they didn't trust or raid. Trust me when it comes out IT DIES WPVP will die and everyone will stay away from towns. THE NPCS are dishonorable  especially in darkshire.

Windfury tho
---
Dear god I hate seeing achievements pop up all the time in guild chat for people doing mundane things like getting a haircut or falling X feet without dying or just completing a zone.  It's ok when they do it on their first character but if they're an altoholic you'll see it all the time ..
---
I'll make a huge money bet on a duel and then use Light of Elune.
---
GG EZ
---
Yeah, I dont know what he's smoking.
---
Even some of the "hardest" bosses in WoW classic were just thinly veiled gear and class checks. Nothing in WoW classic raiding was, in and of itself, mechanically hard.
---
&gt; I never used potions in BGs
---
So this is why we lose, some cheap bastard can't even FaP with flag!
---
I think on solo BGs people almost always allow themselves to be cheap, because they just teamwith strangers... However, it's not bad manner to do everything that helps your team.
---
Indeed!
---
&gt; They need to let the game die and create a new game where they can make the rules from scratch.
---
I sometimes wonder what people even expect that to look like. Mythic+ is a roaring success across almost all layers of the population (casual, semi-core, hardcore). Are sweaty 40-man "raid-or-die" fanatics going to be okay with a version of WoW 2 where dungeon content is a legitimate end-game progression system? This idea that WoW 2 would look more like Classic than Retail is absurd, I can't think of any game-systems from classic that are loved by modern audiences aside from BRD-style "mega-dungeons", and even then those seem to work best as one-ofs.
---
More players and we don't know exactly what layering will do - butbif it was 8 days on a small playerbase then yeah I imagine some real guild will do it quicker :)
---
We don't know. They're wanting to see how Vanilla alone does before the devote resources to anything else.
---
Blessings tho
---
I disagree. Achievements came out at the WotLK pre patch and that was arguably the most successful expansion.  People didn't take the achievements nearly so seriously back then
---
Are there any speccs that cause anti synergy like overwriting priority debuffs??
---
Dishonorable kills are a part of the Honor System. You gain DKs by killing opposing-faction Civilians NPC during PvP combat. DKs can quickly lower your PVP Rank.
---
Dishonorable kills were added to the game in an effort to stop high level players camping quest NPCs or vendors without penalty, as this could become a major source of grief for lower level players on older servers.
---
Many complaints of the system have been raised due to the fact it almost completely destroyed town/city raiding. One Dishonorable Kill could destroy weeks of work for a high ranked player.
---
Blizzard tried to solve this by adding World PvP objectives in Patch 1.12.0. 
---
The world PVP Objectives sucked and the NPCs just needed to be buffed THIS IS the worst change they ever thought of. The no changes crowd are thinking raiding/pvpbgs everyone is gone once AV and AB release permanently
---
&gt; Who cares if someone uses world buffs for world first ~~SM run~~ anything.
---
FTFY. It's a game. If your enjoyment is based on other peoples victories you are doing it wrong.
---
I am a multiclassing whore in DDO. Bring it on!
---
See you at launch
---
How do you reconcile what you're saying with Blizzard's Code of Conduct?
---
To be fair the whole Black Egyption thing deserves to be mocked, its consistently brought up and smacked right the ass back down over and over. We have the same issue with cheddar man in the UK, some one quoted a scientist saying there was a possibility which turned Into EVERYONE WHO FOUNDED BRITIAN WAS BLACK. There where some black people in Egypt... you know the place renowned for slavery to build monuments... however that does not equate to them being anywhere near the ruling caste but people just won't let it die.
---
I think he/she means pve gear obtained from raids versus pvp gear obtained from pvp
---
Which classes can purge buffs?
---
It never killed it when I played Vanilla tbh. However, a lot of people just played for fun back then and not a tangible reward they could get.
---
&gt; these days
---
Its been like that since forever
---
Right, but reading guides doesn’t prepare you better than having the experience the neckbeards have
---
Intredasting!
---
Plenty of private servers' guilds have the resources and decidated players to achieve a roster capable of clearing MC within the first week of release. Probably faster than Method will without practice. But I don't mind them trying, more competition is a good thing for sure.
---
Why not RP as an asshole?
---
Gamers are racist.
---
Get a wand&gt;tag mobs then dot them
---
Link Parse!
---
Have to wait for the tick
---
gief
---
They don’t tag until they tick, immolate does immediate damage, I use that to tag.
---
Gelkis for life.  Magram are shit birds.
---
From memory its after the tick.  I remember autoattacking to tag sometimes
---
Method got world first in retail bfa by about 12 hours and there is a lot less margin for error, I think a lot of people seriously under-estimate Method.     
---
It’s great that these private server people have a lot of practice and will have the advantage over Method only having beta to practice but Method will be playing 18+ hours a day 7 days a week and are being paid to do so.
---
&gt;  If you let your rank Decay - you couldnt buy them again.

Didn't they change this when they updated the gear?

I *love* desolace. Hell, I love it now. It's one of the only cata-changed zones that I feel they didn't butcher.
---
I loved levelling in shimmering flats, tanaris and desolace. On a pvp server, they were always so peaceful. Lots of kill quests rather than "loot x amount of quest items with a .02% drop rate" queats, which were annoying af
---
I dont have to pretend to be something i actually am, right?
---
You can use `replaceState` instead of `pushState` to replace the url with the new one without it affecting the user's back button.
---
I actually think this is quite a flawed way to look at it. Prices did not just change due to inflation, they also changed due to gold having a fundamental different role in the game. In vanilla it is bothersome to get and needed in high quantities for basic things like abilities, mounts or even BiS gear. On retail it is not just easy to get, you basically get most of your needs covered by doing *other* stuff. Furthermore most basic things are now also cheap or even free.
---
Another flaw is how different the efficiency of farming is depending on classes in vanilla. This means gold is essentially worth more to classes that are bad at farming, whereas in retail gold is pretty even across all classes.
---
Because gold is so different I'd say you can't actually directly compare it, but you can take a few useful views on it. One is how much gold you can farm per hour, then look at the difference and determine a ratio. Even here you need to decide if you look at a farming class or the average across all classes in vanilla.
---
Another way which I personally find to be the most useful is to look at how much gold is needed on a weekly basis (for flasks, repair etc.). Then look at how much gold you can farm per hour and determine how many hours of weekly farming is needed. Do this for both vanilla and retail and you have a ratio to compare. This obviously only mean your regular used gold, so it is also useful to remember that in vanilla you have a lot more "purchase once" items that are expensive like epic mount, pre-raid BiS etc., so the worth of gold depends heavily on the time of vanilla (gold being worth more in the start when everyone needs epic mount and pre-raid BiS).
---
In its current state ofc. But if it was designed around it then i dont think so. They could just make it so that you cant leave the instance for example.
---
Centaur are scumbags
---
One persons rights end where another persons rights begin. It’s simple, really.
---
You said 4 weeks though.
---
The second part is incorrect
---
There will be a massive steady influx of players for atleast a couple of weeks following launch
---
Dwarf rogue and dwarf in general is master race vs rogue 1v1. You should never lose a fight period with a clean vanish and blind immunity with stoneform. Had many a good fight hunting down any and all rogues that came to gank ironforge with a dorf rogue.
---
&gt;Achievements came out at the WotLK pre patch and that was arguably the most successful expansion. 
---
WotLK [stopped the game's growth](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ibJJaNnI4T0/UyLWBayUk3I/AAAAAAAAFmk/oAvYUpHCQmw/s0/WoW+Subscriber+numbers+001+jim+younkin_b.png). Obviously there are many reasons for that but I would agree that, with that chart, one of the WotLK additions clearly *helped* anything.
---
&lt;I regret nothing&gt;
---
But you're playing the game wrong
---
Smallest screenshot everrrrr :)))
---
Because an argument could be made either way. 
---
Your silly RP filling up my chat detracts from my enjoyment, that is unacceptable.
---
And also because Blizzard has implemented chat features which allow you to ignore players and completely removed any policies about protecting RP players, thus, they don't give two shits about what someone says in chat unless it's hate speech.
---
#Raid or die. 
---
PvP gear is only for the fattest and sweatiest of unemployed nerds. You won't have epic PvP gear if you're asking this question, and non-epic PvP gear is just okay. You better like raiding, and you better like playing politics in raids to get gear, because vanilla PvP is highly gear-based.

There has to be for the 40 man content.

I hope you roll alliance !  Fear fear fear fear fear fear fear LoL
---
Absolutely. Un-retcon the draenei. Give us the Dragon Isles. Let me watch Thrall promote Sylvanas to Warchief instead of Garrosh. Bring the goblins in as a player race much sooner, as the first of the Neutral faction. Turn everything on its head.
---
I went and found his example, it looks really nice. I would love to add something like that. I'll have to look into it.
---
They still do it even though they find it boring, as they see the end goal of being able to progress hardcore for that period of 1-2 weeks worth it.
---
Same
---
But immolate has a cast time. I dont know how long it takes for curse of agony to tick, depending on how long it is it might be better than immolate even for single target tagging, and if you want to tag more than one mob then curse of agony will be better anyway.
---
As a warrior trying to get to a mage would you rather have stun resist or extra range
---
Total AP sounds quite OP, wonder if it's a bug or not. And Berserking only really affects white hits...
---
I'm glad you are enjoying BfA. I haven't been able to fully enjoy WoW since mop (say what you want about pandas, I like them). WoD was the last time I progged on mythic, and I used to be fairly hardcore.
---
That same server had 14k consecutive players from all regions in the world competing for mobs within the first two weeks of release. Layering would never let that happen.
---
Never trust a man with two bic lighters.
---
No, that only works with rights protection. Without rights protection, whoever is the loudest, the biggest, the richest, etc gets their rights over anyone else.
---
And considering RP players have no rights to RP even on an RP server, that means RPsuxlol can do whatever the hell he wants.
---
Nice!
---
What is this useful for? I don't understand, spell ranks?
---
\&gt;Also, in guilds that dont use DKP the loot council usually gives the best drops to the best and most dedicated players and the easiest way to determine them is through raidlogs which show damage and healing done by each raidmember.    
---
Whats a good way to allocate loot then that doesn't encourage this ??
---
Yes, most slows are instant, no cool down or one a 1 sec cast timer. You’ve made a really important point and are on the right track. Generalizing overvalues the importance of racials. 
---
I will say from experience human perception in rogue v rogue is a large advantage and one that is often overlooked.
---
This thread was not about being against specific classes, but rather the overall most useful.
---
Every single class regardless of spec has debuffs they shouldn't be using, but yeah, most of these specs would make that even worse.
---
Dots don't tag before they tick in vanilla. Tagging will probably only be really important at the start of launch so I wouldn't worry too much about it.
---
For dungeon finder the more important thing would be that you actually have to find your own group, could put the traveling part in quotes as an added fact
---
Also should mention that creating a reputation is important, retail allows you to be a troll and never be punished for it but in vanilla your rep on your server means everything

BETTER MALE MODELS ON HORDE, WHAT? THEY ALL GOT FUCKED BACKS!
---
Afi, 30 seconds to mars, lil wayne, and anything else with 2k vibes. So much good pvp music.
---
I’m spamming this at this point but: /u/SockofBadKarma said it better than I ever could:
---
Lok'tar Ogar, brother!
---
Let me hype you up about the Horde, right good and proper.
---
You don't want chaos? Great. There is no chaos in the Horde. The Horde is not about chaos. It's about brutal *efficiency*. Orgrimmar's buildings are as they are because they get the goddamned job *done*. The Forsaken literally clawed their city out of rock just to fucking *survive*, man. You know how much pain and anguish exists within a Forsaken's mind, having achieved sentience after enslavement to the Lich King? A whole hell of a lot, I tell you what, but they've got a job to do, and that job is survival (and pure, unbridled vengeance).
---
Survival is the name of the game. The Horde is a band of merry misfits, just trying to survive in a hostile world. The Orcs didn't want to be here. They were literally brainwashed by a bunch of fucking demons that shattered their homeworld and drove them insane, but they broke free of their bonds and, as a reminder of their former enslavement, impaled Mannoroth's big fucking head on a sixty-foot-tall pike. The Darkspear Trolls, maligned and hated by their kin for the grave sin of daring to help non-Trolls, eke out a meager existence on a pile of small islands. The Tauren find peace with nature in a small enclave surrounded on all sides by desert. The Forsaken, cursed with their very existence, struggle just to keep on not-really-living and not-really-dying.
---
They find brotherhood and camaraderie in their shared suffering, and they fight for honor and the hope of a future prosperity.
---
What the fuck does the Alliance have to offer? Ancient, decadent cities of their long-dead ancestors that they claim credit for, when in recent generations their legacy has been little more than xenophobia and racism? When Garithos, made leader of a full regional contingent by sheer chance, utilized his role to damn the High Elves and let the Sunwell fall? Or perhaps when the forces of Stormwind, instead of focusing their hatred against a literal intergalactic army of demons, decided that it was really the Orcs' fault that the Second War happened, and proceeded to enslave them and put them in concentration camps? So blind to incompetence and nepotism in their ranks that the highest elite ranks of Stormwind host not only the daughter of Deathwing but the nascent Twilight Father? And the Gnomes and Dwarves tinkering away in a mountain, giving fuck-all attention to anything north of Grim Batol? Or maybe the prissy and ancient Night Elves, screwing about in a magical tree in the north of nowhere, so incompetent in their racial history that they lost both Azshara *and* Nordrassil? Well of Eternity kaputt and all? And despite having millennia-old expertise with the machinations of the Burning Legion, they still don't prepare properly for Archimonde's assault? Nor does Dalaran, when the Kirin Tor are besieged "without warning", having conveniently not only ignored Medivh's warnings but also ignored the fact that he was possessed by Sargeras in the first place and also they're a bunch of goddamned super wizards? Might as well just put a big ol' bubble around their city and pretend they don't exist so that they don't have to help out any of the besieged citizens of Lordaeron.
---
The Alliance's legacy is inaction, their birthright unearned and their morality tainted by base prejudice. They lay about, and when threats arise, they continue to lay about until it's too late to do anything but damage control, and then they blame their problems on the funny green fellows and throw them in camps. They're corrupted by the malaise of prosperity, and their shining cities belie their slow downfall.
---
Who do you want to be associated with? An army of downtrodden, abused underdogs fighting for the right to live and assembled through fast bonds of wartime brotherhood, or a bloated bureaucracy of racist, snobby malcontents who abandon their allies to the Scourge and pretend themselves wise merely because of the age of the bricks beneath their feet? I prefer the underdogs. For honor! *For the Horde!*

Have a Warlock, Paladin and Warrior with T3 Gear.

&gt; Because an argument could be made either way.

&gt; Your silly RP filling up my chat detracts from my enjoyment, that is unacceptable.

Sure, you can argue just about anything. But Blizzard is going to be the final judge.

If we're being honest, we both know who they're siding with.

---
*You* are a racist. We aren't like you, and do not attempt to seek comfort in incorrect thought that you surrounded by peers who think like you. 
---
You are a tiny minority and the only reason you aren't completely and utterly secluded is due to the internet allowing you to find the other needles in a haystack across the world.
---
1. It's easy.
---
1. It generates viewership.
---
I'm betting on it not changing much and warriors being stuck as tanks until a bit past bwl in high end scenarios, where then they'll be allowed to tank farm content when the GM or off tank cant show up. The community will probably latch onto what the top guilds and streamers are doing and it will end up being worse than vanilla where you cant hit up a UBRS without being resto in at least 4 piece t4 because the one thing classic lacks and will never get is communities not tainted by the last several expansions.
---
You can get a few of the best ones in less than 30 minutes, and then down molten core in like 40 minutes. Its worth.
---
Summit literally spent hours yesterday doing this. Just watch his stream.
---
Oh, in French we say the Poe like Pou and "ou" is like the "o" of "who"
---
If your guild isn't chipping in for the tank's repair bills then they're probably not a great guild.
---
Never bought gold, but that is just a bunch of crap.

*Hexakosioihexekontahexaphobia intensifies*

I love it... 😂
---
Correct, it's all about the money and dealing with every single RPer's in-game tickets whining about how their RP got ruined proved too costly. So they removed the Roleplaying Policy completely.
---
The new path of exile league really helps me having something to play. It's exactly 3 months long and started this friday. Plenty of gaming untill classic for me. :)
---
Mages in classic can do their max dps rotation with a single button and they dont even need a macro for it
---
You seem quite angry for some reason.
---
Do you think ive ever done anything towards anyone of another 'race'?
---
It's basically that stuff like +hit is better in pve, and stuff like +stam and +crit is better in pvp. Basically every class has different ideal pve or pve sets.
---
So something to consider is the Shadow priest is a very niche role in a guild. It is dependent on  a couple of things. Your guilds willingness to use two debuff slots to buff the priest as well as the warlocks. And the number of warlocks in raid. Shadow isn't he most viable because you have to try really hard to do a moderate amount of dps. The bonus is you buff the warlocks. You are worth bringing to raid if you have four or more warlocks because that is when the lack of your dps is made up by the increase in your warlocks damage. So in short if you want to shadow be prepared to over consume as well as get very select gear pieces.
---
I don't debate the fact that people will kill lvl 50+ mob, APES already farmed EPL ghost for the mats of the gnomish death ray but the drop rate of the plan is like 0,2% so we might see it in beta or not, just gonna wait and see what happens
---
I used to do that all the time and never got banned for it. I would send them out for like 10s each. Enough to make a decent amount after a while but low enough that people would accept it out of curiosity. Eventually they just took away the ability to send wrapped items on COD.
---
There's also http://classicwow.tools/ which I like the aesthetics of a bit better.
---
In Orgrimmar I always shopped from my buddy Thathung. ❤ In Thunder Bluff I always use Stampi. 
---
Other than those it never matter. Now on retail I only have my friend Stampi left, but I sometimes meet up with orc daddy behind the auction house... 😳
---
Yeah been doing some research, and I'm taking skinning to level, so think I'm gonna go down the Rugged Leather Grinding route and hand in the rugged armor kits. 
---
I mind on my hunter I made a fortune doing this, and grinding the Yetis in Winterspring. They were pretty easy to kill and great for Rugged leather.  
---
Other Items to keep a hold of as you level are :- 
---
Vibrant Plumes - From most harpies and flying creatures
---
Evil Bat Eyes -  Plaugebats in EPL 
---
Glowing Scorpid Blood - Tanaris and Silithus
---
Dense Grinding Stones - From mining Thorium (4 Dense stones)
---
Thorium Widgets - from Thorium bars and 1 runecoth 
---
But yup....a tonne of grinding needed to get these items, but at least I can do it now with the plan of level 60 stuff as soon as I get all these items together. :D
---
Protip: unequip your gear, get some -stamina if you can, equip it 1 second before pull.

it's been well over 30 minutes, can you please just tell me what kind of griefing you're talking about, because the guy who responded to you before me was talking about player killing which i can address easily
---
[https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Griefing](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Griefing)
---
&gt;Blizzard isn't against griefing behavior when there's a PvP remedy (if you can get together a group of allies to trounce the offending party or simply kill all the mobs quickly, the problem is solved), but when the griever is impossible to attack (is not set PvP, or is of the same faction as his targets), there is no such PvP remedy.
---
[https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/10184](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/10184)

i'm not arguing against verbal harassment. if you're not going to tell me what kind of griefing you are talking about then we can go in circles all day
---
And just plain impossible if you're not a designated guild enchanter since the profitable recipes drop in raids.
---
hell yeah, and the 20 min respawn timer for some questline bosses
---
No, it's better just to take another fury warrior or rogue.
---
I’m not gonna lie, Duskwood is a massive reason why I’m leaning alliance human right now...
---
No, it changed later on. But classic, you'll need to buy then when you are that rank or above, or you lose the opportunity to get them.
---
Don’t have time for this game anymore. Actually basically anyone who started in classic would likely be close to their 30’s right?
---
Absolute classic! Forgot all about this masterpiece
---
Id suggest you add gender choices, because im anti male. They disgust me and id prefere to built friendships with a female player.

Not if its random. Imagine making a badass char that turns out to be a manlet by some wierd visual bug.
---
Good read. My favorite part is when you called it autism, which it is. I want to farm herbs on my main, but if I get a sick worldbuff, now I feel like I can't.
---
This thread is highly amusing. I have my opinion on who will claim more firsts between Method and Non-Method on each Classic phase but regardless this race will be entertaining as hell now that there's an element of drama involved (perception of this being a contest between "Retail" players and "Classic" players).

#Let the games begin!

A private server guild will get the world first rag kill 100% aaaa

W-what is that on the Q and E keys? It looks like coagulated remains of adolescence.

Nope, reread the OP. It’s not just Mages btw

I actually do the far right in IF most of the time, but do use others from time to time.
---
Kind of interesting.  Never thought about it before.
---
it has a 2 seccond cast, curse of agony may be slightly faster to tick however it feels pretty shit when someone tags your mob that you have an instant dot on. Also, at lower levels you have corruption which has a cast time until you talent it or immolate, so from lvl 2-8 immolate is the obvious choice. Maybe later on you could use either corruption or curse of agony and gain .5 of a second and some mana efficiency given Immolate is the least bang for your mana until (if you level affliction) siphon life.
---
Do people really care what their demons names are?
---
It's ganking which is literally just another form of griefing. 
---
I wouldn't exactly call it a fair fight since your guild will most likely have greater numbers and PvP talents/items and the opposing guild most probably will have PvE talents and PvE gear equipped soooo ... ganking.
---
We literally did exactly this in MC and eventually BWL, 14 years ago. It always felt like a gray area, so we didn’t advertise for it the way it’s advertised now, but people knew how to get ahold of us for prices on things.
---
We sold 5 piece tier 1 for 1000, full 8pc for 2000, and we’d bring you to multiple raids to get your stuff.
---
Weapons/trinkets/jewelry were a little more costly.
---
Sometimes buyers ended up being decent players, and we recruited them to the guild
---
Alliance: sexy elf ladies
---
Horde: big strong manly orcs
---
That's what I'm stuck between
---
MC will be cleared in first reset.
---
Oh I don't follow summit so wouldn't have known. But thanks for the suggestion! Will check out the VOD.
---
Bruh all you’re going to prove is everyone else is right lol
---
I think I’ve blocked out a few memories from classic. Like being an underleveled warlock hoping desperately a horde member would find me hiding near SM, or how ridiculous getting to high level professions were.
---
I remember picking a warlock because I didn’t wanna have to buy a mount.
---
The game is unplayable if you go anything but middle, you slack jaws.
---
I'm not sure who you saw talking about PKing, but we're talking about people purposefully being disruptive to other people's RPing.
---
You can do this by spamming in /say, dancing naked in the middle of their group, constantly using items on them as they try to RP, etc...
---
As you quoted:
---
&gt;but when the griever is impossible to attack (is not set PvP, or is of the same faction as his targets), there is no such PvP remedy.
---
Was pretty funny on Nost where for the first time meeting stones didn't summon on a vanilla server. So the forums and chats were littered by players claiming summoning stones were bugged. But no, they didn't summon during vanilla. Actually they put you into a queue for that dungeon, but it didn't work very well and was rarely used. Is rarely used on private servers as well, so basically worthless stones.
---
Nothing like finding a really good tank, healer or whatever and constantly forming groups around them. You eventually get to know people when it’s not so random.
---
What changed: Classic will have higher viewer count than Bfa = i.e moar  dollarz.
---
Yeah I don't think you realize just how seriously method take this game. They literally spent 8+ hours a day for several weeks doing 
---
some of the most mindnumbing content ever in island expeditions, and emptied out the AH's on 3 of the biggest servers in europe, just because it would help them get a slight edge when racing for world first.
---
“I also don’t care about 1v1 scenarios” -  and talks about organized world PvP and BGs. I’m done. Not going to continue arguing on a 2 week old thread because you came late to the party. A huge majority disagree with your points, for good reasons.
---
Follow up, can all classes do this farm?
---
If i remember correctly its a 3 stage HP pool/haste buff. So you have to split your hp into 3rds. Such as 100%-66% you get 10% buff, 33%-66% gives 20% buff and less than 33% gives you the full 30% so what most troll warriors will do is Do a naked gear swap putting them at 50% pop a greater rage pot. Run in get hit by the boss and pop their Berzerker rage ability to give them the full 30% haste increase for the full duration. This helps them slingshot their threat generation through the roof.
---
You would only upgrade leveling related spells and could get away with basically no gear. Which is the complete opposite of how melee work. Not to mention once raiding starts you should be able to make gold selling portals at 40+. Kargath farming on horde side nets a hefty profit at 1g per player (before invited to the group) into a single portal rune. If you are quick you can pop a portal and get 3+ players through driving down your costs further. Park an alt in org near the bank for quick material refresh and relog the mage.
---
Also enchanter alts are 100% viable for mats as there shouldn’t be any level restrictions for disenchanted. Plus it frees up bag space. There’s no reason to go enchanting on a main unless you want raid recipes. As far as I know the big recipes are boe (crusader, lifesteal, +4 chest, fiery, etc) and timbermaw rep can be completed on a level 19 unless that gets changed.
---
Mind you this is outside of the aoe opportunities mages offer for almost every zone after 22(24)+
---
I'm fine with whatever they chose to do as long as I can still play classic if what they decide to do is something I'm not interested in.
---
That's the policy. It's there. It exists for everyone whether on an RP server or not.
---
You are wrong.
---
I played through some Vanilla content and the entire TBC + some WOTLK, before I stopped. 
---
Was in a top 30 EU guild
---
Lady Vashj was a bitch... But somehow, we had a harder time on Magtheridon. I remember over vent "Puuuuuuuush the button you moron"... And then people got knocked back, and failed at pushing the cube... And it was a wipe. :D
---
Black temple was kinda easy compared to Serpenshrine and other content IMO. Had I pause in Sunwell, so cant really remember. :D
---
Played the re-release of Naxx... Was a joke compared to early/mid TBC raids. I didnt play more in vanilla than MC, ZG and AQ20.. So.. I have no idea on that. :D I expect Naxx to be harder/just as hard as mid/late content in TBC. :) I have no idea on how hard todays content is.
---
DEUS VULT
---
Yep, same shit. Two years ago i bought 7700k+480 8gb. During this time i finished only one game, last Doom. Waiting for classic :&lt;
---
But you even if you're tanking you aren't prot spec'd while leveling so technically it's an offspec for you as well. 
---
Would you be upset if the arms warrior told you not to roll on corpsemaker?
---
The last tournament was already very lengthy and this type of format would increase the duration significantly. 
---
There is also not an even distribution of classes. This would cause some people to have to duel more than others. Some people would even have to do duels that don't count for them. More duels means more cooldowns and consumables used, or they would just opt not to use any because it doesn't matter if they lose a filler duel that doesn't count for them.
---
For example you may see mages / druids enter the tournament at a ratio of 4:1. Well all those mages have to duel a druid at least once. That means that those druids are going to have to do extra filler duels against the mages so that everyone can get a duel vs every other class.
---
A question I cannot seem to find an answer to anywhere:  Is there zone scaling in Classic?  I'm all set to come back to WoW if the answer is 'no'.
---
I miss the days when you could run your buddy through SM until that blue dropped for him/her.
---
Who is method?
---
Well done! I like it, looks good too
---
Miss me with that ga* shit m8
---
Apart from nerdgasming rp, alliance trunks horde when it comes to everything apart from maybe nieche orc/ud racials for certain situations
---
I really loved the cata system. You pick one spec and immediately get a powerful ability tied to that spec. I just wish you wouldn't be locked into it.
---
I remember it being extremely negligible.
---
Aye, same bud
---
Lol I'm a knuckle dragger that goes to the right!
---
&gt; I am happy to change my mind about a couple things
---
You have disagreed with every single person who has tried to correct you on every single point, and refuse to concede anything.
---
Just... stop dude.
---
&lt;Escorts of Goldshire&gt;
---
The race for world firsts will be VERY tight even in classic. Minutes in clear times will matter alot.
---
Ya obviously there are going to be a lot of players, but once you are out of the starting zone its no longer a scenario where you will  be having to fight from having every tag taken within a second that the dot ticks is what Im saying lol
---
Thank you for this
---
Yeah, and have you see how well that works out on current RP realms? It doesn't. Everyone says whatever they want. Level 1 alts ruin RP all the time. And Blizzard doesn't give two shits.
---
You're throwing some paragraph in my face as if it's your key to victory when in reality, it does nothing.
---
Yeah sadly as others have correctly stated, pets are very susceptible to AoE damage. Currently in the beta myself and can confirm that my Voidwalker loses its mind often, I’m really hoping it’s a bug. I’ll use a pet attack macro and he’ll attack but sometimes just randomly stop and go passive lol.
---
But why male models?
---
First of May - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-77ElyvRxI nsfw? maybe?
---
&gt;I'm not sure who you saw talking about PKing, but we're talking about people purposefully being disruptive to other people's RPing.
---
ie player killing.
---
nobody is going to prevent a player from walking over or into your character. if they're saying stupid shit in chat you ignore them. if you're worried that the ignore option came after vanilla then don't worry, it was in vanilla 
---
we're talking about playerkilling here, the other guy as well, trust me buddy
---
"haha u dum xd"
---
Nice argument.
---
Saying people have lives now assumes people didn't when Vanilla was out.
---
Sure some people might not be able to play as much as they could back then but other new players will. 
---
People with families did play Vanilla then and can do it now. 
---
You don't need to no-life it to enjoy the game. 
---
There will always be people that have a lot of time for games and for them Classic is perfect, but that doesn't mean they are the only people that will enjoy it.
---
Horde only, get out ♥️
---
Anyone can and should make room for a gathering profession. MT should be (engi + 1) with herb, post 300 engi, being a natural fit. Herb is the lifeblood of any raider since you only need 1-2 alchemist with flask recipes for a guild.
---
It doesnt tag until the first tick of dmg. I usually try and wand the target if I'm competing for a tag or if you set your pet to aggressive 9/10 they get the target tagged while its phasing into the screen
---
Guilds that kill only will know about the buff. It might become an issue once pugs start running, but the public lynching that will occur after it happens once will be enough to keep people in check. Those noobies would probably just turn it in instantly after raid, which is fine anyway since the cd will be up for the next days raids.
---
Imagine not playing an orc or undead.
---
That's not what complexity means though.
---
Complex or complicated means that something consists of several interconnected parts. Higher number of interconnected parts, means more complex. 
---
I argree with you that the modern talent system is better in a lot of ways, especially when it comes to allowing for variety of play. But it is not more complex.
---
Whether its difficult or easy to choose the "best" talent, neither increases or decreases the talent trees complexity.
---
Complexity does not equal quality, or difficulty.
---
So, every one of them will be either rogue or druid?
---
Ya auto attack is what I’ve been doing in the beta in the beginner zones. Definitely the best way imo
---
Darkmoon faire and Darkmoon faire trinkets don't release until [phase 3](https://www.wowhead.com/news=290629/staggered-classic-content-update-six-phases-up-from-four-to-address-itemization-)
---
Darkmoon Deck: Blue Dragon is a reward for completing the beast deck. The decks don't start dropping before phase 3 so you can't do anything about that.
---
For the orb you can start stockpiling items for tickets. Not really sure what would be the best items to stockpile, but you can check the full list [here](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19182#reward-of)

Warlock leveling with reliance on Voidwalker to tank and wands to kill: https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=warlock&amp;talents=DpDqDrDsDtDwDxDyCyCzCACBCCCGCHBSBTBUBVBWCICTCYCfCgCJCKD4CNCMCUCVCWCOCPCQCRCSDkDlDzDHDIDJDKCXDRDSDTDADB
---
Indeed. I have no idea how to fix that though. In Cata they reduced the talent trees a bit and gave you talent points every few levels instead of every level. That seemed to work. Imagine if we had vanilla-wotlk type talents today, they would be huge and probably filled with nonsense. Also how do even try to balance it? Maybe the best way would be to do like Cataclysm, just reduce it down and give points more rarely.
---
Good question.
---
I can add Linken boomerang, which isn't "everyone should" but may win you a PvP fight if you're lucky.
---
There's an LBRS quest that gives OP trinkets (Blackhand's Breadth is one of them), but you'd find it in any preraid BiS guide for proper class. 
---
Your ST class quest is worth mentioning.
---
Juju quest.
---
Priests, Shamans, Hunters with tranq shot (you need to farm a dungeon for the spell at 60), Warriors with shield, Warlock's fellhunter and Doomguard. 
---
Those are all the magic removing options in the game with Priests having the most potent one (that can even remove stuff like Ice Block, Banish, and Divinie Shield).
---
Everything I’m reading say it’s about equal to your primary stat while leveling, the drawback is it won’t help you in wpvp.
---
Which is why them being mechanically more skilled isn't important, what matters is the knowledge and experience they're lacking.
---
Sadly this is beyond true. I really am getting sick of the anti streamer posts and shit like that or talking about how this community is becoming toxic. It is only toxic because people are breeding the toxicity.
---
Leveled every class to 60.
---
Looted a million gold.
---
I am pretty sure you have never played vanilla.
---
Barrens westfall loch modan tirisfall..all od those zones are gonna be crowded as shit and youre gonna have to fight for every single tag.
---
I reckon youre gonna have easier time leveling in some of the more desolate zones but the more popular ones are gonna be a bitch if they keep original respawn timers
---
Method *are* neckbeards. Well, metaphorically. They have been contenders for WF for years now and will *literally* throw £40 per character for an entire raid at the screen just for one gear piece advantage on the other faction.
---
You mean like everyone here shits on people for wanting to min max because that’s what they have fun doing?  
---
The hypocrisy of this sub is insane. 
---
“Don’t shit on people that don’t agree with how you think, but we can shit on people because duh”
---
If you think it’s different, it’s not.
---
Your helmet loose? I responded...
---
I'm with you &lt;3
---
Spoiler: They'll just buy the P-Server players and claim it as "their" WF. 
---
You can have as much dedication as you want, when other people have 10 years of experience with the same content you will still be behind.
---
But if you're prot spec in a dungeon whilst levelling, you're going to be prot spec. Unless you want to spend 50G every time you want to do a dungeon?
---
Same. Still don't know what I want. I've always been alliance so want to go horde. On horde I'd play an orc hunter, but I just really like the class fantasy of a paladin and my favourite zone is duskwood, which being a holy warrior makes it even more epic.
---
I remember deliberately speccing into Shadowburn early on as a warlock on crowded pservers to give me a dedicated tagging tool for higher value (quest, rare) mobs, plus a ez way to finish mobs. It means having to forego a lot of things most people consider completely necessary as warlock (instant cast corruption) but I found it saved me a lot of time waiting around for quest mobs.
---
BOLVAR!!
---
&gt;	on the other hand being able to hit those mages/locks/hunters from further away sounds like a great thing especially cuz they are the classes with which warriors struggle the most
---
What if i told you a warrior still will want to hit a mage (and any of those classes) when you’re not in a 1v1?
---
😱😱😱😱😱
---
And most of the Beta aka not this reddit circlejerk aka the people actually testing this stuff out agree they’d rather have Taurens range than Orc’s stun resist. 
---
Sodapoppin literally said that he doesn’t bother trying to kite Tauren Warriors anymore because the range is so broken. Imagine that - Druid, a Warrior hare counter, giving up kiting.
---
Anyway, I’ve done the research. All you’ve done is read reddit comments based on private server theory testing and are falling back on “well the majority told me X is right so it has to be right!”
---
Take care
---
OP is also disrespecting female UD animations and T H I C C female orc models, so it evens out I guess
---
People who say “yikes” are just as bad imo lol
---
Ironforge &gt; Horde
---
And private servers didn't contain 100% of the "best" players.
---
Because launching the server will have the same inherent login and authentication server issues, and maybe even queues to log in, that have plagued the company at almost every wow expansion launch. Their track record isn't exactly stellar at this.
---
Spending 8h+ every day every month doing mindnumbing grinds is something a big portion of the P-Server players already do and did for several years.
---
Classic World Firsts are about knowing where and how to find best gear and being efficient with clearing the instances.
---
It's not "who manages to finally down the boss after thousands of attempts", it's "who gets enough gear, clears the trash and gets to the boss first"
---
The skill overlap with mythic raiding is pretty much none.
---
I'm excited for vanilla like the rest of us. And retail leveling for sure needs some work, but you still have that feeling of looking forward to skills and talent points in retail.
---
You don't get a talent point every level no, but you get a new ability or spell pretty regularly as you level and that tends to feel more impactful than vanilla talents often do. Also you still get to look forward to when you do get talents to choose which are typically just as impactful (the argument can be made MORE impactful) as key vanilla talents. 
---
Im well aware you also unlocked new spells/spell ranks and abilities in vanilla as well. 
---
But with vanilla talents there's a bunch of them that are very small incremental increases that aren't super noticable point by point. While I admit it DOES feel good every level to at least get something to put in your tree and feel like your advancing, you're still only really "looking forward" to a few key talents in your build....probably 4 or 5 or 6 key talents..essentially as many as retail's current number of total talents.
---
They both end up boiling down to cookie cutter builds because there's always going to be one build that is at least slightly better than the rest and min maxers will pick that build along with anyone else who Google's "best talents for warrior dps".
---
But..if you don't care about having the "best" build there is a decent amount of variety in retail talents. Some of them have a pretty big impact on your rotation and play style. And honestly most of them (I can't say all because I haven't done all the research but i'd be willing to bet all) are usable in raid content or dungeons, even mythic+
---
And obviously they weren't implemented as well as they could be, but azurite some azurite abilities also can have a fairly decent impact on your moment to moment gameplay experience. More so if again, you don't care about min maxing. But...this is kind of off topic now haha.
---
&gt; Because it requires very detailed knowledge of every single pull in there.
---
No, it doesn't. *Mechanically*, the bosses in classic were trivial. It was the logistics and resistance gear that made it difficult. Mechanics like Living Bomb and the egg mechanic in BWL would be *trivial normal* level in today's retail. These people frequently raid content that throws a dozen mechanics at them, each as deadly as the next one.
---
You can have cross faction friends or just pay Alliance and many guilds will have extra accounts for multi boxing purposes.
---
More choices = more complex,more versions of builds.What you would call complex then?
---
Because, to make world first, Method isn't going to meet some of those gear checks. Thus, they have to be knowledagble about those fights and pulls to mitigate that.
---
Exactly this. Holy paladin is what I’m leaning right now...
---
Who cares?  You can look down on me while I’m tea bagging your dead body after I just killed you using my consumables.
---
Don’t like it?  Put more time into your character so you’re on my level, filthy casual.
---
The only exception for me personally is in duels.  No point in burning all that gold in a duel in my opinion, and I’d prefer it was a fair 1 v 1 fight.  If other players want to go all out for a duel, more power to them I guess.
---
How to explain it.... It's original would of Warcraft so nothing new pre B.C people just a reminder
---
Wait. You can turn pvp on on a PVE server?
---
Why would you not use every tool available to you to win a BG?
---
Duels are different because you don't get anything out of winning it's just there to test who is better in 1v1.
---
First time going up to SM is always a treat. 
---
"Oh what's this place?" 
---
"Hi spirit healer..."
---
Isn't there a boat?
---
Free level 40 mount and a lot less downtime though. I wouldn't discard locks just yet.
---
might as well link the right timestamp: https://youtu.be/J_4YwvfEls4?t=409
---
Shamans and Druids are my favorite. I like the theme of being in tune with the elements and nature and stuff. I love healing but can't bring myself to play Priest because the holy stuff doesn't do it for me.
---
Oh I have, I didn’t say these achievements were possible by everyone. Saying one million was a bit silly, but 100,000 seemed silly too considering the gold cap.
---
They are releasing Classic at the exact same time so what makes you think they'll release patches with time between?
---
Just pay the guild GRIZZLY for their members. That guild pretty much gets every single server first on every private server.
---
You can't heal or buff mobs like that in the Classic Beta. I tried.
---
BTW I hate this dude. His videos rule but my god there are SO many copycats doing this now.
---
Purge tho
---
Which mobs aren't flagged as part of the alliance? Even the kul tiras in durotar is in norrthdale... Is that correct?
---
Wonderful post, but illidan isn't vanilla.
---
I'll give you $10 for it.
---
I mean, at least they had the ability to literally just sit around in a city and sell portals for no work at all.
---
Yep that's on my list already, will let you know.
---
Or they will actually plan *with* p-server players and have them show the ropes.
---
Don't underestimate the amount of resources Method is willing to throw at this. And time is also a resource.
---
Same.
---
Cant compete with setting hs to a leveling area and porting yourself to cities when needed.
---
Also hunters will have grinded more than enough gole to make free mount obsolete by the time they hit 40
---
Google it if you've been using the same addons since then and plan to use the auction house from early on since it can definitely give you an edge.
---
That never happened lol
---
Live to win!
---
The meme where it was this is my favorite subreddit and then /r/classicwow was the drunk guy. Struck home way too hard with me it made me sad.
---
Oi bruv
---
Yea, I've seen lots of videos with warlocks using Corruption and even Immolate and Syphon Life, even in AQ/Naxx... Funny how many clueless people there were.
---
If you consider rolling lock again, I suggest you to think how you DPS this time :)
---
Oozo, rogue showing hemo build -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHrFh8Z70xc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHrFh8Z70xc)
---
Agreed, the dungeon finder Violently beat the community into the ground.
---
Cross-realm killed it.
---
And the Raid-Finder put the nail in it's coffin.
---
Someone high up must have a raging hate boner for rppvp realms. There can be no other explanation. This reeks of pure spite.
---
Lul
---
 - Wand    
---
 - Shadowburn (level 20)     
---
 - Send your pet after the next mob    
---
 - Drain Life (1 sec damage interval means it is equivalent to a 1 second cast, which is shorter than shadowbolt/searing pain/immolate)
---
&gt; Thus, they have to be knowledagble about those fights and pulls to mitigate that.
---
Again: fights are *trivial* compared to retail mythic. Having a living bomb mechanic or a decurse won't even challenge their reflexes one bit.
---
This gonna make the last 2 hours of my worktime alot better, thanks Josh!  
---
Love your show, cheers from Norway
---
You really think the guy that bought a star destroyer for $2000 wont have an advantage over the guy with a $20 piece of junk? Cmon
---
2 hours before raid clear DM, rotate 1-2 instances before raid time with mages porting people to org, zep ride &amp; raid log at ZG island until called on discord, pop heart, port to org, pop head, hearth to kargath. Tryhards had songflower with a summon to zg.
---
Similar process for ally flying sw to burning steppes. Which typically is just lotus farmers by the time raiding gets serious.
---
Not much difference,
---
I expect to hopefully see a slight pumping of the breaks on these AP systems they've fallen in love with since Legion, and hopefully a return to more WotLK-Mists systems ala pvp vendors and raid token vendors. The latter is already evident with their catch up vendor mechanic introducing in 8.2
---
A FW dwarf priest masterrace can take that role doe
---
Maintenance has always been done on different days in the US and EU. BFA had a simultaneous worldwide launch but US still gets each raid one day earlier.
---
Well, they only got a few months to learn how to speed level vs people who've been doing it for years.
---
Yes, they were mechanically trivial, which is why mechanical skill isn't going to decide wf, what's going to decide wf is knowing which packs to pull, which packs to invis skip, etc.
---
Neither the ones in mulgore or the ones in the barrens were flagged.
---
[Barrens example](https://youtu.be/XAHWk939VlQ?t=431)
---
You're not a man, 'til you've had a man.
---
Between those three:
---
1:paladin
---
2:mage
---
3:priest
---
The general wisdom seems to be if you can get over the weak points of paladin you should play it because they're actually really fun and useful especially in pvp
---
Higher gear levels you want more disc than holy. PI is incredible for as many caster dps as you can get it on. Holy gives you nothing in the bottom tiers of the spec.
---
Tanking in a raid would be a dream, and hopefully I can try a bit of it, but I'm fine with healing as well. I'm mostly just looking forward to Pali tanking 5-man's on my journey to 60, and hopefully for a while at 60.
---
Not sure about skeletons but corpses lasted for ages, didnt they? A friend of mine told me he logged in after like 10 years and found out his corpse in Badlands almost became a local tourist attraction.
---
some diggas that you don't wanna try!(my diggas)  
---
some diggas that really dig or die! (my diggas)
---
Your presence in the raid will be a net loss in DPS, since you'll be using two debuff slots, one of which is a small DoT and another that has no effect in most raids.
---
Back in Vanilla, 13yo me always hoped they would add playable Centaur, Naga and Goblins as a third neutral faction.
---
Yeah but I imagine people AFKing made a huge problem. What if the tank goes afk for a while or the priest healer? Human factor, bound to happen.
---
&gt; I dont know how long it takes for curse of agony to tick    
---
2 seconds.
---
The 25% stun resist is huge. Especially on warriors who can talent up another 15%.
---
&gt; The skill overlap with mythic raiding is pretty much none.
---
It's the *dedication* they are bringing. What they lack in hands on experience from back in the day will for sure be supplemented by all of them spending weeks reading up, testing stuff on P-Servers and preparing for this.
---
Graphics aren't changed. Our computers just aren't fucking potatoes. Raid finder isn't in the game. Layering is only for the first few weeks to deal with heavy population. Blizzard are definitely sucking on streamer titties, though.
---
NEXT.
---
Pls mage next:D
---
People that consider being "tryhard" bad are just salty they lose everything and want their stupid retail restrictions.
---
Those god damn tryhards using keybinds fuq em bleergh derp.
---
They haven't given many details, unsure if it's just reserve names on servers, which can be done on a web site, or full-fledged character creation, which obviously would require a login to the server.
---
I prefer horde after playing Warcraft 3, but the early alliance zones are 1000x better than the horde zones. Elwynn, Westfall, Redridge and Duskwood feel like actual storylines.
---
They don’t want to if you don’t get fame though.  This is an easy win for method
---
Thanks mate
---
Speedrunning is really the only hardcore mode left for Classic.
---
Which is why you should roll Horde. We get totems AND blessings.
---
Locks can do it as well. Although in Classic you can’t log out and back in to get ported to the instance entrance like you can on private servers which is a pretty big difference in gold/hour.
---
Heartily disagree. M+ is a cool concept, but wow is the wrong game for it. Its just one of a hundred things that have been added since classic that progressively removed the RPG from MMORPG.
---
Thanks for being with the show from early on mate, so glad to hear you’re still enjoying the ride!
---
I will copy another comment I made:
---
*They are a very dedicated group of players. They will undoubtedly be  preparing this for weeks by talking to P-Server players, testing out strategies, reading up on EVERY piece of theorycrafting and make gear tables for resistance gear.*
---
That is their level of dedication to a WF.
---
no thats a steak knife
---
I remember farming stockade on my alliance rogue and making a killing. Lots of boe blues from there.
---
Something that didn’t occur to me until recently was that I have never played horde. I’m looking to play vanilla as I knew it, but playing horde will be a total brand new experience with less nostalgia. But then again, playing horde will be totally brand new. Tough choice still.
---
I love pve servers but this is laughably inaccurate. It's like you've never play but you say that so authoritatively...
---
I see OP's point. You can spend 12 hours farming herbs to make flasks and pots and consumes and whatnot, but that single worldbuff you let expire while farming would still be better than all of the consumes you earned in those 12 hours. Worldbuffs are just too good.
---
Another one on the "Not A Bug" list, then.
---
&gt;What if i told you a warrior still will want to hit a mage (and any of those classes) when you’re not in a 1v1?
---
I don't see how that changes anything. He's still asking for organized PvP and BGs, not 1v1s. He's asking for the overall strength of racials.
---
&gt;And most of the Beta aka not this reddit circlejerk aka the people actually testing this stuff out agree they’d rather have Taurens range than Orc’s stun resist.  
---
&gt;Sodapoppin literally said that he doesn’t bother trying to kite Tauren Warriors anymore because the range is so broken. Imagine that - Druid, a Warrior hare counter, giving up kiting.  
---
&gt;Anyway, I’ve done the research. All you’ve done is read reddit comments based on private server theory testing and are falling back on “well the majority told me X is right so it has to be right!”
---
All I see here is anecdotal evidence at best, and while every other person on this thread have done the same, it doesn't suddenly make your opinion better or more valid. I've watched Monkeynews, Perplexity, Steezy, Payo and various other 'top tier' players in Vanilla say they're surprised of the Tauren hitbox, and they do think it's a factor in 1v1s, but matter way less in BGs and organized PvP where you're thrown stuns left and right and got freedoms, LIP and so forth.
---
For all I know, you could be the person sitting on Reddit trying to be controversial about racials and what's best, just because you can. Meanwhile I could be the one having done the "research".
---
If anything, you should've stayed on topic, instead of trying to insult me and my opinion which seemingly plenty of people share, for good reason.
---
&gt;Take care
---
You too.
---
Yes, and they will World first Rag with 12 druids and 28 rogues. Duh.
---
 &gt;Blessings
---
Scuse me there m8?
---
And, *again*, it's not about knowing the mechanics. Any 10 year old kid can do the mechanics *corrrectly*. It's about doing them *optimally*. Not meeting the gear requirements means every one of your fights is on the healer's OOM timer. Not to mention that they cannot change raid composition easily to cheese fights like they can on retail.
---
I'm not doubting at all that speedrunners are going to get ridiculously fast times on Classic, they will make the old times look like a complete joke.
---
but that run in the pic was not on an official server and is therefore disqualified IMO.
---
5% attack speed and +60fire damage (stackable up to five times)
---
All hunters should have both to be honest, for certain fights it’s invaluable and trinket swapping after 30secs is just a macro
---
Yes, wonder if they can stick around in the Classic world where hardcore progress itself takes mere hours...
---
Well, speedrunning is always an option to create your own hardcore content.
---
For nihilum, Kungen has an injury that makes it hard to play wow right now I believe.  (I read this a couple months ago so it could be good now)
---
&gt;Concerning parry, you get a reset from your main hand timer, so it's always interesting to have for threat.
---
Oh shit really? I always thought that was just an NPC feature, I didn't realize players benefit from parries in that way as well
---
Curse of reck is pure gold in human based dungeons. Open world you kite out fear-able mobs knowing they’ll run at some point. With enough distance to prevent chaining you’ll effectively cut a mobs hp by the fear cutoff.
---
I played horde in vanilla but was honestly too retarded at the time to understand differences etc. 
---
I now play alliance. 
---
In PvE - alliance has it easier. Hands down. Salvation is just god tier. Will be even more important with the 14% parry information. 
---
In PvP - horde usually has the edge. Better PvP oriented radials, a significant population is undead - which basically negates an entire class on the alliance side and shamans being offensive tends to attract more PvP focused individuals. 
---
Behavioral differences...
---
Things I’ve noticed on private servers between the two factions. Alliance is, in general, the type that would rather watch you get ganked and then steal your quest mob, herb, etc than help you win the fight. Aka gigantic fucking self serving assholes in the questing environment. They are gigantic fucking pussies with an awful mindset of running rather than helping.  
---
Horde on the other hand is quite the opposite. A typical scenario is some dog shit undead rogue opens up on an alliance player fighting a mob - still somehow manages to lose the fight - spams the general chat that they are being camped - and sure enough 9 fucking 60’s are there to help. So horde def seems more willing to help out their brain dead players than alliance. 
---
Alliance have better cities by far. Horde cities are just straight trash. Especially without a mount. 
---
Being closer to BRM is quite the perk for alliance as well. 
---
Horde has warchiefs blessing. 
---
Horde’s races are better overall imo.
---
Horde I believe has more quests and overall is slightly the better speed leveling faction iirc. The exception being the first 20 levels as darkshore is just amazing. 
---
Depends on what you want. 
---
On a fresh server - no reason to not go alliance imo. 
---
On a developed server - go horde or your leveling time will take twice as long. 
---
If you are playing on a pve server just uninstall wow. Lol
---
I still really enjoy certain console games because it's more relaxing to sit back on a couch with a controller. 
---
But I will say that WoW Classic is going to be the first PC game in a while that has roped me back in and as a result I did buy a new $1,300 PC. 
---
Obviously I didn't need a new rig to play it, but it's more about the reliability of a newer system for long hours, multiple screens for looking up guides, managing music, etc.
---
I haven't been this pumped for a game in a while so I had to splurge a bit!
---
The Guilds pushing for server firsts would never tolerate that.
---
The Guild I was in was just barely getting to Ragnaros. So…
---
You're the best around
---
Pick up Witcher 3. That shit is so good.
---
But doesn’t party reset the auto attack timer making parry very strong for threat / rage?
---
&gt; you really think people are arguing against very clear harassment terms of service guidelines???
---
&gt;we're talking about playerkilling here, the other guy as well, trust me buddy
---
I understand where you're coming from, but please look at my other thread with /u/BeethovenTheMage. He is not talking about PKing, he is explicitly talking about harassing behavior.
---
&gt;Because again, everyone has the right to whatever fun they see fit.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;You have the right to RP to your heart's content.
---
&gt;RPsuxlol has the right to ruin your RP to his heart's content.
---
&gt;It's not my fault your rights are so easily trampled by his rights. That's your fault for putting your measure of fun in something so &gt;fragile.
---
&gt;There is no equal rights protection in WoW.
---
Gelkis and it’s not even close. The arrows/bullets as that quest reward is a pretty quick way to make 5g or give them to your alt to have a blast leveling them up. They don’t have a level requirement and do like 9dps.
---
I've had that discussion with different guilds and you get variable results from people. The more contributions given overall to the guild by a person, the more they feel the need to have a say in strats, gear, etc. 
---
The best thing that seemed to work was GM bank alt taking in donations or various requests and using the AH to supply. Also, guild enchanter selling shards, etc from useless gear in raids. 
---
Now, some of the BEST guilds do well to do their part.. but you know any long term guild has politics and that was the answer that solved most of it.
---
What is this... a playlist for ants? The list needs to be at least 3 times as long!
---
You played a naked warrior at 60 with no gathering professions as well I see
---
I imagine 15-20k people leveling on one singular server would be much more difficult than layering. Layering makes leveling way easier. You won't see anything like that with classic
---
They send a paladin to the outside of the dungeon, mind control it, and cast blessings on the horde raid to prepare for these record speedrun vanilla raids.
---
You know it's a mix of smegma and cheeto dust, why would you even bring it up?
---
Go Horde if you want raiding to be harder. In return you get better racials for PvP
---
Oh that’s a neat trick! Never thought of that.
---
No flying mounts, no dungeon finder, and NORTH AMERICAN PING.
---
Another great listen  and just happened to  e running brd on a private realm at the time.
---
And again: they won't have to.
---
What they will do is make a *detailed list* of things to do that everyone *has* to stick to in order to raid with them. Find a good balance of classes for MC. Find X pieces of resistance gear at Y. Get Z consumables. 
---
They will *absolutely* make sure to do them optimally on a level that would put your average neckbeard to shame. I am telling you that they will dedicate the next two and a half months to going through hundreds of hours of collective research to do this.
---
I blame Tips tbh
---
The first one was pre-Naxx, and prior to a *lot* of itemization changes. Hardly surprising a Naxx geared guild exploiting world buff mechanics could beat a patch 1.10.0/June 06 record...   
---
So less that "times" have changed, and more that MC itself was substantially trivialized after that.
---
That makes it so freaking hard. Not to mention I like enough classes to make that choice hard as well (orc hunter, undead shadow priest, human paladin, gnome mage is my short list)
---
Great idea
---
6int/9sta/2spi
---
We remember this stuff from leveling tons of alts in Vanilla-WotlK and then again on private servers.
---
Isn’t it humanoids only?
---
I know what their dedication is, but they're still battling people who have been putting in years of dedication, even if they're more dedicated at the moment, that experience isn't something you can just read and discuss yourself to, ask ANY method player and they will tell you that practice is important, how many practice runs do you think Gingi did to ensure his WF 120?
---
&gt; I plan on playing pve too. But I'm curious what the ratio will be. The majority of posts on the subject seem to indicate pvp. The guild recruitment threads seem to be filled with an overwhelming number of pvp guilds. It's really interesting to try and guess how it will be. I still think pve will be bigger by a lot. But the pvp crowd is certainly making themselves known.
---
Like many things on this sub, folks think that the pserver experience = Vanilla/ClassicWoW.
---
Back in the day and continuing until the removal of "server types," PvE servers held the bigger half majority of WoW's population.  You largely see posts about PvP servers here because that's, essentially, been the only type offered in the pserver scene.
---
OP is putting together a meme spec raid. I automatically assumed they’d never get any gear.
---
How much for a half n half?
---
It was definitely looked at as a butch move. 
---
For example, if you’re in a big and the guy you’re killing pots, you would hear people to “ohhhhh bitch had to use a potion just to kill me”
---
Obviously it’s part of the game and you can play however you want, but it definitely made people think less of you and almost nullified your kills.
---
There isn’t really a story in classic. It’s just random disjointed lore.
---
I haven’t played any other game apart from d3 from that genre. And d3 was so awful that I had to force myself to play it and finish the campaign.  I really couldn’t understand the hype and how people play it until now, I tried it again for a while when they unlocked all difficulties and the torment ones, finished it on torment 3 and that was it, never looked back to that awful game. But the worst part is that current WoW has borrowed many things from that awful game.
---
I forget how much gold it cost to change specs but I did it twice a day. My Warrior was Arms during the day to farm and then Protection in the evening to tank raids.
---
Those are tantamount to troll posts since, when challenged, they do not back up their accusation. It's just a general complaint from complainers. There is a personality type: 
---
*"Someone should do something so that I feel happier!"*
---
Frankly I'm surprised that the mods allow people to post that way. It would be one thing if they pulled some quotes from a recent thread or had a word cloud example as evidence but, from what I've seen, it's just general whining. 
---
*"I feel a certain way and the way I feel is angry. Fuck you!"* 
---
Well okay then. Thanks for posting that in this subreddit that I enjoy so that I had to see it. It definitely made the place a bit worse.
---
Found the Tauren.
---
1 AV weekend and you should be exalted. I doubt serious rankers will run anything but premades for any BG weekends. Though I generally dislike the vanilla ranking system which rewards a no life no job gameplay style.
---
&gt; I am telling you that they will dedicate the next two and a half months to going through hundreds of hours of collective research to do this.
---
No one is arguing that, but they're still competing with people who have thousands if not tens of thousands of hours of experience and research behind them.
---
Ill add i remember that one!
---
I feel like there is some irony in this post somehow...
---
I don't remember this one as well you know if it was memorable at the time?
---
Exactly,a planned nieche thing, not a rule you should follow when determining race/faction
---
Female tauren master race reporting in
---
Not in-game.     
---
There was "loremaster" addons that literally contained a list of every quest and you could "check" them off. But would likely need to be re-made from scratch for Classic.
---
As someone who has done both things, not really.
---
Grinding to 14 is not nearly as braindead as doing island expeditions, and it's also for a far greater reward (bis weapons) at the end. What grinding island expeditions does is give you a few ilvls on your neck (basically meaningless), and a minor defensive trait, which 99% of the time is also going to be meaningless.
---
Sexy strong orc women?
---
There are no achievements, nor is there a way to track in game. If you wanted to track your quests though, I'm sure a completionist addon will be made soon after launch for people just like you.
---
I agree i mean i can take some of those ones out i want it mainly focused at vanilla
---
Consider that this is the second highest parsing ret on the overall rankings. He is only above three low percentile player: a hunter (mandatory low dps), shadow priest (mandatory buff for warlocks) and an exceptionally poorly played warlock. I can only assume they brought 4 tanks or something because a fury warrior doing less than 500 dps in Naxx is worse than an LFR player. Also, this is not a 40 man raid in case that wasn't obvious.
---
Regardless, it was a random example to show how to navigate the website for yourself and not the crux of my argument.
---
&lt;No Totem Left Behind&gt;
---
I just wanna be a bloodfang kitted out rogue with some decent daggers 😁
---
Yeah but they’re not the majority of guilds. I’m talking about regular people guilds who raid without being competitive.
---
Oh ok. What I've noticed and it's consistent with what I remember from 2005 is that as I gain levels the mobs start dodging and parrying a lot more. I don't think the leveling experience is completely linear but more like a curve. Aggro ranges also seem to be effected by my level or even the level difference between me and the mob. I'm pulling way more nearby mobs now than I did in the early levels.
---
Dynamic respawns weren't really much of a surprise since they weren't there back vanilla.
---
The bag issue was something I knew for a long time was wrong with private servers, possibly on purpose. Bags were always a big deal in vanilla.
---
Some caster mobs do less damage, some of them are really painful. It depends on the mob.
---
He is also bipolar, and known to just go offline for months at a time.
---
Like the guild I was in
---
X•D
---
They need to mention that raids go to 40 and that you can't interact with people not on your realm.
---
I'm currently writing an addon to create your lore story after creating a char, that also guides you through it (e.g. Seven human Kingdoms and how you could originate from one of them, Great Wars ofc, less known events like Gurubashi War for those RPing as 60+ year-olds, etc).
---
Also, plan to highlight the more important zones/dungeons (if you're a Wildhammer dwarf, don't forget to /sigh in proximity of the cursed Grim Batol, etc).
---
I was thinking about adding generic popup zone lore too. And of tracking the progress.
---
Right now it's in a prealpha state though, a lot of texts to edit or write... And my English is so primitive :( Only good for writing long reddit comments, eh.

---
How long do you think it will take method to acquire all relevant knowledge for a classic raid? 12 - 17 hours, we are not talking about calculus
---
Bam, that sounds all really promising. Keep it up! I am working full time but do you need help somewhere?
---
No. Part of the fun of classic is doing shit because it was just fun to do. Not because you got a piece of gear or a mount or an achievement from it.
---
Does the pserver guys also have the dedicated server fanboys? Method is like a mega streamer colleboration.
---
No, mind controlling a Paladin doesn’t work. You have to have an Alliance priest mind control the raid and cast a blessing on each member individually. That player then zones in and logs out until everyone’s blessed and ready to go.
---
I think anyone level 45-50+ or so should have an equal vote on things.
---
I think that's similar to OSRS's voting requirement in term of skills.
---
100% waste of time to do this.
---
Who would have thought spreadsheets and economic growth =/= fun games
---
But atleast you can buy lvl 100 because these new game devs "understand" you dont have enough time to play games

Awesome job, coming along nicely.

Suggestion: validate the URL's on parse.

Keep in mind, this was purely done from the 1-10 human starting zone perspective. As the video maker does not have access to the beta, and was purely doing comparisons to a/some videos of someone leveling on classic.
---
How? It was at pre patch WotLK and the game was thriving then.
---
Oh I thought you said you were done here, ok then. 
---
&gt;I don't see how that changes anything. He's still asking for organized PvP and BGs, not 1v1s. He's asking for the overall strength of racials.
---
Even in BGs you're still getting kited by these classes.
---
&gt;doesn't suddenly make your opinion better or more valid
---
Ok, then by contrast the the majoritarian argument also doesnt make yours more valid. 
---
Because I've done this research I'll go ahead and give you the best piece of info to back up what your position and what actually makes Orcs racial OP: Grenades. Every class can throw them and stun you. Besides Paladin/Rogues who deeply rely on stuns in their kits, no class really depends strongly on Stuns but they all can still use them and then use them again with grenades. 
---
In PvP Tauren and Orc are both incredible. In PvE, Orc are strictly better.

i mean if they are running full memes, then yeah probably not lol My guild will be running the trifecta of memes 1 Feral tank as tank 3, Enhancement shaman for main tank group/nightfall swinger and shadow priest because we have 7 warlocks signed up in our guild currently.
---
Difficulty of raids is laughable. Like I said, the only hardcore mode left is speedrunning and Horde have every advantage there.
---
Hop into dungeon groups with whatever you have.
---
As a naked mage you'll be fine to do everything pre-raid.
---
Raiding is easier as horde....
---
I don't believe they should be disallowed...I'm just saying the only argument against it is that this wasn't really that core to the experience so if they decided to remove or nerf it in some way it wouldn't negatively impact the OG feel much if at all.
---
Priest + Paladin always make for a deadly combo in support. The priests shuts down casters with fearward, dispell, silence and manaburn while the paladin handles the melees with stuns, BoP and Sacrifice. 
---
I really need to get the good old skullforge reaver back, just for that sweet 30sec DoT. No bandages, no stealth resets just a proper and fair endurance match between a plate armored healer and a chump with two pocket knives in bondage clothing who wonders why is pocketsand, gouge and sap get ignored.
---
Go directly to dungeons - you should have decent enough gear from quests to be a-okay :)
---
I never said casual plebs should consider it, but if you’re a speed runner, you’re shooting yourself in the foot by not rolling Horde.
---
You can tank 5 mans while leveling as arms or fury. You don't need to be prot spec. In fact anyone who knows anything about vanilla warriors will tell you to never go prot until at or near 60. 
---
This isn't retail where the dungeon finder won't let you join a group as a tank because you aren't prot.
---
She probly just had a very bad moment, she be back :P
---
Ah that explains it. 1-10 is indeed easy, after that it starts to ramp up.
---
That's nice to hear haha. Thank you! Time to find myself a preraid bis list, write it down and tape it next to my monitor!

You can with a minimum of preparation: a raid with you and an alt in, switch char, reset instances.

At least I have proven that there are joke worse than dad jokes.  Let's just pretend I did it for science.

I doubt you're going to pull that off in anything but an uber-hardcore guild but gl!
---
The thing is I plan on doing pretty much only Aoe grinding leveling. Therefor I'll probably only have boe greens and if really lucky a rare blue!
---
Tons of people also level at prot for aoe pulls. Especially when farming in groups. 
---
Also I'm aware. I've been playing since 2006 bruh.
---
Yeah, I wasn’t talking about PKing, I was talking about getting to say whatever you want and Blizzard not doing a damn thing about it, “harassment” in the EULA or not.
---
An ingame poll would be nice. Just so that everyones voice is equal. 
---
They probably have to add some requirements before you can actually vote in the poll
---
Lets pretend for a second that they acquire all relevant knowledge in that amount of time, they're still missing the practice.
---
Great work Josh! Keep it up man! Your podcasts make my daily commute a lot less boring! I’m sure there’s hundreds of other players in the same boat as me but I hope I get the opportunity to play with you sometime!

If you are planning to be casual in both PvP and pve I wouldn't worry to much about what progression you get. You can achieve all you want just fine without engineering. If you feel you need the extra edge in PvP then yeah, engi will give you that.
---
Ah okay, I was just assumed because you said your friend went out for lunch in 8th grade. Haven't heard of many schools in the US that allow that. I had to wait until senior year before we were allowed to leave school grounds to go to lunch
---
Looking at this thread I see the very opposite of this taking place.
---
Fair enough. My experience with French was Canadian grade school, so I don't remember a whole lot of the specifics. I was mostly explaining how I heard/said the word from an "English person trying to say a French word" perspective
---
Yeah same, and it sucked not being able to play with them anymore (BG and Open PVP, mostly)..
---
It won't be out unless you are levelling slow as molasses
---
I think a role playing pvp server would be fun but I know roughly 60% of the players would never role play
---
Their downvotes only serve to prove my point.

Yup.

I think if method takes it seriously it will be alot easier than you think, I mean they have soooooo much footage they can learn the fights and step in there.no problem. We get it, you are a pserver player, but the calibre of player highly favors method here

The STV music all the way from 1 to 60...

Our kel kill was on the 10th of October 2006, #20 worldwide if im not mistaken.
---
Besides fighting the stupid taunt resist on 4HM you could bring 60% of slackers and kill it and the same goes for most, compensated by the rest doing more.
---
In TBC if you brought 30% of slackers you werent going any further and we struggled immensely with that. 
---
People we played with for years that were just fine from bwl to naxxramas were suddenly just not good enough for raiding at a high level.

We did clear all of TBC, but it was with lots of new people and not same guild anymore.

Every speedrunner guild does this. We only go for records once a month because of the Darkmoon Faire.

When did they say that they would keep it up 'forever and ever'? If they did, it would probably mean seasons or a few permanent vanilla servers. It more than likely doesn't mean dilute the content over years and years.
---
If you want a few servers that go at a slow pace I'm totally fine with it. I'm not against expanding server types even though the #NOCHANGES crowd seems to think it would ruin their experience on other servers.
---
yeah but by far the slowest in the game because for some reason it goes around the two entire islands as opposed to just ferrying back and forth. you usually wait around 15 minutes or so
---
It definitely needs fixing, but I have to admit it's hilarious watching huntards and mages cry about their huge advantages being diminished.
---
You know man, I purchased a string of games over the last \~5 years and felt this exact same way.  Stories bored me, gameplay didn't captivate me, really made me feel like I had just outgrown gaming and I felt kind of crushed.
---
Then I found a good ROM for Final Fantasy Tactics on ePSXe.  I had played FF7 through X2 growing up, but somehow missed this title.  Anyway, I fired it up and in the OPENING FUCKING SEQUENCE, you get this amazing line:
---
&gt;Don't blame us.  Blame yourself, or God.
---
It's not us my dude, games just aren't written that way anymore.  But soon, we get to enjoy another old classic together, keep hope alive friend.
---
Intentional - bulk armour I think.
---
Yup. I remember questing the whole place on foot on my Nelf Warrior. Good times!

---
Now I have this [song](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=I3qwcxLIzvM) stuck in my head again. 
---
Not complaining, though it is a nice song.
---
If you outgear your tank considerably or they don’t know how to generate threat effectively you could be threat-capped and then the imp would be worth it. Generally if a raid wants a warlock to provide the imp buff to a group the lock will be SM/Ruin though.
---
So now you're forcing all the ppl that love pvp to farm pve in order to be competitive
---
50 max characters per account, 10 per realm. If pvp server then 0 cross faction allowed.
---
I like it. Left a 5/5 as ideal for me messing round at work where signal can be a pain. A level required counter would be nice so I can see what level I need when doing weird build paths. Would help monitor key level breaks and power spikes for pvp etc
---
Oh, alright.
---
You'll be fine.
---
They are doing 2k dps, not 200k like everyone interested in its drops will do
---
13th of August you can make 3 characters.
---
You need an active subscription for it.
---
Yep, you can do them all. With quest items and the occasional dungeon while leveling you should be all set. Many pre-pre-bis will be tailoring items and lower level dungeons. I recommend some gear guides for mage leveling gear that'll guide you to some powerful items to look out for while leveling. 
---
Note though, that these items focus on time to kill, and are not optimized for extended fights nor PvP.
---
Your itemization also depend on what you want to do:
---
Single target TTK = stack spelldamage over all stats. 
---
AoE = int over all stats, as spell dmg increases don't do much for blizzard nor instant spells
---
PvP - healthy mix of Stan, int and spell dmg. Be careful about being a glasscannon. 
---
Personally I prefer the glasscannon spell dmg stacking (+frost dmg) and having a single target spec. I'm not a fan of relying on AoE grind, find it a bit inconsistent. It requires you to find a spot and people to not fuck with you :p and everyone will be jelly that you can AoE grind and will try and fuck with you a bit. 
---
It's decent in PvP if no one opens on you and if you're a god at kiting. Sometimes you just get popped with your 500 HP at level 40 X)
---
If you do enough quests in places like EPL, you gear should be okay to go to places like Strat/Scholo/UBRS to get your tier 0.5 stuff. Then after that you can get into places like MC/ZG.

---
Yea I saw that too =/
---
This guide doesn't seem to be written by somebody who really knows this stuff that well.
---
&gt;The rush is all about knowledge and experience, not mechanics.
---
Correct for the most part, it won't take long to master class mechanics but knowledge and preparation is what will determine who gets world firsts.
---
Not to mention, even by 2006 standards, that time was pretty bad.
---
This isn't proper use of this meme.
---
What I was getting at is that honor/rank system rewards were to blame rather than the rep rewards. If AV gave little to no honor than the it would be mostly played for fun, since rep is still easily gained by doing so.
---
Later on, put voidwalker on the spawn point. Put it on aggressive. GG.
---
None of these guilds stand a chance against pserver players who've been doing it for 5 years and already have everything optimized for leveling/raiding with greens.
---
SM is Shadow Mastery, which is a 30/0/21 spec.
---
16 debuff slots is confirmed.
---
That assumes you got atleast one person having additional account leveled to max level on opposite faction or a friend of the guild willing to help.
---
Also while  youre gonna be buffing you are going to be a target for alliance pvpers.
---
Very very improbable situation,hardly managable outside of the private servers
---
It doesn't matter as a mage. You won't have much spellpower at the beginning anyway. Your group will be happy if you make food + water, buff anyone up and sheep some mobs :-)
---
Interesting, thanks for that!
---
To be fair most raid bosses were taunt immune anyway, which is why smart tank swapping was a thing (unless you were alliance thanks to BoP) but even so, protection paladins weren't ideal in any raid situation. It can be done but everyone has to work extra hard to make it a success.
---
You'll have to rebind your assist target and rewhisper keys tho. FYI
---
This is a horrible take. Engineering is absolutely essential if you want to pvp at the highest level. This isn’t even a debate. That’s like saying you aren’t better protected with a gun and body armor than having just a gun. Like yeah you can still kill people but the body armor will come in handy in certain situations. 
---
You can easily be outplayed by slightly less geared players when they land a clutch grenade on you that turns into a combo play, or you could use a grenade to stop a healer when your other int abilities are on CD. 
---
idk what ur logic is but u can’t just deny that engineering isn’t essential to pvp at the highest level when it gives you an extra stun, snare, aoe, spell reflectors, friendly sheep removal, which are all extremely effective in high level pvp.
---
Zboard!  I had 3 as they ended up breaking and just gave in.  Was a fun gimmick but...yeah cost me a few quid!
---
Why would you need a shortcut for emotes like /roar and shit ? LUL
---
What about voidwalker? They reroll for that too?
---
Hi guys as many of you I am excited for classic and will be playing a warrior. Now I have a couple of thoughts and want to know what is your opinion. I started playing wow on TBC and always wanted to experience what classic was like, first I needed to make my mind on what class I wanted to play and I decided on playing a warrior. I haven't tanked in many years and have been playing melee dps since cata (used to tank in WOTLK) would you guys play fury or prot and why?
---
Another thing I want to do is pick up enchanting and Alchemy so i am thinking about rolling Enchanting and herbalism on my jouney to 60 and once I reach max level will be dropping herb for alchemy. My plan is to save some mats (not all) to get the profession leveled up and as soon as I can roll an alt to start gathering herbs. Main reason why I want enchanting is to be able to self enchant all my gear and alchemy is to be self sufficient for my raid consumable as well as these two professions will help me contribute to whatever guild I am in.
---
Do you guys think this is a good idea? if not then... what would you guys do and why?
---
I doubt many horde characters fully discover Teldassil.
---
Glad I saw this, I almost planned on getting a race change.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
sorry, I didn't realize I had to go through other threads on the sub to understand what he's talking about
---
You severely underestimate the lengths to which speedrunners will go for record times.
---
That's fantastic.
---
It's not about the difficulty of mechanics. Speedrunning in Classic comes down to pure knowledge, practice and optimization, which the top pserver guilds have been acquiring over the past years.
---
Both guilds can easily clear the raid without wiping, the question is who can do it faster.
---
For example, the top pserver guilds have cleared MC in 17 minutes, BWL in 25 minutes, AQ40 in 30 minutes.
---
200k DPS hot damn

&gt;  **Create Your Character**            
---
&gt; If you’re eager to claim your character name in WoW Classic, take note: we’ll be opening character creation on Tuesday, August 13.** Players with an active subscription or game time on their account will be able to create up to three characters per World of Warcraft account. We’ll have more information on realm names closer to launch, but rest assured—you’ll have plenty of time to figure out your plans for realm domination!      
---
&gt;  ** To align with other regions, the Americas character creation will occur slightly ahead of August 13.

Warrior with stealth /s
---
Lmao, let your pet go free, being your pal must be a torment for him
---
The point is, nobody (should) care if you have looted a lot of gold or not or if you have killed every faction/class combo (the latter will just happen within your first couple alterac valleys anyways so it's hardly an achievement). The really worthy ones will be visible on your character. You will see the super BIS on the top &lt;insert favourite class&gt; of your server roaming around in IF and you will drool on that. Suppose you're a mage. You will see the first full netherwind mage rolling around roughly 3-4 months before your own guild will be expected to even down nefarian and you will drool. Or maybe you will be that one guy and the others around you will.  
---
Effort will be rewarded in game. Just not in a list of points.
---
lol fixed
---
The way I’d like to see it happen is, classic is enough of a success and keeps people subbed they can have a 3 year cycle on new xpacs for retail to make them better.
---
Classic launches, a year later we get next Retail xpac, then two years later classic goes to BC, then another year later the next xpac. 
---
Give them some more breathing room to have retail xpacs better. 
---
Alternatively, if classic is a ridiculous success, have N’zoth win the end of BfA, classic becomes new retail with a new story line going forward. They’ve done alt realities before. Have BC come out, but slightly different story line etc through.
---
That content will literally disappear if you want to level 4 classes though. And I for one will probably wanna level like 8 (I won't have any problems cause I have a ton of free time, but for those who don't..). :)
---
Military strategists like box canyons. It's like lawn gnomes.
---
This thing is awesome
---
what a waste of everyones time.   
---
submit a ticket for harassment and the player gets a temp ban, repeat.   
---
you don't have an argument
---
Fair point
---
You're a legend
---
I disagree on it being the obvious choice and the reasoning being just because it feels pretty shit. To me both feel equally pretty shit and to me curse of agony is the obvious choice, its objectively better at multi tagging and i would argue that its objectively better for single target because it lets me keep moving during those 2 seconds while immolate doesnt.
---
Just do it on a pve server
---
Oh, my sweet summer child...
---
On the off chance you aren't meme'ing, there is no "help" when it comes to questing other than the clues in the quest log text. You won't even see "!" or "?" on the map.
---
Method wasnt the guild that transfered for gear, Limit was.
---
That's where you're wrong, the race is not about clearing a 14 years old piss easy raid with barely any mechanics and strategies all figured out. It's about being the first guild to have a roster ready to clear MC by day 6 or 7.
---
Being a mechanically gifted player like Method's doesn't give you any edge on vanilla compared to retail, it's all about experience and practice. I doubt Method is going to learn how to level efficiently the 60 within 5-6 days between now and Classic release. Creating an optimized route, learning each quest and adapting on the fly based on population and bottlenecks takes years of experience.
---
Right is right.
---
Who is scype?
---
It's not that real my dude
---
Guilds won't take them unless they are shit and or desperate.
---
Brilliant, thank you. 
---
I defo would like to get that BLue Dragon trinket as a resto shammy. :D
---
We do!
---
it will be interesting to see what insane time records people can pull off now.
---
Imagine not knowing your exact threat and everyone else's via basic calculations on the fly, L00000L!!! /s
---
It's like when you were 6 in school and the teacher made you do your first collage for art.
---
The top pserver guilds are also dedicated. So dedicated that they have been practicing and speedrunning the same raids for years. Catching up on that kind of knowledge doesn't happen overnight.
---
I’ll buy it for tree fitty
---
I remember wowglider
---
I mean aoe leveling for the first few months is going to be super tough unless you are in the top 1% ahead of the pack at launch - so you'll probably have to quest :)
---
And if you do only aoe level it will take a long time since you'll be fighting over packs - so by that time you'll probably have a decent amount of gold to spend on low 50 greens on the ah.
---
While I agree that Classic was the worst period in Warcraft’s 25 year history in terms of story development, I also agree that what they did to the Dragon Aspects in Dragon Soul was fucking annoying. As someone who read all the books, web comics, a couple paper comics, Chronicles, etc. I was really disappointed with the whole, “Our ancient purpose has been fulfilled,” as if they were created to defeat Deathwing. I was actually just talking about that with a friend yesterday.
---
MC/Onyxia are the only World Firsts that matter for classic, and really out of that the only one that matters is Rag.
---
Rag will be killed on the first week by multiple pserver guilds and probably Method too.
---
The way they are doing it is having a lot of people speed level hunters (fastest leveling class), then farm/feed gear to warriors/rogues who can carry the dps in MC early on.
---
That's all it really comes down to.  If you have 40 people level hunters just to feed gear to 40 other people who are going to clear the raid, you can easily clear MC the first week.
---
No worries, I understand the confusion now.
---
I was most definitely not talking about PKing though. To be honest I've never even logged in to an RP server and have only, and plan to continue, playing PvP servers. So yeah, I'm all for PvP being as wide open as possible. Not having full PvP makes it not feel like WoW to me - one of the things I hate about retail.
---
Do we agree the other guy is just talking about being a dick, and doing stuff that directly violates Blizzard policies?
---
I can see how complex it would be vanilla/wotlk talent trees in today's wow. but wouldn't it be worth the effort? Actually, obviously this is a much larger debate, which developers already decided the outcome of: make it simpler, and more accessible. they did this not only with the talent trees, but with everything else; dungeon access, looting, mounts, travel etc. Are we really happy with where that path took us? I think Blizzard being forced to launch Classic answers that question.
---
Yes, original WoW could be a pain in the ass with all its "do it the hard way" methods and only a small percentage of the player population got to see full content... and, imho, that was the whole point of it! All those "quality of life" improvements chipped something away from the game, it became... standardized? mechanized? ordinary? I think the experience of original WoW started in "making it to the dungeon" and continued with "making it to the END of the dungeon"... Once you were able to teleport to the dungeon with a click anytime, anywhere, it lost the challenge, along with the importance and relevance of all the zones among where you are and whatever dungeon you maybe trying to reach.
---
Getting back to your point, yes it would be a humongous task to balance vanilla talent system in today's WoW, along with all the other small things, but I think it should not be impossible and well worth the effort.
---
Anywho, whatever was, was because they could not be any other way.. Just like Classic's launch. Here is to living that "challenging" feeling and dragging our sorry asses to each and every dungeon around Azeroth!
---
hmm, it might have been for a couple things. I thought it was crafting though.
---
Found on wowhead: For those a bit unclear as to what this is for, it is used for four recipes currently in-game. They are two pieces of epic pre-TBC armor (Breastplate of the Chromatic Flight and Legguards of the Chromatic Defiler), the potion that is used to extinguish the brazier in Zul'Gurub to summon a boss, the Libram of Rapidity which adds Haste Rating (+10) to a leg or head slot item and, finally, the Blood Crown - a recent addition for the Jewelcrafting recipe.
---
I think Blizzard will do whatever they want. They just said they will listen to the community because thats what we want to hear.
---
Why do you assume that he's only going to have a single character? There's a very real chance that you won't have enough time to play what you want if you wanna level more than one character.

You sure about that?
---
Bacteria can live for decades on a keyboard.
---
Damn dude, I did not think of that. I am currently trying it out on a pserver and I like it a lot. Will probably be different in classic though.. :(
---
By every single pull, he means optimizing trash clearing, not boss pulls. Killing bosses is the easy part.
---
What truly matters in a speedrun is how efficiently you can clear/skip the trash. Pserver guilds have been practicing that on multiple servers + test servers.
---
I have been playing OSRS on and off for the last 2 years and all of the new additional content they've created specifically for OSRS is some of the best content I've ever seen. They have a very competent and caring group of dedicated staff/devs over there specifically for OSRS so I understand that may not happen with Classic. But that being said, if they don't do anything with Classic whether it's expand it into BC and WOTLK eventually I will be quitting probably before the end. No point just going to the end of Classic to be stuck with nothing to do, I'll just stop and not waste my time.
---
Method won't have any issues with the raids themselves, but that isn't the challenge, at least for MC and Ony.   The challenge is the speed leveling.  I don't care how good you are as a player, if you don't know how to speed level in vanilla and aren't very practiced at it, you aren't going to get high enough level fast enough to beat the people that have been doing this over and over and over and over on pservs for 15 years.  I'm not saying they can't do it or don't stand a chance, but I don't think they're as prepared for this as they might think.   It's going to be interesting and exciting to see for sure.
---
nice work Trollgodx
---
Ya think so?  I think it looks way cleaner and streamlined than the standard UI.
---
Barrens ones were never flagged. They weren't doing research for the Alliance at the time.
---
Hahaha shit I totally forgot about Librams and Totems and that they were actual bits of equipment.
---
See...Classic is not even out yet and people already miss lots of futures from retail. It's safe to assume that Grindy Boring Vanilla feeling will quickly turn Classic into a ghost town shortly after the launch. Player mentality has changed by 15 years of gaming experience, you can erase that even if you bring back Classic

We are all 30+ most of us mid to late 30s. Right now we hope to find an RP PVP as most of us want to world PVP and some of us are D&amp;D role players. Two guild names we are kicking around are The Old Guard or The Expendables plan on doing Sunday main raid day. The. Picking another day during the week for smaller raids like Ony or ZG.
---
Is wall walking possible like it used to be or noggenfogger elixirs back with the old long duration on the levitate buff? Jumping off Hyjal when the zone wasn't open used to be so much fun.
---
I have a $2300 setup that I'm gonna be using to run a game that won't even take me off of idle gpu temps... And I can't wait.
---
Yep, and that doens't even come down to the encounters themselves.  Those are easy compared to what Method normally does.  It's going to come down to the actual leveling.
---
I disagree. I played from vanilla through WotLK. There were always people with different builds and always room to test out different talent combinations. There was a lot more choice back then. 
---
I agree that there will always be a "best build", but not everyone wants to run what calculators say is the best. I fondly remember a time in WotLK when arcane was the "best" dps. And I fondly remember being the frost/fire mage that people laughed at when the group was formed, but then pulling ahead of the arcane mages on the meters. It was the feeling of choice and being able to play how you want that made it special.
---
Same here, I would love to pitch in!
---
For sure, especially the first few months while everyone is leveling their mains and alts.
---
Only way it would be effective (unless you are top 1%) would be if they botch the layering and it's easily manipulated to get on empty layers. 
---
*But that is still a long shot because I doubt there will be a ton of layers past the first couple of days.
---
I think if people want to park there mains in capital city’s / BB waiting for world buffs and logging out for raid nights.... let them... they’ve obviously got to a point in there own content progression that they WANT to blow through the raids. 
---
Classic is beautiful because you can do WHATEVER you like. 
---
Think not having these buffs will stop you from clearing raids? No.... only Naxx would it be a “must have” maybe...
---
I don't think so.
---
I do have an argument because that literally never happens on Retail. Blizzard does not at all enforce interfering with RP as harassment.
---
Not really. That 15k Server had something called dynamic respawns which made Mobs respawns almost instantly when enought people were farming the area.
---
Hardcore players abused this feature to get ahead of the pack and get all those mobs by themselves.
---
I think its posible to do MC in the first reset but It wont be easy.
---
Hell yea thanks man.
---
I think this will really push the player base to classic, which is a good thing imo. If this popularity persists, perhaps blizz can follow an update model like OSRS and keep Classic replayable for years to come. 
---
We’ll see how long this hype lasts, or if it’s hype at all
---
three monitors but all i do is play kotor2 on one monitor
---
World first??? More like 405th....
---
How do you even run from the entrance to Majordomo, then to Rag and go through his minute long summoning speech in 18 minutes let alone DPS down the bosses in between?
---
Pretty much. 
---
5k playing hours in Dota with 7.7k hours overall, have played less than 10 hours since Classic Beta began because I don't want to commit myself to anything else anymore.
---
No economy is the same when you go from 2,500 people to 250,000.  I wouldn't stress about any economy numbers in beta.  Only time will tell what items will sell for what.

I would recommend checking out these series of videos, I'll only link the first one for now but they are pretty great for listing out pros and cons.

hard to imagine Method doing PvE with tank and spank mechanics

To be fair those speed clears weren't their first clears so it's kind of apples and oranges there.

There’s no reason not to have both.

Plz explain less incest! Not doubting u just wanted to see how incest was even in current wow
---
The pserver players have never ever dealt with the bottlenecks they will face this launch. Period. It's pretty clear you aren't looking at this objectively
---
Mixed level content. Say you design Arathi highlands as a 30-40 zone.
---
Most of the basic quest content will be in this level range. 
---
Grim Batol is for Raiders, so 60 content. 
---
Add a cave somewhere with high level herb/mining nodes for 50-60 content.
---
Maybe add a few questchains that have one step in the 40-50 range there.
---
Vermillion Redoubt could be a full 60 subzone like the plateaus in TBC that supports Grim Batol with quests and reputation like Chapel does in Plaguelands.
---
What you dont like buying unfinished games, full of bugs, with online only for single player modes, which in turn are splintered into multiple parts to be sold back as "DLC", while all customization and XP/Item/Skip/Currency is only available through cash shop, and you can find a clone of it for mobile

The last good game I've played was FTL and Rogue Legacy, a $5 indie game back in 2013

---
You can sell the bullets that you get from a non-repeatable Gelkis quest to make a solid 5g or so on the AH, so that’s something. :)
---
And the very first reply to you is an idiot.  Wonderful.
---
Except you need to practice lvling if you wanna be the first to hit 60.
---
Pservers players have been lvling to 60 many times over the years. Top pserver guilds are probably practicing lvling solely for world firsts right now.
---
Some of my friends are coming back. Some aren't.  Beta is fun and classic will wreck my life once again come august.
---
No. Every healer downranks. 
---
The basic logic behind it (excluding very low rank spells, look up coefficients for your class specifically on this) is that lower rank spells cost less mana but recieve the same benifit from +healilng as higher rank spells. 
---
I'll just toss out an entirely hypothetical senario. Shamans now know the spell 'Healing Burst'. HB recieves 100% bonus from +healing on gear.
---
Rank 1 heals for 200, costs 100 mana.
---
Rank 5 heals for 700, costs 300 mana. 
---
You have 0 +healing.
---
Rank 1 heals at an efficiency rating of 2 healing per 1 mana.
---
Rank 5 heals at an efficiency rating of 2.3 healing per 1 mana. 
---
Rank 5 is more efficent without +healing
---
-----------------------------
---
You have +500 healing on your gear.
---
Rank 1 will now heal for 700 and cost 100 mana
---
Rank 5 will now heal for 1200 and cost 300 mana.
---
Rank 1 heals at an efficency rating of 7 healing per mana.
---
Rank 5 heals at an efficency rating of 4 healing per mana.
---
Rank 1 now vastly outscales rank 5 in terms of mana efficiency. 
---
--------------------------
---
MP5 is an excelent stat for all healers as a side note.
---
Also using the 5 second rule while not stacking spirit is a terrible way to heal in raids. Your passive regen is pretty much shit. Downranking while drinking mana pots / dark runes will allow you to heal continuously through the whole fight while not running oom.
---
Where do you need the duid? Rogue bandage + rogue "evade tank" meta dude ! Think larger
---
The Alliance ones.
---
People are going to spend 50+ hours leveling and attuning then maybe 3 hours clearing the raid.
---
A few minutes won't matter.
---
That would ruin early instances. Everyone would be leveling as hunter/warlock/druid and the odd miraculous bear tank and resto druid group would be fighting over a tiny fraction of drops.
---
How dare you know me this well.
---
Hit me up in DMs we have a discord and a Battle.net group on Live called A Better Place A Better Time.
---
Well, you're flat out wrong about the abilities as a good chunk of them are utility and the "good"ones don't need to be implemented at the highest output they were available at. Giving prot paladins a tome of pallytaunt isn't "powercreep", it's fixing a glaring hole in the spec's ability to do it's intended role.
---
Raids already *had* vanity items in vanilla. ZG had two mounts, in case you forgot. That isn't a "retail thing", this is where it fucking started.
---
"Barely take gear" &lt; "Never take gear". And yes, i am, because *everyone else* will also get optimized tier gear, and warrior sets can be adjusted accordingly.

As for bc/wrath raid difficulty, that's entirely the point. They're supposed to be hard. I can guarentee people will still run it if incentivised. Can't do mimiron's head because no flying, but i can promise people will grind out 0 lights yogg in a 40 man setting for their own personal flame leviathan, on top of guilds wanting the legendary healing hammer should that make a return.
---
That aside, we're talking tier 1.5 from Karazhan in the scenario i made up. Dps warriors aren't going to roflstomp their way around the world in gear that's maybe 5% better than what you can get in MC and still worse than BWL aside from set bonuses, especially when you're also giving set bonuses to specs that currently do not have any.
---
You made all that effort in that post with the assumption that he wasn't getting crushed even though he was.
---
There is an Orc camp inside wetlands, and Hammerfall just to the North. A camp in twilight Highlands isn't that unbelievable.
---
For sure. There will be some very confused and frustrated tanks in the first couple of months.
---
The calibre of top pserver guilds is also high. Many of them have been playing at the top lvl in retail in the past.
---
It's not just about learning the fights, its about practicing and optimizing every single thing. Each pull has to optimized, trash included.
---
20% stun resist is hardly niche my mans
---
Alliance just have more players = takes less time to do stuff.
---
waiting for Classic and then Cyberpunk 2077

“ Vastly more complex” ?? Guys c’mon.... 
---
The only time you weren’t using a cookie cutter build was TBC SL/SL locks (yes I did it. I’m not proud). Stop trying to mask lack of information and tools + bad players for harder game. The overall feeling is there, it is just not a very good game as gameplay goes. 
---
P.s. wasn’t the cap 100g for respec?
---
Ironforge is so comfy though
---
Then that's clearly an older version than Blizzard is using. I leveled up through Mulgore numerous times and was never flagged by fighting those mobs, but it was at least a year after launch before I made a Tauren.
---
Yeah I can certainly relate, been on the exactly same path as well!

Oh the SteelSeries zboard.. what a piece of garbage that was! My mom bought one for my brother and I when we were younger because we thought it was the coolest thing ever. Both of our keyboards stopped registering keystrokes after a month, my brother just gave up on it but I wrote SteelSeries in an attempt to get a replacement. They then sent me a new keyboard, the SteelSeries Shift, can't say much about that one though since my brother spilled a soda on it a few days after I got it. 10/10 would not recommend.
---
Would you be willing to have a shadow priest in raid? 
---
Played bfa. Played vanilla as a kid.
---
Not a ton of experience with classic wow. Have jumped on instant 60 private servers for vanla just to have fun in pvp.
---
Currently playing ESO until classic drops. I do all end-game content on ESO so im not a noob to the concept of pve.
---
I know shadow priest isnt very sought after unless there are enough warlocks in raid for it to be beneficial. Would i still make raids if i go this specc?

Top pserver players will play 20h per day until they hit 60 and clear MC.
---
They also have been practicing server launches for years, why do you think Method can do it faster without experience?
---
I couldn't disagree more. I love classic and i really dislike retail. Im just not hypocritical enough to say that everything in classic is good and everything in retal is bad. In fact everything you just listed is what i enjoy about classic the most and dislike about retail the least so try again.
---
Yep, I'm almost 30 now and remember being very very young when started on classic.
---
Bro can we have that optimized route u making
---
If you choose to level more than one character with your time spent in WoW than that's your choice.  If people choose to instead progress through raid content that's their choice.  You can't hamper the choices of others, because you decided to do something different with your time.  That's extremely selfish.

Wasn't Stino's melee attack after nova when he gets rooted in place but before the Mage blinks at a larger distance than other races can hit from though?

you're making me feel like my knowledge of quest rewards is severely lacking
---
Druids are easymode in early Classic if you can find a good guild you run dungeons with. 0/30/21 spec is all you need for healing in MC and PvPing in phase 2 and you can either tank or heal in dungeons for easy gearing and distribute gear with guildmated with no drama, and you can easily aoe farm with hurricane + barkskin and finish off mobs with bearform. Easy life and if you want a warrior later on you can funnel gold into him.

Pserver players spend 16 hours per day for 3 months when getting R14. 16-20 hours per day until they lvl 60.

Don't underestimate them, they have been dedicated for the same game for years.

---
It's pretty clear you are uninformed about private servers, as their releases have much more players online at the same time than the Classic layers will ever permit at launch.
---
Bottlenecks are never going to be as severe on Classic with layers and shorter named respawns as they are on private servers with 14k concurrent players day and night from all over the world. But feel free to believe whatever you want with your oblivious vision of private servers.

Shit man 18 mins was actually bad wtf
---
That server also had MASSIVLY decreased spawn timers on mobs. So fast that if you had a quest to get a mob at the back of a cave you'd better bring a well balanced 5man group to get to it.
---
Digga stole my bike
---
I suppose you are right. I guess its more the Idea that the dungeons never become pointless really.  Really enjoy 5man content 
---
Which is quite the opposite for raids in vanilla.  Youll always find MC groups even when its well past naxx release. Thats a hell of a feature to have been made redundant. 
---
Classic cant come soon enough.
---
Yeah, but this just proves they know the raids in and out.
---
Classic speedruns will be even faster.
---
APES WHO ??????????????
---
I AM AN ADULLLLLLLTT!!
---
Haha I love it, definitely using that one.
---
I like the she-hulk vibe but their faces though
---
If the phases are too short then people with little time to play won't be able to level several classes until classic is over.
---
spurg
---
The real question is which group can convince 45+ people to take a week off work and efficiently level 18+ hours a day.
---
Method has the clout for that.
---
I don't think protection paladins were really ideal for anything apart from a few niche encounters against undead that make good use of things like consecration.
---
I'd watch that. 350 ties in a row until someone gets tired and slips up.
---
Lfr
---
So it's 13th for EU and 12th for NA? Is that correct
---
I can't do a transmog run on a 120 in less than 18 min...that place is huge and takes forever just to run from boss to boss
---
This won't happen. People that play on RP servers tend to be more mature and level-headed. You won't end up as anything other than another name on people's ignore list. If you want to be excluded from every PUG imaginable, go right ahead.

I think they can give private servers a run for their money but in the end I think the private server people will prevail. I mean there are guilds that does rank 14 for their entire roster just to get good weapons before AQ and they know every pull by heart.

Sure I agree to that. My question was more regarding to what the grey/White items sell for to vendors, since those were a big reason as to why pick pocket farming was lucrative in pservers. Which isnt affected by the economy numbers. 
---
And also the drop rates of the different BoE items themselves, not necesseraly what they sell for.
---
I hope that Classic WoW will be the jumping point for WoW 2.0, a chance to reset everything and start fresh with what did work and what didn't. I think retail WoW is too burdened by legacy systems (hence why the leveling experience is an absolute mess and much more) and has attracted a very different audience by catering to too much convenience.

So I am going to stop ya there and hope you are going paladin tanking for leveling correct? Then at 60 you will swap over to being a Healer? Because i tried this on a Private Server and paladin tanking is not a thing you go oom halfway through a pull and barely can maintain threat on single target at all. The issue is you don't have the mana to keep up with the cost of your spells in order to tank. You won't be able to tank anything post 5 man dungeons. And even then in order to be tanky enough to tank dungeons you put your mana pool with full buffs at about 4k. This isn't a viable spec for highlevels it can work for leveling but it will never work at max level properly.
---
Air ships &gt; Ships

---
In late TBC:
---
1. EXP needed up to level 60 was reduced.
---
2. Outside elite quests got turned into normal quests.
---
3. Old dungeons were rebalanced, so the difference between the first mobs' level and the last one wasn't as big (SFK last boss is 26 in vanilla, but 21 in TBC, Eranikus from 55 to 50).
---
4. Low level dungeon items were buffed A LOT, especially caster gear. All green/white gear from bosses got turned into blue gear. You can do a full deadmines run in vanilla and the only boss that's 100% gonna drop blue items is VC. In TBC even the first ogre boss drops nice blue 2handers.
---
5. New talents make every single class stronger, and most hybrid classes deal more damage early on. Paladins can easily tank in TBC too.
---
**&lt;Moist&gt; PvE Horde NA Casual Raiding**
---
**Intro:**
---
We  are Moist, a collection of friends (and some significant others) having  come together through the ages of playing WoW and still staying loosely  in touch with one another. The goal is to find other fellow mature  players with limited schedules wanting to make the most of a single  organized raid night without the pressure to fully min/max. The core of  us are laid back, mature players with busy schedules, but who have raided since vanilla.
---
We are all excited  for this release.  For some it’s about nostalgia, for others it’s about  experiencing classic for the first time.  Regardless of why we are here  we can all agree we are here to have fun. We are a casual guild but that  does not mean we aren’t aiming to succeed.  We want to create a  comfortable atmosphere so we can all experience the game in a positive  way. Play what you want, play how you want, play when you want.  We are  accepting and open to players of all types.
---
Classic  WoW relied heavily on individual and guild reputation.  We will strive  to make Moist synonymous with quality: quality players, quality  attitudes, quality experiences.  Anyone who encounters a member of Moist  should leave thinking that we are knowledgeable, respectful, fun, and  all around awesome!
---
**Expectations:**
---
Members  should have a desire to learn and share knowledge to improve the guild.  Seeing as we will operate on minimal organized raid time it is  important that members be prepared and prompt for raid. The goal is to  at least be farming BWL and 20 player content and pretty much see what  motivation levels are like beyond that. We run a loot council but we try  to be fair and transparent as well. We’re looking for people to help  share the responsibility of running our guild community rather than  focus too heavily on progression.
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
We  are planning to run two separate 3 hour raid IDs, one on Thursdays at 6  pm PST (9 pm EST) and the other on Saturdays 5 pm PST (8 pm EST), for  targeting 40 player content. By having two raid groups, we hope to be  flexible for people’s schedules while also providing a large player base  for smaller group content. Other nights there may be optional 20 player  content scheduled as interest dictates given the shorter lock out  schedule.
---
**Contact:**
---
If  you are interested and want to be part of our discord for release day  organization, then please message Slaugth#9941 on discord or even a DM  here on reddit with a discord contact (I don't check reddit as often so  please be patient).
---
Keep yer feet on the ground.
---
I don't have as many hours of walking as people who are older than me. Still I manage to walk just fine and I don't struggle with it at all. Its not a challenge, just like MC isn't a challenge. Its literally as hard as walking from A to B IRL.
---
Better than my plan, which was Darude Sandstorm on repeat at 88% volume for 2 weeks straight.
---
if you fuck with people's RP you are quickly gonna find yourself blacklisted server-wide from dungeon groups
---
I have been looking for that Atlas for quite some time now, it's pretty hard to find in Sweden!
---
Wanting content to come out faster is inhibiting people from playing alts and leveling slowly, isn't that hampering choices? The 'selfish argument' favors the majority, and that isn't the people progressing through raid content.
---
you go to retail after naxxramas
---
pardon?
---
 Oomenacka!
---
Old videos of Vurtune and Og (I think it was?) will help change that guys mind. I Was pretty decent at pvp back in vanilla then I saw those and it took me to the next level, wish I had it in the beginning.
---
They can flag you when you try to attack a target and stand in the way. As soon as you tag them you are flagged for pvp too. It's certainly shenanigans, but it works.
---
I'd buy that for a dollar!!!!
---
Gold farmers bought me WotLK when I deployed to Iraq (I deployed before it came out). I came back from downrange to 10,000k gold and my main leveled to 80. Not even mad. Luckily, I used a bank tracking addon, so I was able to literally list every single sentimental item that they deleted and it was all restored.
---
what's more manly than fucking a guy in the ass?
---
Feel free to link any data that supports your claim, or just keep throwing around numbers it's up to you
---
This was poetic. I loved it.
---
I play on a rp server on retail. Not because I roleplay, because there servers are genuinely more alive and fun to play on. You NEVER see groups of people doing things on non RP servers other than spamming in trade chat. Last night some group was putting on some where a prisoner escaped and he was running around asking players for help while players acting as stormwind guards were asking "Have you seen..." Yea, it's entertaining to watch. I was just standing there working on setting up grid2 during this.
---
If you're not using all of the tools available in wPvP or BGs, then why the fuck are you even queuing up or playing on a PvP server?
---
Arbitrary rules of item/gear/profession limitation is only for those that can't handle getting their shit pushed in and aren't willing to go to the effort it takes to get themselves on a level playing field.
---
If people using pots in wPvP or BGs bothers you, go play PvE and stay out of BGs.

---
The point is that attunement is a nonfactor. It requires about half of a BRD run. Most people will have ran BRD a few times before entering MC, and the "stragglers" can be ran through the attunement pretty quickly.
---
Onyxia attunement is much more of a grind.
---
This will actually be super interesting, a well-oiled, fine-tuned machine like Method verses the knowledge, skill and experience of classic of the private server players, gun be good
---
Hahaha retail... You know the old Judge Dread when they send Max Von Sydow out into the dessert because he retires? That's what comes to mind when I think of going on to retail.
---
You are just wrong. Count how many times I've written "I agree" in my replies, it is quite a lot. There were multiple times where I admitted a good point and times I made corrections to the post. If you read them, you will see them, they are there, trust me.
---
this is what classic wow is all about,  me and RL mates created a guild called loves you longtime,  and our thing was to use a lvl 40 to lure a lone wandering 60 character into a trap,  we got such a name for ourselves that when questing alone, our lvl 33 druid chased off 5 lvl 60's haha. 
---
we also got tonnes of requests to join, but we liked to just keep it with RL friends,  but that didn't stop us creating a gruelling 20 step initiation quest line for candidates,  we only had 1 guy pass all of them only to fall at the last hurdle -  beat the whole clan at the same time in the stranglethorn arena solo.  poor fucker.
---
you understand that it goes live at the same time right?
---
when it's 12th in NA it's 13th elsewhere in the world.
---
you'll be totally fine for instances. the 5 man, level 60 instances are not that tough, even for poorly geared new 60's. But I dont understand the need to just grind to 60 and then find groups. My plan is to get to 55-56 and then find groups and gear up as I am running these instances. Getting the Onyixia atonement is a long process which involves going into LBRS/UBRS several times, so makes sense to get into these quests and instances from your late 50's, so you get XP and gear as well as doing the quests.  
---
But Green BOEs/Quest items will be fine to start these instances if you are level 60.
---
A) Stop posting bios for posts. Nobody cares who you are (for the most part). Let your idea stand on its own. 
---
B) /r/classicwowplus
---
C) I hate your ideas personally. An expansion to classic that doesn't raise the level cap is not worth my time.
---
Pretty gross to think that cenarius son threw it in princes to make the centuar spawn
---

---

---
Dm what server they are talking about I'm curious now
---
i would like them but blizzard said they wouldn't do it. no biggie either way
---
Lol
---
Hard pass
---
There will be layering for the first few months (probably much longer) and there will be cross realm BGs.
---
More than 60 hours.  I believe fasted recorded 60 was 4 days some hours played?
---
I'm right with you. I enjoyed Valor (except helm) and Might, but the transition from Might (spiky shoulders, BA helm) to this was a huge letdown for me.
---
If there's achievement in a game, the game becomes a job to get a dopamin fix from feeling you accomplished something with a tick in a box. Every moment you aren't working towards one will feel wasted.
---
If there's no achievements no one dictates the fun or how you should play the game. You create your own goals for yourself - not for someone else. Not to stroke your E-pen, not to live up to some expectations. 
---
The moment achievement arrived in (I think TBC?) I felt it was a bad idea. I changed my playstyle personally to try and get them all. It wasn't fun. 
---
I'm against all gameplay elements that dictates how you should play your game, that doesn't affect in-game play.
---
Yep.
---
IIRC that quest was a miscommunication between the creators about what they wanted Garrosh to be.
---
Well, now you look only at Patchwerk, not at the other bosses, where he parses a bit higher sometimes. 
---
Of course, it was a 40 man raid? Why would you say it isn't? On Loatheb, 40 people did damage. On the other bosses generally 28-29 people appear on the dmg chart and 12-13 on the healing chart with the shadow priest being the only one to appear on both. We can also be sure, they ran 23 dedicated dps. On Noth Jayten is ahead of two mages and three locks. On Grobbulus he was ahead of three mages and three locks. Yeah, those all underperformed heavily underperformed for their spec, but again, if the ret ends up in the midfield of dps for your raid, they are no detriment to you whatsoever. 
---
And if your raid has a dps problem, would you rather kick the ret, who works his ass off and places around 15th most of the time or a slacking mage or lock, who can't even get past the rets dps?
---
Yes, in a top guild full of dedicated players, he wouldn't be around 15th, but even this raid, which you describe as very shitty, was able to kill 14/15 in naxx with a ret running around in the lower mid field of the raids dps players. So, what's the problem with letting people play the spec they want? Even if it's less optimal, unless your entire raid consists of such weaker spec dps, you won't have too much trouble clearing the content.
---
Because "Pness" kind of sounds like penis, I assume.
---
Right... their DPS was dogshit until they were given dual wield along with a couple other enhancement changes in TBC.
---
to put this into perspective, highwarlord/grand marshall (highest pvp rank) is around the quality of MC gear. once you get to BWL, the pvp gear is a lot worse, so PVE gear is the best gear in the game ultimately, and there isn't really a difference between pvp/pve gear because things like resilience or versatility or w/e the hell they call it now didn't exist
---
No adding content that wasnt in Vanilla.
---
How. Hard. Is. That. To. Understand? 🙃🙃🙃
---
Put dumb content on different servers and allow people to transfer their main from Classic to shitball server.
---
I played for like 2 years on an RP-PVP server in vanilla, when I was like 16/17 years old. was the most mature MMO community I have ever experienced.
---
people speaking in a full sentence instead of like "uWu +1 dudu heal strath speedrun no n00bs". the community on a realm creates the immersion, not the game.
---
we should get rp-pvp servers at release. if they release them later, many people will just use them as a freshstart server.
---
Maybe this will help you see the light.  They do not have to keep every server on the same phase and they can if they decide progress ones slower or faster than others.  
---
If you play on a server that already has AQ phase rolled out, you could pick to reroll on a server that only has the MC phase released.  Because they will decide at some point to start a fresh server so that people can keep progressing through the phases one by one.  If you never hardly play the game, whinging that everyone is too fast for your casual life style, then it doesn't matter at all which server you are in or what phase they are in.  It would only matter for the hard core speed rushers that want to keep experiencing that first week raid of onyxia, molten core and so on again.  I for one would be thankful to start on a server in phase three because instanced PVP was a lot more enjoyable than world ganking and zergfests in first two phases.
---
how is a warrior less of a hybrid then a shaman?
---
Where's your data on this?

This has been mentioned in many posts on this sub about the experience bar showing. I want to say it either had to be disabled in your UI or it still shows in a number of screenshots because it's at the moment of leveling.
---
But I have a pretty clear memory of playing in vanilla and still seeing my experience bar at 60, it would just never progress beyond the exp you had when you hit 60 and then when TBC launched it reset to 0. I remember disabling the exp bar and swapping it out for reputation bars at 60
---
Rushing MC gear is fine, people in MC epics are of course much stronger than people in blues, but they are still mortal. A proportionate reward for those who play hardcore early on. 
---
The content that worries me if it were rushed is Dire Maul, AQ, and Naxx. DM makes MC almost pointless, AQ gear is starting to get pretty OP, and Naxx gear is completely insanely broken. Sooner or later you'll inevitably get to a stage where Naxx gear is rampant, but that's also the stage where most people will quit, either completely or for a "fresh" server. So the question of when to release Naxx, is when it's OK to let Classic die (mostly).
---
Mobile first! Majority of the people browse on mobile
---
i don't get it. that's naxx in epl.
---
Leveling to 120 in BFA took under 10 hours at launch for a lot of players. You can go look at leveling speed on wowprogress to confirm this with time stanps. I'm not sure how you can be 12 hours faster than the ~10 hours it took a lot of players. Ginji did get it first if I recall correctly, but not by an impossible amount.
---
combat rogues for the axe bonus i presume?
---
I only focus on the extreme?
---
..EQ, DaoC, FF, UO, shadowbane ... every MMO prior to WoW made it look like an extremely casual MMO where you could be antisocial and still get to max level.
---
it's not the extreme, it's the mainstream. EQ in particular was the top dog before WoW.
---
Yeah this is def a joke
---
Oh yeah, it's a fair point, just saying I've never seen anyone refer to them that way.
---
I feel like whenever I see "hybrid" it refers to classes that can heal, but also do other things like Pallies/Shaman/Druids
---
That is what I was doing in modern wow.  Taking screen shots right before I was going to level so I could know how much time I spent per level.  It was really key to take a screenshot before I went from 110 to 111 or my time played at level 110 would be lost forever.

Reasons to go Alliance:
---
- Human racials (Swordskill, Maceskill, 10% faster rep grinds, 10% spirit)
---
- Paladinbuffs
---
- Proximity to Blackrock mountain
---
- overall favoured faction by blizzard
---
- Fearward (no more dummy wipes on Ony or nef due to feared tank)
---
- Better looks and fighting animations
---
- Better looking towns and cities.
---
- NEVER AGAIN kargath HS. LITERALLY 30sec flight from Ironforge!!!!!!!
---
- Gnome racial: Expansive mind (5% increased intellect)
---
- Garithos (after all, he did NOTHING wrong)
---
Reasons to go horde:
---
- DERP?????!
---
- WF-totumz????
---
- Kinda communist if you're into that kinda thing.
---
Rogues diary should vendor for 45 silver like it did back in vanilla. Classic pickpocketing could be more profitable because private servers tend to nerf the most popular pickpocket dungeons like RFD &amp; BRD.
---
&gt;I only played WoW for 4 months and it was during the beginning of BFA. A bit overwhelmed back then, so many addons, rotations, specs, etc. Felt like I was too late to the party, everybody knew so much, and I was just noobing around lol
---
That sensation will still be there, although a bit less intense.
---
Rogue and Mage are both easy to get in to but have high skill caps. [Perplexity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-kYglKZ1f8) is considered the best rogue by many right now and his play completely transcends what you will see from 99% of rogues. But you do not need to be anywhere near his level to jump someone and stunlock them to death.
---
Mage is the same deal — polymorphing, kiting, and performing shatter combos is easy, but great mages will use these tools to win 1vX scenarios and unfavorable match-ups. [Vurtne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BP90t0ehfk&amp;t=417s) is the most famous from back in the day.
---
Mage will be slightly more desirable in dungeons and raids. Rogue is considered one of the most "selfish" classes as if offers almost no utility to group members besides some situational CC. Any group of friends stands to gain huge benefits from having one mage by virtue of portals and conjured food and water.
---
Rogue is less fun in battlegrounds than mage. You will mostly spend your time defending flags. In zerg vs zerg fights like AV you will be almost useless, whereas mages will be in their element.
---
In world PvP it's hard to overstate the value of stealth. Being able to choose your fights basically means you will always win. However with their CC options and ability to continually reset the fight and abuse terrain mage is no pushover in world PvP either.
---
Based on what you've said I wouldn't give a hard recommendation in either direction.
---
Chuck Norris jokes intensifies.
---
He's talking about the diggers in Mulgore, not the barrrens.
---
according to who? you?
---
cause browing this forum / official forum there's a shitton of player taking vacantion just to grind to max level. There's guild praticing MC and ony in green. Pserver very much have a race mentality.
---
They're not here to cater to the hardcore player?
---
Dude, in classic if you aren't raiding or PvP'ing till rank 12+ you are a second class citizen when it comes to power level.
---
don't think your fantasies reflect reality.
---
He's clearly being sarcastic. I'm sure the method guys will try and be competitive, but josh has already said many of them didn't even want to play classic.
---
Sounds like you aren't a true boy then. You follow where your boys go. Not abandon them because they want to play the opposite faction of you. You are by far the worst boy of them all.
---
A blank talent tree planner so you can save your own idea of your leveling specc or share it with others = NO THINKING ALLOWED ?
---
But you're right, you don't need more tools to stop thinking.
---
That seems to me like the wise way to go.  It is how they have been doing for countless other games over the past decades with seasonal resets.  Some like PoE and D3 have tiny little spice ups to make it more enjoyable than the previous iteration (don't tell the #nochanges crowd. keep this between us).
---
yeah, i'm still working on that! haha
---
BIG mage!
---
*sniff sniff* Smells like Moonfire PTSD. Did you find a cure? Because I am still suffering from its after effects.
---
$0.50 is the best I can do

All i see is....

---
Maybe they should compete for fastest clear times instead of world firsts; or perhaps both.
---
Yea but that's just a single win. I'm speaking more generally.
---
that's where the playlist get's muted!

---
Probably the best thing to come out of Cataclysm.
---
Blizzard said it’s till phase 2. So 2-3 months.
---
What you explained isn’t really a problem.
---
"vastly more complex" ... lol everyone uses the same cookie cutter build
---
not the type of music I was going with for this playlist, but thank you for the suggestions! I love the panic! at the disco song!
---
I am super hyped for classic, 29yo
---
Havent watched a single streamer
---
That is an awesome plan. I might consider using it as well.
---
Every wow video back then was rock/metal
---
Just give it some time after the game comes out and I'm sure one of them will be adjusted for the client.
---
Indeed.
---
This ^
---
hahah! that's something tho!
---
And it is the raid after Naxxramas.
---
Thanks for all the links, these were so awesome :D
---
Did you report the bug?
---
&gt; Blizzard would implement changes to Retail to make it more like Classic?
---
No. Retail is too far down what I like to call the Farmville route to be brought back. And a lot of players actually like Retail. So even if Classic is massively successful Retail will still hold an audience. They're really two different games aiming at two different types of player now.
---
Retail is likely to more in the direction of:
---
- Less story. Much less story. Like no story.
---
- More 'lobby' based content. Just stand around in your favorite city and queue up for whatever.
---
- Which means that the world zones become completely irrelevant.
---
- Which means the elimination of crafting and professions as we know them. In BfA they're already almost pointless.
---
Here's my wayout there prediction for Retail - The next expansion (if there is a next expansion) will be the last. After that Blizz will switch to content patches only.
---
Did they not abandon this boy?
---
Phase 1 Tank set has two items that are unobtainable in Phase 1. Cloak of Warding pattern is from Dire Maul(Phase 2) and Band of the Steadfast Hero is a drop from a summoned boss that's part of the dungeon set upgrade quest chain(Phase 5). That ring appears on the list for every phase until Phase 5 as well.
---
Also, +3 Defense to bracers is not a great enchant.
---
But this is something that is not wrong... We know how the ranking worked/works. perhaps values for Honor points per kill may be different, but that doesn't change how the system works... very good video
---
Is it known if outdoor bosses are tethered for the release?
---
I’m not doubting that method will invest a stupid amount of time into trying to get wf, but the pservers guilds will be doing the same AND they have tons experience of this exact content which method lacks.
---
Essential, no. Helpful, yes. Not denying it had some nice tricks but it's not "essential".
---
Essential is quantified as being one if the most important elements which Engi isn't - gear is.
---
I farmed gold via PvP. 1v1, 1v2, 1v3 was normal. 1v3 was always a stretch but I never felt that Engi would help or hurt me at that point.
---
I was fairly hardcore about PvP and playing well - but at the same time I mained a Warlock which felt like the class was designed to just troll.
---
I should probably clarify that for some classes Engi would be a make or break while others like a geared Lock really don't need it. I never felt at a disadvantage. Ever.
---
So essential? No. Really nice? Sure.
---
Ooof that one as good! added!
---
Was there an official announcement that there would be no option for paid race change in Classic? I remember reading speculation and people saying “probably not” but never came across anything officially.
---
there is no resilience-gear in vanilla.
---
I remember Gonzzo! Jesus nice memory on that one!
---
You couldn’t be more wrong. Everyone who could afford it spammed pots back in vanilla pvp.
---
monster
---
Not a big deal until people start raiding MC and BWL. Getting into the raid was half the battle back then with priests using mind control to make people take a lava bath.
---
Too high IQ for /r/classicwow.
---
Maybe , Just maybe , we should focus on what Classic actually have .
---
is this "THE" shadow panther?  I used your site such a long long time ago if so, thanks for that info!
---
Is 8 hours per day supposed to sound impressive?
---
I'm in central time zone.  What time frames are you thinking.  Would it be acceptable for me to only be able to make one of the raid nights?
---
I used this add-on in retail. Not clunky at all actually. In some ways I thought it was less clunky due to keybinds you can use.
---
I meant back in Vanilla and BC, where not being able to grind the mounts meant not being able to play with my friends.
---
I won't play Classic, but I hope you'll have fun. :)
---
No Problem wanted to make a hub for all the greats of nostalgia, and if anyone was trying to find something it would be here
---
Glad I went Horde for the beta.
---
Man that is so cool though - I would be proud to be ganked by that group if I were alliance.
---
You understand what the "world" in world first means right?
---
The boys need to come up with a place they want to go. If more boys want to go horde you go with the boys. It is literally what i did. I was going to be a tank for an Ally guild but the boys wanted to go horde. So we are Horde and making our own guild. Because the game without me and the boys, isn't the game at all.
---
I'd rather watch Asmongold get trolled by some asshole he pugged.
---
Explosive trap direct ontop of a mob spawnpoint counters moonfire spam more often than not. 
---
So at least one mob of the respawn will be mine, which is something, I guess.
---
Well how do you want it to be patched? Want it to be finished in six months so you can go play Bfa whilst waiting another year for TBC progression? Do you want the content staggered or should they cater to the hardcore players so the content can get thunder plowed raped in three months?
---
I think there would be quarterfinals assuming you had 16 players and the top 4 players of each round robin moving on.
---
the amount of people who feel the need on this sub to tell people how to play is so goddamn annoying. “dont forget to do a quest, catch a fish, do a dungeon, soak up the world” or just play the game how you want without some puff telling you how
---
Not in the way you intended it.
---
It's really just for try-hard PvPers in small scale encounters. If you're going to play casually I wouldn't worry about it, just do what you like.
---
not just one, but \*two\* jump buttons, a very valuable tool for classic
---
you'd probably like all their other stuff too, then. they're also very similar to fall out boy as they were inspired by them
---
I mean, the narrative is true, the example isn't.
---
But you don't just need to walk from A to B, you need to walk there faster than ANYBODY else.
---
Why did it become popular?
---
I wouldn’t be surprised, in my experience though no one ever did. I guess at that point you’re already committed to the character? I have no idea, it’s a weird phenomenon for sure.
---
So everyone leveled 144 characters to 60 ? DAMN
---
Ony is only bad for Horde. It's manageable on Alliance from what I remember.
---
What I am saying is that Method does stand a good chance to get the WF because *the content is stagnant*. This is not something that requires beta access.
---
A lot of the information is out there, it's years old, and it's been discussed to hell in pserver communities. There's also p servers on which they can test strategies as much as they want.
---
It's nice that private server guilds have been doing this for years, and the experience is valuable, but the issue is that this information is broadly accessible. Method has been shown to have an insane level of dedication to WF races. What they do will almost certainly include an insane level of trial and error as well as research.
---
Pretty sure their raid ‘rotation’ consists of spamming shadow bolt.  So if your main focus is PvE as you’ve mentioned, it’s one of the easiest to play.
---
For their other abilities, you’ll understand what they do as you level up and get them.  But that goes for any class.
---
No. It's the raid that IS Naxxramas.
---
Always play paladin or druid. The question is not what specc, the question is what do they need and how patient are they. 
---
Now excuse me I need to restart my loot-hoover it choked on a bow once.
---
Gonna be really funny to point and laugh at all you method fanboys when they fail
---
So I am based in Canada, but in his case and even in mine we can leave if we get written approval from our parents/guardians. That being said we did have to live near the school or was being picked up by said parent/guardian.
---
&gt; I'm not a professional "Systems Analyst", with a pretty diverse background.
---
    :%s/not/now/g
---
I'm also a systems analyst! 
---
BOTTING CREATES JOBS, PEOPLE!!! ^^/s
---
I gotcha. tbh Im leaning towards Mage, because it seems like the rotation/gameplay is more forgiving and bit more simple than Rogue.. more beginner friendly at least to start with.
---
Plus, one of my friends said he is going Rogue.. so at least we wouldnt be sharing the same loot..
---
Very cool infographic, the talent system does have more points compared to current system however it isn't more complex.  For each spec there is only one optimal talent path build.
---
&gt; No. It's the raid that IS Naxxramas. 
---
And the raid that IS Naxxramas is the raid after Naxxramas.
---
Me. Lol. I bought my current keyboard off craigslist. It was pretty clean when I got it and I just gave it nice chlorox treatment when I got it home. Good to go.
---
classic wow: runs on integrated graphics at high settings, except in lag forge or lagrammar.  
---
Modern wow: runs on integrated graphics at lowest settings and experiences hiccups while solo questing or in groups.
---
Listening to this on Christmas day 2017. Can't wait for Vanilla servers to come back ! :D
---
I ended up on Lightning’s Blade... no idea how or why... I feel like it was auto assigned to me and I just went with it tho.  Not sure if that’s how it worked back then or not.
---
What practice?  There is no difficulty in buying mats to make fire resist gear for your melee and tanks to kill rag.  And that's the only difficult part of MC, they could do the entire instance as soon as their tank hits 60 and had a couple pieces of defence gear.  There is nothing to practice, 90% of the raid will just need to be at least level 58 and show up on time.
---
"I am dad" / "I am dead"   are phonetically more or less the same.
---
So when the dad "misinterpretes" something as a name, I just did the same with the word "dad".
---
It was supposed to be a bad joke anyway. Mission accomplished.
---
If in doubt, just call someone a fanboy. Not only is it wrong only 50% of the time, which it is here, but it's also an easy way to avoid making any arguments for your points.
---
Yes, but its still not hard to walk. Everyone can do it. You dont need thousand of hours walking to walk at the same speed as your opponent.
---
Changes? Did you say changes?!?
---
Ya that's the problem. It's TOO smart of a joke. I see you've played knifey spoony before. Pretty sure that was supposed to be so stupid it was funny.
---
Nah it's a grind on both sides
---
Stampi in TB
---
mage shield
---
I'm... HOOKED ON A FEELING
---
Half truth maybe? Raid experience wont matter at all... its not like raids are mythic hard mode stuff... They are way too easy especially for 40man...
---
All the race is gonna come down to is who can level and gear the fastest... And i guess that experience can come from pservers...
---
Streamers
---
Yeah even if your gear is not great you should be able to start doing max level dungeons on day one. 
---
My suggestion is start on your Ony and MC attunements first. 
---
Then work on your BiS list.  That way if your guild starts raiding you can jump in. While BiS will be best before you start raiding. I don’t think it will be “needed”. 
---
Oh and don’t forget to farm fire resist gear. 
---
Drink plenty of water and don’t forget to get enough sleep.
---
People can play, request, or do whatever they want within the rules blizzard outlines.
---
You should be addressing your bitch plea to blizzard, not other players. Ask blizzard to pander to you as opposed to listening to a subsect of players.
---
Listening to the minority is the entire reason we are getting classic in the first place. So stfu with telling people what they should want or what they should do. People like you are so obnoxious
---
Were not blizzard
---
I see you've played Knifey Naxxramas before.
---
Uh, not really. Pretty well known fact that people who are willing to cheat a given system (by paying a Chinese botter for ez gold) are more focused on themselves and less focused on others ergo more egoistic and less empathetic. It also seems pretty obvious so idk why you'd disagree tbh.
---
Pogggggg
---
I like to think that the customer retention representative that saw my message about why I was cancelled my sub and under what circumstances I would resub (only once vanilla wow was playable I would renew) brought it up to the king of blizzard and that was the turning point in recreating vanilla wow. What can I say except you're welcome!
---
 Monsters having no dynamic respawn on the Beta is a bug. WoW in general  always had dynamic respawns and not only in the starting Area. Mark Kern  confirmed that.
---
Omg, I remember me vividly dreaming about this keyboard all those years ago. Wow, what a flashback I just got. Had totally forgotten that those even existed. Thanks for the post! :)
---
Meh, at least ally will finally win all the BGs.
---
Why are you on this sub? Sening you my best block so I never have to read your babble again.
---
it is certainly a walled garden propaganda.  Trying to distance the very similar players that play both games of the same name from each other.  I don't know what people like about feeling superior or putting other wow players down when they are playing the same game from different eras.
---
I think you need to pay closer attention to usernames. My only point is that it's gonna be really funny when you guys who are so cock sure about method being able to dominate in the classic wow space with literally only 2 months of prep are proven to be wrong. There are better guilds with better players who have been putting in the time and work to prepare for classic for years and years now.
---
Known on private Servers. They are a good guild.
---
If this goes live (it likely will) it’s gonna change the entire meta. No more Orc Warriors, everyone is gonna roll a Tauren Warrior for pvp.
---
&gt; Mythic+ is a roaring success across almost all layers of the population (casual, semi-core, hardcore). 
---
This is just false. Every person I know that plays WoW thinks this is one of the worst features ever created. It's the reason 2 friends of mine quit the game. It has completely killed raiding.
---
This looks awesome, thanks for the great work! I'm a developer so I can definitely appreciate the work put into this!
---
The worst camper I ever encountered was a human rogue named Farley.
---
I'd love to have a beta invite. Quit acting like a damn baby.
---
&gt;would i just have to suck it up and pay the 50g every time i wanna switch specs? 
---
Yes, if you want to PvP during progression.
---
&gt;would it just be smarter at that point to make 2 different character's (rogue for example) with one spec'd into pve skills and the other spec'd for pvp skills?
---
No. Because your rogue will have shit gear and vanilla is highly gear-based. Ideally you're a PvE spec during progression and you just accept that you aren't getting to PvP, and then when content is on farm you can swap back to your PvP spec.
---
Lol.  It will be impressive if they can get multiple warriors leveled to 60 with non trash gear and attuned in the first week.
---
I don’t know if they’ll be able to get tanks and healers pre bis/flasks and actually do the raid in that time. We’ll see.
---
What if Blizzard makes 1 RP-PVP Server and all the streamers join it?
---
There’s no que in Classic
---
Would be really surprised if they didn’t. TRP3 is really popular. I just hope we get RPPVP servers... and yes I added to the RPPVP post on the forums. And so should you.
---
ohhh
---
Doesnt faerie fire tag or am I misremembering? I know it's a different class but it doesnt do damage
---
Duels are for fun.   It’ll never be balanced.  The most important thing is viewer experience. It doesn’t really matter how fair it is for the contestants.  Whatever makes the best viewer experience is the way to go
---
i was an alliance boi in vanilla but now all my bois are going horde so ima be a horde boi
---
This is getting me so pumped to stream snipe.
---
Found the serial killer
---
correct
---
primarily.
---
Gnome starting area has a quest that takes 2 minutes for 680xp (half of level 4) for bringing a cup of coffee 45 seconds away, then bringing the empty mug back.
---
1,330 xp for "go inside these 2 mines" that are a walk in the park, since all the mobs are dead.
---
The horde are bad guys. You wanna be a bad guy?
---
I’m jk. But kind of serious too
---
Troll is trolling so hard.
---
I've been playing a lock on a vanilla server recently, and I've found that other people waiting at the entrance to dungeons are always willing to join your group to help summon :)
---
&gt; I personally don't enjoy following an arrow from point A to point B that much.
---
Great!
---
Don't install an addon that does that, then.
---
And my point is not whether Method will definitely win or not. I couldn't give a rats ass whether APES, Method or the Flying Fairy Godmother gets the BWL or MC first at the end.
---
My point is that disregarding the amount of collective dedication Method can put into stuff might be very bad for APES and Co.
---
Can’t wait for apes to ruin their classic experience
---
pls add mendro to the rogue pvp list, one of the top. Also the eviscerate series

Why hunters would be better than any other class for over lvl content ?
---
They miss less on higher lvl mobs ?

Unless the boat is at the dock when you arrive there it is quicker to swim it unfortunately
---
I will never understand people who spend time reading and posting on a sub for a game they have no interest in.
---
Rofl what a hypocrite.
---
You're trying too hard, mate.  I believed you were just a generally disgruntled person, but when I read that you enjoyed WoD more than Legion I had a good chuckle.
---
&gt; Credit to anyone that works out quest locations and objectives from the text only.
---
I did that plenty back in the day. I didn't enjoy it.
---
Another great episode Josh. Really enjoyed being on the show. Thanks for having me again :).
---
Yeah grinding 14 and doing island expeditions is not even close to the same thing
---
Love ya /u/joshcorbo82 !
---
No, he was actually pretty unknown/flew under the radar quite a bit - but he massively inspired me and others to try out the hemo build, which was usually dismissed as a "worthless" talent. He inspired quite a lot of more "famous" rogues to try it out, especially Ming, who was a well known/infamous loud mouth rogue at the peak of Classic.
---
He was really the first to demonstrate the effectivenss and control it could give in a fight - in that linked vid, in his first fight, he is able to defeat a rank 13 warrior equipped with a Thunderfury, while he himself is only wearing greens and blues!
---
He did later release a remix of a number of his videos called "back to the vanilla" which got a lot more attention, with about a quarter of a million views on Youtube - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C7Uvt\_0oYs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C7Uvt_0oYs)
---
Someone actually paid like 1500$ lol.
---
Shhhhh. Dont tell the kids
---
Go check out one of the latest episodes of counting down to classic. One of the developers says why that is so.
---
It's exactly the same time allowing for time zones, I believe.
---
Immigrant song,  Led Zeppelin
---
That would take a whole day to complete..
---
Reading isn't really your thing, is it?
---
Priest buffing if fucking terrible. Only experienced players with empathy will get that instead of, “fort pl0x” losers. BTW my rule always was that if i corpse run, you all do. I’ll will not fucking Rez you if you AFK. Fuck off with that bullshit. No mage water? No heals. Mages that give water without asking become macro targets that live forever. :)
---
Personally I would consider 8 hours of doing something INSANELY boring far more impressive than doing something enjoyable (like bg's) for 14 hours, but hey, that's just me.
---
Oh. I see.  Yeah.  being 40% slower than them was a deal breaker.
---
I'm fine with that, mostly interested in it for leveling. I'm aware it doesn't scale super well in end game. Hopefully I'll be able to gear up and tank UBRS, Scholo, etc. But I'm not holding out too much hope that I'll be tanking MC. Mostly playing for the leveling experience anyways.
---
IIRC they were done first/early
---
Shaman tanking is worse than paladin tanking. Just say no. Also, you don't queue for dungeons in classic. You find friends and strangers who want to go with you by networking with friends or traveling to a major city and asking around. Then you travel to the dungeon.
---
I actually don’t watch streamers. Never saw the point, but this prick really motivated me. If he’s on a PvP server in Classic, Where can I sign up for &lt;Blacklisted&gt;?
---
If you want to dictate how I play and how others play the game because your popularity caught on, got another thing comin’ bud.
---
wtf
---
The saying “it doesn’t fit the narrative” is stating that the example is a reach/bad just to try to reinforce an established narrative.
---
Welfare epics started in TBC, flying ruined the world, BGs ruined wPvP, the homogenisation of classes began in TBC as well.
---
Priest is easier.  You get benediction pretty easily which eliminates the competition for two slots for most of the game.  The only thing you really have to compete with all of the other healers for as a priest are rings and rejuv gem.
---
Also,  having raided both at endgame,  I find the priest's gameplay much more satisfying.  Brace yourself to receive a LOT of complaining about totems if you choose shaman.
---
shamans cant really tank in vanilla, you can make it work if you absolutely have to, but its a pain in the ass and youre better off als heal/dps
---
Yeah they wanted to do zone spanning quests throughout but realised after the did those that it just wasn’t viable.
---
It didn't explode 😉
---
As you know there are no women in the Internet.
---
As a Paladin player I informed my boys that if they intend on playing with me they are going ally. If some go horde, they better keep an eye out while they level
---
RP-4-Life!
---
non-RP servers seem so alien to me
---
lol, same here. Even have screenshots of them on my PC :D
---
&gt;Pretty well known fact that people who are willing to cheat a given system (by paying a Chinese botter for ez gold) are more focused on themselves and less focused on others ergo more egoistic and less empathetic.
---
No it is not. A game like GW2 got a system built in so you can buy gold, so that is obviously not cheating. Many might buy gold due to lack of time or simply because they don't enjoy farming. Buying gold in WoW can be the same mentality, that they just don't have the time or enjoy farming gold but still enjoy other aspects of the game. They might not see that it hurts the game, or maybe they don't think buying just once will make a difference. You can't just say "well known fact" as an argument when you clearly haven't even thought it through. And how the fuck does someone buying gold even mean they are less empathetic, that is just bullshit.
---
&gt;It also seems pretty obvious so idk why you'd disagree tbh.
---
Because I have the IQ above a doorknob? Just because you can rationalize something to "seem obvious" does not mean it is true. The media regularly make something seem obvious, yet it is totally fake news. You can also easily use statistics to show something wrong without directly lying. There are tons of examples of why "pretty obvious" is the most dumb way to determine something.
---
I sincerely hope you are trolling.
---
Yep. Misunderstanding what the post is about because he only reads the title and nothing else. It's amazing how often that happens.
---
It is essential buddy stop trying to fool yourself. when you play against other good players you will need engineering if you want to win certain 1vX situations. 
---
How are you going to stop a potential death coil if ur a mage with no ice block on CD that could lead to a immolate conflagration combo? You reflect that shit back at him which u need engineering. How are you going to catch that hunter who is kiting you hard and you already blew your intercept? You hit him with the net or a nade. How are you going to stop that sheep as a shaman once ur grounding totem is on CD or destroyed and you already shocked the first cast? (Btw this is a standard situation in high level pvp since ally try to neutralize an ele sham or focus) You grenade them. How do you 1v2 a priest and warrior as a class with zero cc (aka me a shaman)? You can try to rocket helm the priest and kill the warrior.
---
This guy is a shitposting troll-lord supreme.  Downvote and move on.

If you are looking for a book format, the companies in the US that made that kind of product became extinct with the evolution of the “interwebs.” You May be able to find an old Brady Games guide on eBay.

Otherwise, several people have posted links in this reddit to reference materials. You might want to do a search. I did not bookmark those posts personally, but if I happen across them I will try to send you a note.
---
World seconds
---
Late August will be the official release for Classic. Right now Beta is by invite only.
---
When it comes to shamans people often overlook Purge. It's a one-button solution to a **huge** number of problems in pvp — Ice Barrier, Mana Shield, Power Word: Shield, Bleeding of Freedom, Protection, Sacrifice, Voidwalker Sacrifice, and on and on... You will be absolutely hated by these classes if you use it.
---
Chain lightning is as good as it sounds, but it's worth pointing out ele pvp doesn't kick in until you get substantial gear, gear which really doesn't show up until AQ. Otherwise you'd have to go for tier 0.5 or the pvp officer set which I understand won't even be available for a few months. All of your raiding sets are +healing only.
---
Priest is in a similar boat in that raiding gear is not shadow gear. However unlike Shaman you can't run a hybrid spec and will have to respec every time you want to deal any damage (questing, farming, pvp, whatever). This will cost a ton of gold.
---
Mage will be desirable in raids and be strong in pvp, and also levels much faster and with less gold overhead than your other choices. Finding later dungeons will be a little harder since you're pure DPS, even granting that mages are one of the most desirable DPS classes. Their raiding rotation is also the most brainless of the three but some people see this as a benefit since it lets you focus on other aspects of a fight like positioning.
---
Yep your right about those ones ill get it added, i was thinking i swear there was a rogue with thunderfury PvP movie and there you go haha
---
I was actually in the same guild with him. Definitely underrated.
---
Queue as in choosing what to respond to on 'LF Tank/Heal/DPS'
---
As stated in another post, there is no queue in Classic. You will have to create a group through speaking to people and advertising for groups. Tanks get groups almost instantly compared to other classes. If you are wanting to avoid waiting for instances, then Tank&gt;Healer&gt;DPS is priority and will dictate how fast you get into instances. (On a side note Shammy tank is pretty strong and fast IF played well and geared accordingly, for 5mans.)
---
I never really understood why anyone cares about raid firsts enough for it to draw in sponsors.
---
Like, I kinda understand the appeal for arena (though I still think it's a pretty underwhelming esport).
---
But who really gives a shit who clears wow raids fastest, much less classic raids that have already been done before?
---
Keep some quality of life changes. Srsly. Grinding soulstones sucks major ass.
---
you sir, fail badly at reading comprehension.
---
too much senseless arguing on the internet I suppose.
---
Yes people can do whatever the hell they want.
---
I’ll have to explain this because the reading comprehension of some of y’all leaves something to be desired.
---
Blizzard has stated in a few interviews that they will be listening to the community for phase rollouts. I’m hoping that the minority (hardcore) players flying through content are not the only ones they listen to. Usually the loudest voice makes the decision.... I’m asking the general population to stop and smell the roses for a second, instead of rushing towards the finish line. There will be the majority of players (non-hardcore) that will not be blazing through content like them.
---
&gt; (probably much longer)
---
Can you provide a source for that?
---
Then why don't you have an olympic gold medal in race walking?
---
Apes don't really speed run or care about doing things first.
---
Nah I just genuinely wondered how you want it staggered.
---
no, we pay the iron price
---
Warrior with a class that can throw heals is insanely easy and fast to level. Gearing is another matter. But there is some great boe and craftables. Some of wich are bis throughout the whole of vanilla
---
Yes. You can also do it with gold if you buy a wow token
---
In my opinion, a shammy can tank all lower level instances right up to  Uldaman, without any issue.  Beyond this, tanking gets tougher.   Instances up till this point should be fairly straight forward. 
---
Also remember, there is no LFG tool to queue up as healer or DPS. Groups are made from folk asking for others to run instances.
---
I've been playing classic (on a private server, not sure about beta) and even some beasts do this, I'm not sure how they determined which mobs do this.
---
I know having corruption up wasn’t necessary but the raid leader in my guild had us keep corruption up. I know how to play the class in classic I was even the lock class lead in the guild I was in back then.
---
But maybe you wouldn't have died if you were paying attention. ;)
---
I’m not telling anyone else how to play. I’m just hoping that a small minority doesn’t push the phases to be released too fast.
---
There’s nothing wrong with someone telling you to stop and smell the roses every so often.
---
A less satisfying keystroke has never existed. Dead like shark eyes.
---
Been playing since vanilla. I can still enjoy legion memes though
---
I don't recall these ever being flagged either and I know I killed my way through that place a bunch of times. As for the "Very low level pvp was a way to keep people entertained on launch day" That is nonsensical. There were no southern barrens level alliance anywhere near that place as the only alliance leveling areas were north of the barrens on the Darnassus leveling quest chains and 90% of those players were running wetlands to make their way to Westfall. Alliance didn't show up in the area until the low 40's to run Zul Farrak and even that is 2 zones away.
---
You sound mad and overly invested, man. This is extremely obvious stuff, if something is against the rules because it is detrimental to the experience of the population, and you break that rule for personal gain, that's egoistic.
---
I don't think I could come up with a better example of the word selfish if I tried.
---
Buying gold off a bot is cheating. People who cheat are drastically less empathetic than those who don't. 
---
Other games might let you buy gold, but vanilla wow? Not that I recall tbh.
---
They will be, it just wont be straight away. The developers will need a bit of time to put them together.
---
Paladins are probably the best pvp healers
---
Seeing so many Ravens fans here lmao love it
---
1. Create iPhone app

---
Thank you, Josh. Was just listening to your Frostadamus episode earlier today on the way to the airport. Can’t believe we are so close at last! Cheers!
---
Trick question, this isn't ironforge
---
Not classic , but you reminded me about when that chick traded sex for an epic flying mount in TBC...
---
Right, but you make it sound like their commitment to researching stuff will give them an edge in a WF race. You can do all the research you want, but there is nothing that trumps actual game experience.
---
Or manuals/recipes, different trainers, etc for all professions
---
I'm gonna soak up that nostalgic WoW zone music tbh
---
I started playing vanilla in later patches but the premise is always the same no matter what phase you hit 60 in. Farm the relevant rep for the current raid at time, do your attunements, and make sure to run a few 5 mans a day to get gear/fire resist to raid.
---
The game is out Aug. 27th. The beta invites are for the most part out, they could change it if they decide too, but there are stress tests that allow playing on servers that are being pushed to fail for a couple of days. A lot of those invites are dependent on how much you experienced Vanilla WoW as far as I can tell. I haven't played consistently for years, but I played a lot a decade ago, and got invited to the stress test within 24 hours of setting up my beta opt-in..
---
If you have never played I would suggest possibly playing a private server, but then you risk burn out before the actual game releases. The reason a lot of us are chomping at the bit is because we remember our first times in Azeroth, and you have a chance at a clean slate experiencing the game fresh at release. Other than that, Blizzard will give a free trial and you can level to 20 in modern WoW, but I suggest patience for the Classic release.
---
questie or any other quest addon usually show available quests on the map/minimap. so whenever you are flying etc, check the maps of some zones, often times a quest here and there show up, although not all of them are worth it.
---
&gt;In my opinion, a shammy can tank all lower level instances right up to Uldaman, without any issue. 
---
That's what I thought might be the case but it seems like some people here disagree.
---
&gt;Also remember, there is no LFG tool to queue up as healer or DPS.
---
I really should've worded it better. I'm just refering to responding to LFG/LFM messages. Also, I'm pretty sure you could still queue at the meeting stone, just nobody was using it (Tho that's not what I was talking about anyway).
---
Durotar is my favorite starting zone imo.  Actually I prefer a majority of Horde zones over Alliance
---
Idc about the method debate, however:
---
You dont spend 16 hours a day for 3 months on Rank14, maybe for the last month but before that you can get away with MUCH less.
---
eviscerate/akrios was one of my good friends during those times, was an awesome dude with a lot of skill
---
I don't remember being able to stealth solo elite mobs
---
Ehm, how can they go world first for something that was already done a decade ago? This is a new level of ridiculousness in this whole weird "first" bullshit.
---
I could have swore I remember summoning with them
---
&gt; Tell me a class that 1v1's a priest.
---
Right off the top of my head, Disc Priests with Improved Mana Burn, Warlocks with Drain Mana and Hunters with Viper Sting.
---
Interesting troll.
---
+2 for invention.
---
[...I guess](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/365/753/94c.jpg)
---
I would wait till release of classic instead of jumping into present retail wow. It’s a completely different game and will more then likely just confuse you. Wait to experience the beginning like many of us did and you will see why we want to go back.
---
I posted something about trying to use a 1.11 reference client a few weeks ago and did nothing but start an argument about how Blizzard is right and private server knowledge is skewed. I never once mentioned anything about a private server. People just have a narrative and I guess they have to get it out of their system instead of contributing meaningful thoughts. That will be the last time I try to post anything on the official forums.
---
Hey Dad. I'm Dad too. Also not in the beta.
---
Right? The raids weren't designed to need all of the buffs, they didn't even require a perfect group composition. This is really just for ultra min-maxers and racers.
---
Agreed. Once I started watching some pvp videos and the combos that a grenade could generate I immediately began playing with grenades to see what I could do. As a shaman, getting a nade off could turned into a nice lightning bolt + shock combo that finishes a pvp encounter when I had no chance of getting a cast off due to the opponents interrupts. Since shamans have zero cc other than slows via earthbind and frost shock, engineering gives me a whole new tool kit that vastly increase my ability to win unfavorable match ups or situations.
---
I plan on rolling horde for classic and am going to miss Westfall/Duskwood so much.
---
“but the early alliance zones are 1000x better **to gank** than the horde zones.”
---
Fixed.
---
your pet will outtag most players if standing on the spawn is an option, otherwise you have to wand
---
I know people like to ignore it but IMO its pretty hypocritical. Especially when the reasoning for them being bad is hybrid tax. I could even give a pass on it if we were talking just about druids and paladins because they can do all 3 roles. But shamans and priests are just like warriors. If warriors can perform 2 roles on a high level then shaman and priest should also be able to. Now im not saying they should change this in classic, not at all. It was already hypocritical at the time.
---
Top of Orgrimmar Bank &gt; All of IF
---
3 hours is optimistic for a full clear on lot of content until you've mastered it and are farming it for loot. Though, with a weekly reset on raids, you can absolutely find yourself in a situation where you can only devote a couple of hours at a time on "raid nights" to slow clearing content. There will be a very small percentage of raiding guilds clearing places like Naxx all in one go and if they want to, then good on them but the majority won't have to roll like that.
---
It's not as bad as you remember, I have 50g on my lvl 34 character without going out of my way to farm. Plus you can get the mount cost down by getting rep. 
---
Or just roll a lock ;)
---
No massdispel in vanilla, so no Ice Block/Divine Shield removal
---
I would have happily traded sex for an epic mountsin classic or burning crusade. Sadly there were no offers.
---
It's not a joke, they do it for this exact purpose : a rich dude makes a mistake and BAM you're rich.
---
I'm explicitly not shitting on minmaxers. Nowhere did I say there's anything wrong with minmaxing.
---
800g isnt till phase 3 or 2
---
I dunno, rep grinds were pretty core to TBC, especially Aldor/Scryer. Unique stat boosts, essential crafting recipes, and IIRC access to some raids and such? were locked behind daily-heavy rep grinds. Been a long time but I know I spent an ungodly amount of time doing the same obnoxious daily quests. 
---
I have a lot of nostalgia for TBC, amazing times in dungeons, raids, and PvP, but the thought of doing those dailies again....ugh.
---
Most raids will most likely be done hours after re-release of them. They are all known already and everything up to AQ40 is easier than the first BfA mythic raid.
---
How do you Port out of Mara to the front of the dungeon in classic? I used to farm this way on a pserver and could Port out by having a second account online and in my group then would crash my game and kick my main so he ported to the entrance. I'm not going to have 2 paid accounts on classic though. Is there another way to get yourself to the entrance?
---
Thanks! My bad.
---
Resil was introduced in TBC
---
Personal goal is to take my mage through Naxxramas, at least attempt to farm my absolute bis, and then idk...
---
You should consider tobacco cessation
---
Did you really create an account just to troll one sub? You bored? E3's still on man
---
wat
---
Can someone please do this for Apple?
---
A geared fury warrior is a grinding machine !
---
I raided with Blood Legion briefly during Naxx progression. It was then that I learned what it truly means to have no life.
---
Elwynn, westfall and dusk wood I believe took them 9 months to complete. Then they realized they couldn't spend that much time in every zone or it would take 20 years to release the game.
---
&gt; Right, but you make it sound like their commitment to researching stuff will give them an edge in a WF race.
---
No, what I am saying - quite literally - is to not underestimate the level of dedication and the fact they will be willing to spend the next two and a half months full-time going all in on research and private server tests to find the optimal strategies.
---
The fact is that they *have* game experience. They are familiar with the game and with how to play *efficiently*. Speedruns, pulls, boss tactics and class stacking is all information that is available to them to test out.
---
I am not saying Method is ahead of APES or that they *will* actually get it. What I have been saying the entire time is that it might be interesting and underestimating them is a bad idea.
---
Facials are never overestimated
---
I wonder when the firestone warlocks, priest tanks and ranged warriors crawl out of the woodwork. 
---
While its  fun min-maxing such things and some people collect the gear for the fun of it it's even less viable then Prot Paladins. And that is saying something.
---
why gimp yourself with a shaman tank? they play a similar role like druids, where if your main tank dies a druid can pop in bear form and try to keep the group alive long enough to res the tank.
---
No, they shouldn't.
---
This is my exact reasoning
---
I'll be honest, I assumed he was complaining about the overwhelming negative reception of the first few comments.
---
Yes its worth yes you should play when it comes out. Welcome :)
---
Never even stuck around for mythic+. I came back briefly for WoD, and left as soon as I realized I had to run LFR (aka, face rolling the keyboard while I watched Netflix because it was nigh impossible to wipe) in order to gear up for actual raiding.
---
I understand not wanting to keep 99.9% of your players locked out of the expensive-to-develop raid content, but honestly, I never saw anything past BWL, and I still managed to have a blast. I would rather not see the content at all, than sit through weeks of the content in "participation trophy mode" and be showered with loot.
---
Thank you for the list!
---
If there's no difficulty, then why would Method get wf over any other random guild?
---
Gonna get stomped by a good private server guild on the first MC clear, the rest of the raids they will probably get first kills in though
---
Yup, fuck Naxx. People keep talking about patch 1.13 as an alternative to TBC - any version of 1.13 that includes Naxx is dog-shit. Fuck Naxx. The content may be cool (never raided it in vanilla, but cleared it in WOTLK) but the gear just completely fucks up the game. Naxx's itemization is basically "we know TBC is on the horizon, we know people are getting tired of the game, we will release a patch we know has broken itemization to keep people excited and subbed". It's like the TBC pre-patch but for raiders. 
---
Classic WoW peaked in terms of "game feel" in T2 IMO. A solid raid tier, BWL gear is insanely iconic and beautiful (that infographic with the T2 pally and shaman sets triggered INSANE nostalgia), it was well-balanced against the rest of the game (stronger than blue/world epic stuff, but no so much that the entire balance of the game went out of whack), dragons are just cool, BRM was still the hot-spot. I'll probably play Classic WoW phases 1-4 and then quit when Phase 5 drops. I have no interest in seeing classic slowly crumble to shit, especially if Classic doesn't get TBC (TBC saved Vanilla).
---
Imagine walking around with some dudes cut off finger.
---
Some minor changes could have a large impact on raid comps. I.e. Stacking sunder armor like abilities will most likely not be on live drastically decreasing melee's value and tank threat generation. Biggest advantage is probably leveling to 60 for world first Rag, that edge will diminish with Naxx.
---
no need to min max in that case, go for the pvp races (gnome/dwarf)
---
They probably don't know yet, plus this is like 2-3 years away probably. TBC release is the most likely so plan accordingly.
---
&gt;This is extremely obvious stuff
---
You keep saying that as if it is an argument. Just because you think it is obvious does not mean it is true.
---
&gt;if something is against the rules because it is detrimental to the experience of the population, and you break that rule for personal gain, that's egoistic.
---
I already addressed this in my previous comment. People might not see it as ruining the experience of others. They might not understand the consequences. Or they might not think that one more changes anything. So you can't say it is egoistic, depending on how much they know about it, it is no more egoistic than using cheats in a single player game.
---
&gt;People who cheat are drastically less empathetic than those who don't
---
Show me the trustworthy study that backs up that claim.
---
&gt;Other games might let you buy gold, but vanilla wow? Not that I recall tbh.
---
I didn't say that at all. I explained the mental state of buying gold not meaning less empathy, thus concluding it is only the cheating part that can possibly be linked to it - so if they don't view it as cheating they don't have less empathy. *This* is what you call obvious.
---
You seem to lack the basic ability of reading and understanding a text, you don't use any studies to base your "facts" on and you repeat the same things after I've pointed out how flawed it is, not even *trying* to accept that it could be wrong or at least further explain why you think it is true. Just repeating. These are all traits of someone extremely dumb, so I'll just stop arguing with you now, you clearly don't know what you are talking about and can't be reasoned with.
---
Your arguments do not break my logic. All I am saying is that if you buy gold, you keep the system of hacking, botting and spam in tact. This means you value your personal time more importants than other people's grief. Which means you have less empathy than people who do not buy gold for the reason they think it's detrimental to the game and enjoyment of others.
---
The same mentality is that of people ganking a lowbie over and over again. I would not do that because I would not like to be on the receiving end. Other people may not have that thought. They just lack the empathy for that. *I don't know that person, fuck 'm.*
---
Lacking  a certain degree of empathy or being more/less egoistic does not mean a person is inherently bad or worse than someone else. It means just that: You have less empathy than people not buying gold because they think it lessens the state of the game *for others.*
---
Company directors also fall in this category. To end up so high in the chain of command, you need a certain ruthless many people do not possess.
---
No, there’s no indication that there will even be a post-classic plan At this point. Everyone needs to calm down, enjoy what we’re getting before worrying about what to play in 2.5 years.
---
You mean without a tank?
---
legends say he's still clicking his abilities
---
Yeah it works great for lower level 5 mans just run a lot of Eagle gear and you'll be fine don't worry too much about defence just pad with high stam/int. UBRS is basically untankable for a paladin i tried it and it was super hard. Granted i was also in pre-raid bis for a warrior tank gear. So i was able to survive the damage it is just the mana is your biggest issue. You will have to go holy first 20 points for concecration, then prot to effectively tank while leveling. It works great for leveling, just once you get max level the mobs HP increases so much so that it gets hard to keep up the mana to maintain the ability to keep threat.
---
Just turn the sounds up, scroll in so it’s first person and enter the world.
---
Is this a serious post ?
---
Depending on the keyboard you can actually just wash it in the dishwasher.
---
who cares about tbc? its a trash expansion anyways, pretty much shattrath afk simulator
---
overrated as fuck, ill probably stop playing when they go past classic
---
People used to quit in vanilla all time. The game was harder than today's games, but people were the same. 
---
Some people are cool. Some people are not cool
---
If its a unique mob (quest boss etc.) with known spawn your best bet is melee tagging. Otherwise immolate, you can see melees running to mobs and casters cast to judge if its worth trying to tag if its uncontested it doesnt matter how you tag.
---
The Infographic is missing 9,000 more things that are different.

Hey! I am playing wc3 right now for the lore also right now and it’s a lot of fun. Do you think the chronicles series is the best way to get a background on the lore before classic launches?
---
/ignore Mom
---
OHHHHH I get it
---
I didn't start until quite late in Vanilla and I remember them being flagged, I believe they were in TBC even. Never seen any Alliance travel that far to take advantage of it, but still, I remember thinking back then that it must've been a feature added for launch day PvP.
---
My main will be a shaman. I just want to level a tank for when me and the boys.jpeg can't find a tank. If people want to be babies and not take a feral tank because streamers told them not to then that's their problem, not mine.
---
Far left, always! :)
---
That is true, however most classes used talents from multiple spec trees which is definitely different from retail
---
Well uploading app to Apple Store costs 100$/year. So I just suggest using web pages. One guy made [this](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/) and I think it's very good.
---

Isn't that the citadel?

---
Roll a lock ;)
---
it could be called Campfire
---
The Classic "Race" is entirely different.  You are starting with NOTHING.  No gold.  No gear.  Level 1 characters.  No one to really help you since the faster you level, the more alone you are.  No time for professions.  
---
Honestly this "race" will be pretty fun because it actually will depend on who can get 30+ characters to 60 and attuned.  They might not even have epic mounts by the time they kill Rag.  
---
It's going to be a totally different feel because the race is less about downing the boss and more about getting enough people to max level, and MC attuned.  I personally look forward to 5 days of meme spam in Josh's chat and it's going to be even more ridiculous because there is plenty of time for streamer interaction while leveling.
---
It'd be useful if it told you what level the talents required
---
I agree on TBC being trash, but if they decide to take that route, I don't want to be stuck on a useless faction.
---
Why do you think that and assume a person can only have 2 hours a day to play? I can play 7pm to midnight every day while having a career, marriage, home, and kids. If a person can't set aside the time, that's fine, but people make time for the things they like to do.
---
It's a guild effort, it's not 40 individuals trying to level, once the first couple people reach 60, they're gonna tag level people... hard.
---
Hey guys looks at my wow game guide post#727581

Druids can most certainly tank in Dungeons before and at 60 without an issue. I thought Shaman might be in a similar state.
---
No idea why they'd have an issue. You just dont have a taunt. But if you are using a shield and 1hander, and your group give you sufficient time to build up threat, then no reason why you cant tank them. 
---
Remember warriors and Pally's will be wearing Mail &amp; leather gear in low level instances too. So as long as the healer is ok, you'll be fine. 
---
Just keep your eye on their mana, and dont crazy pull while they are drinking...haha ;)
---
For me: Class/spec balance + 25 man raids + arena's and pvp gear
---
The only help you get is a quest tracker with vague quest descriptions.
---
But eviscerate is an abdominal attack. It’s literally what the word means. “E-viscera” lit “to remove the viscera (guts).”
---
You can’t eviscerate a neck. That would be garrote.
---
this is actually nice to hear. I lusted after this thing so hard and never ever had one. It's kinda a relief to hear I dodged a shit coloured bullet.
---
It's obviously a joke lol.... OP /r/AteTheOnion (and everybody else here who didn't actually watch the video).
---
The whole point of World Firsts is learning new mechanics, not replaying what everybody knows to get the quickest speedclear. Although Im sure speedclears will be a thing in classic.
---
If your group holds together then I'd say warrior no doubt. Having a pocket healer turns you in to a rage-mongering burst damage juggernaut and while you'd normally get kited and CC'd all day being dispelled will solve all of that for you. Your group being fully rounded for instances on the way to 60 is an obvious plus. You will get choice rolls on all warrior gear from Corpsemaker to Herod's set and stay on top of the power curve all the way forward. And as far as "work hard but pays off long down the road characters" warrior is the apex, with warlock as a close second.
---
Otherwise if your group disbands or your healer won't be as interested in pvp frost mage will check your boxes better. You never feel like you're out of options when playing a mage and shatter burst never gets boring.
---
Alliance have inferior racials across the board (both PvE and PvP), no significant geographical advantages (none in Outland, and I guess they have slightly easier access to Kara maybe, but nothing really impactful).
---
Ret paladins on alliance are also shittier than on horde.
---
Outland is also a tiny continent with flying, which makes wpvp really boring and contesting Outland when the majority of  the playerbase is horde is shit, unlike in Vanilla where Alliance generally have supremacy in EK.
---
There's still tons of classic guides online, and addons such as questie that are super helpful :)
---
Ooga gang
---
&gt;All I am saying is that if you buy gold, you keep the system of hacking, botting and spam in tact. This means you value your personal time more importants than other people's grief. 
---
This right here is the core of why you are wrong. You assume that if someone buys gold they do so while thinking it brings someone else grief.
---
Many people will not think this. They might honestly believe "one more doesn't change anything", or they might be totally unaware of how it effects other people (not everyone sits on reddit reading about how Chinese goldfarmers ruin the game, some people just play).
---
The fact that buying gold is part of the problem is in a sense irrelevant to whether or not someone has empathy. What matters is what the person himself *thinks*.
---
For example (and this is obviously just a hypothetical scenario), imagine a guy that thinks Chinese people are really poor and thus kind of see this as "donating" to someone less fortunate. This would actually mean he has more empathy than most people by "donating" to strangers just because they have less.
---
The point of that example is that reality isn't what matter, what a person thinks and believes matters. You can't just say "oh, he bought gold so he lacks empathy".
---
Of course some people will buy gold fully knowing it furthering a problem for other people, but you can just generalize it to everyone.
---
And in sure im gonna be able to find a couple of like minded people for it not to become an issue
---
Trash post.
---
Absolutely. Especially the first book is such a massive addition to the story. You get to know how azeroth was formed, where the orcs come from, why Sargeras is evil, stuff like that. In chronological order.
---
The second book is more what can be read in the warcraft books, like how the horde formed, the war of the ancients, background of drainei, thrall and so on.
---
I heard wow classic contains a lot of retcons, so we should be prepared for that, but besides that I definitely don't regret to have bought the chronicles.
---
Not at all. And I agree that everyone should be there welcome to play what they’d like. 
---
The issue I have is when people that play clearly inefficient and retarded specs then throw temper tantrums when they are told to respec or are not coming to the raid and then from them complain about elitists. 
---
I agree - if you are in this sub just calling people morons left and right - you’re an ass and I get that.  But what I also see is anyone saying “ret is bad” which is an objectively true fucking statement getting lumped in with being an elitist asshole. 
---
That’s stupid and it should be addressed as such. 
---
There are specs that are just bad. Through and through. Some kids think they can change the numbers but at the end of the day - they can’t.  BUT if that’s what they want to play and they are happy with it then by all means - you do you.
---
Also bagnon and something like selljunk, hopefully one that also does auto repair/restock.
---
I'd also like something that can show a soulstone cooldown without needing to summon a soulstone.
---
You weren't fucking the keyboard were you?  Your review could read either way...
---
&gt; resto sham, arms warrior, holy pally combo in 3s
---
Bringing back some nightmares. I played this comp for a period of time during BC (about 1/2 of season 2 IIRC), depending on opponent's comp you can literally lust twice in the same match it lasts so long. I recall it holding up well against RMP (which was the meta) but god damn if you went against some sort of cleave comp with a Druid healer this was going to last forever.
---
Can we get a mod in here to clean up all these garbage posts that are coming in? Holy god they're getting aweful.
---
I dont need no pugs/gear oe whatever to ruin someones fun
---
TBC was my favorite part of all of warcraft and I'm a day1 vanilla player. It was because I was in a hardcore raiding guild and got to play with some really good people, but also the zones were awesome, old world cities were still populated, arenas were in the game, and each class was balanced, the raids were better, pretty much everything about the game was just better. it still had all the rpg elements and mmo aspects we loved but was just a more polished game by that point. even early wotlk was a great xpac, towards the end is when it started to turn to shit, and every xp after that has been complete garbage
---
Ok. Then also yes. I usually watch Cdew or Venruki and they win pretty often. Probably not as much as Esfand and co. but way more than 0 as you suggest.
---
I believe Esfand and co. have an advantage right now in that most private server veterans rolled alliance and they obviously have the game experience advantage and also Alliance has Paladins which are more reliable than Shamans.
---
It also feels like Alliance is way more and tryhard and they are playing like they have something to prove while horde is chill and having fun.
---
Thanks.
---
If this sub now agrees that Method going hot in classic is good, but streamers are bad for the game, I don't know what will happen next.
---
Imagine Method streaming it, complete anarchy
---
1 - They probably don't know yet.
---
2 - Rushing a decision when we're not even out of Classic Beta sounds like an AWFUL idea.
---
3 - You're not entitled to an answer
---
Imagine actually caring about "world firsts" in a re-release of a 15 year old game.
---
I totally get where you’re coming from, but I think it will be an overall average for total time. You’ll have days where you can play and days where you can’t play. By all means, I’ll be staying up to midnight some nights, but others I won’t even log on at all, so my average will dip down.
---
We all know our SOs won’t be okay with us playing every single night haha. Still gotta spend time with the SO to keep them happy at home.
---
It might be a number just being thrown out there, but it’s about the right amount for all my friends I play with. We probably have an average of 2 hours a night.
---
It’s not just nostalgia. I enjoyed tbc and even wrath slightly more than classic. Don’t get me wrong, it’s very close for the trilogy, I love them all personally. I’m honestly no changes for the most part, a lot of people dislike flying but honestly the zones were designed with flying in mind so it’s not like we can take that out. 
---
For me, what really stands out for me in burning crusade is it feels like all the vanilla stuff still means something, all the minerals, herbs, etc are still used so people can level up professions, people still spend tons of time leveling up alts in kalimdor and ek, because there is no choice to boost. Some people still raided mc to get the Thunderfury they never got; naxx is still in the game. But the raid progression in BC was fantastic imo. Kara is hands down one of the most flavorful and immersive raids, I had so many good times with irl friends and guildies in that raid, the music was so good too. 
---
BC was an expansion pack that really didn’t feel like it strayed too far away from the classic pillars that made it a great game. My opinion, just figured I would share my thoughts on the topic.
---
You lost, just stop.
---
&gt; After people have multiple max level characters, what's the purpose of new mid-level content?
---
Thorium Point and Revantusk Village were both added in patch 1.5 in order to round out a content drought in the level 45-52 bracket, giving players more choice and spreading players around the available world a bit more. Even though I was level 60 I remember being really excited to log in on patch day, and I headed straight to do the new Hinterlands quests because I liked experiencing the little stories and I loved the feel of the zone.
---
&gt; it would be fixed before launch.
---
My little wow team at Activision-Blizzard will certainly prove you wrong if you look at the track record from wod, legion, and bfa beta bugs.
---
I just dont like this word. It suggest that we should not do our best? Its weird. But maybe im just too old.
---
wait i'm confused. how is Dire Maul a step above MC? it's a dungeon filled with lvl 60 Blue's
---
I thought of giving you a lmgtfy link but you should just use Google scgholar instead. Literally, there are hundreds, dating back to the 60s, students, employees, marriages and yes, even video games. I looked at a few and they all draw the same conclusion : Known metrics for empathy, compassion and responsibility anti-correlate with the willingness to lie and cheat.

---
This last one has a great couple of references immediately following the line beginning "As empathy is negatively related to cheating...". The references here are large studies on empathy and are keystone papers in the field.

---
This last one attempts to explain why the connection exists and covers the relation between empathy, guilt, the percceotion of guilt and anti-social behaviours, including cheating.
---
For the record, my partner is a sociologist and highlighted a few of those for me. Hope it helps you develop your understanding!
---
Jesus. Sorry guys.
---
First of all, engineers and *only* engineers can use and equip engineered items. You can equip smith items, tailored items, leatherworking items, you can drink potions and get enchanted but you can't use engineered items if you're not an engineer.
---
Trinkets. You can craft yourself mechanical dragonlings and chickens to aid you in combat. The combat pet level is your engineering level devided by 5, the maximum engineering skill is 300 and requires level 35, so at level 35 you can have 300 Engi skill and your engineered pets would be 300/5=60. Level 60 pet at level 35. Let that sink in.
---
Bombs. Do fire damage, stun target, all the useful stuff.
---
Portals. If you pick up Gnomish engineering, you can craft a trinket that transports you to Gadgetzan or if you pick up Goblin engineering you can craft a trinket that ports you to Everlook. The portal trinkets are 100% sure to transport you safely to the city, they don't malfunction.
---
Goblin Jumper Cables. Healer died in dungeon? 50/50 chance to bring them back to life.
---
Net-o-matic. Running away from a mob or ganker? Trying to capture a running mob? Kiting? Useful in various scenarios.
---
Gnomish Death Ray. One shot mobs, elites, anything.
---
Repair Bot. Wiped multiple times on Garr and your gear is all red? You can summ the repair bot and continue the raid without having to port and summon back anyone.
---
Not to mention the multiple heads and guns you can craft as an engineer.
---
&gt; MC should come down to speedleveling and the later raids will probably be cleared in an hour after they are released.
---
This is always how it goes on pservers, yes. The first MC clear is whichever guild has enough people poosocking their way to level 58 or so and getting enough quintessences to summon Rag.
---
After that, literally every raid release is cleared within 4 hours of launching.
---
always the one in the middle
---
"Ooga booga" was used to make fun of black people before 4chan was even a thing.
---
I always chose the guys on the left.
---
The content is still there for you to do... YOU are choosing not to raid and then telling everyone else that they should wait for YOU, because of YOUR choice to level more than one character.  That's the epitome of selfishness.  
---
"I don't want this content to come out, because I only play 2 hours a week and want to level multiple characters."
---
Very cool!
---
Thanks, I just got the 1st volume!
---
I’ve sold most of my keyboards.
---
I disassemble, clean and disinfect all keys and the board itself, then put it back together, take decent high res pictures, and take the money.
---
Though, I have seen people trying to sell what looks like dusty cum stained keyboards, the ads just expire.
---
I meant like if you have a resto druid he can pop into bear to tank a bit. Shamans can technically tank dungeons, definitely not raids. They aren't designed to tank, more like an off-tank at best.
---
You should lose 50 Dollars, Krones, or Pesos for not understanding what's happening here.
---
They fixed a lot of the bullshit people like to bitch about in Vanilla and call it nostalgia. It maintained many of the challenging aspects of Vanilla that made it fun to play but polished it.
---
You'll really want to join groups in those zones to share quest progress. It's a lot easier for 5 people to spread out and tag 12 mobs than it is for one person.
---
All real MT's are Taurens
---
Pete and repeat were on a boat. Pete fell out who was left?
---
I don't know where your english is from, but in my english dad and dead sound *very* different.
---
This has always been and will always be my favorite vanilla wow video of all time.
---
So they're going to streamroll everything in sight
---
But people won't even give it a chance. Feral puts up good numbers, better than hunters and locks at many stages, but people are so stuck in their fury warrior meta they won't consider it at all
---
Interesting. I understood consecration as mostly being relevant for multi-target non-elite pulls, and otherwise there are simply better, more mana-efficient strats for holding aggro, particularly against single targets.
---
Edit: by this, I meant that I thought it would be better to go into prot for imp righteous fury before going holy for cons.
---
Damn you raided scholo with barrack before he ran for president, that’s legendary
---
Having dead servers isn’t a problem? Have you ever even played on a dead server? 
---
Or are you trying to say that you don’t think servers will die if they stop receiving updates and a new server is opened?
---
Nah I don't think so, the only way I'm imagening that happening is the ally player pool being much bigger because there are so many children (children=people who pick alliance)
---
What's the dilemma?  There's only The Horde and the people we kill.
---
Edit - There isn't less incest on the Alliance.  The history of human nobility is fraught with incestuous relationships.
---
Because it’s method, I know a lot of people here don’t play retail but if you did then you’d understand the commitment of going into BFD with 3 characters who have main level 44 necks and alts 42 when a mythic raider who was taking the game pretty seriously like myself had a single character with a neck level of 39.  
---
Method will be practicing now, they will have members creating weakauras’s with optimal roots and addons that complete quests for them etc. Their job is to optimise this shit, I really don’t think anyone else can compete but I’m looking forward to being surprised by pserver community.
---
I like tbc. But there’s problems with it that put me off, one in particular was the nerf to aoe farming (10 max mobs) any more than that made your damage be split between the mobs making it stupidly hard pulling more than that.
---
Was my point ever just about farming mats? Restating as it appears it gets overlooked in each reply as they focus on one small aspect and not the WHOLE experience.
---
Nah, hard is appropriate and the definition seems to fit perfectly.
---
I don't remember these complaints at all. TBC was great raiding, Kara like it should be was complete-able by all skill levels and SSC and TK were just the right mix of difficulties with epic scale final encounters. BT and hyjal were shit tier though. Archimonde was nice because he made your worse raid members be the slightest bit responsible for themselves. Sunwell was some of the most fun I've ever had in WoW and I have never heard complaints it was too easy.
---
Too late Method, streamers already got all the “world firsts” in closed beta.
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:
---
- [/r/vanillawowservers] [I built a Talent Calculator with a "talent order" feature to supplement leveling guides](https://www.reddit.com/r/vanillawowservers/comments/bzs2ee/i_built_a_talent_calculator_with_a_talent_order/)

---
i love paladins even though I am an avid horde player, i don't mind being constricted to pretty much healing, but i cannot get over the fact that my righteous avenger of justice has to flop around in an ugly dress
---
Blood Legion is Back. Basically the whole vanilla roster is sitting in a discord right now just waiting to play. There are a few of us in Beta
---
They have no idea which route they want to take yet. 
---
In some of the interviews from May 7th the devs said they are listening to the community and would be up for going in a number of different routes depending on what we the people actually want. They spoke of TBC / Wrath, and they also mentioned possible new content for vanilla. 
---
The bottom line is they just dont know what they want to do yet and are waiting to see how classic pans out. There is a HUGE hype behind classic right now and it will easily surpass modern day wow numbers; however, we don't know if it's goig to stay huge or worth their time for more development. 
---
It won't take as long to develope TBC / Wrath expansions if thats the way they decide to go. Maybe a year now that they have the base client down, maybe a little longer. Either way, even if it takes 2 years again to develop we have time. We don't want to run into a situation again where they release naxx and then within 6-12 months release TBC again so nobody clears Naxx like back in the old days because they're just worried about copying their character over to new stuff. 
---
People -- Just be patient and play classic.
---
I’m all for success, but we need to be very careful. The tone in here is already starting to change and I am getting concerned that the lesson of WHY Classic is good is going to be lost in the mass migration over from BFA. If we’re not careful history is going to repeat itself.
---
Mark my words - 3 months into Classic you are going to have a significant, loud minority crying for introduction of BFA features into Classic.
---
Forewarning, that sheet (while extremely comprehensive) is based on 1.4 itemization and a lot of it is outdated for 1.12. Some of it should be alright; but for instance they don't have the Guiding Staff of Wisdom listed for priests, but list things like the staff of the blessed seer.
---
&gt;They might not even have epic mounts by the time they kill Rag.
---
They certainly won't if they want to be the first to kill him.
---
As a rockhound irl, can confirm.
---
Hi, /u/Eddmnd
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bzs42l/lf10m_eu_alliance_hraiding_guild_english_speaking/).
---
This is a guild consisting of many of the best WoW players to ever play the game who are also capable of nonstop playing for weeks on release without having to worry about responsibilities. When they’re racing to a goal that’s when they are the most excited to play even if that means grinding, it’s the post world first raid logging that they don’t enjoy but are still willing to do as they have shown time and time again, because it’s worth it to them when the next raid drops. I would not be at all surprised if they are running MC splits within the first 1-2 months to feed gear to their mains. Method will have a very good shot at world firsts unless they get screwed by patch times and US clears within an hour head start, which is very possible. Also, classic has nothing to do with striving for perfection gameplay wise unless you’re talking about perfectly spending your time grinding efficiently.
---
What exactly about it do you consider trash?
---
Idk. With the recent 30-40 grind a lot of streamers/pserver people straight up farmed SM because of the group xp rates. It'll be interesting to see if dungeon grinding with a group is worth it beyond 40 because if so they'll have the gear at 60 to clear it and they can easily fill the groups.
---
Edit: I agree first week will be insane, but I can totally see their tanks at 60 and geared enough for MC in under 10 real days.
---
Maybe in a year and a half, sure.
---
Because the game will need updates and new content eventually to survive, just like OSRS did (and it worked, OSRS has thrived for many years when people thought it would die in months).
---
It's not that Vanilla was perfect and had infinite longevity in its vanilla state. It's that Vanilla was a better version of the game before Blizzard made the mistakes they made in subsequent expansions. The game needed updates, just not some of the ones they gave us.
---
They  need to just poll all content updates and require a 75% vote to pass, just like OSRS.
---
I never thought about it like that, seems the hearthstone art is more accurate than the WoW art :')

What a good day to learn things!

You conveniently *still* ignore everything else I said. Actually my whole main point. You apparently either lack the intelligence to understand it, or you ignore it because you know you can't argue against it. Whatever :)
---
Well said it's not hard it's a struggle. It feels earned.
---
Well if the Pete portion fell off then all that's left is... Omg no... REEEE
---
And as for specifically what parts of TBC I'd want: Arena, 25 man raids, Class balance. Just leave flying mounts out and you're good, honestly.
---
repeat
---
4 days 20 hours by Joana
---
The world, dungeons, raids, items, class changes, difficulty, etc, etc.
---
&gt; Proof? Just look at the time line of wow. With each patch, the game became progressively more and more casual until we got the retail. 
---
Nah, mate, kind of the opposite.  My original guild's slipped down to barely anyone logging on because the game introduced more and more grinding.  BFA's the worst it's been lately, with grinding for the neck, grinding for rep, and grinding dailies ("world" quests) praying that the gear you get is actually an upgrade but not knowing because it's all tied to RNG.  The current state is designed for people to be logged in longer.
---
In Cata, I had a character I played most of the time with my guild, but wanted to make another one my main.  He was max level but horribly geared.  Didn't take too much effort to get him geared well enough to be raiding competently, though.  Ditto for later when I wanted to test Enhancement.  Heroic dungeons dropped loot that was worth using, JP and VP let you get armor pieces and target slots you were having bad luck with, and even crafted gear was worth using if you needed it (and wasn't so expensive to craft that it was obnoxiously expensive on the AH).
---
Man... professions... oof.  These days you've got special mats in each tier that you need for recipes, plus Expulsom, plus rare crafting mats that are hard to find, i.e. Anchor Weed for Alchemy, so you have to grind all kinds of content to keep up with a profession, which is kind of moot because most professions seem to be pretty much worthless in BFA.
---
I'd be ashamed of my stupidity after typing out a sentence like that
---
Listen I got a buddy who is an expert in these kinds of keyboards.  I'll give him a call and he'll come down and appraise it for you.  We can go from there.
---
Speak 3 Names, and a man will do the rest...
---
Oh my god that’s progression. When brought down to that simplicity... D:
---
Originally I just made a toon on my sister's server this time I'm definitely going for the best named server. After that I'll find a guild and so on.
---
People are saying there's no "queue," but isn't that what the meeting stones did? Or is that only on private servers? There is still a queue, but we don't know how many people will use it.
---
And share my valuable exp with others?
---
Not gonna happen,ever (atleast from my side)

---
How dare she charge more than $0.50!!
---
I dont know what this guys problem with spriests is. He is trying so hard to tell everyone they suck. I think maybe he was terrible at playing them and is jow trying to justify that by saying they suck. 
---
It's pretty common knowledge that spriests wreck  people 1v1 but then usually need to drink before fighting again. And generally they aren't as useful against coordinated healers who will just cleanse everything. 
---
But duels, wpvp, and 1v1 scenarios they are strong
---
Actually they can catch you on ground mount. You  see ground mounts are on the same levels as players so lets say a warrior is on you... they spam hamstring so you aint going nowhere.
---
But on flying mount that wont matter, at some point you can no longer use hamstring because they are so high up in the air you cant reach.
---
Flying mounts are safer in every way. Its pretty much the reason why semi-organized world pvp died on my server, people just stopped doing it since it wasnt fun anymore. Every encounter ended in alliance vs horde staring contest midair, where as before that we had the opportunity to kill them and chase them off our lands.
---
So people stopped doing it when people stopped "defending their lands". It was fun during tbc and wotlk, it died out rapidly during cata after flying was introduced everywhere.
---
This is just my experience ofcourse.
---
I can smell your fedora from here
---
So?  They’re not obligated to. No one is. You can’t have it both ways. 
---
You’re allowed the freedom to play whatever you want. In the same breath - I’m allowed to tell you to fuck off. 
---
You can’t tell people they’re not allowed to tell you how to play and then also bitch because they don’t want THEIR play experience dictated by you either.
---
it's really hard to tell. the original vanilla launch was a complete nightmare, and even some recent expansion packs have been awful. I think with the tech they're using behind the hood such as layering and using the stress tests to get an understanding of how the servers will be utilized, you shouldn't have an issue logging in on day1. I would take the day off if you want to start as soon as you can, but you will still be competing with a lot of players especially when it launches. day 2 will likely be a lot smoother, not just logging in, but even just progressing through the content.
---
Shaman tanking in RFC, WC, SFK, even RFK is pretty simple and smooth. After that it starts to get sketchy. You don’t have the threat/control resources that druids and warriors do, so you’ll fall out of favor there. 
---
Anecdotally I tanked BRD as a shaman at level 55, with a 59 priest healing and some great cc dps (hunter, mage and a rogue I believe). We did the whole dungeon and it took a long time (3+ hours). This was all with guild mates however, the higher you go the tougher it’ll be, but it’s not impossible. I wouldnt recommend it above the entry level dungeons tho, unless your group is very patient
---
You're a good boi
---
question to RP´ers; how do you deal with death? that is, my players death and going to kill ragnaros for the 4th time.   
---
RP seems interesting as its fun to talk like the character and imagine there is some persona there but playing RP kinda feels weird with the farming and death.  
---
i guess i could just delete the char if i die and only go molten core once but still, my character would live in a world were death has no meaning. yet death is everywhere.  
---
help please.
---
And most important, Kara
---
Only if you will be ok with server lag and crashes as well as login issues.
---
Three flares, that's some serious radius.
---
Personally, I would take time off a few weeks to a month after launch. It can help you finish off your journey to 60 and even work towards Pre-raid BiS. This also prevents you wasting holiday time in queue, or just not able to log in at all due to server crashes. That being said if you want to see the chaos, taking off launch day could be fun.
---
.. People have tested and posted it on the Blizzard forums more than here. More posts will (more likely) not hurt but a petition is a bit over the top.
---
The Lambos in their garages from all the twitch streaming revenue
---
imo, i’d wait. i’m only playing launch cause i’m a college student, and who cares about college. i’d give it a try after work and see how it does because frankly i think it will be a mess
---
Frankly if you have the best route, you don't need years of practice.
---
To make the best route will take a lot of time of course, but they could "buy" it from some pserver fan.
---
TBC contains many inoffensive 'quality of life' improvements. Guild banks, 25m content, arenas. 
---
Instead of being its own game, TBC feels like Classic 1.5 -- a slightly updated version of something I like.
---
I don't get it. Could someone explain?
---
If you dont have time for this you sure as hell dont have time for retail either.
---
Read it again. He said world firsts are pointless then gave an alternative server first
---
In phase 1, according to a quick video, HoJ is the BIS for hunter in p1. I do personally a agree it should go to melee first, since they can make full use of the trinket, but that doesn’t make it not BIS. Rune of the Guard Captain came out in patch 1.5, which is not phase 1. I cannot find a Devilsaur Talisman, so I cant comment on that.
---
Raids and dungeons and their designs and mechanics. Class balance. Sockets and gems were a nice addition to gearing (though of course you just min-maxed it).
---
What I didn't like: late-game badge gear. Shattrath as a hub and the attunements to raids. (Or more specifically how they worked and what they caused. i.e player poaching and running newbies for attunements and them disappearing. Too much drama).
---
People often mix up the terms "Casual", "Easy to use", and "Rewarding" often using them interchangeably.
---
Trying to think of a way to put this without creating a massive wall of test but this comes down to a lot of what is wrong with modern WoW content. Edit: **I failed! TLDR at the bottom.**
---
Classic WoW was slower. The level up sound was far more rare and each level brought a new milestone. Your abilities improved incrementally by having to train new and better levels of your existing spells and abilities at an actual trainer. Some may call this cumbersome but it really added a lot to the game. When your character reached that new level, the gain was not immediate. You traveled to a city with a sense of anticipation. "Oh man, I finally get that next level of Overpower, frost bolt, sinister strike etc." then you think about those mobs you were just killing and how much smoother those kills are going to go with your new ability. Maybe you are low on gold so you have to budget what to train now vs later so you can keep saving for your first mount.
---
You go to the trainer, learn the new abilities one by one seeing that yellow flash, then you add them to your action bar. One by one, look at those icons.
---
You were involved in your character's new level for at least 20 minutes before you even got to use it. 
---
It meant so much more. Every gear upgrade, spell or ability upgrade, every bubble of experience was one more step that you had behind you and one more toward 60.
---
Then you took that new level and put it to use. If you only had a couple of hours a night due to work, school, or family obligation that was ok. You could run 5 - 10 man instances with enemies that dropped specific loot that you wanted. Every class had its own set of blue armor and for the first time you had a class "look" instead of the tan legs, red helmet, teal boots harlequin you used to be.
---
It took a long time to complete your Valor, Devout, Shadowcraft, Elements, Lightforge etc. When your piece didn't drop, you could bet that the one that did was for one of your friends. You had to travel all over the world to get the set so you saw a diverse series of environments and enemies.
---
Later on, having finally conquered that hurdle, if you found yourself surrounded by like minded individuals you could dip your toe into raiding. Suddenly you had a whole new set of gear in front of you in Molten Core. When you wore this, people knew who you were. They knew what you had done.
---
That was what made classic not only casual friendly but friendly to all levels of play. Not much time, there were more dungeon instances in classic than any other expansion. Time a few nights a week? Low tier raids, just for you in Molten Core and ZG. Lots of time? BWL, AQ and Naxxramas are right there.
---
**TLDR:** Classic wasn't just casual friendly, it was everyone friendly. It had more meaningful progression that you could follow at your own pace and it even had tiered difficulty in end game raiding the "casual raiders" or the hardcore.
---
Tier sets from dungeons through raids made progression tangible and gave a specific goal for a specific task and you wore them like a badge of honor.
---
Anyone else thought that making bolvar the lich king made no fucking sense?
---
I had the battlefield version. Quit working very quickly in
---
PvE launch experience day 1:
---
PEOPLE.
---
FUCKING.
---
EVERYWHERE.
---
Getting mobs will be a pain as the zerg of players will make the first, about 20 levels be kind of a slog fest. Once you are ahead of the zerg, it's pretty empty. if you're starting a day or so behind, it'll be packed but not super tight.
---
That's most of the expectation, if you are leveling alone it'll feel chaotic. if you have a buddy it's nice to have a laugh together. Finding mates for dungeons will be you questing while spamming/browsing any world channels the community makes, or the general chat of the zone if the dungeon is in it. And it'll be like that until 60, when its time to start gearing and farming professions for raiding or PvP or both.
---
PvE is like the above, except in contested zones, you'll be susceptible to attacks/ganks from the opposite faction. And people crying for help who are being ganked.
---
TL;DR: It's going to be a cluster fuck.
---
Yes they do but they are rarely used and near useless from what I recall.
---
1. All of you need to already be at the dungeon to queue so you can gather people with just /say at that point.
---
2. They gather 5 random classes so it can easily be 5 dps.
---
Hey. Im trying to figure out which Class I'll play in Classic: **Mage or Rogue.**
---
Some quick points:
---
* I only played WoW for 4 months and it was during the beginning of BFA. Casual player. A bit overwhelmed back then, so many addons, rotations, specs, etc. Felt like I was too late to the party, everybody knew so much, and I was just noobing around lol but it was really fun!
---
* On BFA I played a bit of DH (main), Mage, DK, Warrior and Monk.
---
* Like I said, Im more like a Casual player, so I would be playing something like 4 hours a day.. a little more on Sundays. I'll probably follow some builds and guides on the chosen class.
---
* Maybe I should roll a "beginner friendly" class in Vanilla? Simpler rotation, more forgiving? I dont know if thats even a thing haha whatever..
---
* I dont like to tank or heal, only DPS. Thats one reason why I chose these 2 classes anyway.
---
* I would both PvE (raid/dgs) and PvP (openw/bgs) ... 
---
* Maybe I'll have 2 friends playing with me, but thats not guaranteed. And one of them is definitely rolling a Rogue. We'll probably play Horde characters.
---
* I like both melee and ranged playstyles. 
---
* Aesthetic-wise: Rogue gear/weapons are cooler. Mage spells effects/animations are cooler.
---
* You guys can ask me more questions if that helps you giving me a better advice idk. Thanks for the help!
---
**So what do you guys recommend: Should I pick Rogue or Mage? And why?**
---
I'm gonna be a hunter. No matter how low my dps is gonna be in aq/naxx, this time I WILL GET THAT KT CROSSBOW.
---
If launch of Legion and BFA are setting a new rule. I’d say you will be good. I took off 7 days for the launch. I plan on no lifeing a warrior to 60. At least that’s the plan. If I make it to 40+ with a mount I will be happy.
---
There's a lack of blood in combat animations compared to Vanilla WoW.
---
Ah gee I just cant really put my finger on it /s
---
A fan made event got ~150k viewers on twitch is what happend lol
---
"rogues" and "rare" do not belong in the same sentence
---
Still requires A LOT of time grinding out professions, and relying on BOE's dropping when there aren't a whole lot of players at that level, and someone getting a BOE that isn't going to one of their internal guild members.  
---
AH is going to be pretty slow and I imagine no one is going to have gold to buy a BIS item.  I know for a fact that if I get a BIS item, i'm waiting for people to have gold before I look to sell it.
---
What if i told you that you can still chill in Ironforge as a hordeboi?
---
You just have to call the banners first.
---
If you go to the options and hit build info it shows it there. I have been thinking about making it more visible. Thanks for the input!
---
It made no sense to have Bolvar become Lich King, IMHHO. The reason that "there always needs to be a lich king" flies in the face of lore established in WCIII
---
Hitting Level 40 is lofty, gold is much harder to get
---
MyRolePlay for Classic was, according to the author, 75% functional last time I checked.
---
I created a new post - this one is being removed.
---
I'm 99% set on playing Rogue. Never played it passed lvl 53. Is Hemo a valid spec to raid with? It relies on a debuff but with the 16 debuff limit and the prevalence of melee heavy raid comps I feel like that would be a worthwhile debuff to have on a boss.
---
Story in Vanilla made sense. TBC also made sense though the writing was hackish.
---
Tbc holds perfect balance od hardcore and casual,balance and stuff to do.
---
By far the best expansion and the high point of the game
---
Rogues are one of the most popular classes. They won't be rare on either faction or any race.
---
Atta boi
---
I think you can still do this but with an alt on the same account, just need a guild mate to setup the group / Inc your alt. I think anyway. I also read something about a /camp reset macro but can't remember more.
---
Rogues will be popular. They used to call the game world of Roguecraft for a reason. Hopefully the servers will be balanced. But unless blizzard releases faction numbers during the prelaunch “name saving” period we won’t know.
---
 Hey. Im trying to figure out which Class I'll play in Classic: **Mage or Rogue.**

Fun little fact about MC gear. It had just as much Shadow Resist on its gear as Fire resist:
---
Shadow (31 Items): https://classic.wowhead.com/armor/min-level:50/max-level:70?filter=29:214;2:2717;1:0
---
Fire (33 Items): https://classic.wowhead.com/armor/min-level:50/max-level:70?filter=26:214;2:2717;1:0
---
Even more in Onyxia's Lair (9)
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/armor?filter=29:16;2:2159;1:0
---
Now here is the really funny part. Frost resist drops on gear in Ony (11), but not many Fire (2, and one of them is the priest helm) and fire resist gear drops in MC (33 as I said above) but not in Ony (2, and again one is the priest helm).
---
So what does that mean? The best gear in stage 1 will all have shadow resist gear on it, which not only impacts what damage you can do against someone but just so happens to impact all of your CC as well. 
---
And that is just damage and resist gear working against you, let alone everyone is used to reading up on guides or watching YouTube videos on how to beat what and there is no getting around mechanics like a Shadow Priest without Mana cannot harm you.
---
So yeah, people "wrecked shit" in Vanilla, but this isn't 2004 anymore.
---
You can seperate those elements of the game from RP. Few people are always doing it. Normally you switch it on or off depending on the situation.
---
Here is an infographic from the Nostalrius dev's AMA.

---
Haha, I'm pretty sure this time! Repeat!
---
&gt; if we had only 1 raiding difficulty and power-creep constantly going through the roof.
---
The multiple raid difficulties aren't as much an issue as them having a spread across the difficulties, plus wanting to make each new tier higher ilvl than the last one.  So you end up with constantly progressing ilvls to start with, then tack on -forging so a piece of LFR gear would be as good as Mythic if they didn't add more gap between difficulties.  And how much of a slap in the face would it be to see someone do LFR and get Mythic tier gear?  But yeah, at this point, the "stat squish" (second one!) feels completely moot already, as your power level explodes from the moment you hit 120 to when you're in newest tier stuff, even LFR gear.  It's insane.
---
Worse is how so much of the gear in BFA is RNG based.  Like a quest will say it gives a piece of "Azerite gear" which could be any of those slots, or one says it gives a trinket or ring, so you don't know which and what it'll be.  That's extra annoying when you have, say, a 390 trinket and a 370 trinket and two 390 rings, and you do the quest hoping for a 390 trinket but you get another 390 ring.  Means you're constantly doing quests or dungeons or (Thrall forbid) LFR hoping for a specific slot, but bound to RNG with no way around it, so you might end up grinding for a long time and still not getting an upgrade you need.
---
Are you using google sheets on your local pc or excel? If you are using google sheets, you need to change the data validation for the specialization window on sheet “bislists-v1”. It’s referencing a sheet that doesn’t exist for some reason. It gets jacked in the conversion.
---
Once you correct that validation, it’ll work properly (as best I can tell).
---
hunter is so easy to equip, t1 done t2 done t3 done. 
---
i want to roll heal shaman but the items are so shit, bis looks so shit since its just random greens blue epics.
---
god damit i love classic and shammys but i hate the bis look
---
&gt; We don't want to run into a situation again where they release naxx and then within 6-12 months release TBC again 
---
Uhh??? 12 months of Naxx??? "Content drought" is almost always the worst part of the game, and it is going to be doubly bad with Naxx because Naxx gear is INCREDIBLY toxic to the game. And Naxx is already going to be releasing something like 15-18 months after vanilla comes out if they stagger each phase 3-4 months.

Everything.

Making gold is so easy compared to classic you don't even have to leave your main town, meaning you can start raidlogging much faster.

The world is completely dead due to flying mounts.
---
Outland is a pretty meh zone.
---
People just afk on shattrath while waiting for arena/bg queues and raid lockouts.

5mans are pretty much the same but with different bosses.
---
Some classes (hunter for example) has a 1 button macro that does everything for you, on classic they have a pretty decent rotation.

Faction imbalance, TBC is always 70-30+ horde ratio.

# LF10M EU Alliance H.Raiding Guild English Speaking
---
Hello,
---
My name is Edward. I am currently living off of savings (not Government) and will start a competitive raiding guild on a healthy sized no-large-streamer PvP server.
---
I will be playing a Human Prot Warrior, and am looking for a maximum of 10 people to preemptively start my guild with.
---
Every spec is welcome, however I only want a maximum of one Ret Pally, Shadow Priest, and Tank/Resto Druid. Night-Elf Priests are welcome for this early sign-up, yet later on we will prioritise recruiting Dwarfs.
---
Raid times are not yet decided - I could raid every night into the foreseeable future, so it depends on you, as we will build a core raiding group around these original members.
---
Joining early will result in benefits - the Ret Pally will receive the first eye of sulfuras - the druids will receive quick tier sets - the shadow priest will 100% get a dedicated raid spot - and the first casters will roll against eachother before Naxx to decide who receives the 40 splinters of Atiesh - assuming you all equally contributed to the guild.
---
We use a custom rolling system for loot distribution, the rules of which I have listed in detail on the #loot-distribution page of our guild's discord server. Our discord contains a lot of useful resources in #help, as well as neatly written instructions about how legendary and class specific weapons are obtained, how the Ahn'Qiraj War Effort functions and how to open it's gates. We also have a priority push-to-talk system where one person from each group can speak for that group in important situations to reduce VoIP spam.
---
The only pre-requisites are a willingness to improve, and an urge to get to 60 - please don't take forever.
---
I will reply to comments and send people I see fit a timed discord link. We will wait 'till classic launch in there.
---
&gt;For example, the top pserver guilds have cleared MC in 17 minutes, BWL in 25 minutes, AQ40 in 30 minutes.
---
With Naxx gear, sure.
---
My original guild was called &lt;Heel Toe Express&gt; referencing how hard it was at the time to get mounts and most of us had to walk every where
---
I could also do it as a druid on private servers, but not as efficiently as hunters.
---
Ya I think both factions attract different kind of annoying players. Alliance can attract VERY young players who don't want to play the "bad guys" and so you get dumb as rocks party members. Horde attracts the edge lords who want to be the bad guys and are generally more troll-like behavior. They might be better players but they also aren't the best party members as they might even troll horde players for fun as well or just generally be selfish 
---
This is VERY general and maybe it's not how it was back 15 years ago but this is def how I felt at the time.
---
Thanks for the feedback! I made the icon freehand in under three minutes, I know it's pretty lackluster. I think that eventually I'll design something with more effort.
---
Fucking gold!!
---
No, it just proves they were Naxx geared
---
2005 isnt coming back with Classic man. That girl? Not coming back either. Your hair? Gonners.
---
If we are talking about the Method team that currently makes up their roster on live they will stand 0 chance against the top private server guilds. They will not outlevel these players - some of whom have power leveled 10+ level 60 characters and cleared MC before the first reset. They know every powerleveling trick and most of them use private leveling routes that aren’t listed in guides. 
---
Method will get the world first. By buying out a top private server guild.
---
Great levelers 
---
Enough gear. 
---
Pick only one.
---
You are either leveling fast enough to constantly outpace your gear which, in a gear dependent class, creates a cycle of either slow leveling due to poor gear - or slow leveling because dungeon running for better gear to speed up leveling
---
Warrior leveling is not as hard as people make it out to be. But it is the slowest in the game. So literally any other class will be faster, more efficient, better quality of life during the leveling process.
---
Dealing with multiple mobs is pretty difficult until level 30 and even then it can be dangerous. 
---
You either haven’t done it yourself or you’re just talking out of your ass. 
---
tedious is how I would best describe it.
---
It was but it was also glorious!
---

---
that's good to know, i'm glad it's not at midnight
---
I'm not dictating anyone's play experience, but I am rightfully frustrated that it feels like there's nobody in the middle between show up in premed rogue spec with fire mages in MC, and 30 warrior comps
---
eheheh
---
Dual Shadows ;)
---
That was the first wow pvp video I ever watched back in 2004.
---
Some bis is actually subjective. Some will prefer more intellect vs spirit, or might like the stam vs slightly more spell power, etc.
---
BIS should always be taken with a grain of salt, and (imo) all creators of these lists should provide justification for their choices, so people can understand their thought process. This will also allow people to better be able to think on their own regarding their own gearing.
---
Fucking his mom in the ass?
---
Yeah I read the most popuilar classes will be warriors, rogues, mages, and priests.  Anyting else?
---
Thank you very much, I may ask for help at some point in the future :) Mostly with texts because I really feel they're quite clumsy. 
---
And if I'm lucky to find someone with Beta access willing to contribute, some features involving the actual interaction with world could be included (something on acceptance/completion of quests, or ability to see a lore summary of someone else with the addon..)
---
Oh my. 
---
Is there a documentary where they explain all this?
---
Great feedback, thanks. If you go to the options and select build info it give some helpful numbers including required level.
---
That's too bad 😍
---
what class would be rare u think?
---
No, because the raid after Naxx Ramas was... I don‘t even know which tbc raid came first tbh.
---
Naxrammas was „A“ raid after Nax Rammas.
---
&gt; I heard when it comes to rogues, many people recommend rolling horde.
---
The basic reason for this is the Orc stun resist. Which has two big influences on your faction choice. If you roll Orc then you get that big juicy stun resist which is quite arguably the best PVP trait. The other side of the coin is that if you roll an Alliance rogue you now have to deal with Orcs (of any class) on the other team resisting your stuns. Not good.
---
Fucking screencapped lul
---
They will run whichever direction their backs are turned to.
---
Them zones brah...and the way gear looked. I still think gear images looked the coolest in TBC.  That T4 hunter set whooo baby.
---
Don't kink shame me bro.
---
Check the Census survey results in the sidebar.
---
comes down if you like melee or range more. as a melee you can hit jump while doing dps as a caster you have to stand still :&gt;
---
both classes can do everything you want to do. Mages might be slightly prefered in pve due to utility
---
If it's so easy, what's preventing other people from getting the wf?
---
can always go female . That model is sweet looking compare to the male one.

+1 it’s structured differently but having more things to click does not translate directly into more ways of playing the class. Keep in mind that most talent points are being spent on passive bonuses!
---
It’s different for sure; hybrid specs for filling multiple roles are not even a thing in modern wow, but the end result is similar given that you can just change specs.

Awe it's okay, i'll heal for them.

I don't know about the rest of these people, but ours always started with a massive guild vs guild battle in front of the raid.  We had horde guilds with the same raid times as us and the only way to avoid it was either to get in early or corpse run in.  But it was great if you had some good PvPers in your guild!  That being said, no way in hell you could summon with 15-30 members of the opposing faction right out side.

Especially if they stream progression of mc n the days leading up to it.  Everyone was hyped for when they did Uldir can only imagine it'll get pretty heated for classic
---
I'm gonna be a hunter. No matter how low my dps is gonna be in aq/naxx, this time I WILL GET THAT KT CROSSBOW. This time.
---
Your dad quotes remind me a lot of my dad. Now I take some time to think.... (5 seconds later) Ok, I took some time to think about it. I'm pretty sure it is not Pete,it's the other one!

Cool beans

Massive? Lol no
---
Okay thanks! Ya /camp was just a command to logout. You could either /camp or alt+f4. Then boot your main. Hopefully the reset works if a buddy's in group and boots you after a logout.
---
No way, brother, I was going to buy one until I saw your review.  I'll steer clear!
---
&gt;There are better guilds with better players

did/will nelfs have the faster stealth speed in classic
---
&gt;Drink plenty of water and don’t forget to get enough sleep.
---
Don't worry man, my 3yo keeps me busy all day, plenty of time to drink water and take a 2min nap. :p
---
Can you add a click to unlearn so I can use on my iPhone at work. Was looking for a IOS friendly talent calculator for a while last week but there isn’t one.
---
Naked mage
---
SM/Ruin. Demonology was gimped in end game content and full destruction meant you were using Searing Pain which caused high threat generation so it was near useless in raiding and even a pain on normal dungeon boss fights, and heavy affliction builds weren't usually ideal because of the 20 slot debuff limit (And you don't want 2-3 warlocks taking up ~15 of those slots, or knocking off sunder armor or whatever).
---
They all had their own place in PvP but not much was better than just SM/Ruin + Succubus. Seduce, CoS, Corruption, Shadowbolt, Shadowbolt, Shadowburn, and as long as at least one of those things crit or nightfall proc'd you could basically 1-trick most classes.
---
Leveling wise you could probably do just about whatever, though. Demonology probably being the best just since your pet matters a lot more in solo content and ridiculous damage output isn't as necessary.
---
Does the troll Regen passive cause threat? I can't find info on it anywhere.
---
None are rare - the least populated will be paladins, shamans and druids.
---
But u can still listen to login screen for hours getting eargasms
---
Yeah STV is a mess in private servers. Like horde will camp nessingwary's camp for literally the whole day. No WPVP just a wall lol.
---
Hunters will be popular too.
---
Druid is the rarest then likely warlock, sham/pally (depends on how you count them).
---
In classic, death knights will be super rare.
---
Male or female, i hope that user name checks out.
---
Duels no, wpvp yes... but in the end you do you. Personally for dueling felt like a waste of money
---
Mages have it easier than rogues for the leveling, you might wanna take that into consideration aswell.  
---
Either way, you won't have a problem finding a spot in raids (if that's your objective).
---
I don't think either of those things are correct, it tried to find a tank and healer according to an Engadget article about their history. Apparently you could queue at nearby innkeepers as well. I'm not sure which version they're including in Classic, but we don't know how new players might react to them and try to use them. No one used them in Vanilla, but that doesn't mean they won't in Classic.
---
Most likely Druid will be the least played. But none are "rare".
---
Considering your preferences, I think mage might be better for you. Imo, Mage is a better first-time class than Rogue, though neither are *particularly* noob friendly. Leveling should be fairly painless if you go with the typical deep frost talent build (they are everywhere if you google it) though a Rogue would have the advantage of stealth to avoid fights on PvP servers. At the endgame, a Mage will have an easier time finding groups to gear up and raid while having a 1-button rotation. In PvP again imo, Mages are more forgiving than Rogues for players who are new to the class (or the game) and are starting to PvP.
---
I hope this helps. Good luck on your quest!

Here is a picture from beta 06-May-2004 :

---
Now this might have changed from beta to release, but you have to take into account that the NPCs are tiragarde were not flagged in vanilla, the NPCs at Bael Modan weren't flagged in vanilla. So why do you believe the NPCs here were flagged in vanilla?
---
He did say something about Ignorance being strength. Maybe if we apply that and keep at it!
---
True. But when a whole guild. + the fanboys work on getting only a few with their professions. That grinding will be definitly easier. In the end the guild with the WF will be the guild that organized everything better.
---
You can define p2w however you want, but most people wouldn't call this f2p model the same as p2w.
---
Reminds me of PoE racing to kill Uber elder when there's a new league.  Less about the actual boss n a lot about how you got there.
---
The tomes were only for the last rank spells and that was only after AQ opened.  Before that you had to go to trainers.  But a point to mention would be that you had to pay to get trained and it wasn't the cheapest thing.
---
A race to endgame missing all the amazing content that makes Classic *Classic*?
---
Trivializing the leveling process to jump straight to ‘endgame’ raiding?
---
Sounds like they should just stick to retail. It was made for people who *‘just don’t get it.’*
---
All these people saying don’t participate in Launch are wrong.  If you haven’t done it, it’s worth the experience.
---
If you are NA - then no... it launched Monday 8/26 3pm pst / 6pm est.  - servers probably won't be stable for the first hour or two.
---
If anything I'd take Tuesday off and make Monday a late night :)
---
Also - my plan is taking Tuesday, Wednesday,  Thursday, Friday off - since Labor Day is that Sunday, I'll have Monday September 1st off - giving me a full 7 days of trying to get to 50 ;)
---
Myself and others in the Bug Research discord have looked into this extensively, we believe the current implementation in the beta to be correct.   
---
However seeing as this is a heated topic, we'll surely get confirmation from Blizzard eventually.

1.3.0 patchnotes:  "Spells in PvP now have a slight increase in range and area of effect when targets are moving. This should improve the overall usability of spells and ranged attacks."
---
Kiting with AoE in the beta isn't completely accurate because AoE-leeway is currently not present, which it should be. So the range of AoE spells in the beta are too short.
---
You can read more about the mechanic here:

Also worth noting this bluepost from 2014 regarding the inner workings of how melee range, spells and AoE is calculated: [https://www.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=13087818929#135929566858](https://www.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=13087818929#135929566858)
---
So “Arise my mushroom”
---
Malaysia
---
That's a fair point, thanks for the feedback!
---
For MC it's a matter of getting to 60 and gear up.
---
For BWL onwards it's a matter of parking the character ready to raid outside the istance door and logging in the moment the appropriate phase comes up.
---
I'm sure Method will be able to call time off work to do all this. I'm not sure about private server heroes.
---
The first couple of months will be a shit show in STV lol. You will be handled alright.
---
as mr T said:  mother.  there is no other.  like mother.  so treat her RIGHT treat her RIGHT
---
so fucking your mother in the ass is NOT manly!
---
it's flat health regen, so it kinda drops off the higher level you get, but if u can spare the bag space having an outfitter macro for your fighting set and regen set to use when on the move/eating would be the most optimal method.
---
moonfire
---
In case you're not joking it would be a trifling amount of threat even if it did.
---
#One and done.
---
The #nochange bois will prevent it.
---
Simply stating something doesnt make it true. You havent explained at all why my idea would be terrible, so obviously it isnt if you cant talk about it.
---
Theres nothing good about your comment either btw, you are comparing wow to a 2d hack n slash game or whatever it is... noone cares about PoE or Diablo, we are here to talk about WoW and how Hardcore could be implemented there. (its rather obvious you have a boner for PoE/diablo)
---
You can always play your own hc if you want (ironman says hello), adding one or two hardcore-specific servers the way i imagined them would not hurt anyone, besides its just an idea.
---
Theres no reason for you to argue against disabling certain features that would make the hardcore experience easier for players. To keep it pure and equal to every player you NEED to disable things or someone is gonna have streamer-benefits or some other help that makes their hardcore to what BFA leveling is now. (there are features in D3 that are disabled in HC if you didnt know... such as the ability to transfer items to your HC character)
---
If you want to argue, then make a proper point yourself instead of pointing towards something else.
---
ps. Ofcourse seasons and ladders would be ideal in wow-hc but it has literally nothing to do with ingame features so its not a valid argument here. Everything i mentioned are ingame-specific features.
---
Lol no you’re not looking at this objectively friend.
---
Top pserver guilds poopsock just as hard as Method. Most of them have leveled 60 characters 10+ times on multiple fresh servers.
---
They know custom leveling routes that can’t be found in guides that are optimized for each individual class.
---
Most of these players have close to every item in Classic memorized and full mastery of the vanilla version of their class. 
---
They will out level Method’s retail roster and have an edge on attunement. 
---
Mechanics/the raid are irrelevant and will be easy for both. 
---
Method’s retail roster will lose during the leveling/attunement process.
---
Method will win if they buy out a pserver guild and pay them to train and carry their main personalities (Sco, etc).
---
No, just an additional level to stealth which works as a free 1/5 Master of Deception
---
Hah!! I was just thinking about this a few days ago, i bought one for myself. Total trash, but i definitely enjoyed it at the time.
---
Gurubashi Arena exists though!
---
Yeah, because people won't just gift them 2-3 gold on stream ... oh wait
---
Different servers for speed runners and server/world first guilds would be great. Hell, give them the option for premaid (pre bis?) level 60 chars if the majority wants not to be burdened with the pesky leveling hell or put portals to the raids in major hubs, I don't care. Actually, I would prefer that. Let them do their thing and when the first few guilds beat the content, let them restart. Make it a seasonal thing like in Diablo.
---
But let the rest of us, the semi hardcore and more casual players have our fun with the world and the raids at our own pace, I don't want to have it all over in a year or one and a half and start over or whatever, I want to enjoy this as long as possible.
---
&gt;Except you need to practice lvling if you wanna be the first to hit 60.
---
But you don't need world first lvl 60.
---
You need 40 coordinated people who know wtf they are doing and can take 2 weeks off work in order to nolife to Rag/Ony deaths.
---
The answer to this in virtually every MMO or class based game I’ve ever played is healers and tanks.
---
I don't get it either, flying and the zones being overly large just because of flying - puts me against bc and just wanting classic :)
---
there's only 8 classes to choose from. (well 9 technically, but Paladins and Shamans are faction-exclusive)
---
some classes will be more common than others sure, but I wouldn't exactly call any of them "rare". rare is a strong word.
---
Great content, I always enjoy listening to you and your guests
---
You don’t know what you’re talking about. Stop.
---
TBC did a lot of good things that I wish were in vanilla.
---
It also did some very bad things not limited to:
---
* Make the cardinal sin of flying mounts and making Outland completely divorced from the rest of the world.
---
* Begin the homogenisation of factions, races and classes. 
---
* Make all level 60 progress worthless compared to greens you find in Hellfire Peninsula
---
To paraphrase an old song from a National Lampoon album: We are the fluke, of the universe...
---
I wouldn't trust anyone else to satisfy her better. Don't you worry, son. She's being treated *just right*.
---
Well, going against the odds is part of the fun, isn't it? Being realistic, yeah, classes have limitations and it'll be easier to have a warrior tank and stick to healing. I just don't want people to try to discourage you from trying, especially because you already know it'll be hard, and they know you know. They just want to be mean on the internet.
---
There is no dilemma... For the Horde!
---
I had the zboard before steel series purchased them. Wasnt a bad keyboard at all for me. I enjoyed having it and the tbc keyset.
---
Ya you spend like a handful of hours in those zones while leveling the fastest levels to level if you're alliance. If you're horde you can spend time there at 60 for days and have a blast
---
As rare as rain in scotland
---
Of course it’s good but if it was game breaking you’d only see orcs at top end pvp and this just wasn’t the case back then.
---
I thought blizzard mentioned capping the amount of layers on a server so the population won’t be really crazy. Number I see floated is 2-3 layers per server. Granted who really knows at this point.
---
For every game, buy a keyboard, where you can make macros. Or a macro-based mouse. Leftclick+bounded key and you have macros where no macros where allowed.
---
Yes. It works like this..
---
If you are in a zone controlled by the opposite faction (horde inside elwynn forest for example), then the horde have pvp on by default. If however you're in a neutral zone, then /pvp will toggle your pvp on indefinitely. If you want to turn pvp off, /pvp again and your pvp will go off after five minutes, unless you heal/first aid/buff allies whom have pvp on, then it delays the pvp turning off
---
True, you'll have trouble stunning Orcs but facials work 100% of the time on them.
---
&gt;Ah, so like paying Blizzard for grand marshal gear. I can't imagine anyone in the Classic fanbase wanting that.
---
This model would never work for WoW because the game requires such a huge time investment. I think any pay-to-skip mechanic would be labeled as p2w since the grind is so long.
---
I hadn't thought of it by your last point is actually pretty spot on. You watch Venruki and Soada and they're playing for shits and having a good time. Many Alliance streamers, and by relation their followers, seem more concerned with being the best
---
You’re right but it has nothing to do with the raid. Methods retail roster would get dusted during leveling. They are going to be sitting in the high 40s while the top pserver guilds are attuning their raid.
---
Taurens have always had a larger hit range than other races in vanilla. It was designed to be that way because of the larger models.
---
Stop it.
---
dont think warriors would be rare though would they
---
&gt; The fact that buying gold is part of the problem is in a sense irrelevant to whether or not someone has empathy. What matters is what the person himself thinks.
---
And this is precisely my point. Persons who think that either have never thought about it *or* they lack that bit of empathy.
---
Let's agree to disagree as it's going nowhere. 
---
The endpoint still stands: Buying gold keeps the goldbuy system in place which means you are part of the problem. And if you do not see it as a problem ,you prove you're egoistical.
---
I think the idea was the undead that always needed a leader, and prior to WC3 there was few undead since K'T, Arthas, and the lot were really the ones responsible for creating that many. Without someone in charge they'd run rampant and just destroy everything is what Blizzard was going for but in that case put on the helm of domination and tell them to all go for a swim in the sunwell or something ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Having fanboys literally gifting you shit helps a ton though.
---
Need Dark Iron? check.
---
Need whateverthefucktheyneed? check
---
Need to unlock AQ? I bet the server they play on will wtfpwn the war effort just because of the sheer amount of kiddos helping them
---
You should pick a mage. In classic, both mages and rogues are a very saturated class, but once you reach the end game you'll find it harder to find a group for things as a rogue than you would as a mage. Also as a rogue the skill ceiling is EXTREMELY high, and per your post I think you will find their rotation very hard to master. But if you intend to PvP, rogues are very fun.
---
Mages get some very cool abilities that are fundamental to Classic. Travel and downtime are serious business in Classic WoW, but mages can conjure food and water for themselves and their allies, as well as create portals to major cities on a whim. Mages also are the best AoE leveling class due to their Frost spells and talent tree. Pull mobs, freeze in place cast blizzard til they all die. It's very satisfying. But also, you'll be stuck in a Frost build for the first chunk of endgame, as damn near everything in the first few raids resists fire.
---
If your friend is definately playing a rogue, I'd recommend not playing a rogue. Not that it's not "optimal" or something, but you'll be loot sharing the whole time (minus quest reward) and loot is super slow to arrive in Classic. Play an Undead Mage with their Undead Rogue and you will have a blast.
---
Awesome going to use this... alot
---
Thanks for sharing, great playlist!
---
Or a Gnome Priest.
---
Which is actually pretty amazing considering the only class that could see you is human with perception ,giving you the chance to jump on enemy rogue nearly every time
---
I would guess there will be tons of arms (PvP spec) &amp; fury (PvE DPS) warriors, but protection warriors (tanks) will likely still be in high demand.
---
As moonkin/enhancement player, I subscribe
---
I always do Gadgetzan. That way you get almost all four corners of the world (flight to SS/WPL from IF isnt too bad)
---
Generaly if you are going to equip it roll need. 
---
If you want something specific, mention it before hand and expect others to as well.
---
Try to know most classes pre-raid BiS so you don't roll on an offspec upgrade that's way more valuable to someone else.
---
Also don't take advice from hunter mains, oh wait...
---
It’s a leveling contest - and I don’t see Methods retail roster beating elite pserver players in a leveling contest.

Willing to make that sacrifice to save everyone else.
---
Honestly I would take the day after launch off. That way the servers will be more stable and the starting zones will be a little bit better, but still pretty hectic
---
Pretty sure I read somewhere that it wouldn't be, which is upsetting.
---
Plus it’s a very aesthetic expansion in everything from zone design, item models and blood elves :3
---
Like other folks said the damage has to tick.  During the stress test it was necessary to stab anything you wanted to tag, since shadow bolt took too long to cast with the sheer amount of people around.
---
Listen. Wow classic is NOT impossible to do without world buffs. Sure, it gets easier, but logging out your char because you got a world buff and wanna save it for raids, is plain silly. You are restricting yourself, for no other reason then wanting a small advantage on raid night.
---
Unless you plan on being crazy progressive and try for server first stuff, world buffs should never take priority over anything. Especially with the classic timers.
---
Just stop assuming everyone and their mother wants wow classic MC completion in week one. It's a minority that will be progression raiding.
---
I once bought a [large key children's keyboard](https://duragadget.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/694x540/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/6/2/624_6.jpg) off of ebay so I could replace my boss' keyboard while he was away on April 1st.
---
When it came in the post, it was absolutely caked in fluff, grime and nicotine stains.
---
I made that thing sparkle with a rag and some isopropyl alcohol.
---
Credit where credit is due, my boss attempted to use it for about an hour before he threw in the towel and asked for his real keyboard back. I had decorated it with self adhesive rhinestones.
---
That is quite correct.
---
100g in Classic was $20 and in TBC was $15.
---
So, yeah, massive devaluation of gold.
---
Gnome racial Escape Artist and Human racial Diplomacy (I think) are handy too
---
Smartest move is for Method to sponsor those pserver players and get them to train/carry their streamer personalities.
---
that's not bad. shouldn't take too much work to get it fully functional then.
---
when I was still subscribed to BfA I was using TRP3. but I could still see the profiles of those using MRP.
---
The Horde females can break me and I’m into it tbh.
---
I don't believe so. The four Night Elf racials in Vanilla Classic are :
---
- Nature resistance, +1% to nature resistance
---
- Wisp Spirit, faster movement while dead.
---
- Quickness, +1% to Dodge.
---
- Shadowmeld, become invisible while not moving. This trait DOES increase the character's stealth rating making Nelf rogues the stealthiest characters in the game.
---
Hi there I have a buddy playing Alliance tank on pve, and originally I wanted to play a dwarf priest with him. However I have a feeling a PvP server would be more fun and feel more alive, also I really love shaman since I enjoy being a support character, additionally I played a druid back in retail vanilla to wrath, so I miss my druid too.
---
PvP or pve server
---
Alliance or horde
---
If alli dwarf priest or ne druid
---
If horde tauren shaman or druid
---
Thanks all!
---
And so many more people who haven’t. Pservers are very niche. To say otherwise is ignoring the truth. Nost had what 200k accounts created? How many of those were by different people? If you combine all the people playing vanilla pservers or maybe even all pservers I doubt you get 500k different people. Definitely don’t if you are just doing vanilla pservers.
---
If all of those people try Classic at launch and at launch classic hits 1 mil players (which I think is low) we’ll have ~50% pserver population (again that is including all pservers.
---
Edit: that is imo a very generous estimation of the pserver players making up classic playerbase. Chances are there will be under 500k people from pservers (not all of which are hardcore) and more than 1 million people playing at launch.
---
From all the testing and such i did for leveling, getting cons as early as possible is the best option for tanking early. It helps you tank dungeons, and yeah you won't use it for tanking bosses and such that will be via judgements and other spells but for all the trash you just roll cons and win.
---
That's when you decide to just sit there and use soul drain on every mob to get into the instance instead of helping to dps. That'll teach em!
---
I remember watching this and having the tune in my head all through school. Now I'm all growed up and it's in my head at work. Magic salt and pepper shakers!
---
In Classic Vanilla DK were supposed to exist and named Runemaster ! But there aren't rare near Naxxramas \^\^ !
---
You, man, are really insulting. You asked for trustworthy sources, I gave them and you called me an idiot.
---
That's just never gonna be a fun discussion for anyone, is it?
---
Yeah I agree with that.  If you have your solid crew of 40 main guys, 10 back-ups, and as many support chars that you can find, it becomes exponentially easier. 
---
If my job is to race to 40 and farm mithril for 4 days and send it to the guild, it really helps out people working on professions.  It's actually insane that there are fanboys willing to do stuff like that.
---
Classic wow has been playable on Pservers for YEARS and people keep playing it. There will always be people playing it. Naxx may be a little toxic, guilds may break up, and people will quit, but new people will keep coming in all the time or restarting or something and Classic wow will always have its player base. 
---
Again like I said, theyll do whatever they think the community want, but I think this time around they will give enough time in Naxx before actually releasing something where more than a handful of guilds clear it.
---
Welcome to people who value their time and what to get things done vs people who just wanna play casually. 
---
You make think you’re rightfully frustrated for not being given a chance - just as they think they are rightfully frustrated that you’re playing a suboptimal spec but expecting to be treated as if you’re not a burden when the cold hard math says you absolutely are after a certain point - and I think its safe to assume that the guild would like to progress beyond that point. 
---
I hate to break it to you bud but this is how things unravel after a game is pretty much solved. 
---
What happens is the few people that actually are in the middle quickly realize they don’t want to change and so they just gravitate to the casual guilds that wipe on Ragnaros during the naxx patch. 
---
Or they realize how shitty it is to still be wiping on Ragnaros during the naxx patch so they gravitate towards the guilds that cut way down on the stupid shit. 
---
I understand your frustrated but surely you can see the big picture here. 
---
Feral Druid - as you mentioned - pulls okay dps in the early raids and can even be competitive - provided you farm the hell out of crowd pummelers. 
---
You can definitely pull it off even in the higher tier guilds - IF and usually only IF you are the only “special snowflake” in the guild. 
---
As the raids progress the margin for these specs diminishes. You hate the 30 fury warrior meta but ironically it is what allows more sub optimal specs to come due to the sheer carry potential. 
---
Classic isn’t a balanced game in all regards. It’s part of the charm. 
---
Maybe classic just isn’t for you. 
---
One of three things will happen for you I’ll imagine should you go feral for classic. 
---
1) you’ll get into a raiding guild and they will hit a wall because they are okay with being sub optimal specs to the raid. You’ll either accept this wall (and you’ll hit before the end of BWL I assure you) and this is where you stay. 
---
2) you don’t accept the wall - you respec Resto and you move to a higher tier guild and continue your progression. 
---
3) you get fucking incredibly lucky and you’re truly a top .1% player of your classs/spec and you get into a higher tier guild that lets one of their spots get filled with something a little sub optimal and they pick you for it. 
---
Option 3 does not happen often. Most of those guilds are just not going to want to deal with it and that’s just the facts. 
---
I wish you the best - but I hope you see how you come across in your comments when you act out in frustration because people don’t want to give you a chance because that’s their prerogative but that’s not a good enough reason for you - while at the same time they are not allowed to question your spec choice. 
---
You want to have your cake and eat it too. 
---
That’s just unreasonable man.  Refusing to see that DOES make you selfish.
---
You're right - inkeepers were added as meeting stones in 1.5[1]
---
There's conflicting accounts on whether role was accounted for with meeting stones. I remember trying it for dm twice and getting groups with unworkable roles (there's forum posts that say the same[2]) but I am not sure at this point.
---
At any rate, they weren't popular at all on my server (and forum posts suggest they weren't popular elsewhere either really).

I love rppvp servers! I don’t RP but it’s much more fun playing and not seeing names like HOTSIXTYNINE lol
---
&gt;It's not just about learning the fights, its about practicing and optimizing every single thing. Each pull has to optimized, trash included.
---
that's only if they start the raid at the same time.
---
Stop posting this classic + shit every 5 minutes kkthxbb
---
True, but the two hander combat animation has to be the worst. It’s looks like she’s swinging a bat underhanded...and whiffing. And that /lol ....
---
They wont. The toxic neck beards love to make fun of RPers. There is probably a market for 1 RPing streamer.
---
Ranked list:
---
* Blue PvP gear is about as good as MC gear (slightly better imo due to the more stam on it).
---
* Epic PvP gear is on par with most BWL gear &amp; T2.
---
Anything beyond BWL (AQ40 &amp; Naxx) is far superior to pvp gear. Most tier 2.5 sets turn you into a god when it comes to pvp. Shammy T2.5 is just downright dirty for ele shams.
---
 Not for free - you repay back by advertising to the right audience ;)
---
Stoneform is a good bit better than perception in rogue v rogue imo
---
Holy shit I forgot about this for 14 years. Thank you for posting this.

The zeppelins are pretty bomb tbh, Alliance really misses out there.
---
This, but i would prefer a TBC pre 2.3 which is where the downfall started

First of all, sure Vanilla WOW was the first version of the game a lot of people played...but TBC was *also* the first version of the game...a lot of people played. Nostalgia is a huge factor, walking through the Dark Portal for the first time, seeing your first Outland green dropping. The raids, the heroic dungeons, arena, the look of the gear, world PVP on the Isle of Quel'danas, exploring Nagrand for the first time, etc.
---
There are a ton of reasons but mainly, its the game that I fell in love with. I dont really think anything needs to be removed or changed before releasing it as a sequel to Classic. The game was incredible as it was released.
---
Kink shaming *is* my kink
---
Shamans and Druids are normally the two rarest. With Druids being the run away rare favorite. Rogues get to pick their target. Orcs mostly play classes you wouldn't want to target anyway. It's all about those sweet sweet clothies.
---
&gt; you'll be stuck in a Frost build for the first chunk of endgame
---
To be honest thats my favorite spec as Mage, I really enjoy the Frost Spells, both visually and mechanically.
---
&gt; you'll be loot sharing the whole time
---
Thats what I was wondering too. Equipping 2 Rogues (leather) gotta be a pain in the ass, right? That would take way longer than Mage/Rogue.
---
&gt; Play an Undead Mage
---
No doubts about that! =D
---
Setting themselves up for the easiest Option Select.
---
1. I said Method would get first and we did!
---
2. We were *obviously* joking.
---
Shamans for windfury crits ez choice for me
---
I want to say it came from a documentary called [The Making of Classic World of Warcraft](https://youtu.be/LYxU7pIJHhk)
---
I agree. But Method members likely won't be streaming their levelling to the same extent Asmon, Soda et all are. Method will be streaming the raids primarily.
---
Hi ! Sorry, I'm new to Reddit, where's this sidebar ?
---
Get yourself a few elixir of water walking if you plan to quest in feralas as alliance.
---
In your opinions what's going to be the least played race/class combination? Not including genders cause that's obviously anything Female Dwarf.
---
Most is certainly Human Mage/Rogue right?
---
&gt; Depending on the keyboard
---
**BIG** emphasis for the slow learners.
---
oh I don't know, maybe 15 years of patches where US has ALWAYS gotten it a day before?
---
i've warned people about this i think it's guaranteed to happen. they will claim it as theirs just because it's a unique server.
---
Does this mean their 1.12 server is not accurate then ? Because they said that they double checked this
---
"Now I'm ready to post in chat for an hour for a group, only to have people leave by the time we start"
---
Ding ding ding we have a winner.
---
There are mobs that have one or more weapons in their loot table that use the same model as the weapon held by the mob. This was never a special mechanic, and loot tables didn't change for the same mobs or anything like that.
---
Saying they are "rare" is true but you don't really need them. So they won't be scarce. 
---
Maybe what he should be asking is what will be scarce. Something that isn't able to meet the demand for it.

&gt; Your hair? Gonners.
---
NOOOOOOOOO!!!
---
Its no way clear it was a joke, you've said a bunch of dumb things about priests on this thread already so who knows.
---
I don't believe they have put out any statement in regards to melee leeway yet, got a link?
---
Easy to get all the grease and baby batter off of im sure.
---
&gt;rank 14 for their entire roster just to get good weapons before AQ
---
rank 14 takes at best 13 weeks, to get weapons on par with BWL.
---
Nope. But what we will have is a toxic cesspool of, "LF Mages, rogues, for guild, LoL NO dps hybrids.  Full on non priest healers. You must have 3 world buffs stacked to get a raid spot"
---
Nice of you to come white knight for Method and all the former Classic haters for free.
---
I wonder if most people realize what is coming for Retail starting August 27th.
---
There is no BfA hate here, just stating facts. You would think that at least mythic raiders would not be bored of BfA...but if top guilds are (and I have no reason to think that other top guilds aren't as bored as Method)...I mean, I have 3 WoW accounts atm, and 2 of them are trial.
---
Today, I logged in one of those trial accounts, and went to Orgrimmar, on 3 "high pop" realms...I didn't had to wait too long before people started to talk in trade about how dead BfA is. Today.
---
With Classic almost 3 months away.
---
I don't know man...looks really bad for Retail players.
---
When you have top guilds saying "we are bored to death of BfA" is not good...but when they continue with "and we can't wait for Classic" you know it's bad.
---
And when they say "we will go for world firsts", you know that this means A LOT of time spent in Classic, because this is how it works.
---
Than you realize that what only a fringe minority (me among them) was saying that Classic will kill Retail since November 2017, is not becoming "main stream"...well...
---
We've been called idiots, retards, delusional, getting downvoted all over the place...we might actually be right.
---
Time will tell. I stick by my guns : Retail will be history, 9.0 will be the last expansion for Retail and WoW2 is already in the works. I've been saying this since November 2017, WAY before BfA was even in Beta.
---
I just KNEW that Blizzard is not releasing Classic because they have big hearts and love the players...they did it because it was TIME to REDO all the mistakes that they did in the last 15 years with WoW, and in this process to prove, again, that they can revolutionize the MMO gaming in 2019 like they did in 2004.
---
Blizzard will be first, again. Hopefully, they won't fuck it up...again.
---
Most of these "bumps in power" are so small that most people wouldn't even notice if they were bugged and didn't work at all.
---
Hunters beat shadowpriest? Hahahahaha
---
So you'll farm gold to buy epics to farm more gold?
---
Not trying to be a jerk or anything, just not seeing the end goal.
---
I am looking for a single Ret Pally anyway, and you seem dedicated. I have Dmd you a link to discord where we can talk.
---
Locks, Druids and Hunters(as mains) will be the least played I bet. They all get the short end of the stick I think.
---
mostly because you don't actually need to be deep prot... ever. not even in naxx
---
Simply untrue. SPriests are still melting faces on private servers today vs. experienced players. They are ridiculously powerful in Vanilla.
---
Not an uncommon type of bug either. Pets would have a similar bug in bg’s where if you leveled in the bg your pet would keep their scaled level upon leaving.
---
So a lvl 12 joins WSG him and pet get scaled to 19. He dings in BG pet levels to 20 he does too. After BG player is back at their level (now 13) pet is still 20.
---
I’m eastern time zone, United States. Planning to lollygag to the barrens between the first three evenings then taking Thursday and Friday off work to hit it hard for five days straight with the holiday. Hoping to be mid 40’s by the time I wrap on Monday but we’ll see how it goes with Labor Day plans, I’m sure I’ll be required to go to at least one thing
---
But all of that can be done without TBC, without even raising the level cap, without introducing flying...
---
Except 25 man raids, but really, i'd rather see flexible raid sizes, and *then* start porting raids from later expansions down to level 60.
---
I love that set so much
---
how come shamans druids warlocks are rarer than ohters?
---
You think anyone would pick those swirly nipple bastards? 
---
https://m.imgur.com/t/funny/Cah48
---
Classic doesn't need sellout shitters for success.
---
See I feel the exact opposite.  Elwynn is just terrible and confused.  Dun moro / ne zones arent bad.  Westfall is alright but everyone ends up there and it gets congested.  Silverpine is atmospherically my favorite zone in the game and has incredible grinding .  the worgens / gnolls alone make the zone bomb.
---
Does it smell like day old cheetohs and stale mountain dew?
---
Will you sell it on ebay?
---
Make a hunter t2 or t3 one! These are really good man
---
Nope, sorry. You should have enabled war mode before leaving Ironforge.
---
And your point being?
---
flying mounts out of TBC would require some serious changes though, its one of the few expansions really designed for flying as soon as you hit lvl 70.
---
I read reason for that is because people want best of the best not jack of all trades.  A paladin may have more defense than say a rogue but can never tank like a warrior.  Shamans and druids can't heal as much as a preist dps as a rogue/mage or tank like a war.
---
There is a lot of stuff I would love to see added, but WoW was designed by a bunch of self motivated metal head super nerds.  The new stuff would be made by the Mumford and Sons fan club.
---
Yeah, that is already happening. Venruki was given a staff of jordan for funsies.
---
I would say as a rule of thumb, if you play with a friend you should each play something that uses different equipment to get the most out of the RNG. Who is going to use the cloth and staves if you're both fighting over leather and daggers etc. Its hard fo say how much longer it would be because loot is so random. In fact in Vanilla, sometimes bosses dont drop anything at all early on, especially in the first few dungeons. You can always level a rogue later if you want.
---
Isnt about half of methods roster composed of streamers?
---
Will you be adding the rest of the alliance races?  Highly interested in at least gnome/dwarf.
---
Love a full 3 pages on landscape mode.
---
I would say if you can spare it might as well book the whole first week off. Only booking a few days off is going to cause you to do nothing but want to play as soon as you are forced to go into work. Just do yourself the favor and book it all off.
---
Stoneform is more valuable if you don’t get the opener and less if you do. Perception, if you know what you’re doing, will allow you to get the opener the majority of the time. Ime human rogue consistently beat dwarf rogue which consistently beat all the rest. But again, this is niche of a niche stuff and has minimal impact on group pvp.
---
Extremely high skill ceiling? Wat? Or are you talking about PvP?
---
Prayer of healing is pretty strong too
---
yikes, hoes mad lul
---
It would only be nice if you didn't need a sub to pre-make characters. Unless someone has a name they think will be take or are very impatient and want to feel like they're playing by making the character (me) most will wait to resub i'd think.
---
You know I'm not 100% sure! I'm sure there are multiple spells that can work for tagging. As far as a druid for tagging Moonfire is King!
---
Protection Paladin or holy Paladin will be in extremely high demand. Tough to level too
---
Scholo key also IMO
---
How do you “right click to unlearn” on mobile
---
Lock them to the same realm with Asmon and Soda.
---
No streamers on non-containment realms.
---
idk man.. I remember following Death and Taxes pretty tight back in the day.
---
I'd say that everything including Naxxramas is easie than any mythic raid
---
Maybe I should tryhard my way up to 55-56, do the dungeons I can for preraid gear, start working on Onyxia/MC atunement meanwhile slowly going for 60? Sounds like a good plan in my head but not sure if it would do any good when it's live?
---
This census has some very interesting info, especially about the most recent expansion players have played. Horde/Alliance diversity is much less dramatic than I anticipated as well, it's essentially a coinflip.
---
I'll still go hard the first week, but I will use PTO the tuesday-friday after labor day banking on the fact the majority of people will use it the first week.  I figure I can be \~25-30 by the tuesday of my first day of PTO, then I'll play early in the morning and have a relatively uncontested ashenvale/stonetalon/STV for ez efficient leveling.
---
Hi r/classicwow!,
---
We are a small (4 to 6 of us) skilled (Top 15 US) raider group of friends looking for a home with an existing guild or to pool resources with another group(s) looking to start a guild.
---
*LFG / Horde / US / PvP / Evenings-Weekend Raids (\~7/8pm - \~11pm EST ) / DKP/EPGP/Loot Council*
---
Who I am:
---
* Warrior since Vanilla WoW (Day 1)
---
* Max level on Beta
---
* I main tanked within my guild &lt;Relentless&gt; on Shattered Hand-US. We were up against and competing with the best guilds in the world at the time &lt;Death &amp; Taxes&gt; and &lt;Drama&gt; (World first Nefarian). We cleared everything up until Sapphiron in Naxx-40.
---
*  We held all the Horde firsts and then moved onto Server Firsts after some alliance migrated to Bloodscalp-US.
---
* I am still a member of that same guild on retail, some of which are coming with.
---
* I've attained Gladiator Rank in 3 Seasons of Arena PvP and enjoy both BG's and World PvP
---
* I would prefer a Off-tank/Maintank leadership role in a guild, but I can be flexible as DPS. I've lead countless pug raids of Green Dragons and World Bosses and of course in-guild raids.
---
About my friends/guild members:
---
* Currently looking like 4-6 people will be joining me. 4 of which would like to raid and are reliable.
---
We are looking to integrate fully and hope to find a great group that we can contribute positively to.
---
Things that we aren't okay with:
---
* Drama and immaturity, we're adults that played WOW since Vanilla/BC/Wrath and we'd like similar experienced players in terms of raid ability
---
Final Note:
---
* If there are like-minded individuals that share the same sentiments, where you have a core group of friends that are relatively serious about playing classic and want to do progression raiding, but you don't quite have the numbers to start on your own, and/or if you find the idea of running a 40 man guild on your own daunting, hit me up and maybe we can pool our resources start something together.
---
Contact Info: Discord: GaryGolz#8235, or DM me here!
---
Thanks for taking a minute to read this! (format credit and excellent writing to u/EvilMonstar &lt;3)
---
&gt; I think the idea was the undead that always needed a leader
---
But that's not true as established by WCIII. When undead are no longer controlled by the Helm of Domination, they usually gain free will (if their brains haven't completely rotted out). So really it would just produce a lot more "Forsaken" (or maybe new undead faction that would be neutral since they owe the alliance a debt of gratitude for freeing them) or more undeads like Gunther Arcanis.
---
Then you could make the ones that literally are mindless jump in a fire or deal with them with the massive Alliance and Horde forces since they now have no leadership. Either way, the scourge isn't really a threat without a lich king.
---
The people they’re competing with developed all the private leveling routes you’re talking about. Why would they teach them to Method?
---
Great idea, I see now that the formatting is terrible in landscape. Thanks for the feedback.
---
Paladins and shamans can only be 1 faction.
---
Druids heal - a lot of people don't want to heal for some reason.
---
All specs can be played and be played well - there are specs that perform better with less :)
---
If enough people move onto another expansion, consolidate the servers, keep at least one. I’m sure there will be enough people always to do Vanilla content. 
---
Your argument can be said about retail as well so I don’t know why you bring up dead servers. If enough people leave retail, they consolidate servers. It’s not like it will vanish into thin air.
---
&gt; "I would like to extend the offer to one healer for a position in our dungeon group to join in the fight against the Scarlet Crusade in Stratholme. We intend to complete the dungeon at a fast pace, so we would appreciate it if you were not a new ~~player~~ **adventurer**. Sincerely, Zugtug, **Orc Warrior of 31 seasons**."
---
They'll probably level inside istances starting with BRD at 50ish
---
Trust me you Will know when someone achieved something
---
You have named advantages and disadvantages; but i do agree ! It would be great provided we have a great non abusive and long terme interested community
---
Troll rogues. Trolls are the least popular race on Horde and they have tough competition with PvP racials against Undead and Orcs.
---
This sub's [class/race survey](https://i.redd.it/inis00ztt2o21.png) a while back confirmed this too.
---
They have the pull to snag many of them. You think that any of the leaders on legacywow boards wouldnt lose thier minds for the opportunity to be in method?
---
I'm just going to have Stormstout Brewery on repeat and pretend it's MoP again.
---
I have the basics of the route on the spreadsheet for gnorf starting route.
---
Should be easy enough for anyone to modify the .json to match that route.
---
I just doubt I have another 6+ hours in me (though the waypoints are all the same, should be a lot quicker) to make a new route file. Feel free tho. Have at it.
---
but they do not have a cooldown unlike ward
---
Yeah but paladins never run out of mana and provide great buffs. Shamans have chain heal which is amazing along with their totems such as wind fury totem which significantly boosts ur melee dps. Druids have innervate and can rez in combat on cool down. Come to think of it horde raids may take as many as 8 shamans.
---
That info would change every second and be not really informative, so I guess they won't give it, at least not that early.
---
thing is, this is beta and everything will be wipe, so not really important. When it's live, the gold/advantage to guildy, this item can bring, won't be oversee
---
agreed 100%. gotta take advantage of the loot table
---
People (not me) failed out of college because of OG WoW. Don't be that person
---
it does
---
People are amazing in their own amazing ways :)
---
I think it's more because the vast majority of people prefer DPS roles over support roles.
---
I agree. Classic was great, but my memories and experiences were so much better throughout BC. Flying and leaving azeroth are obvious cons to the expansion, but ever other element was better. This includes the community, I knew more people in BC than classic. YMMV but overall BC just felt better.
---
Necrophilia and Beastiality
---
Method wont get world first 
---
There are guilds who have been playing vanilla for 15 years and can clear raids blindfolded
---
Orc female and both undeads are the only ones I can play.
---
With NE Female, Human Female and Dwarf Male (plate)
---
That’s...thats just not true
---
I really, REALLY wish they would've had more quests/faction choices like this in the game. Would've added a lot of depth and RP elements I think could've gone a long way.
---
The only thing this crappy show was missing was a laugh track like two and a half men and the big bang theory.  Felicia sure struck gold in the market of 13-20 year old males.  Props to all the advertisement endorsement money she made over the years.
---
Tyvm !
---
priests not so much, sadly
---
Shaman or Priest for bgs. Ele/Resto vs Disc/Holy. 
---
It seems that priest is slightly more foused on support while shaman on damage dealing but you do both.
---
I kind of like the idea of being able to quickly finish off players while healing/purging/etc. most of the time and shaman seems better at tha, but I am still not sure what the pros and cons for either are exactly specifically for bgs.
---
Also does either have any advantages with regards to things like gearing up for PvP, finding groups etc. Note - if priest i am more likely to be alliance.
---
I would love to have huge vanilla 5 man dungeons, like BRS. But filled with TBC heroic trash. Content where you don't have to play your interface or mimic a dance, but where you must use all tricks you class has in unexpected ways to survive. Would probably need a weekly lockout...
---
If you are looking for rarest class combo on ally side, I would guess, it will be night elf warrior
---
Hey Josh, quick point on the stream sniping (excellent episode by the way). Provided Soda’s differentiation between stream sniping and lowbie ganking, where does his blacklist idea place a player that stream snipes a lowbie streamer? Is that blacklistable or not? It seems to be in conflict with itself. I’ll give him the grace of venting after a frustrating situation, of course, as this is mainly in jest.
---
That's probably true, I've never played an Alliance character past level 20 or so.
---
They shouldn't be, they weren't tethered until BC if I'm remembering correctly.
---
you are 100% right. but you wont find much support in this thread. i think the vast majority of people would agree with you tho.
---
There is no mc progression. The most interesting part will be seeing them get 40 people to powerlevel to 60 as fast as possible.
---
It'll definitely be a race from 1-60 more than a race to clear the raid. It'll actually be pretty awesome IMO.
---
For me class design is by far the most important part of the game, I still find tbc/wotlk enjoyable, while nothing afterwards has really clicked for me. 
---
For that reason supporting tbc would be a safer bet over entirely new content/designs.
---
Personally I'd remove flying and restructure the zones to accommodate that change and keep paladin/shaman faction exclusive (maybe even not include the new races), but other changes that people dislike don't have a big impact on me
---
Druids are rare because they are seen to be not very good. They are a pretty niche to pick. In the case of Shamans. They lack dispel magic and, this is their most heavily nerfed patch. They are good this patch but, they are a shadow of what they were. For Warlocks they are kinda rare not because they are bad. A lot of amazing players even think they are the best class in the game. It's just Mages are the silk slipper wearing golden boys of classic. They just shine so hard. Less people wanna play warlock.
---
I doubt that they'll disable layering in Phase 2. They only said so to keep us calm for now. But when phase 2 is approaching they'll come up with an excuse how servers can't handle it because more players are playing than expected etc etc so layering has to stay. I mean do you really think they'll do the AQ event without layering? Highly unlikely.
---
Ya warrior is the one exception in vanilla. For some reason they didn't consider it a "hybrid" and made all three of their specs super viable at at least something. Then they made priest dps suck because they are a hybrid. Hell even the non hybrid classes don't have three viable specs.
---
Kungen responded in a tweet that he plans to play it and prepares for it right now (health etc.)
---
The [Census Survey Results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xIw7HPEpe5fUSV0mIVzgkdtGxHxqYc4mcVtn26ThS68/edit?usp=sharing) in the sidebar shows that the factions are pretty well balanced as is.
---
Have you seen a lot of this in the beta?
---
I think it has too many towns/outposts, vanilla zones usually don't have that many
---
No 50g was the cap in 1.12. It was higher in 1.9 but they changed it because it started to get out of hand with the costs.
---
Dynamic spawns, shoo
---
But i love my 3th world shit shack orgrimmar tho.
---
DU DU DU..... DUM
---
&gt;TBC was my favorite part of all of warcraft 
---
All of WoW, or all of Warcraft? Because pitting TBC against WC3: TFT... that's a tough one. TFT kicked off MOBAs, kicked off Tower Defense, Draft Wars is arguably the father of Auto-Chess. It was the last great RTS game, it had great online PvP and great campaign. Awesome lore/world-building.
---
cant we have anything that is just fun to be fun without this esports shit
---
I'll take 5, please!
---
They are definitely a hybrid class.
---
Play a rogue and claim Redridge Bridge as your own.
---
PoE is so complex i literally got lost whwn i started
---
They will try. And this will eat up most of their time. Which means that they will play Classic basically 100% every time they wanna be first.
---
And hundreds of top (and not only) retail guilds will do the same. The impact on BfA will be devastating, to say the least. Entire guilds will switch to Classic. Many other guilds will split...
---
BfA is already a ghost town...it will be a cemetery starting August 27th.
---
&gt;Why in particular?
---
Same reason I want classic wow. Because I can no longer enjoy it the way that it was meant to be enjoyed.
---
World first mc race is legit just a giant race to 60 for your roster though...
---
Well dang.  That sells the horde really well!
---
I personally am going wait a day or two so that I can avoid the craziness in the starter zones
---
&gt; Make all level 60 progress worthless compared to greens you find in Hellfire Peninsula 
---
Was this even a thing? I remember my gear lasting quite a bit longer than that. I think i only replaced the last slots just before the 70 ding or shortly after. But the majortity of my gear deffo lasted way longer than Hellfire
---
Meeting stones weren't added till patch 1.3, classic is 1.12
---
Even priests seem to pay a hybrid tax on their damage tho. Warriors just get a pass.
---
Darkshore questing? Lol dude darkshore sucks. I’m a huge alliance fanboy, but darkshore ain’t it.
---
Now redridge mountains on the other hand? Mmmmm, gimme soma dat lakeshire

Judgment of Justice is another good one.

When I'm healing on a low-level Paladin, I'll use Seal of Justice for the stuns, and Judge it to keep 'em in line.

Having played tank and healer I'm very aware there are many gear choices which are subjective and even fight specific. But it annoys me when there are these bis lists floating around which prioritise obviously wrong stats or list an item which has an alternative where every important stat is higher - generally because the bis list is based off progressive itemisation on gear, which classic won't have.
---
[A good video on them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEfip7OUtac)
---
Disagreed. Method will simply ask on stream, "Taking donations of Transmutes, Azerothian Diamonds, Truesilver and Devilsaur leather" They will have all the gear they need day 1 of being 60
---
Darkshore is one of the most efficient leveling zones in the game my dude.
---
Ya I never understood why people keep saying arcane isn't viable. It's actually THE spec that is viable early on.
---
Not always.
---
Spoiler alert - they will fuck it up again.
---
Could be that I just have Mankrik's Wife Syndrom, but after hearing the same few questions over and over, I just cant help it. 
---
But ok, here is the long version:
---
&gt;I mean primarily for Keys, Attunes, items or trinkets most people will want.
---
That is a fairly generic question AND you provide  no information about your faction/class.
---
Items most people will want....might also include BiS gear. And if so, then there are more than enough guides for it. Besides from all the stuff you can get, what isn't an item?
---
--&gt;Pretty hard to give a fitting answer with the circumstances. 
---
as for googeling: "wow vanilla all attunements"  results in [this](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Instance_attunement_(original) and ,[this](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-attunements-and-keys-dungeons-raids) as my first two results. 
---
Regarding trinkets: They are quite rare at the beginning of vanilla.  if you put aside anything from engineering and all epic trinkets (since most of them wont be in the game from the start or require raiding) you are left with actually not that many.
---
 And out of these only a handful are worth using. Any vanilla database (eg [this one](https://classicdb.ch/?items=4.0.12&amp;filter=qu=1:2:3;#0+1)  )lets you look at all of them and if you find something interesting that you want you can research further.
---
examples:
---
 [Horde+physical only](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19120) . This is really strong early on....if you are horde and a physical dd.
---
[This one](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13347) is an alliance only that can be used to die intentionally without armor loss. Uses could be : 
---
being stuck, wanting to talk to the BRD key questgiver, "resetting" instances ( should relogging port you to your hearth location instead of instance entrance) and maybe others -  you need to keep the Q in the log, though.
---
So basically what is left is stuff like Skull of impending doom or Carrote on a Stick. These kind of items that are very niche and "hidden" by the fact that more often than not, you dont expect an on-use effect on these slots.
---
Once again, without knowing what you are looking for I am fishing in the dark. but anyway:
---
[Plate shoes, dispel snares](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7936)
---
[leather shoes, providing speed boost](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7391)
---
[cloth belt, dispels snares](https://classicdb.ch/?item=4328)
---
Besides gear you might get a group for this [neutral quest chain](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/You_Are_Rakh%27likh,_Demon_quest_chain) to grab an early [16-slot bag](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10959) and a [trinket](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10779)
---
Or maybe even good ol' [Dartols](https://classicdb.ch/?item=5462) (make sure to abort and NEVER finish the Q line, if you want to keep the item. Alliance only).
---
Oh and before you quest in Felwood, make sure to do the cleansing Q so that you can farm the mats required to grab the [buffs](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Useful_zone-specific_buffs) ([alliance](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=4101) , [horde](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=4102) ) . 
---
Same goes for e'kos in winterspring.
---
Fazit: the attuments links are literally lists of all keys and where to get them. 
---
The early trinkets are (for the most part) not mandatory/necessary/useful and the few that are depend on your class/spec (=&gt; pre BiS lists).
---
I admit, that the other stuff is pretty hard to find without knowledge of the game. Especially when you dont even know they exist in the first place. 
---
Thing is, there is so much stuff in vanilla that question like "what should I do first" or "what are useful items to keep" have SO many possible answers each, that it is beyond overkill to ask about basically all of them at the same time.
---
Then there is the pve &lt;&gt; pvp part as well. Some items are mainly/exclusively used in one part of the game. Since you brought up Skull of impending doom, which is predominantly used in pvp. Do you also want to know about [Magic Dust](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2091) or [Net](https://classicdb.ch/?item=835) despite not being related to quests?
---
Or [Jungle Remedy](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2633#comments) which can be used to get rid of all kinds of debuffs during leveling even after doing the quest or being horde.
---
Alliance's got nothing on female Troll and Undead tho
---
I wanted to play a paladin, but my friends want to play horde. Will shaman be a close alternative, or should I just go priest? Shaman i understand as being an offensive healer, paladin quite the opposite. It was mostly class fantasy that pulls me to paladin, which I will roll a second server for a paladin alt, as we will be on a pvp realm. 
---
My goals were pvp heals, with the occasional raid.
---
No they don't. Warriors get two upgrades in the 20s (Ancient Longsword or similar-named 2-hander from Nek'rosh and quest reward from Morladin) and then WW axe is soloable mid-30s using nature pots -- I know from experience having played both classes to max level. Rogues definitely go for much longer with no quest reward upgrades, while on my warrior I got some upgrade every 4-5 quests.
---
If they wanna go for World Firsts, they gotta bring in the A and the B team...not the C team.
---
They will need 50 people for the Classic roster. And that is A and B team.
---
implying they aren't getting that experience right now
---
What kind of "fun" are you planning on ruining exactly? People on RPPVP realms commonly do world pvp in 40 man raid groups. If you try to 1v40, it's only to be your fun that gets "ruined."
---
If you meant verbally harassing RPers (less than 25% of RPPVP players actually RP), you'll very quickly get added to a global blacklist that will put you on auto ignore for everybody with RP addons.
---
Mage seems like a slightly better pick based on what you are saying but both would work well, so it depends if you want to kill people quick from the shadows and disapear or if you want to kill people from a distance.
---
Rogue+Rogue is super fun for ganking in the world if youi are into that (better than rogue+mage). There are currently 3 rogues terrorizing a zone in the beta by ganking people quickly and then quickly re-stealthing. If you are into that rogue is a good pick.
---
looking at this thread most obnoxious posts are from alliance players.
---
I know that I was in a mixture of tier 2 and pvp gear and it was half replaced by the end of that zone.
---
&lt;Here Be Monsters&gt;
---
Faction: Horde
---
Region:  N/A - Most of us are West Coast, but want to build out more.
---
Server: PvP
---
Focus: PvP, and High End Raiding (Aiming for Server Firsts) Casual As well.
---
&lt;Here Be Monsters&gt; is a gaming community that has played a lot of games.  Most recently we have had divisions in; Black Desert Online, Atlas, Ark: Survival Evolved, Conan Exiles, Monster Hunter, Archeage, and the list goes on.  We do community game nights, and run other parts of the game-o-sphere, for example: I run D&amp;D nights on Thursdays.  The point of HBM is to be a community first, and to be able to play games with friends.
---
There is an element of this guild that wants to hit the game super hardcore and will operating to that end, and I intend to support that.  The good news is that those of us who are not going to play to the full hilt, and play more casually - are still going to be able to support them.  
---
I have a plan for starting off that will help the entire guild support one another as they grow and advance professions.  I expect there will be two raids formed, one for the higher super-hardcore, and another that will be more casual, but will still have dedicated members.  I personally have played this game in Vanilla when it started, but haven't played since WotLK.  We have some very experienced players, but don't let that shake you - we have players of all kinds and are looking for players of all kind. 
---
You can reach out to me through discord.  [HBM] TheJayde#9340 or reply to me through reddit.  Either strategy works.
---
You can only level in Azeroth. What the hell is this question
---
That's what's lacking in today's WoW.  Today it's just about memorizing your ~~rotation~~ priority queue and then doing that in every fight.
---
Classic, you had to figure out how to avoid pats walking into you, mobs running away from you, plan ahead to have enough health/mana without wasting down time, use your whole class (i.e. sheep, frost nova) instead of just spamming damage.
---
Yes, I returned for Classic last year and have been updating my site again in preparation for its release. I’m glad you found it helpful.
---
Is it? All I seem to remember is a lot of running. At least the barrens have multiple flight points.
---
You can, it's just fixed on private servers.
---
You can make a new character in retail too
---
Doesn't matter what color you are, if you are playing classic wow you are a fucking loser too man. You can tell a bigot a mile away from stupid ass reddit comments like that.
---
&gt;there is nothing that trumps actual game experience.
---
except for knowledge and actual game experience.
---
No info papa, spend that $25 to transfer
---
I won’t play BC. I quit like 5 months into the expansion and this will be the first time returning to the game since then.
---
The expansion killed many things for me that were never the same:
---
- Arenas and gear - PvP gear became extremely easy to get and resistances made PvE gear irrelevant.
---
- Flying mounts - wPvP Non-existent
---
- Azeroth abandoned
---
- Sharing a city with the other faction
---
- Maybe I’m alone but I HATED the new zones. They felt very anime....
---
unless you grind a ton, you will have to visit more or less every zone after 20 (doubt silverpine alone will get you to 20 tbh)
---
While the % will be balanced you will likely have servers that are heavily skewed. I think this is what he was going after.
---
Such as Mal'Ghenas (sp?) being like 86% horde and other servers being mostly alliance.
---
You can not cram in years of experience into 2 months
---
They’re going to have people rolling characters to do nothing except farm gold/mats and not even use in raid.
---
OOGA GANG RULES! hahhah they are fucking awesome
---
If it is the class fantasy, I'd say priest.
---
I guess you mean Eastern Kingdoms papa - yeah you can grind to 60.
---
i think he forgot that, and was thinking on EK
---
Tier 5 warlock set is the most beautiful thing ever created
---
!RemindMe 80 days
---
Druids are always the least played on both sides, mage warrior rogue are the most. You will see a decent amount of them.
---
You don't understand Classic man. Method said that private server guilds don't seem much, and they will easily beat them.
---
PRIDE is what will stop top private server players join Method. They want to PROVE that they (private server players) are BETTER.
---
Method Oand other top retail guilds) will want to prove the contrary.
---
You haven't played Vanilla, so you don't get it. Guild PRIDE is a thing, and a big one, in Vanilla.
---
don't forget about the secret chamber you have to swim to inside the cave, usually is loaded with nodes :-)
---
No. Just in every launch day ever. This one will be no different.
---
Oh yeah, Oxhorn. 👍
---
It’s going to be weird now that a large number of the player base will be in their 30s. The change from parent agro to wife agro on the Beta has been neat. 
---
Like I’ve had to log from a few groups because my wife needs something. The weird part? No one has given me shit for it any any group. Just a lot of “no worries dude see you next time”
---
Going for wf is a lot harder than learning boss mechanics lmfao. How does this garbage get upvoted.
---
True, but there are also a ton frothing at the mouth to embarass them as well.
---
Better endgame.  Better raiding.  Better class balance.  Better PvP.  Worse world building and the inclusion of flying and daily quests.
---
TBC was my first ever experience with a MMO, and I still treasure a lot of memories from those times: questing with friends, learning the game, spending my days in The Barrens, then learning that there was another world (Outland), learning to fly, world pvping... Everything happened on TBC for me, and this is the expansion that brings me nostalgia the most.  
---
I also love WotLK, because it was then that I really learned how to play and enjoyed PvP. But TBC has a special place in my life.
---
Would like thoughts on this also, I’m in the same position
---
Plot twist.. I stole them both..
---
Bosses have a 14% chance to parry. Skarm didnt know this when he made this vid. He went with PS-numbers and thats 5%.   
---
DW against 14% parry and you will get parried alot = you will get extra instant attacks to the face. Yeah, mostly you will probably get the shield up in time and your healers will have sh!t their pants, but you live. But some times you will not have the time to bring that shield up and pop last stand etc, because you will be brought "instantly" from high health to no health.  
---
I'm not saying DW fury tanking is BS, but I'd say its more of a way for prot wars to switch it up and having some fun if the guild is starting to get overgeared.
---
that's tough, i was referring to WoW, but I also spent countless hours in TFT multiplayer custom maps, specifically dota and tower defense games
---
Yes, but I don't believe they stream constantly. They do a lot of their play while not streaming. They also don't play to their audience like the dedicated streamers do.
---
I don't think warrior lay any hybrid tax at all. I would argue that warriors are the only real viable hybrid. Nobody else can do two things as good or better than the other classes.
---
they had 3 players at 120 in 5 hours. I can't even fathom how that's doable.
---
I’m not hard #nochanges for TBC, but I don’t think I it should be brutalized or cut up all sorts of ways like a small % of people do.
---
But, my favorite part of BC is the gameplay. It’s pretty much Classic 2.0. Classes and specs are more fleshed out and useful, but they still have old school class flavor. Dungeons are difficult, although I will say they are designed worse than Vanilla dungeons. Still, heroic 5 mans are the brutalist 5-man content in wows history, and I can’t wat to do them. Also, the raiding is excellent.
---
Even if flying and dailies are a negative, I don’t want them to change soooo much about TBC to the point where it’s an unrecognizable heap of what it was. 
---
I’ll also still play Classic on the side, and probably alternate between the two games forever.
---
W
---
Why just why
---
Night Elf priests. EVERYONE knows dwarf rules for priests, and human are second (on ally side) so while NE priests will still be a thing (and realistically okay)  they'll undoubtedly be rare.
---
Don't expect many Tauren hunters either.
---
New fresh - that's how you do it. Fuck TBC. TBC was boring and had Draeneis.
---
Fuck that
---
inb4 "but muh arena". The answer is go play a tbc private server.
---
Ok so no source confirming it besides your own speculation. Seems like a good reason to downvote me.
---
&gt;Pserver players spend 16 hours per day for 3 months when getting R14.
---
assuming they don't pool it like in the old days
---
Most of the mobs that run away are humanoid.
---
Most humanoids run away.
---
(These are two distinct statements).
---
I'm pretty sure they stated that as long as there will be players interested in the game, the servers (or probably at least one server) will be up.
---
For the 'forever and ever' part I meant that the Nax version (phase 6) will be out for a long time. Currently I haven't heard any plans for any future plans. No seasons, no follow ups so if this is what we get why not enjoy it, why rush?
---
Horde has more Incest? Damn, I really should consider Horde then.
---
Far left. He gives me better deals and always has mints.
---
I think there were specific beasts they would think are cowardly.  The rule of thumb is that most mobs that run away are humanoid, and most humanoids run away or enrage.
---
I think you mean only in Eastern Kingdoms? Looking at the zone levels, yes. It likely won't be optimal.
---
Tirisfal Glades 1-10
---
Silverpine Forest 10-20
---
Hillsbrad Foothills 20-30
---
Arathi Highlands 30-40
---
The Hinterlands 40-50
---
The quests within these zones likely won't take you through the whole level range, but you could grind your way through.
---
A troll rogue
---
not really bis though
---
They need the practice. It is a TOTALLY different game.
---
Mechanics are secondary...decursing, mana, threat, logistics, class composition, skills, talents, consumables, gear, etc. will give HEADACHES to any Raid Leader that goes for world first.
---
You have NO IDEA what going for even server first means. It is a MONUMENTAL task, one that in Retail DOES NOT EXISTS, except for mechanics.
---
But everything else is much more difficult.
---
owN owNNNNNNn
---
If that were true every Naxx geared guild would get those times, which they don’t, which means you’re full of shit.
---
The great thing about vanilla is that when new stuff comes out it doesn't make every thing before it obsolete like current wow.  There are some gear skips along the way, but for the most part you still have to progress through the older stuff first.
---
keep in mind this is a huge zone, its similar in size to ashenvale which also had 5 large quest hubs and way more small ones. its actually got the same playable area as loch modan, the wetlands and the searing gorge.
---
&gt; Hunters beat shadowpriest? Hahahahaha
---
Hunters have +5 yards and a mana drain, how is this difficult for you?
---
I'm so looking forward to being a feral druid with omen of clarity again. These old talent trees were so good.
---
I'm fairly confident that Blizzard in 2019 is up to the task of maintaining stability on launch day. The real challenge will be contending with the mass of players on Day 1. Layering will only ensure a "normal" amount of clusterfuckage, not eliminate it completely.
---
Yep it's great for when the quests in Westfall start becoming orange/red. It'll get you over that hump with relative ease. I headed over to Auberdine at level 14 and was greeted by a dozen or so yellow quests.
---
I'm unable to listen at the moment but does trollgodx get interviewed? It is genuinely amazing to me that people are still giving him attention lol
---
Why would Human Mage be the most played? It's not even the best race for either PvP or PvE.
---
The type of stream able content in classic is different than in live though,so it may change (it remains to be seen how this transitions from beta)
---
Pserver heroes don't have jobs, they are hardcore poopsockers.
---
I’ll give u a dollar
---
I mean it's a week out from launch, so you're not losing much by subbing to reserve names. I'll probably do it to try to reserve a cool name. If you let non-subs reserve names it defeats the point and would be an absolute shitshow.
---
A year and a half of content isn't rushing anything. Them adding a few more months won't change much. 
---
I'm fine with them making "casual" servers and slowing down the content on them. You guys don't seem to want that for some reason. Why?
---
&gt; but Vanilla storytelling was like non-existent.
---
Vanilla stories were things players did, not world story.  You'd hear about that one guy who ninja loot'd a guilds first Ragnaros kill, or the other guy who has been sitting under a bridge killing the other faction's lowbies when they walk across for a month.  The game had a story, but that's not what people cared about, it was just icing on the cake.  The guilds (and guild drama), the pvp, the adventures, those were the stories of Vanilla.
---
Ah ok, sorry to say it sucks then. Not trying to harsh your vibe. I usually opt for the wetlands run when I can, so my exposure to darkshore is actually a little limited. Light be with you!
---
Class spec balance, arenas, pvp gear, the raids, especially mount hyjal, karazhan and black temple.
---
New crafting gear. And of course my beloved tree form, a lot of people hate the tree but I adore that form. 
---
I rate tbc overall higher than classic. Didn't like wotlk that much, but it finishes the original warcraft 3 storyline.
---
Everything after that I don't care.
---
How many times are you going to write *mechanically trivial* in italics before it enters your thick skull that this has 0 relevance to getting world firsts?
---
The best route changes drastically depending on how many people are leveling using it though.
---
I think you're overestimating the amount of people who are going to be min/maxing. At the end of the day a lot of people are going to be human, I'd be very surprised if it isn't the highest population race. I figured mage or rogue would be popular picks for them because both seem to have a good reputation with Classic leveling, have good amount of flavor etc.
---
Thats to bad cause im really good healer... but ok
---
Ooga Gang is just a lesser version/copy of Pirates of the Pancreas
---
Unless you're in a huge rush to get 60 immediately, I'd honestly wait a few days, use a vacation day after labor day if you get it off. The huge crowds will be gone and you'll have a more enjoyable experience.
---
TBC held my first maxxed out character. It'll always hold a special place in my heart, with my shaman. I remember actually sitting through and seeing my first character to Max level just due to being in an awesome leveling guild. When Wrath came out, I got to see my second Max level character, in my druid. Took him all the way to Heroic ICC 25. Those fight mechanics in BC and Wrath were remarkable and challenging. That time was remarkable.

---
APES will hulk smash them...
---
You have much more faith than I do my friend!
---
Meaning it would get released... this year? 
---
I'm saying worth.
---
&gt; WoW was great because the lore that they took was all the obscure parts that were mentioned in passing but what we, as a player, were then able to explore with our own eyes without touching on the main storyline that involved the Alliance and the Horde all that much. 
---
100% true.  What made Vanilla awesome was that the stories you cared about were the actions of players, not the lore of the game.  The lore was there for people that cared about it, but it wasn't what people cared about.  People cared about that guy who ninja loots, or those guys that sit under that bridge and kill lowbies.  Those were the stories we cared about.
---
What about the private server players that already jump straight to "endgame" raiding? Are they also people who "just don't get it."?
---
Protip there's a mountain path near Gnomeregan you can walk up (no wall jumping required) from which you can jump suicide into the wetlands. It'll res you at the graveyard outside the harbour. No need to run through loch modan/all of wetlands
---
Yeah, a hunter that basically practiced speed runs on the same class for YEARS...and he hit 60 in 116 hours.
---
A Warrior will need, even in perfect conditions, at least 150 hours. Same for Rogues. The best DPS melee classes will need 150 hrs to lvl to 60.
---
They will have to play 15 hours/day, for 10 days straight. It's crazy. I can't do it, but many will.
---
MC won't be cleared in first or second week. Not enough time to lvl, gear up and farm consumables.
---
But it will be cleared the moment the reset comes for week 3. No doubt about it.
---
Who will be the first? Private server guilds or retail guilds? Hopefully, WoWprogress will pull API from Classic.
---
Sorry I started about TBC time and was still too young to understand anything. What’s so special about Duskwood?
---
You must be a really bad player if you cant imagine a priest dispelling viper sting.
---
What were those stones for?
---
&gt; If enough people move onto another expansion, ***consolidate the servers, keep at least one***. I’m sure there will be enough people always to do Vanilla content.
---
You only consolidate servers when there is realm bloat; which we already know Blizzard is trying to avoid. "Realm bloat" describes dead servers that need to get consolidated. 
---
You stated "That made no sense" to someone who said 
---
&gt; now you've created the problem of realm bloat which blizzard is trying to avoid, thus developing layering.
---
Layering allows the game to launch and run with fewer servers in order to avoid having dead servers. 
---
Launching a new expansion and allowing players to choose between staying or transferring to the new expansion will decimate the original server communities. It's also, by definition, going to create realm bloat. 
---
I'm really confused as to what part "made no sense" to you. But having been through a few of them myself, I rather dislike your proposed solution of "just merge the servers".
---
Everything
---
It can be as small as sapping someone and make them miss their boat
---
It can be taking the respawned quest mob in front of them then dissapearing in thin air.
---
It can be straight out pummeling people who equip their rp crappola gear
---
Small,sly, crap like that ruin other players day.
---
Granted i am probably gonna roll normal pvp server but yeah...sometimes getting in roll of a sneaky backstabber can be fun
---
Forming a group. No one uses them though.
---
Yeah need the sub for sure or you let 4chaners run wild.
---
I had fun doing Ony with a few 70 friends as a level 60.  Took awhile, but her damage was very low so with a well geared healer + sustainable tank you could stay up indefinitely.  
---
Did it with enh sham (me), priest healer, ms warr and I think like.. a hunter or mage or other rdps.  
---
Dropped a lot of gold plus epics for disenchant
---
The Ooga gang is great lol. Funny server meme or whatever.
---
TBC is Classic as far as i'm concerned
---
The last two launch days have been fine.
---
Because beta started and they only gave out a few thousand keys.  Nothing breeds hype like scarcity.
---
And how many times do I need to repeat it until it gets into your thick skull that this is *one* of the points - read **one** of them - of why extensive training isn't necessary?
---
Let me summarize this for you in an easy way:
---
1. Thrash is trivial.
---
2. Bosses are trivial.
---
3. Most stuff is a gear check.
---
4. Routes can be researched.
---
5. All this information has been out there for years.
---
What part of this is hard for you to understand? Do you seriously believe that someone who does this kind of thing for a living and has been for years has no effective way of preparing for *all* these things? To learn and plan speedrun routes, research pack skips, research BiS and class combinations and how to manage mana?
---
This is *absolutely doable* for an experienced group in two and a half months.
---
I just wish I had a picture of my talents. I have Counterattack and Aimed Shot but not Scatter or Wyvern, wtf was I doing.
---
No one's got time to climb a flight of stairs.
---
We talk about world firsts man. As in 40 lvl 58 in greens and blues, attempting to be the fastest to clear MC.
---
There will be wipes after wipes, because of MANY things that retail players don't get : threat, hit, mana, consumable use, etc.etc.
---
You will see that Classic raiding is much more difficult in it's entirety than Retail...just give it one month after release and see what the AVERAGE player will do in MC.
---
What’s up you cool classic fans?
---
Can't be, because both Ice Barrier and Mana Shield produce an effect around the character which is missing during the hit for 440.  
---
At frame 920, you can see the "440" displayed above the Gnome  
---
At frame 978, the Gnome casts what looks like Ice Barrier  
---
At frame 1155, the Gnome starts to cast something else  
---
At frame 1167, an "Absorb" appears above the Gnome, right after some melee attacks from the Shaman  
---
Since the framerate of the video is 60.034, each frame lasts for ~16.65ms.  Frame 920 to 978 is 58 frames, 58*16.65 = 968.6ms, almost a full second, so this is probably not a Spell Batching issues as the batch is processed every 400ms.
---
Now, the Gnome only attempts to cast 6 spells before frame 920, none of which are a shield:  
---
At frame 332 he starts casting Ice Bolt  
---
At frame 494, he casts Frost Nova  
---
At frame 585, he starts casting Ice Bolt  
---
At frame 630, he casts Arcane Explosion   
---
At frame 722, he casts Blink  
---
At frame 825, he starts casting Ice Bolt
---
I'm looking at these 10 month old life at 60 collections and there are about 12 top level comments with 1/3 of them being the equivalent of, "I played a warrior, but never got to 60 until TBC!"
---
Tanaris was number 2 for me too while leveling! I always did some combination of Desolace/Tanaris from 37-49 or so.
---
Never was a fan of Night Elf-stylized zones like Feralas either.
---
How do you get gold as Rogue? 
---
Is it possible to get gold for 1st mount before lvl 40? How do you get gold for epic mount?
---
looks like it was done in error
---
Shaman are best as an offtank to be honest.  Max rank earth shock will often pull threat, and if not then windfury will finish the job.  You can pretty easily keep adds off of squishies, or if the tank has it all then just keep your 2H out and get big wf hits. 
---
Shaman can main tank but it requires a special group to kind of change their playstyle and you really want a mage there as well because oyu have to drink ALL the time.
---
There has never been a 100% smooth launch by blizzard. On a good launch you deal with sporadic lag spikes and occasional disconnects but it’s still playable. On a bad launch you sit at the login screen for hours.
---
My guess is that this will be a “good” launch, i.e. playable but with lag and disconnects.
---
Uhm, that means all servers.  Server-first is a separate thing.
---
I think I still have some screenshots of my orc rogue hanging out with the Alliance leaders. I couldn’t get higher than the stairs on Magni without running the risk of aggroing him, but I was able to get behind Tyrande, Mekkatorque, and I think Bolvar.
---
I like to imagine putting bunny ears on Mekkatorque. Yes, I am just that warped.
---
I have them in the running for bwl onwards for that reason, but I think they will get smoked on mc and ony due to it being a leveling race, not a raid race.
---
Gamers rise up
---
Understandable completely. They should always have 1.12 regardless. Blizz may never make a good mmo
---
1.3 is before 1.12.
---
1.3 was released in March 2005
---
1.12 was released in August 2006
---
I can't choose between Warlock and Hunter. Going to be playing casually, mostly exploring the world again, WPvP, dungeons and an occassional raid. Which one do you think will perform best with the least gear?
---
RP fear of sea and zeppelin flying?
---
TBC had my absolute favorite "beggining of end game": Heroic 5 mans -&gt; Kara 10 man -&gt; Loot reaver/Loot below 25 man -&gt; actually doing the 25 mans
---
At one point most of the guild will be getting item upgrades in heroics AND Kara AND 25 mans, and boy what a magical time that is to raid and do dungeons.
---
This right here should be the discussion for how TBC should be handled. I think this should be an entirely new thread as I don’t believe your comment will get enough views.
---
The Alliance definitely has more inbreeding.
---
There are not many paladin pvp videos that may be considered skill induced, but Zalgradis is to this day fun to watch. Not your typical ret or reckoning. Given it's pre 1.12, talents are not yet fully shuffled and you can see SoC, consecration and Holy shield in one build. 
---
https://youtu.be/DlA0aolJCYs part one
---
 https://youtu.be/iBOYeeimqHg part two
---
https://youtu.be/kL4VDO8MBhg three
---
It's not going to help - those fanboys will never be level 60 fast enough to make a difference in the world 1st race.
---
Yeah it's almost as good as t5 druid!
---
You don't need full bis to clear mc, just as much of it as you can get. Hell, don't even need everyone to be 60.
---
that's because Blizzard literally started with those zones and they had the most iteration and time to mature.. Horde zones kinda got tossed in at the last minute.
---
I don't really fault Blizz for it though.
---
Nostalrius didn't have dynamic spawns on launch
---
It’ll help him understand why he’s paying money to not play BfA, but a remaster of the 15y/o version.
---
&gt; You must be a really bad player if you cant imagine a priest dispelling viper sting.
---
How exactly?

Exactly

Shamans:
---
\+ Disruptive: **Purge,** grounding totem, tremor totem, earth shock
---
\+ Extreme burst (with gear)
---
\+ Windfury
---
\+ Mail
---
\+ Nature's Swiftness: extreme flash healing
---
\+ Good match-ups: Mage, Paladin, Hunter
---
\- **Curse of Tongues**
---
\- No hard CC
---
\- Support totems like Windfury not functional in pugs, can't change group.
---
\- No proper dispel: can't break polymorph, entangling roots, frozen, etc.
---
\- Mana problems
---
\- Gear dependent
---
Priests:
---
\+ Better pocket healers: Dispel, renew, PW:Shield. Able to support while moving.
---
\+ Mind control
---
\+ Psychic scream — melee peel and CC
---
\- Dispel is twice as expensive as purge, not as spam-able.
---
\- Virtually no damage
---
\- Cloth; common focus target
---
Admittedly I have more experience with Shamans but I hope this helped.
---
Shaman is a more offensive support. Typically they’re brought into premades for the big ele burst which can really swing the tides in a battle. The ability to lightning bolt &gt; NS &gt; chain lightning (which makes them both land at the same time due to the travel time of ltb) and follow up with a shock to instagib someone is extremely powerful in WSG/AB (and wpvp of course). You have the ability to off heal, which can be clutch, and purge is everyone on your team’s best friend.
---
Priests are a little different. As disc/holy, you just always need to be with the team (or a warrior at the minimum). Disc priest pvp is more centered around dispelling, bubbling, and flash heal/mana burn. Its a much more defensive style (as paladins on alliance are usually the offensive healer for freedom/etc.) than shammies as you simply don’t do nearly as much damage/burst. I personally prefer priest due to the offensive/defensive dispel, but I’m primarily a horde player (where no one else can defensively dispel magic).
---
If you like to kill people, shammy is probably the better choice between the two.
---

---
At lower skill levels and gear SL is really good to help you survive. But once you have enough Spell Power the extra damage for killing people is much better. 
---
It's easier to survive if you can kill someone in 5 seconds rather than stacking stam + SL and letting the battle drag on and on. Before you have the damage, that's the strat. Once you have the damage then damage is the name of the game.
---
What I like in TBC is class balance. What I do not like is that there is no point to going back to the Old World and flying.
---
Good to know! I was planning on going for imp righteous fury first but this is great information. I think I'll go for cons first then.
---
imagine thinking china don't get world first
---
It's actually funny how everybody calls the healers hybrids when the only optimal thing they do in raids is heal. "The hybrid classes" oh you mean the guys doing nothing but healing 95+% of the time? 
---
The only class that actually does two rolls regularly in raids is warriors. They are the only actual hybrid class in end game raiding for the vast majority of the time.
---
Sell it when classic comes out
---
&gt;the top pserver guilds 
---
Will have a &lt;Method&gt; guild tag
---
What’s the name of this keyboard?
---
Did you have to downvote me to say that? Cool.
---
Time will tell.
---
I had the same thought. The flight up to TK could be from an NPC that you needed to do a chain quest to unlock or something.
---
Just a really cool and well done zone. It’s pretty much an enclosed dark and gloomy forest with caves, crypts and cemeteries. Anyone that likes Halloween will love this place.
---
Wasn’t me.

First off let's talk about what wow is. Wow is an MMORPG the first two letters of that acronym stand for massively multiplayer. So what makes a multiplayer game "good"? I think many people would agree that the key component of a multiplayer game is player interaction. Look at bdo and Poe I would argue that while these are good games, they are not good multiplayer games. Bdo lacks any real player interaction beyond the market place and late game pvp, but when leveling and exploring the world theres no insensitive to join up with other people, infact the game encourages you to keep others at a wide distance. Because of this when it comes to pop the people you're fighting just feel like npcs that fight back a little harder. Poe has players even further removed, you basically play solo and meet other players only to trade.
---
So why do I bring all that up? Because most of your suggestions involve removing player interaction. Your vision of what a hard core server would be is essentially a solo experience. So let's address your points directly.
---
&gt; you are comparing wow to a 2d hack n slash game or whatever it is... noone cares about PoE or Diablo, we are here to talk about WoW and how Hardcore could be implemented there. (its rather obvious you have a boner for PoE/diablo)
---
It's a good comparison. You just dont understand that were talking about mechanics separately from the games they are attached to. The artistic and design choices of both of those games (your criticism that it's a 2d multiplayer action rpg instead of a 3d online tab target rpg) have little to do with how hard core implementation could be achieved. Both of those games have a hard core and have implemented them very well. They have done so without removing a majority of player interaction and gutting the soul of thier games.
---
&gt;To keep it pure and equal to every player you NEED to disable things or someone is gonna have streamer-benefits or some other help that makes their hardcore to what BFA leveling is now. (there are features in D3 that are disabled in HC if you didnt know... such as the ability to transfer items to your HC character)
---
Theres a lot of bullshit to unpack here. I'm gonna brake it down a bit further.
---
&gt;To keep it pure and equal to every player you NEED to disable things
---
Pure =/= equal. To make the game equal you would need to remove all item drops, non fixed gold gains, any damage ranges, crit chance, classes, trading, mail, gear with stats, pvp. I'm sure I'm forgetting things but this is already too much. For example to make things equal you could not have a dagger that drops from a mod with an attack range of 1-5. If they roll a 5 then luck gave them an advantage over some one who rolled a 1 or even someone who was not lucky enough to get a dagger drop. Striving for equality is what turned vanilla into the current BFA shit cake.
---
&gt;or someone is gonna have streamer-benefits or some other help that makes their hardcore to what BFA leveling is now.
---
So basically you need trading and player interaction removed because you cannot make friends. I get it now, you want wow single player because you lack the social skills to form groups with other people and work toward common goals. You see other people who are able to do what you cannot and say "ThEy HaVe StReAmEr BeNeFiTs, ThAtS nOt FaIr!" Hate to be the one to break it to you kiddo, but social interaction is a skill just like any other. You're not gonna get better at it by pretending otherwise or demanding others be hamstrung because of your impotence. That's how we got to BFA levels of homogeneity between classes. People complained that the people who were good at playing, had better social and mechanical skills than them were getting better loot. So blizzard listened to people like you and gutted the classes down to basics and put in all these catch up mechanics to make the game easier. For people like you, the impotent.
---
&gt;(there are features in D3 that are disabled in HC if you didnt know... such as the ability to transfer items to your HC character)
---
Strange straw man, no one is suggesting we be able to transfer items across servers.
---
&gt;If you want to argue, then make a proper point yourself instead of pointing towards something else.
---
Providing examples of how it was done right is a valid form of argumentation. If you want to argue then you're gonna need to up your game son, pop a viagra or two and bring some hard dick arguments instead of these soft dick ones you got now.
---
Remove the anime sticker and might be worth 3.50$ (sarcasm)
---
Oh yeah, cool.
---
I'm talking about something else.
---
I thought corpses disappear with the weekly server reset
---
Fuckin Reported
---
That is irrelevant. TOP HARDCORE Naxx geared guilds that practiced speed runs since 2008 are able to clear MC in 17 minutes? What a surprise.
---
I can clear SM GY in less than 3 minutes at lvl 120.
---
Does this means that 5 random lvl 32-35 will do the same? Or that SM is easy?
---
Means nothing regarding difficulty.
---
Its probably also worth mentioning that with the current schedule its looking like the next Retail raid should come out before classic.  They might be figuring they can get through that and then no life Classic for a while during the 'downtime' between raids.
---
Arenas :)
---
naxx geared people weren't replacing most things until heroics/kara.  specific items like rejuv gem or nelth's tear were incredibly strong since good trinkets were hard to come by.  they even nerfed stuff like shaman t2 3 piece set bonus and thunderfury because they were BiS at 70.
---
Trash loot drop rates are higher than pserver so I don’t have to take skinning? This definitely comes as a surprise. Every guide I’ve been reading suggests taking skinning due to the extra income but this definitely changes that point. 
---
But as a rogue maybe I should still take it for cheeky devilsaur skinning steals? Decisions decisions
---
page 2 works and download it if you dont want people making changes while youre in there
---
People forget the one, unbeaten, boss from vanilla. No-one downed it before TBC rolled around.
---
Hakkar the Soulflayer!
---
Yes, really!
---
We got him on easy mode, without the high priest buffs, some brave souls even took him out with one, two or three buffs still on him.
---
Nobody took down Hakkar with all high priest buffs.
---
^((ignore that it was mathematically impossible even with BiS Naxx gear...))
---
If you watched could you please briefly summarize so I don't have to scan through hours of video? Would be helpful.
---
There were more players online at launch on that pserver launch than on any singular realm that Blizzard will have. A Guild like Progress or APES will 100% take World 1st MC. You don't need good players to clear MC, you need players willing to play 18-20 hours/day for 7-10 days and who know Vanilla leveling inside and out.
---
The entire argument was about the fact whether or not Method players require research and practise to achieve a world first, which they do, and I see you’re slowly starting to realize it. Again, points 1-3 are arguments against what you’ve been trying to argue all this time. Trivial content requires knowledge and experience to speedclear, not mechanical skill. People with years of experience have a clear advantage. Doing research is not comparable to actually clearing the same raid for years on end.
---
I’m sorry my thick skull remark hurt your feelings so much, but you have to understand that it looks silly when your arguments prove to opposite of what point you’re trying to make.
---
I suspect the "harder" pserver values are inaccurate and Classic values are correct.
---
Class population usually correlates more or less to class spread in a raid tbh
---
You’ll need lots of warriors, rogues, mages and as such there will always be lots
---
The only exception is hunters as they attract a lot more casual players
---
Press and hold
---
Big brain OC
---
Oh damn, I've been reading it as 1.1.2 this whole time
---
You can flag yourself. But then, whoever wants to fight will 100% have the jump on you, because you can't attack them until they've hit you and flagged themselves. Not a great experience.
---
Yeah that was a mistake on my part forgot dispell was holy. Hunter still wont ever win against a spriest 1v1. I dont know why you hate spriests so much and are trying so hard to make them bad. Clearly no one in this thread agrees with you. What do you think you know that we dont?
---
They can easily bring in elite pserver players to go over MC speed clear strategy, specifically designed for an under-geared raid. With the amount of time and effort Method takes to prepare that won’t be an issue, they will have spreadsheets and assignments and everything planned out. 
---
The real question, is if they can level more efficiently than elite private server guilds that have a lot of experience speed-levelling. Between vanilla and private servers, most of these guys have levelled 1-60 10+ times and they’re really good at it. Because of this, I just don’t see Method levelling fast enough as a guild to win this initial world first. BWL+ is anyone’s game.
---
This is for personal use mostly, if you want you can screenshot
---
This is all fine, and I don't think anyone really gives a shit about leveling builds - nobody really expects a priest to be specc'ed holy at level 20, they just expect them to use their healing spells in Van Cleef.
---
I just hope people don't roll a paladin or shaman expecting to do anything but healing in endgame raids because it would be very disappointing to spend 2 months leveling a character only to realize you hate the role you're forced into, and I saw this happen *ALL THE TIME* in vanilla.
---
Raids are better, classes are more fun to play, awful pvp ranking system removed, and I really like the general aesthetic.
---
How would the hunters go about feeding them gear? BoEs? Carrying through dungeons?
---
Yes, my hope is that if Classic is a success, they will increase the size of the team working on it and be able to make such changes.
---
No probs cuz straight up on the dooblybop doop. Imma fixin to cruise dasdoaqdqwefwekgnjkg
---
I got bored and mashed keys. You're a fuckwit.
---
Yes!
---
Lol no idea why I thought your account name was linked to your chars.
---
Although with battle net it is right?
---
Preach! I stand beside you, except I liked the new zones. I dream of TBC w/o flying mounts and relevant PvE gear every day👀
---
It's been done on every recent private server - what makes you think they wouldn't do it for the real thing this time?
---
Icon looks fine to me
---
2 Questions.
---
Horde or Alliance on Druid?
---
Alchemy or Leatherworking as my main profession?
---
Except that this is all lore so if you care about your faction choice from a gameplay perspective this does nothing to help you.
---
Great idea! If someone has the know-how for the backend I can do the frontend stuff - I made barrens.chat so I have some experience already.
---
But people don't.. your entire post is based around something that doesn't happen. Minmaxing is for raids

Normally this meme implies the person on the couch is going to be the victim but from the picture I get the sense the viewer is going to be the victim by everyone here instead &gt;-&gt;
---
that's a pretty drastic assumption, calling it a ghost town. Even with WoW's declining population, it's still got the population levels of other MMO's considered successful like ESO and FFXIV. I do think it will be interesting to see what BFA areas look like the first week of classic release, though. I'll have to check /r/wow that week. Lots of tears and tantrums, I predict.
---
No. We are top dps behind warriors.
---
Death and Taxes is coming back.
---
this 'boys' meme can't die fast enough.
---
Druids.
---
I liked TBC. I had fun. I want to go back. Without being forced to stop playing it because of a new expansion.
---
Thankyou so much for this!!
---
They are recruiting for Classic.
---
Good luck, maybe one day you can buy a vr wife or husband sorry dont want to assume you are straight.
---
I'm missing Gegons videos in this list, maybe they we'rent as big due to him playing on a french realm (I think)? But I remember watching them back in vanilla and them being a large part of why I rerolled from an undead to a gnome mage :-)

---
And I guess, if no one else recognizes these, don't add them :)
---
I'm lucky that it's launching after work (6pm) on the east coast on that Tuesday.  but IMO I wouldnt go out of your way on Day 1.
---
My plan is to login make sure I have all the names I want and maybe put in a few hours (if thats even possible).  I plan to get a good nights sleep and wake up super early the next day to avoid the rush and then wake up 7 am east coast - hopefully too early for east coast nerds and west coast nerds will just be going to sleep.  Hopefully any server issues would be fixed by then as well.
---
Launches are way more smooth nowadays though blizzard has done well so we'll see how it is
---
“Do you seriously believe that they will need months of dedicated training to effectively clear MC as fast as possible?”
---
Yes. The word ‘effectively’ is redundant in that question by the way.
---
And it shows the tooltips when touched. That is my gripe with wowhead classic on mobile.
---
This post itself is essentially beating a dead horse as this has been stated many times, but I will add my two cents regardless just in case this happens to be the post someone sees when they / *gasp* /use the search bar.
---
You can give people advice and that's fine. Seeing someone who is a pure DPS class struggling to do damage when their gear is good is fine, imo. The thing we should avoid is belittling people in doing so.
---
Saying things like "Hey what is your spec?" "Have you thought about trying XYZ?" and bringing things up constructively with a reason, I feel, is fine.
---
What we want to avoid is the "Dude WTF is your spec. That's trash" "That spec (referring to ret/enh/etc) is s***, you need to be XYZ". These things are not constructive and benefit either party in 0 ways.
---
I bid 5 DKP
---
You'll still be able to buy 6 slots for 5 silver. If you're getting more armor drops to sell you can afford to buy your bags earlier. Not saying tailoring is a bad idea because you will save money and upgrade your bags faster if you go tailoring
---
Well, as I’ve mentioned in an edit for original post, it seems the site I linked is based off an older, flawed version of Pingaan’s sheet. It has not been updated, while OP’s sheet has new info and it seems to be updated every so often. I cannot confirm ALL of its accuracy, but it appears to be better.
---
Many lists that have come out in the past few months on discord’s, forums, YouTube, etc. actually don’t use progressive itemization, since we’ve known for a long time how Blizz is handling that. Seems the errors tend to be flawed info (like items from wrong phases).
---
&gt; If there is one expansion that Rp-Pvp realms should be in from the launch, it is classic! 
---
Said someone who didn't play them until TBC
---
I know about the Onyxia-style raid entrance but where's the second one?
---
I'm more on the side of the ugly underdogs who have to fight to survive. Alliance adventurers, particularly humans, are just cleaning up their own mess.
---
MDI? The event that barely got any viewers?
---
I'm not a devote advocate of TBC but once the shine has worn off of classic in a year or two I would definitely play it. I began playing in TBC but didn't reach max level until the very beginning of Wrath so I'd be as excited to experience the TBC raids during relevancy as I am to do the same on classic.
---
No Onyxia Wipe Animation?
---
no? having a legion of fanboy working to comple the war effort weeks ahead of other servers?
---
Ya it would definitely be a shitshow, not saying they should do it just that the stats would be inconsistent. It's 2 weeks before launch so I'm curious how many people will just kinda toss away $7.50 to start making their characters. Im sure a lot of big fans like this sub will, but just normal people coming back will wait until the 26th/7th to start up again
---
No one is forcing anyone to play any spec, unless you want to raid in a semi hardcore / hardcore guild that wants to progress quickly. Don't expect to be paired with good players if you don't take the advice of people who are knowledgeable and have years of experience in this iteration of the game.
---
Dungeons experience prior to 60 does not matter as any spec can handle everything before Strath / UBRS / LBRS / Scholo / DM E+N+W.
---
No one will give a shit unless you're trying to melee hunter or some dumb nonsense.
---
Liked: Arenas
---
Disliked: Flying mounts
---
If they added arenas to Vanilla I could live without BC, at least for a while longer. But without any rated PvP the game feels unfinished to me.
---
Ideally, they would release Classic BC **without flying mounts** (or with severely restricted flying, e.g. no epic flight, no flight in zones that don't require it, etc.).
---
He did, and he destroyed so many grey items even when his bags werent full, I wonder how much he actually threw away in that stream, haha
---
Play the game the way you want. I'll play the game the way I want. Stop telling others how to enjoy their free time elitist casual.
---
I had someone give me shit for leveling hybrid Prot as a warrior on the Beta. He then promptly died the next pull after AOEing in the first few seconds and pulling threat. How’s that 2hander work out for ya their bud? 
---
I know my build is not ideal for soloing but it’s great for groups. I hope to have a pocket healer all the way to 60 with my friends group. Half of them are rolling Priests/paladins/Druids. So I should never want for a healer as long as they keep up with my leveling pace.
---
I have had this experience a few times in Vanilla, where I'm in a dungeon group that whispered me, a priest, asking if I wanted to heal for them.   I arrive at the dungeon only to have 1 person in the group critique my talent choices, my rotation, my gear.   There is always that one person who thinks they know best.   My solution, "you play how you want, I'll play how I want".   If they continue I just put them on my ignore list.
---
Fortunately, while leveling this was few and far between, but it did happen.
---
Yeah, seeing basically zero hype for 8.2. Or indication the philosophy is changing for retail. They really are going to ride their design choices right into the ground.
---
that's assuming they try.  
---
Let's see someone doing those MC times in pre raid bis, BWL times in MC bis and so on.
---
Private servers enabling cheat-code-gaming are beside my point.
---
Blizzard trying to keep the content treadmill running for top-end guilds is what lead down the path of expansions that trivialized leveling, dungeons and exploring the World of Warcraft.
---
We got less world content and more Raid-focused content including things like LFR. Because the World of Warcraft became *only* about Raid content and ‘we can’t have players missing out...’ became Blizzard’s focus.
---
This is what broke the game. Hopefully Blizzard doesn’t make the same mistake this time around.
---
If people would quit games because some top players are clearing everything in 2 days...there won't be any games out there.
---
Your vanilla footage you're providing as a counter example is where a warrior starts his swing while neil is in range, and runs out of range before the damage is dealt?
---
That _is_ how melee is supposed to work and _not_ an example of leeway behavior.
---
I preferred TBC for a lot of reasons, but even if you don't, what's going to happen with classic when everything is cleared?  You always need to pump out new content.  So it would either be TBC or they would do a new 60 raid.  Considering how much easier and probably more money TBC would bring, I'm guessing Blizzard goes that route.
---
They are basically pulling a Disney.  Keep releasing games that will sell from nostalgia.  Pretty low risk (although not as low as movies).
---
Hunter for sure. Warlock is notorious for being hopeless in pvp until they get the later raid gear.
---
I get the feeling you really like pirates
---
Ill be working a full day on monday as it launches for me at 6pm on the east coast US. Then starting my wow vacation tuesday. Hopefully servers will be playable most of tuesday. We’ll see.
---
but you don't need years of experience
---
 lol ll miss these timess.. now lvl 1-100 in 6hour  that ridiculous after blizzard wonder why the population on wow drop  lol ll
---
It's not quite as good as Duskwood, but I really like Silverpine.
---
&gt;Method will win if they buy out a pserver guild and pay them to train and carry their main personalities (Sco, etc).
---
They will. Why wouldnt they?
---
Hell yeah! And sure hunter dps in the last two raids is bad... but they are amazing in everything else! Group pvp, world pvp, dueling, and soloing capabilities are all still A Tier. Nerubian Slave Maker is the most badass name for a weapon too
---
So basicaly private server standard
---
&gt; your bags will be full from trash
---
So I'm not the only one who noticed this? I was struggling for bag space early on due to looting so many grey items.
---
Good for them
---
The things I do for love.
---
Having never played Vanilla.... Is there a speed leveling guide somewhere I could learn from?
---
&gt;When people get to raids then the builds matter
---
This isn’t even really true for the first 3-4 phases. You could clear shit in vanilla with 10-15 literal potatoes in your raid, and we’re a lot better now. Unless you’re in some super hardcore-been-waiting-15-years-practicing-16-hours-a-day-on-pservers crowd, you’ll be fine. Have fun.
---
&gt; Hunter deadzone is 5-11 instead of 5-8.
---
Oh no.
---
I don't know, Vanilla Naxxramas was very tough. You essentially needed 8 geared warrior tanks for the fight, and with a 40 man raid you naturally have attrition of people leaving over time. It can be tough to maintain your raid group. Granted Method or a highly qualified and recognized guild name will likely have an easier time finding refill for raiding spots, but I think you discount how tough that raid was.
---
Not all heroes wear capes!
---
I want to hate my life 1-59 so I'm rolling warrior
---
That's a fair point. However I did have a ret paladin friend who did just fine in raids with his guild so exceptions can be made.
---
You can go into instances and pick pocket all the humanoids so that's nice.
---
The problem with adding more content to level 60 is a lot of people will never see it.  Many people won't ever clear Naxx, which means even a smaller % would clear whatever is added after.  I understand how frustrating it is for the top players to have their progress wiped with a new expansion, but you can't just tell most players they will literally never see the new content.
---
You can't just remove flying from BC. A lot of maxlevel content is designed for flying. Ogri'la, Skettis, Netherwing, a lot of misc places in all zones that can't be reached without flying.
---
Removing flying would damage the expansion, not improve it. Which is another reason why rereleasing fundamentally flawed expansions is not a good idea imo. TBC is somewhat okay in terms of game-damaging features, but wrath has some crap in it that I never ever want to see in Classic.
---
The OSRS way is the only viable long term option. Rereleasing expansions just postpones the inevitable death of classic by a fixed amount of time. I'm quite baffled that so many people can't see something so obvious.
---
&gt; Elwynn, Westfall, Redridge and Duskwood feel like actual storylines.
---
Durotar, Silverpine, STM and the Barrens feel more like actual zones, though. I mean, I like how Alliance has a zone-spanning, cohesive narrative, but I *also* like how the Horde experience feels like trying to tame an unconquered, wild land.
---
For Priest, I see the wand spec/spirit tap alternate back and forth suggested often, but I just don't see it. Wands do the most % of damage earliest in leveling, so I go for that immediately. It is also a better talent incrementally. You don't even have much if any spirit gear by level 14, so it's not as useful. I think it's fine to finish spirit tap by 19.
---
tl;dr IMO wand spec, then spirit tap
---
I haven't played Naxxramas long enough to be able to judge that one.
---
&gt; Minimum range for charge and shoot is 8 yards, but that's just the spells themselves, without hitboxes/combatreach taken into account.
---
Why would a ranged attack care about hitbox/reach.
---
Looking for a class and race:  
---
Casual player, heavy interest in PVP, want something that isn't heavily dependent on play time or gear, but can still be viable in most end game content, something with a more relaxed and fun playstyle
---
Thats so not true. There are at least 3 builds, pvp, pve and solo
---
Reasons to go Horde:
---
This post.
---
It got it a month later, not a huge deal when everyone keeps saying they have so much more "experience" and they have been doing this for yeaaaaaarrrrsssss
---
That's exactly what I'm getting at. I saw it happen too much in vanilla, BC, WoTLK etc. Advice is good, toxicity is not.
---
given the phasing of content, and PvP coming out with BWL there isn't really any meaningful advantage there.
---
I played hunter in Vanilla, and the week one of my friend got High Warlord I got my Ashjrethul. Sure, getting rank 14 guarantees those drops but you can't use them to progress BWL and they won't matter that much for AQ
---
TBC was my favorite time in wow.  
---
Easily
---
They took vanilla wow and the lessons they learned and simply improved on top of it rather than re-developing things.  So if you enjoyed Vanilla it was a straight up improvement.  Starting in wrath is when they started fiddling with how specs/classes played for example they started giving specs that didn't have to manage dots/debuffs...dots and/or debuffs to manage...
---
Pretty much every spec had viability to be brought to a raid(sans ret although we did have a hardcore pally who we let go ret sometimes even in Sunwell) AND specs/classes still had their own uniqueness.
---
It had a much better set of dungeons due to experience gained in vanilla plus the introduction of heroics.  I enjoyed the questing as I love being able to fill up my quest log and then destroy a section of the zone and then turn in a full log at once.  I hate the new system where you only get a 2-5 quests at a time and so are forced to run back and forth to the hub a lot more.
---
Not being a world first guild we didn't really have issues with the raids(ie the early tuning on vashj &amp; Tk, lady vashj is still my favorite raid boss) so to me perhaps hyjal was the only poor mark.
---
at 3:45-3:46, he's out of range at all times(red actionbars), yet still auto-attacks each other.
---
Hard to argue with War Stomp. Shadowmeld is pretty useless when you have cat stealth.
---
Concerning factions I'd guess alliance druids are slightly depreciated with all of the holy paladins taking up healing slots. At least with shamans you'll see the odd ele/enhancement build, especially in PvP.
---
Both of those professions will net decent money. Druids can solo farm devilsaur leather easily — but there might be a lot of competition for it this time around with guilds demanding BiS from their raiding members.
---
Yeah, +2 range not +20 lol
---
Even though Gnome is better, some people hate reputation grinding and human (especially as a mage) can really grind that shit out fast compared to anything else. Also you can just see gear better on humans and gear is one of the most important aspects of a n MMO
---
Yes it is. The LFG tool only matches you and teleports you to normals, heroics and timewalking dungeons. At no point are the hardest dungeons accessed by being sent there via teleport
---
&gt; What do you think you know that we dont?
---
That you cannot dispel viper sting?
---
My girlfriend would probably be annoyed at that bud.
---
Levelling speed is improved by practice.  Someone showing them a route won't make much difference.
---
Whatever you say chief
---
You were learning the game like the rest of us! I originally meleed as a hunter.
---
TBC's class balance is WAY better than vanilla's. That's most of the reason for me.
---
It feels like a logical extension of vanilla. Classes are still unique and have strengths/weaknesses, but they are much more fleshed out. That and hybrids are now raid viable. You can tank raids on a Paladin or Druid just fine, or DPS as Spriest or Ele shaman or Boomkin.
---
It directly fixed the biggest issues with hybrids, while still keeping their weaknesses in mind. Paladin tanks now have a taunt, and gain mana back whenever they are healed. Boomkins now use less mana and gain mana back when they use innervate on other people. Shadow Priests also use less mana and have not one but TWO ways of gaining their mana back (Vampiric Touch, Shadowfiend), plus no more debuff limit so they can use both of their DoTs, and Mind Blast no longer generates a fuckton of threat.
---
etc. etc.
---
It basically buffed all of the hybrids to the level that Feral druids were in 1.12: Viable, but suboptimal.
---
So here is the things i like about TBC
---
25 man raids were much more manageable
---
10 Man side raids like Kara and ZA were fun
---
Heroics were a great addition, I personally would love to see heroics classic dungeons (hard, max level with some new loot)
---
Justice gear was good as  a way of getting suboptimal upgrades and some RNG protection (however IQD gear specifically was way too good). You couldn't really get a full set and many pieces just were not as good as other choices but they allowed dedicated players to get guarenteed upgrades if they worked at it every week.
---
The attunement web was awesome (should have been account wide however)
---
Class design is just better than classic in almost every case other than a handful of outliers. Hybrid specs were made viable while maintaining their uniqueness.
---
Draenei are my favorite race, i would have way preferred ogres on horde than BE however.
---
The world design was very good, with many elite quests in areas and interesting zones / questing experiences. It was however blemished by flying kinda making it easy to ignore some things
---
TBC is the only expansion that felt like an actual expansion and not just a completely new version of the game. 
---
Ok now onto things i did not like about TBC
---
Flying was cool but was a long term bad decision
---
Resilience was a terribly thought out stat
---
I personally hate arenas with a burning passion and think that basing all pvp meaning around them was a mistake (they wern't generically a bad addition but i hate how blizz handled em). I am not campaigning to remove them but i think a second iteration would be good.
---
I think Sunwell was a poor decision, forcing out a way overtuned insanely hard raid just to appease the very top players wasn't good. Something harder than BT woulda been fine but sunwell took it way too far.
---
Raising the Level cap and almost all other content irrelevant was also bad, a system that allows new world progression and old world progression to exist at the same time would be a big improvement
---
Blades Edge mountains are a clusterfuck of a zone.
---
There's literally people on this post saying it happened to them, chief. It happened to me as well. If it didn't happen to you then that's a very good thing.
---
Only male has the larger hit radius.
---
For the same reason I want Vanilla: I played it in the past, I enjoyed it and I want to play it again. The Vanilla content is no longer available at all in current WoW, and the TBC content is rendered unfunctional by all the changes the game has had over the years.
---
And if they end up recreating TBC they should **NOT** change a damn thing no matter how much people dislike those features, for exactly the same reason they shouldn't do that with Vanilla as well. Leave it as it was, and if that isn't good enough for you then you shouldn't play.
---
class design. e.g. prot pally finally gets taunt,  shadow priest has unique role, etc.
---
MC attunement is a trivial matter, you can easily get it done in an hour. If you're in an organized guild most of them will probably just run through an empty dungeon to loot the item.
---
...I could be wrong, but that doesn’t sound right? I don’t remember that at all.
---
I would say they are 4th most popular
---
&gt; Method going hot in classic is good, but streamers are bad for the game,
---
I think part of it comes down to the time commitments. The types of streamers that people are complaining about are going to be paid to no-life it up for a few weeks while trying to get the server-first 60. There's genuinely absolutely no way someone who works 9-5 will ever come close to catching them, so that seems "unfair" to some, I'd think. 
---
Raiding is a little different, since the entire 40 man group has to be 60 before you can even start, so I think around the time that 'hardcore-casual' players are hitting 60 is when the majority of raids will start happening, unless there's quite literally a guild of 40+ streamers out there (And Method is probably the closest you'd get to that, while still not being fully there). 
---
So with raids, being a 'hardcore-casual' might still work, since you're also scheduling raids around times that work for 40 people and there's a good chance at least a handful of them also have regular 9-5 jobs. Going to bed one night, tied with the other highest level character on the realm, and waking up to him being 5-10 levels higher than you would just feel unfair though, especially if the other guy is getting paid to do what he's doing.
---
Just IMO though, because that's kinda sorta how I feel. I was right up there in the race for the top 5 Shaman 60s on Mal'Ganis during vanilla, but I'm already conceding that there's just no chance I can hope to repeat that nowadays.
---
Who cares about top guilds in classic? The only relevant topguild is going to be the one on your server, nothing else won't matter

---
Bingo.  TBC had much more balance and was mostly a better game except for maybe flying mounts which hurt a lot of the immersion.  I can't think of many things worse in TBC other than people who just simply want no changes.

---
Then omit all flying-related content.  We don't need flying for arena and pvp gear.
---
Somehow i feel like the forsaken have some nefarious plans. It’s almost as if I can see into the future.
---
I think it's possible to get a taste of both sides if you're not 100% dedicated to just 1 playthrough. Maybe spend 6-8 months initially on your main and achieve as much as you can, then make an alt on another realm and the opposite faction to experience it there as well. Then just go back and fourth between both toons.
---
Will take a lot of time and dedication, though. Hence why having a main really mattered most in Vanilla. You made your choice and you stuck with it, like it or not.
---
And does the LFG tool teleport you to those mythics and raids outside of LFR? No it does not. 
---
Using the LFG tool is no different than posting in trade chat
---
Very true. The horde zones (well, durotar and the barrens especially) feel like survival
---
Class design and PvE content. I like the world, I like the dungeons and the raids are some of the best they ever made.
---
I also really enjoy the fact that every dungeon becomes relevant again at 70 with the heroic tier, something I think they should consider for classic regardless. It's not about giving dungeons a normal and hard mode, but creating this new tier of end-game dungeons with a wide variety of choices (unlike raid tiers, where the content already is end-game).
---
I think a lot of the gripes people have with TBC are either a stuff a small minority have a big problem with or things that became much more egregious down the line. It was the one time in WoW when pretty much everyone playing from the most casual to the most hardcore actually enjoyed the game and there was a general positive tone in the community, instead of a ton of bitching and moaning.
---
As for what they could do with classic if they want to avoid just releasing TBC, I already mentioned heroic dungeon tier. They could also just give us all the new skills and talents and 10 extra talent points. Maybe even tie it to something like heroic dungeon progression. 
---
It would be strange to introduce the dungeons and raids without doing the whole continent though, which would necessitate flying. They could however limit it to normal flying mounts, and maybe even make them have a fairly short stamina bar (incentivizing ground mounts).
---
As for badge gear and dailies, I think some of it is ok. It went off the rails a bit towards the end, but they could probably go up to 2.1 or 2.2 as is, and then release a trimmed down version of 2.3.
---
Overall though I think they will have a much higher chance of success if they make a trimmed down version of TBC rather than trying to make a completely new experience using vanilla as a base.

---
Just a quick and dirty search. But hey similiar enough. there have been misheard lyrics far more off than this.
---
In my opinion, TBC was the best expansion in the game.  Legion is arguably close.  I'm not saying they're on par with each other.  I'm talking in terms of almost everything in that expansion was an improvement (or at least a subjective change) from what came in the expansion before.  Legion is to WOD what TBC was to Classic, but since Classic is several orders of magnitude better than WOD, TBC is still several orders of magnitude above Legion.
---
With that out of the way, why do I like TBC?
---
1. Better class balance.  Paladins were viable tanks, Paladins and Shamans available to both factions (prevents things like Gluth being a lot easier for Alliance), and Spriest, Boomkin, and Ele Shaman became viable classes.  Not to mention things like Resto druids finding their niche, a lot of changes to make Hunters and Rogues viable as CC during dungeons, among other things.  TBC had the best overall class balance in the game's history, especially in regard to tanks.
---
2. Combat rating system.  No more having a level 20 item with 1% crit being comparable to entry-level level 60 gear.
---
3. Heroic dungeons made dungeons viable content at level 70.  Vanilla didn't have 20+ 5-mans that were quality content for level 60 players.  (Although the ones they did have for 50+ were amazing).  
---
4. Daily Quests gave you something to do in order to earn gold besides picking flowers and grinding mobs.  
---
5. Points #3 and #4 would later become major issues when overused, but were done just right in TBC.
---
6. The changes to the PvP system were really needed, especially for low-level BGs.
---
7. Karazhan and Zul'Aman are my #2 and #3 favorite raid of all time.  Only Ulduar is higher.  Not to mention, the progression in TBC was perfect.  This was before hard modes, before heroic modes, before LFR, before raid size options.  I much prefer the 5/10/25 model of TBC and WotLK to the 10/20/40 model of Vanilla.
---
There's a lot of other minor things.  A lot of it may have to do with nostalgia, since I didn't really know what was going on most of my time in Vanilla and never even hit 60 before TBC hit.  TBC is when I got serious about the game, when my best friend got his own account so we could play together, when I started raiding.
---
As much as Classic holds the nostalgia factor for a lot of veteran players, for me that time is TBC.  There are a lot of things I like about TBC over that of Classic.  There are a few things I like about WotLK as well.  But TBC is always where I consider to be my home.
---
Ud is better for rogue than orc
---
They're going to have to compete with hardcore pserver guilds who've been speedleveling and clearing sever first MCs for years and are well versed with the content. It should be interesting to see how they compare.
---
If you save $$$ and sell grays and skin creatures to vendor leather you will have gold for mount at 40 with any class. If you don’t, kill swamp jaguars in Swamp of Sorrows because they drop a lot of gray items to vendor (plus free xp). I never played rogue but my friend did. He would pick pocket mobs in RFD and make his gold that way up to his swift mount. Professions also help but only rogues can pickpocket instances like that, and since it’s instanced you won’t have competition.
---
Then shame your own kink. Endless loop of kink.
---
Book off launch week. Maybe even launch month. Fuck it, go all out and just quit your job to become a full time adventurer.
---
There was something special, I've killed twilight fire guards (who normally use a 1h + shield) wielding 2 hand weapons and they always drop those same weapons. Its like they "equip" the item.
---
I wouldn’t bother, first day will be a shitshow
---
That would be my ideal. I’m nochanges on Vanilla, but I think one or two Vanilla style John Staats dungeons would be awesome in BC.
---
Correct, I  made that mistake. What else do you know that has made everyone else disagree with you? We never said spriest were ultimate pvp gods. Just good at 1v1 and have mana issues. They are widely considered top tier duelers
---
Putting it on now thanks for reminding me :)
---
Private servers require no investment though. I can make a free email, create a free account, download the client for free, and log in to play for free. You lose nothing if you're a toxic turd. The subscription in retail classic acts as sort of a filter. There will still be people who want to be toxic turds, but they still weight how far they push things as to not get banned or shunned because they are financially invested.
---
half the characters don't gain a skill (or only 1) from 100-120... that's pretty ass feeling.
---
Warriors who know how to tank and are willing to tank will be rare.
---
Fury DPS is like, bloodthirst on cooldown, WW is next priority, then HS if you need to burn excess rage. You hardly need any keybinds. You don't need to stance-dance. It's actually easier than playing a rogue in raid. It's a big reason why stacking fury warriors is cruise control to victory -- the spec yields great performance with minimal effort as long as the tank can maintain a high level of threat.
---
Tanking requires a ton of keybinds and much more situational awareness and decision-making. You have to mark and pull. If taunt is resisted you have to be ready to swap to battle stance and mocking blow, then back to defensive stance. Stance swap to thunderclap to reduce incoming damage. Know when to Last Stand. Know when to Shield Wall. Shield block on cooldown. Interrupt casters. AOE taunt. You probably have a bunch of macros set up to manage all the situational abilities. It's the most complicated thing in the game by far.
---
So yeah, it's not warriors that are rare, it's tanks.
---
I read all these posts on this subreddit about how Classic should move forward to TBC, WOTLK. All versions of the game have issues, but WOTLK is so overrated. Yeah I get it, some players got into WoW during WOTLK. These players are jaded. Let me break it down since I was there launch night.
---
Dungeons - Awful. WOTLk had some of the worst dungeons of any expac. Forgettable. Then Blizzard goes and adds dungeon finder.
---
Capital City - Dalaran was pretty, but way too small. It was laggy and didn't match the scope of other capital cities. A letdown.
---
Zones - Very mediocre. Fjord and Grizzly Hills were standouts, but other than it was pretty bland. Slightly better than Outland though.
---
Battlegrounds - Abysmal. Strands of Ancients and Isle of Conquest were the two worst bgs ever put in the game.
---
Raids - Naxx, ToC, and Ruby Sanctum were embarrassing. Ulduar was great. ICC probably could have been better. Mediocre raid tiers.
---
PvP - well there was little to no world pvp. Most players would idle in dalaran sewera doing arena. Wotlk arena had some balance issues like all arena seasons did. Lake wintergrasp was laughably stupid.
---
Deathknights - one of the worst additions to wow ever. Did not feel like they belonged in WoW at all. They hurt class balance and pvp irrevocably. Outrageous really and proof blizzard was willing to add almost anything to WoW no matter how nonsensical.
---
Gear - the pvp and tier sets were underwhelming. Classic and tbc tier sets looked much better and did not look as recycled.
---
It is time to remove the nostalgia goggles. Wotlk was a mess that put WoW one foot into its grave. All those epic adventures in northrend flying at 310% speed. Yeah right haha.
---
Gotta monetize
---
...announcing it only 2 days prior. No Blizzard involvement.
---
How many views did MDI got on Twitch? I have issues trying to find the numbers.
---
Yeah there are definitely exceptions, it just seems unwise to bank your entire enjoyment of your character on such a slim chance to me unless you are coming in with a largely pre-made guild and already know you'll have a spot with that role.
---
Like somebody else said in another thread, the 1-2 shadowpriests brought along on raids usually tend to be the guildmaster's girlfriend or brother, or something.
---
Retail wow is based around spending some time daily. But you lose a lot if you miss one or two days, because most stuff is daily/time locked.
---
In classic wow your results depend on how much total time you spend ingame.
---
In Retail a person, that spends one hour daily always gets more out of it than a person, that spends five hours on one day every five days.
---
In Classic both get the same.
---
Classic is casual friendly because it doesn't matter when you spend your time ingame and you don't really miss out on much if you miss some days. On retail if you miss days, you miss out on 1/7th of the werkly stuff you can get due to the daily-/timelock
---
For me that every spec for every class gets gear.
---
I'm a tankadin at heart, but I can't play tankadin in Classic because the gear to sustain the spec isn't there.
---
I for one look forward to getting a bear druid in dungeons as they are way better dungeon tanks then warriors. Also they won't take my plate. So I can get fury gear and tanking gear in the same run.
---
There is a reason why the most popular vanilla private servers are blizzlike.
---
We just now finally got a chance to re-play vanilla wow on legitimate servers... and you want to make changes to it? The game isn't even out yet.
---
Maybe classic wow just isn't for you?
---
There is no competetive PvP in Vanilla, rank 14 is a nolife grind, just occasional premade vs premade where everyone being engineer makes a difference. Apart from that you don't NEED to have engineering.
---
There's nothing in this game that doesn't care about combatreach, it's in the games core design, most likely originated from how your ranged attacks vs giant bosses should feel reasonable.  
---
As an example, standing 36 yards away from Ragnaros, point-to-point, not counting his combatreach would feel oddly close, which is why such bosses have a combatreach of 10-20 yards.
---
He just misspoke. People do that sometimes.
---
People know by now that dungeons are super easy and there's no reason to bother minmaxing for them. I don't think this will be too much of an issue, most people are just happy that they finally found a tank or whatever.
---
Also if they nerf the blues for whatever reason you can roll enchanting and DE all the boss drops for gold.
---
Even in raids, the spec only matters for getting epic clear timers, which is not tracked by any mechanic other than E-Peen.
---
If your raid has enough healers, they can take a 2nd shadow priest.  Their may be some nerd rage that a mage or fury warrior is “better” but that takes you on the path of a guild’s culture.  
---
Do I want a guild that strives for a 2 minute Ragnaros kill?  Fuck.  No.  That guild will be toxic as hell.
---
I did. Mechanics are unbelievably unforgiving BUT easy.
---
So, if you fuck up the game fucks you up HARD. But if you can perform simple tasks you won't fuck up.
---
Also the game rarely hits you with multiple mechanics at once like it does now.
---
Classes felt more complete.
---
As much as people hate on them, Blood Elves and Dranai were extremely good for the game.
---
And the raids were much better. Karazahn itself is better than any raid in Classic.
---
The only thing I don't really like is flying.
---
It's no IF, but I do actually like UC.
---
Kid, are you really that retarded? You can summon right into Raids and Instances and there are fucking FlyingMounts and you can use Summon Stones. 
---
If you leave a fucking Group you can be in the same Instance with a new Group within 5 minutes!
---
They said they plan on only using it for the first few weeks, but will be gone by phase 2 at the latest.
---
Wait, so no summon stones outside instances?
---
I have the feeling that both Classic and TBC had two very important pillars that had been removed from the following expansions... meaningful work and meaningful relationships. 
---
Every minute spent online was good for something - if you stood in IF or SW for 1 hour, you were usually maintaining relationships - or you were working towards a goal.
---
The raids in TBC were fantastic and the leveling was just as exciting as the end game. I doubt that blizz has much choice but to re-release TBC sometime down the road.
---
With the E3 being a total shitfest and no change in sight, I am really happy to having a home again this fall with classic.
---
Mainly a bunch of stuff along the lines of "Druids cannot get crush immune so they will get oneshot" blabla.
---
Here is the thread:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bvxlci/if\_you\_want\_to\_tank\_raid\_bosses\_as\_a\_druid\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bvxlci/if_you_want_to_tank_raid_bosses_as_a_druid_in/)
---
The guy must have some deep seated hatred for Druids. He spews the same nonsense in every thread about them and most of it is just either plain factually incorrect or it's unconfirmed and will need further testing once we have access to classic Content and can compare the mechanics and damage values with private servers where the Druid meta evolved.
---
Anything is possible. Look for a key mapper app (there's plenty) and just set up those keys like macros!
---
For a WF race you need everything you can get
---
Dungeons and attunement quest chains.  Farming gold.
---
What you dont wanan see who is the best warrior/druid/monk/rogue/rogue team?
---
It's great that they're allowing people to test all the BGs. It's just a shame that it wasn't more open. I was really hoping for more invites but I guess they aren't letting any more people in.
---
2 more months...!
---
Specifically Mountain Dew horde and alliance edition
---
I can imagine that pitiful scenario.
---
I do really love dwarves, though.
---
The way they numbered it really hurts my brain, I thought that before as well, lol.
---
Undead mage. It's the most popular race/class combo for a reason.
---
Not sure I'd call mage PvP relaxed but it is highly gear independent and very fun.

---
&gt;I don't know, Vanilla Naxxramas was very tough. 
---
It was punishing but easy. Easy not to make mistakes, but way costly when you made even a slight one. The mechanics were roughly the same as lvl80 Naxxramas, only in lvl80 Naxxramas you were allowed a way bigger leeway should you fuck up.
---
Maintaining the raid group is an entirely different matter and doesn't really matter when we're talking about Method or established PServer guilds.
---
I don't even know if thats feasable, atleast to me it feels that nearly everything in outland above 68-70 is really designed for flying. I think it would become a whole different game. Which might not be bad, but wouldn't be TBC.   
---
I feel that if they want to rerelease TBC it should be as much no changes as possible.  
---
If they want to go a route with changes, for example no flying, then just make new content.
---
I don't know if i really see the argument against flying though in TBC. You often see ppl make the arguement that flying killed wpvp, however on the few servers i played (EU) that wasn't the case. Wpvp started to die the moment BG's were out in Vanilla, and the battlemasters being added just added to that and with the exception of small scale skirmishes wpvp was dead and buried before TBC even launched.
---
Oversleeping is harmful lol. A simple google search can strengthen that. I don’t know why you’re being downvoted.
---
I really need clarification on this as I plan on playing lock and have people say they do well with just crafted gear and also that they are gear dependent? Not sure who’s right.
---
Can someone please explain this for me.
---
Classic WoW raids are so bizarrely faceroll easy that you can't even play the game because you can't finish them without full world buffs..????
---
I had no idea about the daily rewards, this makes a lot of sense!
---
Information like BiS lists....which exist in about a dozen formats as evidenced by this subreddit?
---
What is required for the quest? I came into the game during TBC and never got to do it.
---
Pretty true. We already know the strategies for the fights so it's not a race to figure fights out anymore, it's a race to power through them.
---
Hell we're already seeing streamers do dungeons that are technically like ~5-9 levels higher than they should be doing (Sunken Temple), so it wouldn't surprise me if guilds in MC burned through most of the content in greens/blues rather than farming the instance for ~6+ weeks before getting to Rag (Like in Vanilla).
---
Ye that would be a dedicated spot I guess. But there is a nice holy weaver spec that goes for VE/silence, should be good in pvp
---
Incest belongs in the pros column ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

---
There is a confirmation about this from the devs?
---
I think blizzard is gonna miss out on a ton of cash. Lots of vanilla players who have no idea.
---
Added!
---
At least it wasn't just me haha
---
Exactly what im saying.
---
I feel like what census we see here will be different from what we see in actual game. You're only pulling reddit users after all.
---
I'm not sure if this goes without saying, but if new content were to ever be created in vanilla WoW, it would be very beneficial to retain the same low poly count in the new art, items, textures, etc. Reusing a lot of old building structures while possibly mixing in some new, equally low-poly count structures that fit in with the older world. Even though the content is new, I think there should be great care in making the content feel like it's always been in vanilla WoW, if that makes sense?
---
Now we need to avoid the streamer servers, the Method server, and the furry erp server. I hope they launch with a lot of servers.
---
Can stress testers play?
---
I think this is what they are going to get at and I’m honestly confused to why they haven’t done this before. They will create a main hub of different expansions going simultaneously. So you’ll have your classic character, BC character, WOTLK character, etc. and you will log on them at different intervals throughout the week.
---
If you want nothing to do with BC or WOTLK, you stay on Classic....
---
I doubt many alliance do either. =\
---
Arms is not trash, what are you talking about?
---
You know, as I was typing it I was thinking it was too many pirates, it's just so easy for them to turn up and be a nuisance
---
Exactly. Those posts that come out saying that your class can only be one spec in raids are for the big try-hards.
---
I don't think there is an argument for saying Method isn't capable of doing some homework and beating out other teams. They've proven they can no-life to absolute degrees, and let's be real here...Classic information is very easy to find, and digest.
---
The ones in Mulgore weren’t flagged either
---
The ones in mulgore were never flagged
---
I definitely think you could create this zone only using vanilla assets (mostly from arathi, hinterlands and lock modan)
---
I played vanilla and I never saw people kicking specs that did their job.  Kicking morons with bad specs that also do less damage than the tank or tanks that don't actually hold agro sure...  I tanked tons of dungeons as a resto druid in vanilla with no complaints and certainly no kicks.
---
If people are getting kicked they fucking blow.
---
Well, you can’t blame wow for that...
---
Having enough self control to get up from the video game and clean yourself up or clean your home is where the true habit forming discipline starts.
---
The ones in mulgore were never flagged. Everyone move along
---
If they marketed towards those who quit before cata they might get more returning players. Just one commercial of chromie doing her thing.
---
Well, this is a bit hard question to answer really and depends on what you consider to be casual-friendly.
---
I don't play retail and haven't played retail in 10 years, but from what I've gathered: the main difference between them is that retail is more difficult (at least the content that is difficult, but from what I've understood there is a lot of content that is easy too) whereas classic will be more of a timesink. You could already see this in the early expacs, boss mechanics and raids got far more involved than vanilla ones.
---
So it depends a bit on your priorities and what you actually want to experience as a casual player which would be more casual friendly.
---
Yeah, and? None of it was complicated, all of it is easily researched. And it's not like they all can't roll instant 60s *literally right now* on a pserver and practice.
---
What part of this is confusing...?
---
The dwarves in mulgore were never flagged. Everyone move along
---
I would suggest checking out joanas guide. Even if you don't want to follow a leveling guide it will give you a nice idea of where to go during certain level ranges.
---
In classic, many zones will have wide ranges of quest level requirements so you'll do some, then come back later to do more. STV is a good example.
---
Warriors did pay the hybrid tax. Were just sneaky little devils and snuck in the back door. Blizzard simply could not hold back our rage. One does not contain a tempest.
---
&gt; No gold. No gear. Level 1 characters. No one to really help you since the faster you level, the more alone you are. 
---
People will sent them gold and mats
---
I am more pessimistic on this. I fear that the current dungeon rush thinking ever since WotLK is going to bleed over to Classic in a huge way and a very large portion of players will refuse to do any dungeon without perfect setups to mad rush the dungeon as fast as possible. I hope I’m wrong.
---
Pog
---
To elaborate on what other people have said. A rank 13 player, in order to advance to 14 and buy the weapons, must be in the top 0.04% of players for 5 consecutive weeks. If he is in 0.04-0.08% he will stay exactly where he is in terms of progress. If he fails to make the top 0.08% of players one week, he will actually go down in rank, losing progress. 
---
You cannot simply save up to get the weapons.
---
Horizontal progression à la Runescape works
---
Remember when the Troll leader got killed by a murloc then they got chased out of their island in Durotar by a level 10 guy. And before that they got chased out of STV by the Zandalari because they were so weak that Zandalari were literally ashamed of them.
---
Remember when Tauren got chased out of Mulgore by level 15 Centuars until Thrall saved them.
---
Remember that Orcs willingly drank the demon blood. They settled willingly in a freaking desert and then they had to attack the Night Elves - their allies in the previous war - just for basic resources to survive
---
Remember how Undead perform human experiments and are actively developing a new plague in Undercity.
---
Wait, so you're expected to take your R hand off the mouse in order to press some macro keys? Or are you expected to reach cross body for macro keys or? I don't follow this thing. Looks like junk.
---
For me: To be able to stop playing 24/7 and get a RL.
---
This way, world PvP won't be a thing anymore.
---
I won't be exploring the world as much because everyone is flying and the big continents of Azeroth become useless.
---
This way, i can finally get back a life after some years of classic.
---
The dedicated server makes me believe they wont increased lvl cap any further, otherwise it would seem easier to  just increase it to lvl 51
---
Yes, the creator does all the thinking for you. This is prosthetic from the users perspective, if it is used for leveling. U are aware of this concept yes
---
HP5 gear and healing does, but natural regen(troll racial included) does not
---
&gt; Abilities that put "you gain x mana" in the combat log give 0.5 threat per point gained; life is the same. Examples would be drinking potions, but not natural regen, or the Shaman's mana spring totem

World Fist Ragnaros in 2019. I bet people will care. The guild who makes it first into MC will get the Firstkill. Same for BWL and Ony. 
---
I bet they will rush into MC with like 10 Hunters, a few Warriors and a few Healers. 
---
I'm really glad I don't watch Streams. I can't think of anything more boring than watching people play WoW.
---
The raid after Naxx is just more Naxx.
---
Because that's going to be the end of the line.
---
Show's over. The pinnacle. The endgame. The last hoorah.
---
You don't have to go home but you can't stay here.
---
not if becomes redundant after a while.
---
GM/HWL gear specifically is the same item level range as BWL gear. I don't know about for other classes, but for warriors some of the field marshal's battlegear is BiS until AQ.
---
I was playing Rogue Troll in TBC (I joined in TBC). Fun class.
---
I do🤷🏼‍♂️
---
This is great. Thank you.
---
mulgore followed by the barrens ... what do i care for some elwynn forest full of E-rp-ers   
---
though i liked wetlands more than most other zones
---
You'll get xp faster if you turn in the quest instead of running around hoping to get tags on enough mobs to be able to complete the quest.
---
Don't group the whole time, just group long enough to be able to finish contested kill quests.
---
Group up
---
I personally am on the no changes side with this one. Keep flying, I really enjoyed it in TBC.
---
Yeah but they have 2 months to practice the routes...
---
Should also be noted that the biggest issue with Parry isnt the lower threat tanks will produce, but the increased damage due to something called Parry haste. After parrying an attack, the boss swingspeed will be increased for the next hit.
---
The thing is that judging from the Beta, the damage dealt by mobs are across the board lower than private servers. Druids also have the advantage of having a massive healthpool meaning soaking up this damage without getting globaled to death is quite low.
---
All in all it's way too early to conclude anything about Parry. Keep in mind that Druids threat is also way superior to a Warrior. On private servers guilds commonly use warriors dualwield tanking bosses as a means to generate enough threat. The Parry change will affect Dualwield Warriors more than Druids.
---
That’s what memes looked like back then hahaha
---
No, i do :)
---
Fear is good for a warlock but, they are versatile wotf doesn't really hurt you as bad as noobies think. Especially in group pvp Alliance warlocks are actually better then horde ones. As they don't face off against fear ward and paladins. The alliance having 2 classes with a defensive dispel magic is huge.
---
They specifically stated the phases will be long enough for the more casual playerbase to get to raids and stuff.
---
Now this doesn't mean they will wait a year for you to clear AQ but you won't have to clear everything day one to get to the end of raids.
---
Any character I make that can be a NE is a NE.
---
It does all the memorizing for you. You still have to choose the path yourself. It's a tool. Like you.
---
Most rivalries will be kept to servers. But there’s always going to be competition to be the first in the world to do something as well.
---
After paying another $15 starting yet another adventure in Azeroth... Oops I Did it Again is going to be somewhere there.
---
Personally I don't understand all the flying mount hate. People like to point at world PvP as a reason why flying mounts suck. Sure you could avoid some fights by just flying places, but until Isle of Quel'Danas, plenty of world PvP seemed to start from either gatherers or levelers.
---
I had a lot of fun getting ganked on an alt, bringing my main, having the ganker bring friends, bringing my own friends, etc. Without flying mounts, travel time would have taken too long, and the fighting would have fizzled out. It also introduced a lot of funny mechanics for demounting flying people or killing them while flying (slowfall tricks, dot classes, engineering gadgets, etc.).
---
None of this is to say flying is necessarily a good thing, just that I don't think it was as big a problem as everyone makes it out to be.
---
There are a bunch, but I'd start here: https://www.joanasworld.com/azeroth.htm
---
They will less populare on pve than pvp because world pvp. But they will be played a lot nonetheless.
---
People seem to forget (or more likely never played vanilla) that spawn rates compared to live are a joke. You could have the most perfect route but launch will be a fucking clown fiesta and more than likely the front runner groups will try to kill level 5+ mobs from level 1 because there will be no competition and they can get a jump start and head to dungeons. Whoever has the best strategy to avoid the bulk of players will be the ones that at least pull ahead quickly, after that it becomes who can grind the longest
---
Click Stoneform -&gt; win
---
The Horde defecate on the streets in Orgrimmar. Stormwind is clean.
---
Sweet!
---
I would say that today, this is probably the logical answer.
---
But, it might very well change after first 3-4 months of Classic.
---
You never know, one can only hope:D
---
I no lifed AV once I hit 51 and def went Counterattack to smack and root melee and run for my life lol
---
I think mine broke after like 5 days of use, garbage.
---
Actually Azeroth was the name of the Easter Knigdoms at some point.
---
I'm hoping to stay at the top end of the pack where most players will probably be more focused on speeding to 60 instead of pvp.  But I'm surprised at how many people I hear are going to take a full week off or even more to just grind.
---
You could also play on a PvE server to have the alt on the same server as your main.
---
I'm going to play horde mage, do I need to go undead to be viable in both PvE and PvP? I dislike the undead aesthetic and would rather roll a troll.
---
I think retail will suffer numbers and they will have to further remove QOL in expansions to keep people interested, which keeps their designers employed.  
---
Honestly retail needs an expansion that is an outright total loss of power.  The same expansion roller-coaster-to-raids formula is not sustainable when there is a competing MMO on the market that is not dog shit.  
---
Count on game designers to take notes on Classic and compare those notes to all of the failed MMO’s that have come out since 2004.  Too many of them copied all of the wrong concepts from WoW.  I assume we will see a real legit MMO competitor in the next few years that will be as good as classic or better.
---
Horde mage hearth in kargath and providing a portal service while semi afk is godly though.
---
That is awfully close to 60, hope this doesn't burn people out too much.
---
68 hour AV inc
---
&gt;If any of you idiots down voting me played a druid in end game vanilla I’ll eat my fucking hat.
---
This is a terrible argument though. The main reason you did not see Druid tanks were not because they were bad. The main reason is they were bad for MOST of Vanilla. By the time they were actually good, most guilds already had established tanks, and the Druids that would be good enough to understand feral itemization would have be deeply invested into Resto.
---
The likelyhood that someone would give up a years worth of progress on farming healing gear to attempt to tank, while also convincing their guild to bench one of the tanks they had been spending the same amount of time gearing up would be very low.
---
layering is only for EK and Kal servers.  They still have to spin up adequate authentication servers and character retrieval screen servers.  Heaven forbid the hundreds of thousands of players that will be attempting to download the game on launch.  Lots of people will be stuck on these steps or pound them over and over again.  Source: all the stress tests.  Really the best time to take off would be 1am to 1pm local time the day of the 27th because most people will be going to bed.
---
Some people just like to have the gear. It can be for pushing content, farming efficiency, or to just look pretty. Everyone has their own reasons.
---
If the O o g a gang got there’s, RIP Alliance streamers...
---
He asked me to name a class that could beat a SPriest in 1v1 like there wasn't one. I named 3 that will just remove mana first. You made your mistake and here we are. The SPriests that will make the videos will be like the classic SPriests who made theirs. They will have gear that outclasses everyone else and the novelty will be that a SPriest is actually good.
---
Out of sheer curiosity you say you were too young in vanilla but too old to play anyway but casual? Made me reflect on myself as i am 34 now and was 19 then being full on into it lol
---
You won’t be Main Tank as feral Druid in raids.
---
 As for tanking dungeons, you should be fine to learn as you go.
---
yes book launch day off. You dont want to at least miss the peak of the zerg. It doesnt matter what they naysayers say :)
---
Do you want to play alone or with lots of people?
---
Vanilla for me was mostly a social solo experience. I had in game friends and fond memories of it but my friends IRL didn't really play. 
---
TBC was when I played with all my friends and got into the content from a social aspect. 
---
I don't favor one over the other, but both phases of the game have their highs and lows. As I was a Hardcore PvPer, I loved the larger world pvp in vanilla but I enjoy arenas and the changes to pvp in TBC.
---
Should have sold for AT LEAST $0.76
---
People tend to cry about Shammy / Pally tank because it's not the optimal class. That's literally the whole reason.
---
no lisping from an orc ... on an rp server? ... okay, you do that
---
Well...it's beta. Everything will be erased, hence, the value of everything in beta is nil. I am not saying that they won't get gold/items when Classic is live, but not even close to as much as they get in beta.
---
the quest that always sticks out for me, in terms of picking it up way earlier then being able to do was Zanzil's secret in STV.  pick that quest up about 10 levels before it goes to orange in the quest log.
---
There is. This is classic, not classic+. A firm community will give you your chance to create your own reputation in your server. You will not be just another player, you will be The &lt;insert character name&gt;. People will know you are the guy who gangs in STV or the guy who helps lowbies with enchants. Your deeds will be known among your allies and enemies without the need of a chart. And that's why classic is the superior mmorpg.
---
I would say it just means they looked it up internaly how many members they have in classic at the moment, how many they can recruit and how many said are going to play and realised:
---
 hey we have enough people to be "present" in this "other game" and we most surely will do our best to live up to guilds name/history/reputation, aka, we have 40+ people already!
---
Is this confirmed?i mean that they will go love at the same time? Im asking because till this day the US gets patches earlier. Like earlier earlier, not at the same time but on different time zones.
---
That weird Excel Online does not work for me. I get N/A on every slot.
---
I think a lot of it really depends on things like how many friends you've made, the faction balance, how much you play solo. I originally played on a 3 to 1 horde to alliance ratio server. Being alliance on that server was rough, you could go questing but as soon as someone tried to gank you, it pretty much forced you to find a whole new area to quest in. If they managed to kill you they'd usually corpse camp you, if you could get reinforcements to come help, they'd counter with more. If you managed to kill them and survive they'd get a whole bunch of reinforcements to hunt you down, so staying in the same area was risky.
---
I think the pvp servers are great if you find yourself constantly in a decently sized group of people to play with. We had a ton of fun starting huge faction wars outside of random towns. Solo though it can be brutal, especially if you're trying to get something done with limited amount of play time.
---
Wait-what? Mythic+ is one of the best new features in retail, along with transmog.
---
He was referring to the character Donut from [Red vs. Blue](https://www.netflix.com/title/80000063). Technically the conversation takes place between Simmons and Grif, but telling Donut to shut up is a recurring theme throughout the show.
---
A spriest can just remove mana too. Hunters are terrible against dots. A warlock is another top tier dueler so that's fair. And a disc priest would be a good fight. But that leaves mages, rogues, and warriors. The three most played classes will get dominated by a spriest.
---
Yes please do this, let us know your results!
---
Many blues from DM are better than MC gear.
---
The nature of their pvp style necessitates taking **a lot** of face damage. Just watch some drakedog clips and you'll see him do this all the time, except when he's able to open with his seduce combo. Especially in the early levels when a warrior or rogue open up on you your only move is to face tank and cast fear. Back in the day there was the infamous World of Roguecraft series which showed this was virtually impossible. The only real saving grace is Death Coil and you don't get that until 42.
---
Certainly not terrible, completely useable :-)
---
I'm just being picky
---
&gt;There are some bosses that it just isn't possible. Resist gear isn't available for non-warriors.
---
This isnt true though. Druids actually have much better resistance gear available to them than Warriors do. Especially for Fire res.
---
Maybe thats true. But asmon also had his streamer fan boys give him a Chromatic Sword when its value as xmog was 5mil in legion.
---
I dont plan to be a Main Tank. This post isnt about that and if telling me that i wont able to play my class makes you feel better, i advise you to leave
---
Just curious, why?
---
I'd wait. Launch is a fun experience if you can get on. Often launched are laggy, long queues, etc.
---
I'd take time off a week or two later. That's most likely what I'll do.
---
Nah, Desolace is ugly as sin. I mean, ngl, I still think it's an... interesting... zone (as in, def has it's own flavor), but STV is beautiful and, to me, worth the aggro.
---
Click a stone towards the end of BRD (at the portal to MC entrance within BRD). An instance that a guild will no doubt run at least once on the way to 60/preraid farming
---
How about moving one point to ruin, major return if can
---
Some people play awkward hours that aren’t conducive to a raiding schedule (shift work, late nights, children). Some don’t like to pug content often, especially raids. And some just prefer the mindlessness of farming over a more structured environment of a raid.
---
Blizzard made plenty of mistakes long before WotLK, many of which could not be undone. Flying mounts, daily quests, and near free re-specs being the most prominent examples.    
---
The struggle is the game. You make things easy, there's no significance to anything you do.
---
They are gonna need to add a bunch more accounts to get any relevant testing done
---
So I’m pretty set on an orc shaman, just wanted clarification on a couple things from anyone who played one in classic (I leveled one to 30 in WoTLK). Enhancement seems to be go to leveling spec, used for 2h Windfury bursts in pvp, but then I’ve also seen it referred to here many times as a meme spec so I wasn’t sure. Wouldn’t there need to be at least one enh sham per raid for Windfury totems? I wouldn’t mind switching to ele/resto for pvp just wanted some information, thanks
---
Amazing. We'll have some enought for the week-end.
---
Easy... My first character was a Tauren Hunter and I will be Horde this time too Undead Shadow Priest or Tauren/Orc warrior.
---
1-4 are melee abilities. Nice.
---
Sounds fun for those in the beta, I guess. Maybe we will get lucky and they will allow something similar for the next stress test.
---
Larger yes...but larger than life?
---
Dunthinkso.
---
Ill probably be playing alone most of my playtime as it will be hard to co-ordinate with my friends who also play, however I personally enjoy teaming up in groups than solo play.
---
Because 1 server ~ all of classic playerbase
---
Makes sense papa
---
Both classes will fit what you want to do. Hunters are a bit better as a fresh 60 IMO. Hunters are one of the best wPvP classes. They are very good at getting out of bad situations. Also, if played right, you should be able to kill at level Rogues when they try to gank you.
---
TL;DR pservers are harder in every aspect in at least lvl 1-40
---
Do NOT pick Eyes of the Beast. You will regret it for the rest of your Druid days.
---
Eyes of the Beast is replaceable down the line. You have Reed, ZG trinket, Ephemeral Power etc.
---
The tank trinket is never replaceable ever.
---
No, you assumed correctly. There's so many retards here getting triggered over people wanting to play non-meta specs. I see how my first comment can be read both ways though.
---
World bluffs won't be a factor until phase 2 anyway
---
Cross realm was a big thing. People will say flying but herp derp muh wPvP. Cross realm was really the killer since it ruined server communities and encouraged people to be selfish pricks since you wouldn't see people again usually after a dungeon. 
---
Gameplay wise I honestly feel Cataclysm was pretty good (being spec locked until you filled out a tree sucked but the trees themselves were stellar). Just the content, especially the last patch, was lackluster.
---
**Grif**: No, but, why "Warthog"? I mean, it doesn't really look like a pig...
---
**Sarge**: Say that again?
---
**Grif**: I think it looks more like a puma.
---
**Sarge**: What in Sam Hell is a "puma"?
---
**Simmons**: Uhh, you mean like the shoe company?
---
**Grif**: No, like a puma. It's a big cat, like a lion.
---
**Sarge**: You're making that up.
---
**Grif**: I'm telling you, it's a real animal!
---
**Sarge**: Simmons, I want you to poison Grif's next meal.
---
**Simmons**: Yes, sir!
---
**Sarge**: Look, see these two tow hooks? They look like tusks, and what kind of animal has tusks?
---
**Grif**: ...A walrus.
---
**Sarge**: Didn't I just tell you to stop making up animals?!
---
I like it. A third party system for finding people to play with. Hopefully it won't alienate actual in game social interaction though.
---
There was a Horde guild on Kalecgos-US called Meet in Kargath, always made me laugh bc that's what we did before raid.
---
I would doubt it since thats not how patches in WoW work. NA always gets them eralier. Earlier as in they can play before us, not just timezones. There is always a discussion in world first races about this because americans guilds can start the raid like 12h before method. Some say its an advantage and some say its a disadvantage but that doesnt matter right now. They just get it earlier. Same was the case with heroes of the storm patches and i think hearthstone and wow expansions releases too. Yes its 2019 and Blizzard still doesnt do world wide releases at least for the most part.
---
Homie, the “queue and forget” tool also has a “queue what you’re looking for” tool. This includes the hardest ranking dungeons. They implemented this tool either sometime late MoP or WoD. Can’t really remember, but I do remember just looking up the dungeon I needed, spammed clicked on each one until I received an invite. And that “teleport” was a 20 second flight to the entrance or the group was already chilling at the stone.
---
That’s basically teleporting compared to vanilla.
---
Boffum
---
Bis lists, packs, patrols, consumable use.
---
I agree it should not be an end-all be all. But its a hell of a good start, especially if you don't know where to.
---
Looking forward to exactly that!
---
lmao
---
&gt; Then omit all flying-related content 
---
Yeah.. no. That would mean omitting over half the solo endgame content in the game..  
---
Did you even play BC?
---
I envy you man. I've always played a NE but want to play something else this time. Wish me luck, I am not looking forward to being ugly.
---
You mean classic?
---
Thanks! I've been reading a lot about mage being a great fit for casuals, any particular reason for Undead? (seems Horde is better than Alliance for casual pvp too)
---
Yes and 14 year olds don't exist today and everyone above 30 has 20 minutes a day to play.
---
Spriest reporting for mana battery duty.
---
You’ll most likely be an off-tank in raids. But feral tanks are fantastic to have for multiple reasons, one being a reliable dungeon tank. AoE tanking is the feral tanks’ strong suit compared to the other tanks in the Vanilla setting. 
---
As far as leading goes, it’s expected for you to be vocal in raids as a tank. Threat management and tank rotations on bosses that call for it being the reasons. In dungeons, tanks usually get the party leader role to mark targets for CC, but I’m sure you can ask someone else in the group to mark for you til you get the hang of it. You’ll find ways you are comfortable pulling mobs and whatnot and eventually will be confident in leading 5-mans. 
---
Hope this helps!
---
Tell me about Warriors spamming abilities every GCD with a 1.3 speed Alcors Sunrazor.
---
I played both in Vanilla.  Both are A Tier for leveling and exploring the world map.  Hunters probably slightly better for PvP, at least without decent gear. But, Locks bring alot of utility (summon, soulstone, healthstone) so are desirable for dungeons/raids.  There are also less Locks than Hunters so probably easier to find groups with and they don't carry the negative connotations that Hunters do.  In terms of gameplay, both are relatively mobile ranged DPS and both have decent pets (more choice for hunters).
---
They have a toenail on the back of their foot and can't wear boots correctly!
---
I might have been cringy but im tired of listening to this stuff
---
I think what he means, is that when people say that tanks are more often the raid leaders they are talking specifically about the main tank. An off tank isn't any more likely to be expected to lead than any other class in the raid.
---
Blizzard hire this guy!
---
You literally asked if you could raid as a tank...
---
Why cant we level in Argus though?
---
You do realize you can get maxed out in both. All you need is a friend who is ok with starting out at hated with both and have him do all the actual killing (while your in the party) and you just reap the rewards why they hate him.
---
Plus points for it working offline, now I have something to play around with when traveling. :)
---
Yeah can't do this again. The nostalgia will always win out.
---
World pvp dps class?
---
As as private server kid. Literally who? Don't be offended by that but to most of us &lt;Method&gt; is a new name we haven't heard about. 
---
I'm getting tired of these retail mount collectors shitting on private server kids when they get rekt by them every single day in the beta. Retail and Classic are two different games and just because you wtfpwn in retail it doesn't automatically mean you own in Classic. The stuff they have accomplished, aside for world firsts, is literally what people don't care about in classic. It's like saying that just because you're the world champion of the 100 meter running race you're going to shit on the expert marathon runners, while listening to marathon experts on how to run a marathon.
---
Also: You're underestimating the neet austism of theses private server kids by miles. Method would get rekt if they were on the same server. Which they already do in the beta. The only time they have a chance against an APES premade is when Steezy leads the horde premade and guess what? Steezy is a top private server kid too.
---
Furthermore, these private server guys *aren't even tryharding*, they just chill the fuck out and report bugs and run **sub-optimal** premades. Like seriously. 
---
Method in Classic is a meme guild until proven otherwise and a memetastic lvl 30 cap duel tournament is not it.  They will have to copy private server strategies for a long time until they fake it long enough to develop their own shit.
---
Can i ask where you get the assets for this? Are they freely usable and downloadable from somewhere? Cool app bro, i like it.
---
The only thing that was not long enough is the Naxx patch.
---
Even slowpokes had enough time to clear BWL and if you are a casual you won't see C'thun most likely anyway.
---
Remind me what happened in 2.3?
---
&gt;late-game badge gear
---
late game badge gear is just a catch up mechanism. Even in vanilla more powerful gear was constantly added to loot tables to allow people to catch up a bit
---
Thanks man
---
For someone who wants to play casually and mostly focus on battlegrounds,what would be a better option for me? Hunter or shadow priest? If I went hunter I’d go orc, and for priest I’d go undead. 
---
Also how annoying are paladins and priests dispelling your shadow word pains, would it be a better idea to go dwarf priest so it won’t be dispelled as often, even though I’d have to deal with undead will of the forsaken? 
---
I mostly just wanna go into battlegrounds and be able to kick some ass and work on getting PvP gear. I’d also raid when I get the chance but I don’t see that happening too often.
---
Really struggling with deciding between warlock and mage. I tried to break it down into pros and cons and could use some help. Basic info: Casual hardcore player, I played vanilla back in the day, have been playing on and off since BFA, planning on taking 3-4 weeks to hit 60, looking at a balance of PvP/PvE with maybe a slight edge in favor to PvE.
---
**========**
---
**Warlock**
---
Pros:
---
\- Fun/engaging/powerful tool kit for pvp
---
\- High survivability in PvP
---
\- Has a lot of group/raid utility
---
\- Does decent damage throughout the expansion
---
\- Leveling is very easy/fast compared to other classes
---
\- Free mount at 40
---
\- Fun, well definied class lore and feel
---
\- I've never played one before so it will be newer and interesting
---
Cons:
---
\- Extremely boring raiding rotation (shadowbolt spam with possibility of maybe getting to add a corruption). Very limited on what you can use from your dps toolkit due to debuff slot limits
---
\- Have to farm soul shards and take up tons of bag space
---
\- A lot of health stones, summoning, etc.
---
\- While decent DPS, not necessarily competitive with warriors/rogues/mages
---
\- Have to spec bounce for PvP/PvE
---
\- Not many warlocks are taken to raids. Very competitive for those few slots
---
\- No way to reset or manage aggro aside from stopping to cast
---
**Mage**
---
\- On the faster/easier side to level
---
\- A lot of utility (buffs, decursing, CC, food/water)
---
\- Consistently viable/competitive DPS throughout the expansion
---
\- An expansive toolkit for PvP, both wPvP and group/premade
---
\- PvE and PvP spec have a lot of overlap, won't need to respec often if willing to compromise some talents
---
\- Can farm gold quite easily as well as selling portals
---
\- I've played the class extensively and am familiar with it (played during vanilla)
---
\- Extremely competitive for raid slots and gear
---
\- Being a water/food vending machine and buff bot
---
\- Glass canon, easy to get wrecked in group PvP if focused 
---
\- Extrtemely mind numbing dull "rotation" Solely frostbolt spam for the first two raids and it only goes up to scorch and fireball after the transition to fire
---
\- If you go OoM in an encounter you're stuck wanding until you passively regenerate (assuming you use evocate, pots, mana gem already)
---
\- No way to reset or manage aggro unless you're frost and ice block is off CD
---
Raid leading is more a personality thing than a Tank thing. If your tank is the best personality for it, then sure go for it. I can count on one hand the number of guilds I've been in that used a tank as the raid leader.
---
As a tank you'll obviously need to learn the fights prior to tanking them, but the fights are fairly simple. Taunt timing/rotations on the 3 drakes in BWL will be the first big challenge as its a coordination thing. 
---
Raid leader is not a glorious position, personally I would let someone else do it, and I would focus on the tanking, and keeping the trash moving between bosses. 
---
Dungeon leading is a bit different, you'll be mostly responsible for marking kill/assist targets and the pacing all on your own. It may take a while to get a feel for each group, but you'll be fine, the dungeons are not super complex.
---
I'm a fire mage spamming frostbolt because they don't want a fire mage
---
nothing beats hunter t3
---
I always wanted a goblin rogue, back in vanilla. Reminded me a little of Silk from The Belgariad. I made one later when I tried out Legion (instant 100), but by then the game had lost it's magic, for me.
---
That MC speedrun was done when BWL recently came out. 25 min BWL was done before AQ40 was out and 30 min AQ40 was done before naxx was out.
---
Try to understand that a normal hardcore guild clears MC in around 40-60 min and BWL in 60-80 min, casual guilds can spend multiple hours or days to clear those raids.
---
I leveled Hunter, Mage, Priest in Vanilla then started a Warrior.  got all the way to Un'goro before I lost the will to live and gave it up lol.
---
Nobody is going to care about these besides maybe Naxx. These have been done before and will be cleared pretty much instantly.
---
Darkshore gives by far the best xp/hr in that level range if you know what you're doing. It's absolutely fucking bonkers compared to the Barrens. Redridge on the other hand is just okay.
---
They started going wrong in TBC. Flying, Dailies, Linear dungeons. WOTLK brought in LFG, Achievements (which I enjoy but it introduced problems), other things I cant think of that others probably will.
---
They started messing it up early, after Wotlk they just kind of went with the flow and kept fuckin up (cash shop, LFR, personal loot, sharding)
---
I would like for them to bring more content but to stick with the actual RPG aspect of it and not ruin it with QoL changes or anything to make things easier/quicker. Dailies blow because  I felt like I had to do them before doing anything else. Flying cut down on wpvp encounters and changed wpvp completely. Linear dungeons was the start of the gogogo mentality.
---
But damn do I want Kara again(and crypts) so I hope they either do Classic + or re-release TBC (hopefully altered to resemble Vanilla's RPG aspects) Also class balance would be nice (keeping shamans and pallys on their respective sides)as I want to be a magical giant chicken without having to drink 3 mana pots per boss fight.
---
I REALLY hope you are wrong. This would push me to unsubscribe faster than anything else I find in Classic.
---
Even then, they need practice, to use a similar example, Rapha isn't going be able to join a quake speedrunning contest and win just because he's godlike at the later editions of the game, even though he spends a couple months being told what to do.
---
The reason you have probably heard this is because we have terrible offhand options. Once you get your Blessed Qiraji Warhammer, your only real option for offhand is the book from Stratholme with 8 Str, 8 Agi and 8 Stam.
---
Some Druids, myself included prefer to instead use the caster offhand from Zul'Gurub called Jin'do's Bag of Whammies (  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=19891](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19891)  ) which has 8 stamina, same as the Strat offhand, aswell as 1% spellhit.
---
This will overall result in slightly less resisted taunts and is great for f.ex trash or bosses where you require multiple taunts such as Firemaw, Ebonroc or Flamegor.
---
Are you familiar with the Noggit map editor? Would you be interested in actually creating this?
---
There was a google doc posted for that a few days ago:

o o g a
---
You'll definitely still be viable as a troll.
---
Berserking increases casting speed which is actually better for PvE and still useful for PvP.
---
Extra Health Regen also helps.
---
Beast Slaying should actually significantly (but not massively) cut down your time to 60 if you plan to level a lot with AoE.
---
Honestly, if you prefer troll go for it.
---
I think you can still wind fury totem while not being enhance. Enhance is good leveling but like Ret paladins once you get endgame dps is lack luster
---
Imp. Lash of Pain is ehh. Pets don't scale, at all. So the pet's damage isn't significant at 60 when people are geared. She is mostly there for seduce, spell pushback, keeping them in combat, and distraction. Any damage she does is incidental.    
---
I'd put the two points into Fel Stamina. She does need to stay alive for this build to work effectively.    
---
 - LoP w/Imp. Suc: 12 sec cooldown = 10.725 DPS   
---
 - LoP w/Imp Suc, Imp LoP: 6 sec cooldown = 21.45 DPS   
---
It is "double" but still pathetic damage. That's less than 0.5% of someone's HP at 60, or less than 5% per **minute**.

The first guild that gets enough raiders to lvl 60, will clear MC.
---
There will be no need to nolife MC/Ony deaths or wipes, the raid will be cleared as soon as enough people hit 60. I think last pserver launch the first MC clear had 1 wipe on Ragnaros and thats it.
---
I played Troll Mage in vanilla and was top dps in my guild. Zerking + popping all your cds and trinkets is awesome.
---
 /thread
---
That's honestly a bigger problem for me than the racials...
---
:( me too, but I think I'm gonna at least level an ally toon or two through Duskwood, to hit Westfall/Loch Modan/Duskwood... maybe Redridge. They're just too fun to miss altogether and getting through Duskwood isn't a huge pain because I love those zones and lower levels fly by. Or, in Loch Modan's case, never really did it.
---
Started listening to you a few weeks ago and I'm sad that I didn't know about the podcast sooner. Great work Josh!
---
I would like for them to bring more content but to stick with the actual RPG aspect of it and not ruin it with QoL changes or anything to make things easier/quicker. Dailies blow because I felt like I had to do them before doing anything else. Flying cut down on wpvp encounters and changed wpvp completely. Linear dungeons was the start of the gogogo mentality.
---
Those runs were done before the next tier came out, with exception for the MC run, where BWL was out.
---
“You’ll find that test characters on Field of Strife are confined to their capital cities. Don’t worry—even if you could leave the city, there will be no enemies, quest-givers, dungeons, or transports throughout the rest of the world.”
---
Did they do this for the WSG testing or is this in response to some people not testing the content the way they wanted them to?
---
Mainly Balanced classes the raid content for me is probably the best I have ever experienced. Vanilla is also fantastic but having something to work towards long term would be good also. Also Arena was great fun loved playing with friends.
---
Damn, you can just change your race on a whim in retail? Doesn’t seem like the best way to get into your toon, does it? No wonder people quit.
---
A troll^2 rogue
---
I'd be okay with TBC if they omitted blood elves, draenai, flying, and shaman/pally playability in both factions. Other than that, it seemed legit.
---
And homeboy answered your question...
---
2%? Is that real?
---
42
---
Not pvp queues with that logic.
---
Yes and my 14 year and 7 year old play WOW as well.  Building my army of gold farmers lol.
---
Every shaman has windfury totem and the Enh talent for it is pretty rubbish.  So no you don't need an Enh shaman.  They do some of the worst pve dps in the game.
---
In pre-raid BiS, we cleared MC in around 30-40 min.
---
58, if I remember.
---
These friday Night kara runs were so nice...chilling  with your buddies, making fun in voice,all slow paced but still legendary
---
Flying was the beginning of the attitude that the world doesn’t matter and players should be able to bypass it at will. This is a puzzling attitude to have in an MMORPG, a genre where the world is supposed to be the defining feature. And yet, look at the state of BFA. Flying was implemented in some unique and interesting ways in BC, but what we couldn’t see was it began the subtle devaluation of the game world. 
---
Flying allows you to travel without interaction with the world.. It forestalls PvP, it changes questing interactions, it causes you to miss encounters or chance occurrences you could have had in the world. It changes the economics of the game by trivializing gathering. It makes the world feel less real and subtly creates he impression that the world is an annoyance to bypass on your way to a destination, not a place where your character lives.
---
And that is really the core of the problem with retail anyway now, isn’t it? The only thing that matters is the destination. The endgame. The tangible reward. Flying was the first link in that chain.
---
Not as cringy as the automated talking points most people bring in this sub. The second its mentioned (even if it isn't relevant) that there is a tank other than a warrior, or someone in passing suggesting a subtle change its OMG WARRIOR ONLY TANK or #NOCHANGE #wowclassicplus ZZZZOOMG.
---
I would have called him out too lol.
---
This is exactly why I'm leveling alliance in the beta. I get to experience all the great early zones and I'm not worn out for launch
---
- I advise you to leave - lol, I wasn’t tell you anything to make you feel bad. What I got from reading your OP was you wanted to tank and you’re worried you’ll be placed as raid leader. Off-tanks IE feral Druid wouldn’t ever be forced to lead raids.
---
Ah, sorry. That was actually a brain fart on my part. Catch up gear is good and I liked the badge gear as an idea. I meant the later patches Badge gear (though I guess you could call that late-game badge gear too I guess), and even there my memory might be screwing me over but I do have a distinct memory of those being what I'd call heavily overtuned which I'd say is a bit of problem.
---
Guild Banks
---
I do think they should give the more casuals time to get to the raids and the more hardcore players to enjoy owning noobs in raid gear, but it would be silly to wait a year for the most potato slowpokes to clear MC.
---
The hardcore players should always feel like they will have gear advantage by the time the new phase comes out and the slower players should have enough time to clear most raids. 
---
So I would say a slightly slowed down timeline would be perfect.
---
A lot of people hate seeing their character as small.  There is a lot of gnome hate.
---
One for horde and one for alliance.
---
Certainly, retail has social rewards if you play at competitive level (pvp or pve), but I initially got to max level, cleared all the raids, and got full epics without adding anyone to my friends list or joining a guild.
---
LFR and sharding trivialized the casual experience, and it basically felt like a single player game with a super tight gameplay/reward loop.
---
Even if you have the best route, you won't execute it as well as someone who has done it 10 times will do.
---
&gt;I feel that if they want to rerelease TBC it should be as much no changes as possible.
---
exactly.
---
&gt;You often see ppl make the arguement that flying killed wpvp, however on the few servers i played (EU) that wasn't the case. Wpvp started to die the moment BG's were out in Vanilla
---
when they say "flying killed wpvp" what they mean is "flying killed open world ganking"
---
&gt;I've seen people kick bear druids because they wanted a warrior for Deadmines. I've seen shadow priests straight up never getting invited to dungeon crawl.
---
If people don't want to associate with certain players, why force them to? 
---
I played as a Feral tank thirteen years ago and had plenty of people drop group when they saw who was tanking but I never felt entitled to having them play with me. I kind of feel like it's somewhat of a backwards mindset and it led me to take the initiative and form my own groups with players I got to play with regularly.
---
At what point is it too much to make the claim that all specs and playstyles are valid and should be accepted?
---
&gt; Still, heroic 5 mans are the brutalist 5-man content in wows history
---
Really? I didn't play much since TBC, I just remember TBC heroics as a fairly trivial ordeal, even when you used pvp talent specs and entry level regular dungeon items.
---
Kara was so amazing. I hope they introduce that if nothing else. A 25 man Kara with the Crypts would be amazing. Im pretty sure that was what they had planned for it before it wen to TBC.
---
I don't know why people are bashing on this keyboard. I still use the one from Cata
---
Sucks that the regular beta server won't be up at this time. I don't want to play av all weekend.. I bet Noone does. Hopefully they get that and out the normal beta server up earlier.
---
No, we're just playing through the regular campaign. I totally want to try the GM mode at some point, though. This game is already the closest anyone's ever gotten to creating a genuine tabletop experience in a videogame; adding that is just pouring gravy on top.
---
Troll better for pve
---
It says below that these mounts aren’t available in WoW Classic
---
They’ll probably be more pug raids this time meaning more people raiding.
---
For similar class aesthetics, obviously priest. Still get a "bubble", still doing holy stuff.   
---
If you're looking for a healer that's hard to kill, I would actually recommend druid over shaman or priest. They're slippery fucks, but you also can't ignore them in group PvP, because of their healing ability. If you go feral, you'll have the ability to wade into the thick of the fight with your friends, but you'll still have access to the occasional heal. If you go resto, you can HoT up and shift to bear until your group can deal with whomever's attacking you (or slip away in travel form).   
---
Paladin and Druid are the two "hybrid tanks" in vanilla, and what that means is that they're rarely picked in PvE where you want the most effective threat generator/dmg sponge, but they really shine in PvP where people aren't going to attack the tank just because the threat meter told them to.
---
It definitely does not tag. Neither does Hunter’s Mark. If you didn’t damage the mob, you don’t have the tag.
---
Exactly this. All the hybrid specs became actually viable. Sure, it took a while for people to take some specs seriously, but they were definitely way more viable. 
---
Things like Protection Paladins being raid tanks. Actually, it's pretty much just this for me - I'd play a Prot Pally in classic even, if they had a taunt at least. Prot Pally has been my main basically since the beginning of TBC, it's my favourite spec in the game, but I'll not be maining it in classic.  
---
I don't care too much for TBC's content, Karazhan was cool, as were other parts, but I don't really care much for many of the zones or raids. The raids for sure had some great encounters, but they had a lot of boring ones too, with environments that don't really entice me - outside of a few parts of BT.
---
Well, isn't it likely 8 more months until AV, being phase 3?  And then another 2.5-3 months until phase 4 for AB?
---
Sorry man, i probably overreacted. Thanks for your advice, i wrote my point badly probably. Sorry again
---
I remember going afk and following peoplr in MC was completely normal and we still cleared it easily.
---
No doubt, I think the grand majority of people are looking back at classic with this, "Do what ever, you arne't a slave to WQs and rep grinds!" mentality.  We have no idea about the environment of "pserver standard"
---
It wouldn't push me to unsubscribe, it would just push me to be much more selective of who I invite or go to dungeons with.  I anticipate a very long friends list being developed with players that understand how Vanilla works, and not wasting time with those that don't.
---
Doesn't make sense to just unsubscribe without at least putting in a little effort to manage the situation with the tools available.  It's a social game after all.
---
Well, good call, I thought the Attunement quest required 60, but I guess that just changes my point from "since the entire 40 man group has to be 55" instead of 60.
---
It'll be interesting to see if a group of 60s and 55s can progress decently far, but I'd bet the group will still need to be 90% 60s before Rag gets dropped. 
---
But that still doesn't change the original point I was trying to make - in that 'hardcore casuals,' who might take an extra week or so to finally hit 55-60 (vs paid streamers), will still be the barrier to entry for those early raids unless there's a huge group of dedicated streamers that are all planning on joining the same guild, so people with normal 9-5 jobs don't feel quite as "cheated" compared to the streamers that are going to be doing the race to level 60, because the early 60s are just going to have to wait for the 'hardcore casuals' to catch up anyway.
---
You’re fine
---
I think 2% is a little low unless you're account for alts and whatnot as well as taking into account EVERY person who ever installed WoW originally.
---
For Classic I'd guess 30% or so of people (unique log-ins) will actually hit 60 eventually. Out of those I'd expect a high % of them to at least step foot into a raid.
---
The people coming to play classic are here to do content, most are not trying out a new game at this point.
---
There are a large number of people that only look to PVP, so they'll take up a large chunk of 60's, but some of them will raid, when they're able, for certain gear I would imagine.
---
Maybe this will get them to realise how garbage 1.12 AV is compared to what 90% of people remember from Vanilla. 1.12 AV may as well be retail AV. No objectives worth doing, just straight zerging to the boss.
---
/thread.
---
Endgame content in general was just awesome in TBC. Kara/ZA were fuggin dope.
---
It's the bandwagon effect.
---
Hey, thank you for the time you have taken to research this and all the other bugs with the people you do this with.
---
I will have to point out, that I have checked these clips quite a few times now and I see what you pointed out in your other comment about the example 3:45-3:46.
---
However, I would point out that the warrior got auto-attack through, but after that not a single auto while the rogue was moving ever so slightly in the exact same range. This would indicate to me a laggy auto attack since the conditions do not exactly change but no more autos come through either side for the following seconds.
---
In [this](https://clips.twitch.tv/ZanySucculentBobaFUNgineer) clip one can see that infact an *ability* (hamstring) is gaining and losing range depending on the movement, and consistently. [Here](https://clips.twitch.tv/IronicCautiousRuffPupper) is the other PoV.
---
While I do not wish to attack against your research, I want to make a counterargument in that leeway behavior should be constant, like in [this](https://www.twitch.tv/perplexitycya/clip/OptimisticSmilingFungusBudBlast?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time) clip. The clips that you linked do have this kind of behavior on autoattacks, but only momentarily even though there is movement involved.
---
Of course, there is also the whole other can of worms regarding how do slows equate with this, are they influencing the older clips differently etc..
---
This is an interesting topic to me personally and I believe we both await blue confirmation, which is exactly what I hoped to further with my post :)
---
Thank you. :3 I haven't drawn in a while, but I'm just way to hyped for Classic I had to do something.
---
&gt;Oh I thought you said you were done here, ok then.
---
I used that to nicely tell you to stop necroing 2 week old threads, just because you disagree with someone. The discussion is already done here and at this point I'm just mentioning obvious shit.
---
&gt; Even in BGs you're still getting kited by these classes. 
---
Point still stands. Using vs. a mage as the example, when he's clearly talking about organized PvP and BGs which mostly feature multiple people vs each other doesn't really speak your case. That would be the same as talking about deadzone kiting a warrior as a rogue, to get the reset, when multiple people are hitting the rogue. To me and obviously a lot of people in this thread and from what I've seen in streams, Orc is still considered superior.
---
&gt; Because I've done this research I'll go ahead and give you the best piece of info to back up what your position and what actually makes Orcs racial OP: Grenades. Every class can throw them and stun you. Besides Paladin/Rogues who deeply rely on stuns in their kits, no class really depends strongly on Stuns but they all can still use them and then use them again with grenades. 
---
Soda talking about taurens doesn't really change what other people think. Do you seriously want me to find clips of streamers like Monkeynews talking about Orc warriors and why they think they're the best horde warrior. Have you honestly never heard someone say that before?
---
My entire point is that I've heard streamers say that taurens are OP as well, I just don't agree with it, along with some other streamers who still consider Orcs the top. You're trying to argue your point, "because Soda said so" which isn't law, just like Monkeynews' or whoever else doesn't prove anything, other than their preference, just like we can argue ours. We just don't agree on this, it's as simple as that.
---
Yes, on the main screen if you click the top right "..." and then Info I have put links in for the assets and where I got them from.
---
&gt; The horde are bad guys. You wanna be a bad guy?
---
&gt; I’m jk. But kind of serious too
---
This is what Blizzard did so well, imo. Neither is particularly bad, or at least, all the races are on a kind of spectrum of good-bad - the tauren and NE, for instance, always seemed pretty decent overall, imo, and the humans/orcs just ambitious and morally gray, the dwarves and trolls are just bros the UD are the shifty ones who you probably don't quite trust but I'd be shady if I were some animated corpse left over from a kingdom scoured by a lich, and the gnomes, well, fuck the gnomes. Then later Sylanas goes full on evil...
---
Yea, that was my point. But i overreacted either way
---
Well, that's true
---
Omg yes
---
Oh that's way easier than I expected. Last thing I had to get attuned for was Karazahn.

Rhymes with shmorthdale
---
The original statement said they wouldn't have to practice at all to be on par... Of course they can go practice to get an edge.
---
I've always liked the pure hearted hero archetype, so I naturally favour paladins. Protecting those who cannot protect themselves, calling upon holy favour to cure but the deadliest wounds and smiting all evil you come across.
---
Although I also have a soft spot for druids who can be similar in behaviour, although their vision of good Vs evil is tied around balance and nature.
---
So my classic main will probably be a prot warrior (because horde can't be paladins), druid or a paladin (should I choose to go alliance for a change - but their access to the fun lower level dungeons and SM, my favourite, is a lot harder...)
---
Great! Thanks
---
I’ve cucked so many priests and locks on my druid. Moonfire is king. Fire Blast as a mage is pretty good too.
---
Method will clear 8.2 mythic raid the day it hits. Maybe do it again with alts...also in the same day or the day after.
---
After that, they will go back to Classic.
---
Ofc they can't wait for 8.2. But they will also get insta-bored RIGHT after 8.2 mythic raid hits.
---
Removed Rule 7.
---
Not Classic, but Holy Paladin in Legion was really awesome. Healer with a big effing 2hander, and u could do decent dps in between heals.
---
greetings fellow display-industry worker
---
I like this approach. I heard on Countdown to Classic today that a lot of people (mostly Alli) were just not queuing at all, because they wanted to get BiS first and wipe the floor.
---
This should be better, there’s no pride attached, it’s just to get 80 warm bodies in there so they can test it.
---
That’s just the alternate universe future! It’s cool how we can blame everything on that now.
---
This sub has more experienced players and people who are going to min/max then regular population.  I would be super surprised if in fact there are x2 the dwarf priest as there are human, or gnome mage over human, etc.
---
All of the problems started in wotlk, and had the most effect in cata.
---
100% True
---
yeah he stated it live on video.
---
Back in the day, my server (Proudmoore) was heavily imbalanced in that it had 7 Alliance for every 1 Horde.  We had to learn to fight a lot more.  Tarran Mill vs Southshore was hard, but we were still able to defend it successfully.
---
Also, our Queues for AV and PvP in general were almost instant.  We never had to wait.  The group I played with was so infamous among the alliance players, that most of the time, the infamous group of alliance players would often leave the battleground and go get a victory.  They lost 90% of the time, and they were long matches, so it was too costly to their honor grind.  I attribute our ability to fight them so well to what we learned in Tarran Mill.
---
People have been talking about how dead wow is since at the very least 2008.
---
You didnt defend me :(  it's fine I know I will be ruining the game for some alliance members.
---
WOTFS is just great — priests, warriors, warlocks all have fears and charms. Warlocks don't play alliance because of it. Berserking is not bad at all but it's more of a PvE talent, rarely in PvP will you be left to free-cast especially at low health.
---
For Alliance I'd guess you could go gnome for Escape artist but that's depreciated by Blink and being a ranged class. Perception isn't great since you can just stealth check with your AoE. Either way you get the benefit of Horde being less ready to dispel your polymorph since they don't have paladins.
---
A druid solod it at 70. Was prett epic.
---
Great episode. I really enjoyed the interview with Colleen. I remember  when that story broke and the resulting shitstorm was all over the local news.
---
Who cares when i beat humans already?
---
Nice effort into a post shows you have an interest in the game, which is nice to see, but you definitely should post this in the Classicplus sub as it wont be well received here.  We are at least 2 years away from talking about "what next", so how about we enjoy what we have now rather than looking ahead.
---
To play along though.
---
1. Not a fan of multiple spec's for each class, I prefer the "you play your spec of choice, and if you want to change, pay the fee and get the gear", makes it so people become masters of their class rather than average at all 3.   The quests to add abilities to skills or inscription like changes is a good idea, but unfortunately would just fall into the same rut that we are in now, everyone would do the exact same thing.   Cosmetic changes would be cool, like the inscription lesser changes.  Colour of spells, cats instead of wolves, etc.  Sure this could hurt people in PvP as they know what a spell is from its design, but that may help keep things interesting.
---
2. Guilds could be utilized more, with guild events where blizzard sends out a weekly list of events that guilds need to complete with at least 80% guild participation (the other 20 being friends or other guild members to help smaller guilds) that earn guilds points for certain bonuses.   Like say complete Strat, Scholo, 1 world boss, 5 members currently under rank 5 in PvP get over rank 5, collect X profession items.   And so on and so on.   Each would have a point value and when complete the guild gets those points.  These points could be used to buy buffs for raids, heck even bring back the concept of a Garrison, but make it a Guild garrison, and probably even make it attackable by other guilds 1 day each week.   Use those points to build defences and stuff inside your garrison.   These attacks can be instanced and be over a x hour period on a specific day agreed upon by both guilds.  Winner claims spoils of war like a small % of guild gold, and items in the guild bank.   Then over the week players can repair, reinforce, and upgrade their guild garrison.
---
3. See above
---
4. True, we have some zones that were opened on later expansions, and some that could be finished the way it was intended (looking at you Azshara)
---
5. I'd love to see a living world.  Where zones in the continent were changed with wPvP.   I play PvE mostly, but would run back to PvP if they had a reason to wPvP.  For example, points along the world that could be taken by one faction.  The longer it is held, the stronger the defences become, from small wood walls around waist high with lvl appropriate guards, then after 24 hours if held continuously it would upgrade to full sized walls, with elite guards, then after another 24 hours it would upgrade to have personal defences.  All in the art of the faction that took it, so if the horde took it it would be horde design.   then during the weekly maintenance it would reset to neutral, and it begins again.
---
6. GM content would be good, but this increases cost and dev time, something Activision seems to be against.
---
Overall, I like some of the concept and Ideas you bring, who knows what the future holds.
---
martyr complex.
---
 It’s actually garbage and will continue to be garbage unless they increase the value of rogues diaries. You can make more by open world chest farming, skinning, or realistically even beast grinding.
---
Maybe if you overgear them. Especially as tank or heals, it a very stressful time. Minus maybe 1 or 2 specific heroics, you *needed* to have 1-2 CCs. Remember LFM Auchenai Crypts Hc, need 2 CC? Shit would wreck you. Even geared groups could have a bad time if they weren’t careful. There were also the easier ones like Mechanar and Ramparts, and harder ones like Shadow Labs and Arcatraz.
---
No changes. If TBC comes, I want it to be an accurate representation of the game I played 10 years ago. You’re stepping into muddy territory when you talk about removing sections of the game that are important parts of the expansion. What else do we remove? Who gets to decide what gets removed? How do we judge what is “bad” or “good”? I’d prefer it to be a 1-to-1 experience.
---
This guy: [https://youtu.be/ZQT7600TAVo?t=108](https://youtu.be/ZQT7600TAVo?t=108)
---
They weren't
---
is this a copypasta
---
Holy yikes dudes just giving you realistic info.  He didn't say you won't be able to play your class he told you where you won't be able to tank.  Take some deep breaths my man.
---
True, but I expect the overall distribution to hold. I don't remember many troll rogues back in vanilla either. A lot of people just don't like the way they look, especially the edgy types that tend to play rogue.
---
this is the right answer, I would think a much larger population will be participating in the end-game content this go-around.
---
I'm not coming back because of the grind to 60 or to do DMNorth runs with my buddies for fun. I'm coming back because the raids I enjoyed the most were Vanilla (BWL &amp; ZG) content, and I hope to recreate those feelings. I'll just fall into a crippling depression when general chat is spammed with twitch memes and it's not the same 14 years later.
---
My CS team lost to the zboard team at i24 by 1 round. :(
---
you don't need "much more leveling experience". After a while it doesn't matter.
---
I see, ive kinda been doing that while dungeoning in retail, but they are way to easy while leveling so it was just an ego think i guess
---
Anyone have thoughts on re-living old experiences vs trying something new this time around?  
---
I played a pvp enh shaman and pve frost mage during release through TBC (Both Horde) and really loved both.  I'm really torn between rolling a shaman again this time around or rolling something new, like a dwarf priest since i have almost no experience on the alliance side or the priest class.
---
Regardless of class or faction I have decided this time around that i want to try my hand at healing, and I will be playing casually (mostly PVE and dungeons with only  occasional raid or BG).
---
So, start with the class/faction I'm familiar with, or try being a total noob again?
---
All servers should be only RP only. Change my mind.
---
good, let's see them doing on legit servers.
---
It’s important to note that gold in Vanilla was 10x more scarce than it will ever be in Classic. So when you play classic, these numbers won’t line up. That said:
---
- In Vanilla, BiS gear would auction for around 2-300g depending on server. 
---
- In BFA, BiS gear auctions around 1.5 million. 
---
- In Vanilla, consumables would cost 5-10g ish per raid depending on sever 
---
- In BFA, it costs around 5-10k per raid. 
---
Something around a factor of 1000x
---
It will still be challanging to get players to 55+ and kill rag in greens and blues and 55-60 players on the first week.
---
BWL will be cleared day one obviously and AQ depends only on the war effort. 
---
Same thing for Naxx, KT will die day one.
---
I'm betting their first clear is with under 40 people.
---
No vanilla video list is complete without Big Blue Dress
---
https://youtu.be/2z29Rk8814w
---
Exactly how long do you think mana drain's cast time is? It isn't instant/no CD 35 yards like our friend Viper Sting. Hunter is going to play you at max range, so you can stand still and waste your time on a long cast if you like, but he is just going to step out and let his pet work on you as you lose mana from Viper Sting. I have been there, I have done these things. Tooltips/mechanics and experience are on my side here.
---
BTW, anyone here who says they are going Shadow Reach to get that range is giving up Rank 4 talents (probably Mental Agility which just makes your mana issues worse)
---
Played here!!! Whitehalo, Rank 10 Holy Paladin in Forgotten Circle / Acta Non Verba. We cleared to C’thun and 4 bosses in Naxx before TBC. Surprised to not see in the guild list 🤣
---
Not really, no. The improved totems are big wastes of talents and dps does not justify their spot. Resto shamans are better, they heal well and drop the same totems.
---
I agree with most of your points that WotLK was the beginning of the end but it did some things very well. It was the first time certain specs were starting to have an identity...moreso towards the end of the expansion. Assassination became a poison-based burst spec, for example. And all classes had certain abilities given to them in LK (Chaos Bolt, Lava Burst, etc.) that made me wonder how did I play the classes without them before?
---
It wasn't perfect but that expansion was the height of social interaction within the game to me (I started in TBC). That's what kept me logging in.
---
Typically there are resto shamans that spec far enough in enhance to get totem improvement talents, but they are still healers first. More of a utility spec than a dps spec. Those shaman can offer what enhance offers, without being a burden in other aspects.
---
I'm going to love my life going 1-60 on a warrior because I will make a pet class first and get some elemental bindings and arcanite transmutes rolling to pimp out the warrior.  Nothing really good at 60 anyways until phase 3 when WSG and AV come out to me.
---
It's obviously a popular opinion to call it "dead", but yet, there they are, still logging in. Too many addicted players with sunk cost fallacy issues that won't unsub. They're bleeding subs for now, but they still have millions of people playing BFA, despite being a crap expansion. And no other MMO will kill WoW is an opinion shared by pretty much everybody. Not many studios even attempt MMO's anymore.
---
my local Goodwill was selling just the base of these for $50 last week...
---
...what?  How would playtesting AV at level 58 for a weekend cause burnout?
---
I thought you were a hunter player. That explains why you think you can beat everyone. Well have fun in azeroth
---
Where'd you get 2% from? I find that highly doubtful. Maybe 2% of any of the players who ever signed in as the majority of them probably won't get passed level 20
---
Do streamers RP? From what I saw, they care more about all attention they are gathering from their own followers than doing RP.
---
Thanks for the shoutout man! Good luck with your search!
---
&gt;although I will say they are designed worse than Vanilla dungeons.
---
yep they all were one way corridors. But I liked the gameplay.
---
&gt;Still, heroic 5 mans are the brutalist 5-man content in wows history
---
Nope, challenge modes (both Pandaria and Warlords) were much much harder
---
Agree 100%.  This started the whole "collecting" form of the game where people do pointless, inane things to get achievement X or pets or mounts.   Before I left retail there was a guy in the guild who was obsessed with getting achievements, like, maybe we should call the police level investment in the game.   I tried to talk some sense into him but he was clearly beyond help.
---
I suppose the one good thing it did was force these people to pvp to get those achievements.  I killed so many people in BG's with their orphan in tow.
---
Flying mounts ruined the game period.  Other stuff ruined the game too but if flying is in the game then the world doesn't feel like an mmo I can go wherever I want with 0 danger.  I still like tbc and wotlk because arena was fun and the dungeons had character but as far as being a true and proper mmo it was done the second we had flying.
---
Reminds me this from Legion.
---
https://youtu.be/6hMqvb8QiUk
---
I regret not playing Fury in Legion a ton.
---
should put /s guild banks are the best.
---
2.3 added za, more badge gear, and banks for the most part. i think they reworked priest racials to give everyone a fear ward.
---
How did you follow them "tightly"? Update a forum post to check if there was a new screenshot of a boss kill?
---
They wouldn’t get AV pops very often that way. They are barely getting AB pops as it is. Forcing players into the test is the best way to guarantee testing
---
Did you read it? It's a different server with chars locked to capital cities and no enemies/quest even if players manage to leave the cities. The only thing they can do is AV, so I fail to see how this could cause burn-out beside only to AV itself.
---
&gt;That 15k Server had something called dynamic respawns
---
And this is why leveling on private servers is MUCH FASTER than Classic.
---
MC won't be cleared in the first week. Maybe on the second week, but I highly doubt that Warriors and Rogues will be 60 AND geared at bare minimum in 14 days to attempt MC WORLD FIRST and actually have the chance to win the race.
---
I don’t think you know how rating things works
---
I have no doubt they will. Deadzone is pivotal in defining the hunter with its only real weakness.
---
Well people have been saying that for years. Usually met with the downvote brigade which I find rather funny in retrospect :P
---
So I finally settled on Orc Shaman.
---
My endgame goal is to Elemental PvP, but I would like to casual raid with Resto as well.
---
My question: How viable is leveling as Ele?
---
I have never enjoyed enh gameplay. In terms of speed, is it only slightly less optimal than enh? I know there might be some mana management issues, but my alternative choice was Mage, so I am fairly prepared for that. Thanks!
---
Hell yeah, brother, cheers from Tanaris. I may not even bother with an alliance alt now, either. I'm *H Y P E D* for H O R D E.
---
No ruin or instant corruption?
---
You may be right that they don't increase the beta level cap again, but this has nothing to do with it IMO.  If they just raised the cap for the purposes of testing AV, then your pool of potential testers is significantly reduced.  This move is all about increasing the amount of potential testers.  It's no commentary on any future beta level cap.
---
You can definitely do these 5 mans with sub-60 levels.
---
But it does. Have you been watching the Method streamers play Classic WoW? They are constantly dying while leveling and they are super slow compared to experienced players.
---
dam your right! Added!
---
Some guy who thinks his retail titles matter in classic.
---
The biggest thing I can't stand about Alliance characters is that with MH specials they're all 360 degrees twirling. It makes me dizzy af. Especially male NEs are horrible.
---
Even if they did, they wouldn't want to wait for people to hit level 51 and get testing. If they want to hit a concentrated test window, this is how they always do it.
---
druids are usually least popular class.  They can only be one race so it kind of limits people that want to be a different race from choosing them.  Long time players know they kind of are mana batteries and little else in raids because of similar HoTs not stacking.  This also means if you are the third druid to log in for raid night you will be benched unless they need a 40th.  They are good farmers, but the similar routes can be done on other classes with better CC and damage.  They are good in PvP, but have big mana problems if you are not paying close attention to what you need to prioritize and when.
---
Very few classes just use the same set of "best" gear for all situations. The same goes for prot warriors. It's obvious what this BIS list is trying to do - it's suggesting the best +Defense pieces for each slot. But you won't need to maximize Defense for every encounter, and any time you're prioritizing defense you're sacrificing threat. It's a balancing act.
---
That's a problem that these BIS lists create, it doesn't really explain to new characters how important it is to swap gear and experiment for each encounter. Healers are in a similar situation with mana regen vs. throughput gear.
---
Method is a meme guild in classic until proven otherwise.
---
It's not looking down on retail players. It's looking down on retail top guilds who shit on pserver top guilds like what they did doesn't account for anything. 
---
You know what doesn't matter in Classic? Fancy mounts, archievements, world firsts barely matter.
---
TBC killed so many guilds with the loss of 40 man raiding. I hope they give us new content from vanilla like a new time line alternate universe kinda deal,  no flying, no lfg etc
---
They absolutely don't. You must be completely stupid to think Blizzard will release phases based on what streamers say.
---
They will have data on what % of the playerbase have killed Rag so they can simply release phase 2 when say 50% of the playerbase killed Rag.
---
It's 2.5 days of nothing but AV testing. Beta testers can't play those characters after that, can't do anything other than AV with them, and can't even play in the regular beta realms for the duration of the test.
---
I think they'll be fine.
---
Nope
---
I despise green tree forest zones and love open deserts as you can see the enemy ally scum from farther away. LOK'TAR OGAR!
---
I'd guess that this is a number that considers every person that ever created an account in WoW history.
---
Personally, I played the most in TBC and WOTLK and loved it all. Although since then, with years of P-servers playing only vanilla content, I enjoy classic as much or more than TBC and WOTLK. I’d enjoy if in a couple years we get TBC and possibly WOTLK a couple years after that.
---
I just resubed to use my gold for tokens to play classic. I tried all the classes I have. Spoiler, all of them and they all sucked to play. The class changes feel empty it doesn't have the same feel older wow had and you are pigeon holed into specs and lose out on class abilities that were previously available. I could only use penance on my disc? No renew no flash heal? Wtf is this. Couldn't pop out of shadow and heal? The game is so dumbed down now and just plain feels bad. Sure it looks nice I guess... That's about it!

We can feel the spirit of retail beginning here. Before this it was totally fine, like a perfected Vanilla.
---
I really love being horde because the alliance races consist of mainly humans, small fat humans and even smaller big headed humans. It's just boring. The horde has much more diversity. 
---
on the other hand the cities are so much more inviting. Stormwind and Goldshire are so nice to hang out with their taverns, bars and parks. :(
---
Org music fucking slaps.
---
Not even. Most of the plot for Westfall/Redridge/Duskwood is how stretched thin they are because Stormwind won't send help.
---
It's still a bit of a stretch imo. But if they do it, cool.

Vanilla was a bit weird the game blew up and was full of casuals like people would find out you play wow and be like WUT LVL ARE U?  Dude I'm 60 what are you talking about and they'd be like o I'm 32.  That was my experience with like every person I met irl who played wow.  Lots of casuals never even hit the cap before quitting.  I expect classic will have far fewer people like that as most players will already have an interest in wow and knowledge of wow

What Mark Kern mentioned is different from what 'Dynamic Respawns' are.  
---
Dynamic respawns is when the rate of respawns is balanced against the amount of people in a zone.  
---
Mark Kern talked about something he called 'overspawn code', which as he explained it, is a script that launches once the mob population is below a certain threshold, that forces spawns out quicker.  
---
The way players experence these two things are different. With dynamic respawns, the amount of mobs will still seem relatively abundant, while with overspawn code, spawn rate is only affected until a certain population is fulfilled, which will make mob density still feel scarce.
---
Totally agree with Daranielbass. There was just so much to do. Massive downsides were flying mounts and personally I didn’t like having a new shared city, or even having a new world
---
Fraps was a thing man! [Warcraftmovies.com](https://Warcraftmovies.com) I still have dozens of those videos on an external hard drive!
---
Oh yeah that one whole weekend of AV is going to totally burn people out and remove all hype. 
---
Classic is DOA because of this.
---
Imagine if they roll on a PVE server though. Would people discredit their world first (first need to reach lvl 60) if they didn't have to deal with World PvP/Griefers?
---
Anyone who thinks Rag won't die week 1 and everything else day 1 when they are available is completely delusional.
---
They are the best fucking players in the world don't you think they can follow a guide? Vanilla is piss easy.
---
&gt;Flying was the beginning of the attitude that the world doesn’t matter and players should be able to bypass it at will.
---
And mounts weren't?
---
"AFTER A WHILE" can you even read?  
---
Of course it matters, but once you have some adding more isn't that relevant.
---
Threads like this are ruining the game for me without it even being out yet.
---
Lets see how many super specific, rare occurrence type situation threads we can cram into the classic wow sub reddit before the game launches.
---
WOTFS?
---
Or just have an alt of the opposite faction for when you wanna play WoW, but need a break from your main. I probably won't even max my alliance alt, and if I do, it'll be a long ways out.
---
Cow tiddies
---
interstyainapint?
---
Idk man. 
---
I sure wouldn't want to pug a 40 man, sounds like hell on earth.
---
Can u explain like im 5?
---
I remember the new instance gear wasn't meant as a catch up mechanic but more to give solo/small group players some progression.  At least I'm remembering the dungeon set buff patch with the timed dungeon runs.
---
It wasn't til TBC when they first started to introduce catch-up mechanics to try to solve the issue of "feeder guilds" that Begemont described.  The top guilds would get their replacements from the guilds behind them making it very difficult for guilds behind in progression to make progress.  It was a big problem(unless you were in the top guild) and the major reason why catch up mechanics were implemented and attunements were removed  :/
---
This would make a great post on r/whoosh.
---
It's absolutely nuts to me that people actually preferred this but they did a massive raiding overhaul, specifically for 25 man content.
---
The 2 huge things that 2.3 removed were infinite consumable stacking and raid boss 360 degree cleave.  
---
Prior to 2.3 raids were literally balanced around having every single elixir from both Vanilla and BC. We're talking 20+ elixirs and a flask - thousands of gold worth of consumables for just a single attempt. On top of that all the T5 raid bosses had a 360 degree melee cleave  that they spammed every few seconds would hit Rogues for like 50%+ of their HP. The result was that melee DPS classes were just benched so raids didn't have to deal with all that extra healing. 
---
That only lasted for a few weeks before Blizzard removed it along with making the change to only allowing 1 flask or 2 elixirs and re-balanced all the bosses to compensate.
---
What an absolute indictment on retail wow when the target audience and what 90% of blizzards time gets spent on (raids for raiders) are bored and want to go play a 20 year old game.
---
&gt; Only ~~kool~~ kewl kids go horde.
---
ftfy. Alternatively, "kool(-aid)"
---
TBC  had problems of its own - Daily Quests, Flying, and wellfare epics were a huge part of the problems later on down the line.
---
Heroic dungeons were awesome, the raid attunements and lore were awesome, but TBC started to show some cracks in the armor.
---
I'm gonna charge my mates 25s a summon #ezmoney xF ( I won't really)
---
I wonder how long they'll last. I don't think a lot of them are super interested in Classic. I saw a few of them even got beta and pretty quickly abandoned it for Retail.
---
I hope they enjoy being miserable for views. I certainly won't give them views. I'll be watching the people who are genuinely excited for Classic (and aren't dicks).
---
Shit my bad
---
small human
---
fat human
---

---
it still served as a good catch up mechanism. Suddenly the "out of raid BiS" was way more powerful and allowed you to do harder raids without stepping into the previous ones.
---
No clue, imo MDI sounded like a really good idea but the poor execution killed it
---
I hope you are right. It’s not that I don’t have faith in the game systems, losing faith in my fellow gamers.
---
Ooooh... Now I get it. He was that doode that died at those gates in WotLK during that epic quest.
---
Vast majority of level 60s who stick around will at least pug a ZG or something. Some good loot and no attune required.
---
If you count BRS, practically all.
---
ally players are pve
---
horde players are pvp
---
it is known
---
Gelkis is superior
---
As it's already been mentioned, this topic is quite old. 
---
If you're a smart group leader and you are assembling a 5man group then you will be looking for class/spec combinations with the least desired loot competetion. I mean a group where 3 DPS slots are represented with two rogues and a hunter may have a good time clearing the dungeon, but the loot situation is quite sad as all three people are very likely to fight over exactly the same items. 
---
And that's where the meme specs can jump in, since they would probably want some oddball items nobody else would need and their spec inferiority is way less noticeable. Nevertheless, it's never a bad idea to ask which item the players want before inviting them.
---
POG
---
Having a beta character created at level 60 wouldn't automatically burn people out.
---
just go SM ruin until we get to later phases and a shit ton of health and then go SL spec
---
How many of these issues are the result of Classic being undertuned or changed in order to fit what modern players are complaining about, vs. being true to Classic and more accurate than private servers?
---
how about hunter vs world?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XgF_P9Ddjk&amp;list=PLaWLJ5UhLSSLv-Z7pK7XO8QbZ6L6sLdnk
---
Very true, agree 100%
---
that's how I would do it, when you hit 50 get the fuck inside BrD and start farming it. You got everything from there? Move on to LBRS/UBRS/Scholo/Strath.
---
You level up AND gear up at the same time.
---
I'm not sure if it's optimal thought
---
I don't think AV would be possible to win with all 51s. It would be next to impossible to kill the generals with an 11 or 12 level difference making almost every attack miss.
---
This is just tickling me the right places. Hope is a dangerous thing brother.
---
An average player should get to 60 in 10 days /played so with a very casual 2 hours a day thats 120 days.
---
I don't think even BWL would be out in that time.
---
I think expertise was later but there's weapon skill which affected glancing blows. Druid would only care about unarmed skill which I'm pretty sure no items augmented.  I rarely play melee so I'm not sure how expertise worked later.
---
Who gets to decide? The players. Like I said, every update gets polled and needs a 75%+ yes to pass.
---
If Classic WoW is going to survive long-term, it needs to be more than just a time capsule. It needs to be what made Vanilla-WotLK great without the things that took away from and eventually ruined the game.
---
&gt; We expect to close the realm and this AV test on Monday, June 17 at about 19:00 CEST. 
---
So they're not even going to let people finish one game?
---
no but make it one
---
&gt;map design advantage
---
AV backdoor: *Exists*
---
How would anyone burn out when the test is limiting them to like 1% of content.
---
but you have to play as the goodies because orks are bad!! 😩
---
Obviously. Still a good sales pitch!
---
I'd rather put 5 points in imp corruption. The whole idea of seducing and three-shotting people is pretty far away gearwise. And felhunter brings so much more utility to the table than a suc.
---
6pm Monday * not Tuesday. 
---
https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/world-of-warcraft/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule
---
Out of curiosity, what are the benefits of testing at level 58 compared to level 40 or level 60?
---
I'm not suggesting they add "TBC" per se. I said I wanted **parts** of TBC. The game will need updates and new content, but not the exact same content that was added before, or else the game will end up right back where it is now.
---
10 hour AVs Pog
---
thats how life is, people wanna get in good with the popular ones by giving them gifts
---
Use the backdoor strat, with 20+ people using it, it’s a decent strat
---
The latest, 108 I believe. Just started it now on my lunch break
---
Great video. Thats real testing
---
And the private server players did it 4-5 times every year...for the last 5-6 years.
---
There is NO WAY Method will get MC first.
---
BWL and after?
---
I am almost 100% sure that Method will take BWL, AQ40 and Naxx world first. Or at least being second or third by minutes.
---
Still, they will be top notch after MC, simply because leveling is out of the way.
---
57 days played or did you go 1-60 in under 2 months because that would not be slow
---
Can someone copy/paste the post?
---
They said phase 1 and 2 will be faster and they won't tell you in advance how long each phase is because they will adapt it to the playerbase.
---
isnt there supposed to be a troll city above dragonmaw port?
---
Vanilla dungeons aren't super hard, but require more precision.  Even starting in WOTLK it was already "AOE pull each pack and mash your abilities" and I'm sure retail is more of the same.  
---
Vanilla is just like.. Do the pull, but Sheep one of the stronger elites.  If the tank loses one mob go easy on your DPS, because otherwise the healer will either OOM or pull aggro if they have to spam big heals.  Drink between pulls is often necessary. 
---
It's not rocket appliances =)
---
&gt; Top guilds in wow history came from pvp servers.
---
"Top" guilds don't represent the vast majority of players.
---
It was never going to be popular forever. Human brains dont work that way.
---
Added! Hunter were able to do so much solo bossing!
---
Rob Liefeld, is that you?
---
No - because ground mounts don’t decisively prevent interaction. I can still attack someone on a mount. I can buff someone on a mount. Farming resources on a ground mount is slower which keeps prices for materials higher and makes those professions more appealing. I cannot mount my ground mount, point it in the direction of the instance portal, and alt tab. 
---
Flying mounts as they were implemented in WoW eliminate an entire class of interactions, many of them involuntary interactions, that make the world immersive and change the character of the game. Flying was the beginning of the current retail game’s contempt for the game world and for travel as a concept. The retail devs even realized this, and tried to remove flying from the game.
---
Can't do that without losing Soul Link :(
---
there's a goblin town bove dragonmaw port, but they built that in cata
---
I wish.  Won't be a thing for AV 1.12
---
Yeah I was thinking the opposite, too.
---
* I remember MORE pulls of packs of mobs, there are a lot of packs on the Pserver I'm on that only come one at a time
---
* I remember MORE aggro from running away in fear
---
I wonder if Hunter will be easier 1-10 than the Pserver I'm on right now.  That was absolutely brutal.
---
&gt; Finally we can see what AV is gonna be like on Classic. Can’t wait to watch streamers play it
---
or you know, play the damn game yourself like it was meant to be. I dont understand the fascination with watching other people have fun / doing things.
---
But isn't he specifically flagged neutral so you can pick pocket him for the rogue quest?
---
Durotar/Tirisfal usually only takes you to about 10, then you go to Barrens/Silverpine.
---
You can probably level to 20 in Barrens, especially if you throw in a couple of WC runs. It'll be a challenge, though, and you'll probably run out of yellow quests.
---
Silverpine is worse. You'll probably run out of yellow quests by the time you're 15/16.
---
What works really good, though, is to go through as many quests as you can in one zone, then go to the next. Do a many quests as you can in the second zone, then return and finish up the first zone.
---
For Horde, it's easy. Just take the zeppelin. It's nothing like the Wetlands run to get from Darnassus to Ironforge.
---
If you really want to stay in EK, then you're probably have to grind mobs in Silverpine for a few levels until you're strong enough to go to Hillsbrad. If you have skinning, you can get cloth and leather from the Werewolves in Silverpine (you could still skin werewolves in 1.12, right?) so it should at least make you a bit of silver/gold.
---
&gt; The player base could self regulate better that way. The worry is what happens if people roll one faction BECAUSE it’s dominant?
---
There will be players that want it balanced, there will also be players that want to play as the underdog or as the dominating faction. No issue with either imho.   
---
&gt; Do you think Blizzard will give us server balance info during the pre launch weeks?  
---
Don't think blizzard ever did this, census addons will though, but nmot straight away i reckon.
---
Welp this settles it, I'm rolling an Orc Shaman. Lok'tar Ogar.
---
Launch Day is actually Monday, 6pm EST. Even if you're PST, I wouldn't waste a vacation day or even get my hopes up of making any progress on Monday night. The rest of the week should be less of a shit show.
---
Right so because its easy to get around the map you wanna equate that to teleporting got it. 
---
Nevermind in retail you still can't fly currently and using a meeting stone is no different than it was 10 years ago and warlocks still exist.
---
Had two of these, and a few keyboards that changed out for them. No support after so long, eventually they broke. Was some expensive ass crap.
---
I only play NE if I roll a Druid, only because I have no other choice. Dwarves and gnomes are the best.
---
If I remember correctly, AV was only available to 50+ initially. Level 58 allows you to actually do appreciable damage on the NPC's that are the ultimate object of the BG. Scaling wasn't a thing back then, so the NPC's were balanced around the higher end of the bracket, otherwise the NPC's would just melt.
---
Exactly 33.33%
---
Repeating, of course.
---
I can't take Ruin without losing Soul Link.
---
There probably are a lot of speed levelers. But the question is how many speed leveling GUILDS are there?
---
If I were blizzard, I'd just do what the writers did to GoT. Give retail a rushed and shitty ending so they can move on to better content. The players will bitch but they'll run out of tears eventually.
---
thx boo
---
cdew DODGE AGAIN!
---
What my original comment is asking for is new content. I only said I wanted "parts" of TBC, not TBC 1:1. Parts of TBC would belong in said new content.
---
25 man raiding is more manageable. Karazhan. Arenas offer a greater degree of PvP competition. Heroic dungeons are not pointless, but a catalyst for more casual players to gear up via low grade farming. Karazhan. Casual players are able to farm battlegrounds and achieve a certain degree of PvP gear via honour. A more varied and wider array of viable specs, boomkins, shadow priests, elemental shamans, all become viable in BC in a way they aren't in Vanilla. Karazhan. Eye of the Storm with mind control. Karazhan.
---
Vanilla is great, and I'll play it, but Burning Crusade had a greater degree of balance between the hardcore players and the more relaxed casual player.
---
It all depends on what you envision your end game to be.  If you want to be in a competitive raiding guild, going balance or ret is probably not just dumb, but selfish.
---
If you just want a relaxed, chill raid group you should probably be fine with "non viable" specs. 
---
Play what you want, just know the consequences of your choices.
---
It more split guilds then lost. So really, we gained guilds.
---
obligatory /s
---
gtfo
---
I can bet solid money that MC won't be cleared in first week. Dynamic respwans provide a much faster leveling, and Classic won't have it.
---
Most I can see is a second week MC world first...but with 14% raid boss parry in Classic (almost three times more than private servers), I wonder how much UNDERTUNNED private servers are for raid boss resistances, glancing blow chances and everything else.
---
I might go as far to say that MC won't get cleared even in second week..just not bet money on it, because it might happen.
---
But first week MC clear? No way in hell.
---
LMao, you can't fly in the current xpac and warlocks existed in Classic. Keep moving those goal posts. It just keeps proving you have no idea what you're talking about when it comes to retail. 
---
Go back to your private server and continue to jerk off to things in your own head and act like running to an instance suddenly makes you a hardcore MMO player.
---
Yes, but only if you are a streamer.
---
Raids and dungeons, karazhan &amp; SWP on top; stellar class mechanics, very fun to play for the most cases; class viability/dynamics, like the tanking and healing roles just perfectly designed; ability progress character outside raiding; removed "forced" inconveniences that were in the game just to force people play more, eg. graveyard runs &amp; flypaths; fixed "silly" pvp mechanics/balance; fishsticks  
---
basically it would better to list things that got worse like lore, questing and reputation requirements on content that became redundant after progress
---
This.
---
You should try it, it's not hard.
---
Guess I'm not killing KT then.
---
It's true, they capped AoE damage.  I personally don't remember exactly when(I thought they did it at the end of classic)
---
I still have to wonder how much of this is accurate, and how much is because we have data from 7.3.5 which is being modified to fit 1.12.
---
Thank you for the review, I have decided not to purchase the brother expansion.
---
I didn’t stop ever?
---
I have no experience with brothers myself only sisters. The one I have had a bit of interest for wow back in the day and is overall pretty cool. So far she hasnt broken any keyboards and Id rate sisters atleast 5/7. From what I hear sisters are a better investment.
---
The forsaken broke free from the scourge and the original naxx launch came with a scourge invasion event showing the horde and alliance the true power of the scourge. Thus forcing thrall and bolvars hands into besieges naxx
---
It would change alot, and probably not even be accurate. ppl can make 3 chars, so they might reserve the same name on multiple servers but not even play two of those chars for a long time.
---
Best of luck! Hope we don't see you on the news!
---
Arenas and raids, I don't like what the continent of Outland does to the game and how it makes azeroth less relevant, but idk how they'd fix it.
---
Idk the right answer, all I know is I don't want classic to be done after naxx :(
---
This is something we didn't had in Vanilla.
---
And this time it will be LIVE !
---
Holly shit, how much times changed.
---
Read that as hinterlands for some reason...
---
And completely passed on the twilight part
---
Dad, is that you?
---
wsg testing is on the regular beta or stress test servers, this will be an entirely different server, so i would guess a response (they dont want to increase the cap to 51 to test av and then sit thru another 2 weeks of people leveling instead of testing av)
---
Gotcha. And the reason against level 60, we're thinking, is that they don't want anyone to play at 60 on the beta and want level 60 to be accessible on live only?
---
Nah flying mounts sucked for the game dude all that beautiful landscaping, the design of the map, mountain placement, all that shit that frustrates you without a flying mounts is why flying mounts shouldn't be put in
---
Kinda like in retail where there is a storyline in each zone? 
---
I’m not a fan personally. I recently played the human starter zones on a private server and got the same vibes as I do in retail, where half of the quests are tongue in cheek cutesy jokes involving farmers and such. 
---
It’s obviously not as silly as driving a tank through redridge or punching deathwing in badlands, but it is along those lines. 
---
That’s why I’ll be playing Horde. The forsaken starting zones are a perfect transition from Warcraft 3 to wow. Questing is very important to me.
---
They were not complete garbage, they just weren't fresh for you anymore after hardcore raiding.  Everyone thinks that the first expansion they raided at a high level in was the best one for raiding, everyone thinks the expansion they first played high level PvP in was the best one.  Far more players think Wrath is the best, because far more players first played in Wrath.  Nostalgia at work.
---
&gt;It basically buffed all of the hybrids to the level that Feral druids were in 1.12: Viable, but suboptimal.
---
and even optimal in certain situations.
---
I was tankadin, and while I was usually relegated to offtanking roles, they didn't even start a Mount Hyjal raid without me
---
It depends.  If the person is humble, yes.
---
But if the person comes into a Classic dungeon run, demands to be summoned (with no lock in the group), brags about how amazing they are at everything, and then they can't out-DPS the healer and they stand in more fire than not...that's when you call them out on everything that's trash.

Can you elaborate on which problems were caused by achievements? Not disputing, just curious.
---
Lol agree about Undead, disagree about my Gnomes tho. Female Gnome Mage is my jam
---
I rolled an Undead rogue on BFA recently (just resubbed since quiting during Vanilla many many years ago), and I’ve enjoyed being an edgy boi but I certainly feel like a baddie when I’m helping reanimate the dead to fight for the horde or killing those Warden NEs (loved Warden in wc3)
---
That's possible, I'm not sure to be honest. Maybe if the BG is tuned to level 58, that's where they'd prefer to test it?
---
Undead have always been pretty evil,  I don't think any other race even comes close to them. Putress's plague was being developed all through Vanilla, and it wasn't exactly being done in an ethical or polite manner. For the forsaken, the wrathgate wasn't wrong, it was just early.
---
I’ll have a look when I get home and yeah I already know that jimmy one without even watching haha
---
&gt;I’m not one to try to predict “omg what will blizzard do next!?!?!?” But this could be it
---
..
---
Yeah, I wonder if any guild will do it in Classic.
---
That would be a race to watch.
---
The main driver here will be... something to do. People like new stuff. They NEED new stuff.
---
&gt;dessert
---
What kind?
---
Double fudge?
---
You'll be fine to do any of the level 60 5-man dungeons. They're where you go to gear up for pre-raid BIS so it wouldn't make sense for blizz to make content that 5 man groups in "at-level" greens / earlier level blues couldn't clear.
---
I'd be a little surprised if any alliance race is more popular than humans for any class. Most people seem to gravitate towards humans no matter what.
---
Nice! Let’s add them to the list of servers to avoid. Someone please?
---
"I have a great idea on how I can play a ret pally"
---
You can't be logged into the same account on multiple servers currently (to the best of my knowledge, been gone a few years) so I'm not sure why that would change.
---
I remember in BC expertise was needed for tanks and pvp so enemies wouldn’t dodge, block, parry and it capped at 6% I think, Dps didn’t need it because enemies could only BDP attacks in the frontal 45* 
---
Tanks and pvp players also needed defense rating to avoid crits and crushing blow. Can’t remember if this was BC only or classic too
---
I don't feel they should to that.
---
Either rerelease TBC in the same fashion as classic, so with "no changes" (as little changes as needed to run on modern infra).  
---
Or go the new content route, but make it 100% new and original content.  
---
Taking content from for example TBC and mix it with new content would imho create some kind of abomination that won't be good either way.
---
Guys let's speculate as to who the raid bosses in grim batol would be?
---
I wouldn't use it. Your damage output is weak, no burst, weak dots. Demonic Sacrifice is a waste if you don't sacrifice a pet. SM/Ruin gives you both survivability and bigger damage output. Full destro gives you ridiculous burst. Both are IMO better options. And also, felhunter &gt; succubus for pvp.
---
Overall, my answer is that it took a lot of what made WoW great and did more of it, and it made some changes that kept it similar to the original game but not as far gone as future expansions took things.
---
Professions had a lot more benefit and life in them than in vanilla. Jewelcrafting and gems allowed for a lot of cool customization. There was a lot more reason to personally get a certain profession other than the occasional "level Tailoring to craft Truefaith / Enchanting to craft Heart of the Mountain then drop for engineering". 
---
Dungeons are my favorite PvE aspect of the game and they were awesome in TBC, especially with the introduction of Heroic mode. Raids were more accessible than in vanilla but not to the level of LFR now. You had Mag and Gruul which were quick affairs like Onyxia. You had Kara and ZA which were like the TBC version of ZG and AQ20, but the 10 man size I think is a great amount that reminds me of UBRS. Not to mention the encounters were Incredible - we all know about the greatness of Kara and BT, but even things that expanded on vanilla concepts like warlock tanking from Twin Emps built upon through Leotheras and Illidan fights. 
---
Class balance is another one you mentioned, I thought was done so well in TBC (I played a warlock, mind you - so I might be spoiled). The fact that elemental, enhancement, shadow, etc became regulars in a raid comp but still 'unique' in that you still have more mages and warlocks as the 'pure caster dps' over the unique hybrids, was a great medium. The fact that specs became good enough in raiding where you could fill that hole of say the missing warrior tank with a feral druid without question (I know feral tanks are good in vanilla, but at the time it was still hard to convince people of that until TBC) - so that multiple classes could fill a role but still worked their unique way: you can bring a paladin tank, but you need to modify your strategy a little bit. Unlike later points on vanilla where classes became homogenized.
---
I love how raiding wasn't the definitive way to be competitively geared - professions, heroics, PvP, BOEs, reputation, raiding all had their impact. 
---
Arenas were a fantastic concept imo (I was lucky enough to be on a great 3v3 team that went very far), my only complaint is that it took over as the definitive form of PvP, where I would like to see a system that more equally valued wPvP, arenas, and BGs as I love all 3.
---
Dailies is where I started getting drawn away from the game. I like flying mounts at the time (like everyone else) but in hindsight not great overall - but really cool when it's a new concept. It was better when everyone only had the slow flying mount.
---
Also, the aesthetic was really cool at the time - I prefer the Azeroth aesthetic more of course, but it was a great fresh new aesthetic. Nagrand, Zangarmarsh, and Netherstorm felt so great to explore. Azeroth was not pointless, but it was obviously less important - but if they tried to make it much more relevant to level 70 then we might have gotten what we got in Cataclysm - and I'd rather have Azeroth with minimal changes like we had. After all, I leveled a fresh toon on TBC launch instead of taking one of my 60s straight to 70 - and I had multiple alts. So you still saw plenty of Azeroth. Sure, everyone's hearth was on Shattrath but Orgrimmar was still very populated - obviously because you can take a portal from Shattrath to Org but not the other way around.

Claiming 2.0 patch as a vanilla kill lmao.
---
Implementation of dungeon/party/raid finder killed it for me.
---
I agree with everything you said. K1 removed world buffs on zoning into Naxxramas (as well as some custom instance buffs) and it actually made things fun and challenging.
---
&gt; People dedicate entire raidnights and ambushes just to strip the opposition of their buffs
---
This part is pretty fun though
---
6 silver? Mr. Moneybags over here.
---
Thanks for this answer
---
You have no idea what u talking about its painfully obvious and im pretty sure everyone else on this thread has also made it clear to you.
---
So you don't think we should get Arena or any sort of 25-man raid? Or the balance changes that came with TBC?
---
Only reading the title is what makes you look stupid.
---
Give it 30 seconds for the content bellow?
---
Well in vanilla nobody can inspect your talents, so just don't tell them you're healing with 31 points in shadow.
---
15 minutes of rubbing elbows with fame
---
I see, thanks a lot
---
They're talking about retail not private
---
"I have an idea for a thread that will get me a BUNCH of downvotes, hold my sweetened goats milk"
---
If you plan to play at the highest level it’s definitely essential. You need every ability you can get your hands on at that point. If you’re just casually pvping then sure, who cares.. but to “PvP” and to not have engi is just shooting your self in the foot.
---
IMO it's a great supplement to one of the more standard BiS lists, giving you an easy resource to find replacements for the hard to get/expensive items like world BoEs, crafted BoPs for profs you don't have, or dungeon items that you just can't get to drop for you.
---
Definitely still has uses even though it isn't up to date.
---
Orcs have been slaughtered to near extinction three or four times now, and they're still everywhere. They're definitely banging everything that moves, including their siblings. Gotta get new grunts out somehow
---
humans have always been the most popular race regardless of class. Gnomes are the least popular. Most people aren't min/maxers
---
Great app, but a couple of points:
---
* When selecting a talent instead of a pop-up when adding/removing points, just let the user add a point with a short single tap, and remove on with a long press.
---
* Add the option for a rotation lock.
---
* Show at which level which talent point is spent where. Like:  [https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/)
---
* A self-hostable web version would be killer, because then we could share builds or attach them to post-it notes or the like.
---
Oh my goodness! I am so hyped for this!!!!
---
They won't even attempt this until vanilla, TBC, and wrath have run their course once.
---
As a first timer? No, I would not recommend it. Book it like a week after instead when the dust has settled.
---
Not gonna lie, the other guy makes good points, but "beauty and design" aren't it for me. If anything I enjoyed the zones even more because of flying. I spent a lot of time in TBC exploring the zones, finding nooks and crannies, hanging out in places I thought were cool, admiring places from above, etc. My server had a handful of folks that used to run hide-and-seek type events with gold rewards for the person who found them, and having to search in three dimensions instead of just two was definitely a net positive.
---
From a previous discussion:  
---
&gt; As stated in the above, if you maxed out the amount of gear, plus supplemented, you're still looking at a perfect pull of around 16 weeks (plus time prior to initial Raid 1) to fully gear up that full raid. This is ignoring BOE epics that can be looted and purchased, but still average. That's if no one leaves that raid or they aren't also gearing up secondaries, plus that would mean perfect pulls, fitting every slot evenly.  
---
The above statement was assuming that there was an even distribution of gear that dropped to equip up every member of the raid in their tier gear. That's not even talking about bis trinkets, weapons, offhands, reputations, etc...

On Friday, June 14 at 23:00 CEST, we’ll open a new realm in the WoW Classic Beta for dedicated testing of Alterac Valley.
---
When beta testers log into the WoW Classic Beta at that time, please look for the new Field of Strife realm. Alterac Valley will only be available for testing on this realm, and we will be turn off the other beta realms for the duration of the AV test. You’ll find that test characters on Field of Strife are confined to their capital cities. Don’t worry—even if you could leave the city, there will be no enemies, quest-givers, dungeons, or transports throughout the rest of the world.
---
On the Field of Strife realm, when you create a character, it will be locked at level 58 for AV testing. These test characters will have appropriate gear, some gold, a mount, and access to class trainers and reagent vendors, but they will not be able to level up past 58.
---
Please go to your city’s Battlemasters and queue for Alterac Valley as much as you like, and submit your feedback.
---
We expect to close the realm and this AV test on Monday, June 17 at about 19:00 CEST. At that time, the other beta realms will return.
---
Thank you!
---
Back when I played Vanilla as a kid, I was always DPS classes. This time around, I'm very interested in rolling a healer. I started playing retail a couple weeks ago and I have really been enjoying playing a priest. Could someone help me understand how each of the healer classes work/what makes them unique and fun to play?
---
You're missing the point. It's not about the content being cleared quickly, large guilds like this and big streamers can kill a realm if they stop playing abruptly. Classic is all about community, and that's what people worry about with this shit. Only a handful of people fking care if 40 neckbeards don't sleep for 2 weeks and kill Rag first. Same people that care about "server firsts" on private servers.
---
They're doing ST technically but most are only attempting it, not actually completing.  Skipping most trash packs because they're borderline impossible, and figuring out the best cheese / exploit-ish strategies for the boss.
---
Do you have links to some other lists?
---
Raise Your Horns by Amon Amarth

for the same reason the undead run scholo and strat

"LFM ICC LINK ACHIEVEMENT"
---
People used them as a way to recruit. I get people wanted a group that knew what they were doing but if you didnt have the achievement chances are you wernt going. Which sucks because how else are you suppose to get the achievement? 
---
Instead of the community (guild/raid group/ w.e) helping a player and taking time to explain the fights or at the very least pointing them to a video on youtube it came down to "Do you have the achievement? No well fuck off we want people who know what they are doing"
---
This is really the only problem I saw with achievements but it was a big problem. Im sure there were other things that people exploited but I think this was the biggest problem with them.
---
Just do both, do the first faction quest chain and then grind the opposite faction
---
this way no choice to make, easy!
---
Could even include alts.
---
In beta, Ive never gotten into a AB on the PVE Alliance server. The longest I waited in queue was 45 minutes tho..
---
I never really rolled pve very hard, and not an optimized raiding build, but I bet the extra tools you get in combat, hell, adrenaline rush alone, would make combat way batter. Going that deep into sub would cause you to miss some good pve skills in favor of stuff that has more pvp utility. Also, missing dual wield spec, sword spec and weapon expertise would probably hurt in pve. All that said, this probably applies mostly to more strict guilds...
---
This keyboard is still the best. https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B000V62BZU/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_mdtaDbV9Z900N
---
No they shouldn’t, but the pace should be slowed down for casuals to catch up some.
---
I still want it to be Vanilla of hardcore players melting faces, but would like for it to be slowed a little to a middle ground to people can still catchup.
---
They don't care about what people want, this is so they can test AV.
---
Dilemma? There isn't even a single pro on the alliance side, no contest.
---
Gotcha, I totally forgot about that. There are going to be so many subtle differences that all add up. Excited for my first taste of the classic life :D
---
Honestly I always wanted variable heights for characters in WoW with a set min and max height for each race.
---
Yeah what I’m hoping for is a spec that won’t leave me completely gimped for either PvP or PvE
---
People like Darkshore?
---
I don't blame WoW alone for it. I don't really blame WoW at all. It's my compulsion and desire for escapism that contribute to a spiraling down of depression. I had a rough start in positive habit forming, sure, but I have to put the work in and I'm the only one responsible for me.
---
I just stated that I'm a little worried about Classic. On the one hand, I look forward to really diving in, taking a week off work even, just to sink my teeth into some hard nostalgia and engaging gameplay. I'm just hoping I'm in a better place in my life come August is all.
---
Camping NE males?
---
It's honestly easy money for Method. Classic is going to be super Flavor of the Month when it releases so it's easy views.
---
The classes and raids are significantly simpler, and they're some of the best players, so there's no difficulty issue.
---
It comes down the the ability to no-life the game. They can do that really fucking well. Modern Raiding at the very tippy top requires even more no-lifing than Classic will. They're accustomed to it.
---
It's just down to coordination and planning, and they've got a few months to do that.
---
I think they're pretty much a wash in terms of PvE, both are excellent at the same things and play nearly the same as you've just outlined.
---
Warlock has a much slower start in PvP and will be pretty hopeless before 42 when you get death coil and your good talents finally start coming in. I've heard that even their tier 1 is not sufficient to carry your weight in pvp either and have experienced as much playing against them. It's not until I see the goggles and tentacles of the T3 set that I get scared — and then I get very scared. Mages on the other hand are always a menace no matter how geared.
---
I'd offer these criteria to further narrow it down:
---
**Mobility and control:** Mage — blink, slows. Warlocks are very immobile.
---
**AoE:** Mage. Warlock's AoE doesn't compare.
---
**1v1s:** Warlock. Warlocks will nearly always beat mages unless they tryhard with trinkets, consumables, blow their 10 minute cooldown, etc. They're equally terrifying against hunters, shamans, and most other classes besides warrior and rogue.
---
**Faction:** Warlocks are depreciated when playing against Undead.
---
This can only be used to test the zone and map/mechanics/npc behavior etc. It cannot be used to test how players will play within AV.  Testers will be using a free, locked, throwaway character in which they have no advancement available or long term investment goals. That means getting quick wins won't matter. No one will be grinding rep or honor. People will be looking for PvP, which is generally the opposite of real AV. It should be a lot of fun for watching the various streams, but that's about it.
---
And I don't think they have any interest in watching player behavior with respect to the 1.12 design of the zone so I wouldn't hold out hope for that anyway.
---
I agree on rated PvP missing.
---
It sucks that the highest rank possible is achieved through 24/7 pug stomping with a premade.
---
I did however really dislike the addition of ressilience, as it took away the "Oh shit wtf did that guy just crit me for?" factor of pvp that Vanilla has.
---
&gt; and I always had to do SOMETHING MEANINGFUL  
---
Vanilla and TBC felt like this. You could always work on something to get a bit more out of your experience, whether it was finding a group for a bis blue, grinding a rep, looking for a rare drop recipe, getting mats for something... you were always in the cycle getting ready for the next challenge.
---
Yeah if anything this rant just gave my pvp oriented guild more ideas how to ruin the min maxers day
---
Why would you play a gnome rogue? The gnome active racial is offset by improved sprint, extra engineering skill is barely impactful, arcane damage is nowhere to be seen, and extra int is only good to level weapon skills
---
NIAR i was trying so hard to remember those videos. thank you
---
So to reset your current talent build you have to pick a different class then go back to the class you want to put in talents for?
---
I enjoyed dailies in TBC to grind reputations. I'd rather do the same 5 quests every day for a few weeks to get Revered with a faction, than to grind the same 10 mobs for a few weeks.
---
Of course the problem is that dailies gave too much gold, but that could be nerfed. It's a good reputation grinding system, I think.
---
Same area before or after shrinking it?
---
Thanks! I will be putting a lot of effort into getting physically ready to do this. And during the leveling, I'll be having another "training schedule" to ensure that I'm staying in good enough shape, my blood will be flowing enough etc.
---
So hopefully not :D
---
no point in goin demo if you drop SL
---
Thought you were serious.  People here choose a feature at random and claim it was the death of the game.  Its ludicrous.
---
Yeah the hide and seek thing isn't like tbc specific, people have been doing that since vanilla, and probably before that on other games .
---
Playing hide and seek with 3 dimensions instead of 2 isn't really an adequate reason for flying mounts lmaooo
---
Lol - pvp server
---
Honored gives 10% discount with your own faction, PvP Rank 3 gives you a further 10%. That's why it's 20% cheaper.
---
True I don't know if it's from my time in the Army or just my body but I do and feel better on four hours of sleep than I do on eight.

[Will of the Forsaken](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=7744/will-of-the-forsaken)
---
I've narrowed it down to **Hunter** and **Priest.**  Looking for a class for organized/world pvp, raiding (nothing hardcore), and 5 mans.   My thought right now is Undead Priest, Troll Hunter but no clue which to main.   I have 10 friends coming back for classic and i'll be the 11th: 3 warriors, 3 priests, 2 warlocks, 1 mage, 1 shaman, 0 rogue, 0 hunter, 0 druid.
---
* **HUNTER:** As mentioned we don't have a single leather/mail DPS  and the shaman is resto, so i'd have little to no competition for gear.   Never considered maining a hunter at any level of wow so this would be totally new.  I like the class fantasy of troll hunter, and that hunter pets are much more unique and interesting to manage than warlocks who all share the same demons.   Great in world PvP and not all that worried about 'dps falling off in AQ40 and beyond.'  Only drawback is having to make/buy and store your own ammo. I can get past this and will likely level engineering as i go, or once i pay for my mount.
---
* **PRIEST:**  With 7 of my 10 friends plan to play clothies there will be some steep competition for gear but how important is that really in the long run? We may have another 2-3 priests but i dont want to make my decision based entirely on what other people are doing. I'd love leveling as shadow and healing dungeons when needed.  I won't have the time to play that some will, and being able to heal and have a large impact on the pace/whether or not you wipe is a big plus for me.   My friend is a raid leader and has promised me the token shadow priest spot if i want it, or settle in as a healer.
---
Can always try to help them out. Teach them to be better and you will have an easier time filling slots.
---
I highly suspect that like 90% of the people that make an account in classic go inactive almost immediately.   The BFA people basically get this game "free", so they'll all make an account.  Most won't stick around though.   Then on top of that, you have everyone else that won't make it to 60.  
---
2% could be a very real number of accounts that raid.
---
Hey it's me ur boss. Venmo me this week's pay and you can keep your job.
---
For loot of course
---
I just want to chime in and say, "Especially at low levels." seriously, talents don't matter when you have ~5 of them.
---
Lol just vanilla icecream dude. Always.
---
This is so true.  If you're awake and just rolling your face on the keyboard, you'll probably do better than half the people I played with in Vanilla raiding.
---
No, book Thursday/Friday of the following weekend (if my head math is right that would be 8.29/8.30) and play 4 full days for the weekend
---
Exactly!
---
Too many people have been “spoiled”  by LFR or just don’t understand the communication and cooperation it takes to clear vanilla 40 man content
---
Edit, LFR
---
I was originally going to make a Warlock, then I switched to Paladin since I thought being a healer would make grouping up a lot easier. Now, I've been watching streams and seeing how much these groups are hurting for summons and I think I'm going to go back to Warlock. Is the lack of Warlocks on the beta just due to it being a closed beta or are they actually a much desired class?
---
One more reason to regret buying a damn iphone. Thanks anyways, though, this is a cool idea.
---
The extra health isn't bad if you have healers that are a little undergeared and gives them a tiny bit of extra room, but I was mainly talking about Fury warriors.
---
There’s no way you would ever beat me as a Druid, trust bro
---
If that's how you think it works then I'd love to sponsor you!
---
so basically you would be ok with TBC if it wasn't TBC. Seems legit.
---
Post like this are hilarious. TBC was almost unquestionably the best xpac in WoW, and sub numbers would support that.
---
"I want muh classic no changes!!"
---
"TBC was garbage, keep it on private servers" or "I'll take TBC with the following changes made: ..."
---
The only thing that was better about Classic vs TBC was the world immersion. That's it. Literally everything in TBC was better.
---
In raids they do nothing.
---
30 minutes in the sauna every day should suffice.
---
Still look up wow rap from time to time hahaha
---
A6 was the best, that Honor Kills is crazy fire
---
I think he is more referencing just being able to play in two months, and not specifically play AV. I imagine it will take people a month or two to hit max level anyway (unless you're planning to just beast through it.)
---
May not have had the same benefits in the sense that Paladins had great inbuilt regen, but it wasn't killed which was the original point, it wasn't KILLED until they removed the lower ranks/removed the +healing application on them. It still existed up to the end of TBC. All pally's in top guilds still downranked holy light as it was more efficient, I accept the plus healing benefits may not have been as extensive.   
---
Having played Holy Pally in server top raiding guilds in Vanilla and TBC. During vanilla only try hards downranked as Pally mana efficiency was king anyway. During TBC it was standard for Paladins to run with several ranks of holy light into BT/Hyjall/Sunwell. The WotLK patch made it so +healing was not applied to lower ranks.
---
I'd rather kick em.
---
They have a working 1.12 reference client (it's just not compatible with the modern server setups). All the numbers should be accurate to classic.
---
The forsaken are not the scourge. They are not mindless undead following orders. They are similar to Alliance / Horde DKs fighting against the Litch King. They gave broken free of the bonds and generally want revenge. Moreso, the scourge is a major threat to all living beings, and the Horde are living beings.
---
Yes, officers. This post right here.
---
In those situations I typically try to go the high route and disregard whatever they're saying unless it's a constant barrage toward me. Even then, most of the time, I'm just going to ignore them and keep doing whatever I'm doing.
---
1. Flying mounts  
---
2. Making all previous gear useless  
---
3. Making all previous zones useless  
---
4. Resilience  
---
5. Shared main city  
---
Those are the ones that pop to my mind
---
or, play the alliance and profit
---
Was Nyhm the one who did the Ulduar song?
---
Or you know, not everyone received a beta invite
---
1) if this is true, why am I finding various builds?
---
2) your response seems very raiding specific.
---
Hi, /u/joeggeli

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bztvgq/which_class_requires_the_lowest_amount_of_time/). 
---
We don't have a sauna in our gaming lounge. :( But maybe I can come up with some temporary solution!
---
Adding content to cater to the people that have cleared Naxx and are bored would probably be the wrong move. But adding content that is equal to the difficulty of MC or BWL that offers new gear sets could be really fun. Maybe release 10 man Kara with weaker mobs, re release Caverns of Time. The gear sets that focus on alternative specs idea would be great for this, like a paladin set that grants Crusader Strike if you get 2 pieces.
---
Hey y'all. 
---
I know for sure that i wanna play a Paladin, but unfortunately it's looking like we are going Horde. And i would like to only focus on one character.
---
I'm not really sure what class i wanna play as a Horde, we are quite alot of irls that are gonna play and i know for a fact that we are gonna be low on healers so it gotta atleast be a healer(for PvE).
---
I'm wanna focus on PvP but at the same time i wanna able to do all the PvE content.
---
So it is between: Shaman, Priest, Druid.
---
1. What are their roles in PvE and how would you rate how easy it would be to get into dungeons/raids as these classes as a healer?
---
2. How are these classes in PvP? What are the best specs for these classes? Both as a healer and dps?
---
3. How would you rate them in(Both as a Healer &amp; Dps):
---
A)WorldPvp
---
B)PuGs
---
C)Premades
---
I'd like to min/max when it comes to race, and if i understood it correctly for PvP it's: Paladin=Dwarf, Shaman=Orc, Priest=UD, Druid=Tauren, is that correct?
---
Any tips in general that you might think off?
---
So not vanilla at all then
---
I'd rather group with a shaman that plays well and has fun than some know-it-all tryhard who just does everything optimally.
---
(I'm not saying that's you, just in general)
---
You can play both, just not simultaneously. One realm instance per account.
---
Best
---
1. Judgement t2 pally
---
2. Cryptstalker t3 hunter
---
3. Nemesis t2 warlock
---
4. Frostfire t3 mage
---
5. Dreamwalker t3 druid
---
Worst
---
1. Lawbringer t1 pally
---
2. Arcanist t2 mage
---
3. Bonescythe t3 rogue
---
4. Dragonstalker t2 hunter
---
5. Faith t3 priest
---
People forget Method is a brand. What’s the one and only thing brands care about? Money. They see a hype train, they ride it. They’d be morons if they didn’t.
---
If your favorite class fantasy is a Paladin: play that Paladin.  I love the Druid fantasy, but mained one forever.  And I can't pick a DK.  Rock that fantasy if you can.
---
DS is required for SL though
---
Would it cap at 60 or 70? Capping at 60 would necessitate scaling down all BC content and gear, and might risk cluttering the gear pool as scaled down gear becomes so similar to current 60 Raid gear.
---
Capping at 70 makes the 60 raids irrelevant unless they’re scaled up, which creates the same issue as scaling down.
---
Raid at all or consistently raid? I'd say probably 85% will clear MC / Onyxia at least. Far less will consistently participate though.
---
You've already pretty well laid it all out. If you're looking for subtle nuance to sway you one way or the other I would say that once you get into Naxx, my understanding is Mage DPS is largely going to be tied to the RNG of who is getting credit for Ignite, whereas the Warlock really starts to shine with that gear. 
---
I'm having a similar debate between these two classes myself and for me I see Mage as the instant gratification choice and Warlock as the slow burn but more satisfying in the end choice.
---
I can't believe my boss, the owner of the company, is trying to blackmail me out of my paycheck. I can't work in this hostile of a work environment. I QUIT!
---
They are desired, just a bit less popular. Definitely a good and fun pick.
---
&gt; Nobody gives a shit about anybody's spec up until raiding because it has no effect on them. Your entire post is addressing a non-issue.
---
I dunno, I definitely had some experiences running Scholo/Strat with a shadow spec'd priest healing and they pulled aggro a lot (no lowered threat talents) and had to drink constantly.  We still never kicked them, but you could definitely tell they weren't specc'd for the heals, and there was probably some grumbling.
---
Priest or Shaman? For PvE and PvP without respec
---
So I need your opinion what should I play? 
---
Priest or Shaman.
---
Background I played with friends classic a lot, now we want to revive the good old times... It's just that we are all adults now, and don't have that much time.
---
So I was thinking group leveling with friends (so that is not an issue) and at 60 casual raiding once a week, with a bit of PvP on the weekends.
---
I like healing, so I would go shaman or priest. Now the question is which of those has more potential besides healing. 
---
Does one of the classes has a spec with good PvE and also ok PvP potential without re-specing? Or which one has more PvP potential with mainly PvE specs and equipment? 
---
(In vanilla I played a Tank...)
---
I won't play Druid, I want a real healer...
---
Ragnaros will be dead first week with potentially a day to spare.
---
With two different accounts, sure.
---
However, if you have two clients loaded; as soon as you enter your account credentials and hit enter it should disconnect you from the other client.
---
I think his point is that he's not in beta and doesn't get to play til August.
---
There’s also little red X’s next to each specialization. I suppose the fastest way to reset the entire tree would be to switch classes, yeah. I thought about a full reset button, but it sort of felt like I already had too many buttons on the screen :) thank you for the feedback, I will try to find good spot for a button like that.
---
Not a streamer, got two invites.
---
Most people I've played with aren't streamers, why is this still a meme?
---
51+
---
Take systems? Sure, add arena for example. But don't add the TBC arena's, create new ones.  
---
Same with raids, could do 25 and 10 mans. But create new raids.  
---
Do add balance changes, but not the exact TBC ones.
---
So imho, reuse TBC systems, yes! Reuse TBC content, no!
---
&gt;  I QUIT!
---
You can't quit, YOU'RE FIRED.
---
Tormund?
---
Naxxramas 2: Electric Boogaloo
---
Don't panic, boy. This isn't the damned Night's Watch where we make you swear off girls.
---
the level bracket would be 51-59, with 60 being another.
---
The only thing I wouldn’t mind seeing in classic is the dual spec option. 
---
But with limitations....
---
Can only change specs at your trainer in town. No out in the field talent changes.
---
What I really would like, if they would do servers with different patch progression. Have fast, medium and slow patch releases, either depending on progress of the average server population, or maybe better, fixed from the beginning. People could choose for hc pushing through content in 1 year or less or for turtling around for the next 3 to 5 years. 
---
Just a tought..
---
What guide? Joana? LOL Jaysus the people on this sub.
---
No you won't be able to. Once you play vanilla you won't be able to bring yourself to play BfA or any new expansions.
---
If they implemented Karazhan as level 60 content, I couldn't care less.  If they don't, then I want TBC.
---
This is what I was thinking too. If classic has widespread success again with high sales and sub numbers.It will prolly influence other developers way more than wow retail. We might get a real next gen MMO in the future afterwards.
---
It's kind of tough with rogue, tbh. Although, I never really tried to make one because I've always been more pvp focused.
---
Flying allows you to escape 99% of WPVP fight, corpse gank is literally not a thing anymore, exciting chases on ground mounts trying to juke each others is not a thing. When you in the air you are basicly immune to death.
---
Flying is also so incredibly boring, its not even exciting, you press space to get altitude and then just auto "walk". For all the negatives it brings, you would wish flying was ACTUALLY exciting, but its not, its literally like swimming, just in the air.
---
It makes the world incredibly small, any kind of mountain useless.
---
So they will be able to test like 2 games of AV, awesome!
---
Sure would help out some unemployment numbers /s
---
Mmmm love it
---
I see this as Shadow Priest being easier to do well with in PvP, but will have a hard time of getting groups/raids should you choose to do PvE. 
---
Hunter will have a higher skill cap for PvP but an easier time getting groups/raids for PvE.
---
Given your criteria I would go with Undead Shadow Priest.
---
Here's a pretty popular staple, where a lot of other lists pull their info from:
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#
---
Here's a website someone made that is a little bit easier to use, but I'm not a huge fan of the UI; I would prefer a list with the names as well:
---
http://www.wowclassicbis.com/
---
Pre naxx, yes really
---
We're not evil, we're just misunderstood :(  lol
---
I completely agree that they have a bad track record, but if this was an actual issue (it isn't, it was a WF proc) then it's something even they can't ignore and have to fix. I'm not on the "WoW is dead" train like most people, but it's undeniable that retail is at its' lowest peak and they really need Classic to go well and pull back in a lot of their subscribers. I'm just as cynical as everyone else, but I'm also being realistic. There is a limit to developer's incompetence and laziness despite how hard they all work to prove otherwise.
---
Dude this sub is the definition of [Toxicity](https://youtu.be/iywaBOMvYLI)
---
Nope, ground mounts just make you faster, it doesnt let you blatantly skip the entire world, going over mountains, mobs etc. It also lets you skip any sort of water area, ground mount are not comparable to flying mounts.
---
Talent reset costs depreciate if you don't do it for a while.  So it's not all bad.
---
So, what do you want to tell me? That the guy who opened this wrote the same as me? Oh noes.
---
Because Vanilla raiding was, outside of a handful of fights, more about dedication and being able to get 40 people who are able to grind out the required man-hours. 
---
Method does that already.
---
Yes and most of them have no viewers. Meanwhile mount farming bullshitter Asmongold killing it with 50k+ viewers. No one cares about competitive WoW.
---
Sounds like NA and EU are the most likely candidates for this sort of thing based on population.
---
I also have some doubts about queue times... But don't forget they are shutting down all other realms so if anyone wants to play Classic this weekend they can only play AV (or hop around in Orgrimmar)
---
2 - Trying to avoid this causes a lot more problems and would never happen
---
3 - I didn't see this as a problem
---
4 - I see this as a good thing.  Why does a pvper need to raid to get pvp gear?  
---
5 - I didn't have a problem with this but I guess it could be considered one
---
Generally you don't do it until level 40 but at that point it's good. Kargoz has a lengthy breakdown on leveling Shaman on his youtube channel.
---
Classic will be so easy 40 man raid of clickers won’t even matter
---
I’m torn between shaman and priest for healing PVE. 
---
I would play as a paladin, but I love the Horde. 
---
I really like tank healing. Mana management seems better for priest, correct me if wrong. 
---
But totems can be really cool and useful. 
---
Which do you think would be more likely to get me into raids? Priests feel slightly overwhelming with their amount of heals, especially with downranking. Shaman seems simpler but I love the priest shield as an emergency heal.
---
The best reason...
---
#**Dwarves!**
---
good bot
---
In that case I can claim unemployment. SO LONG SUCKERS!
---
must be nice :)  fr, though, good use of the time. And it's good to know you're the right faction when it counts :)
---
In very short.
---
Priest - Main Healer. Can heal massive amounts and is usually the main tank healer. Removes buffs/debuffs. Best 'pure' healer in most situations.
---
Paladin - unkillable healer, most mana efficent, you mostly spam one spell but it's efficent.
---
Shaman - offensive healer in pvp, as you also kill a lot. Good raid healer with chain heal you are healing multiple targets. Can easily top the healing charts.
---
Druid - you mostly heal with heals over the time, a little less useful as a healer in pvp but has different options. Innervate b.
---
Okay, *first of all*, talking about mob levels when discussing lore makes no sense. You might as well say the humans of Stormwind were brought to their knees by low-level Gnolls.
---
Now, to continue:
---
The Darkspear were not chased out by the Zandalari. The Zandalari don't even live in Stranglethorn; they just sent a contingent of warriors to combat the reawakened Gurubashi Empire, which had in previous centuries fractured and decayed. The Darkspear were one of the tribes that originated from the Gurubashi before it began to split, and they left Stranglethorn because they refused to participate in the ritual sacrifices and brinksmanship of rival tribes. The other tribes tried to gang up on them, so they left for the soon-to-be-named Darkspear Islands to escape the warfare, where they were then besieged by Kul Tiran fleets and a particularly powerful Naga. Their initial flight from Stranglethorn had *nothing* to do with the Zandalari, and it also wasn't due to them being "weak", per se; they were targets of the other tribes because of their lack of cultural savagery and thus outsider status.
---
The Tauren? Yeah, that's accurate enough, except again, it's silly to talk about lore events with game levels as a power metric. Game levels are a feature of the games themselves; all that needs to be said in regards to lore is that one force was stronger than another force, not that the strong force "was X level because it said so in a Warcraft game and therefore other force was suuuuuper weak".
---
Regarding the Orcs, "willingly" is a bit of a strong word. They were a simple nomadic people conned into enslavement by Gul'dan and Mannoroth. It's like saying the Native Americans "willingly" sold all their goods and lands to the Europeans and then "willingly" settled on barren reservations after centuries of diaspora. Consent by fraud is not consent, nor is a technologically limited people equivalent in bargaining power to a technocratic and militarized people.
---
The Forsaken-engineered Plague is not designed to target humans. It *can* as an "added bonus", but the Royal Apothecary Society began research into a reverse-engineered Plague that targets *the Scourge*, and thus also initiated joint research into how to reverse the effects of the original Plague. They specifically focused on *curing* victims of the Plague during the second Scourge Invasion. Grand Apothecary Putress betrayed the Horde after allying himself independently with the dreadlord Varimathras and thus initiating the events of the Wrathgate, but he was universally opposed by the entirety of the Horde including the rest of the Forsaken. Undoubtedly the Forsakens' methods of researching medicine are rather unethical to the point of being vaguely Nazi-ish, but their goal is to annihilate the Scourge, not other living species, and if the humans of Lordaeron didn't keep trying to burn them all "alive", they'd hardly be concerned with fighting. They're defending themselves from *two* groups of former allies.
---
I know I want to play a mage and I know I want to go Alliance. I cant bring myself to play a gnome. How big of a disadvantage is it to go human mage over gnome mage?
---
Hey stop stealing my karma.
---
They want to just test AV at higher level.
---
The normal beta test will prob go through 2 more phases as in l50 cap and l60 cap before launch thats why they dont want to mess with it
---
If you want to be rate, roll a female Dwarf Rogue. They're like unicorns. Class/race combos are easier to say they're "rare".
---
The least played class in vanilla was and probably still will be Druid.
---
This is my tentative plan as well but I'll be 2-boxing a Paladin to heal myself that will my wife will later use to healbot me in BGs. 
---
2-boxing is annoying but will suck less than leveling a Warrior solo.
---
Onixya was the only super difficult attunement in Vanilla, from what I remember.
---
If this gets posted one more time im gonna...
---
They are not "bored". First of all top guilds don't play for fun, they play to be world first and attract sponsors. Second they beat all the current raid content and wait for the next raid so naturally there's nothing for them to do right now. Note that this will happen in Classic, because they will beat MC in week 1 or 2, gear up their mains with alt runs and than wait for BWL for however long it takes to release. And yes, they are mainly in it for the views
---
The bracket was 51-60 in vanilla
---
TBC has way more, big negatives than positives. My biggest positive from TBC is probably Arenas, but i also HATE resilience.
---
Gp dps pet and don't use vw in dungeons.
---
I feel you. For me, horde and alliance both have a very nostalgic and comfortable feel, but both in their really unique way. I love Ironforge and the snow outside, gives me a fuzzy happy christmas feeling. For Orgrimmar, the feeling is warm, open and like summer. I love both, making the choice so hard
---
Yes he also had a bunch from BC. Ni hao, and many more.
---
Too bad Asmon already got all the World Firsts.
---
1) as healer you will always find a group regardless. (Well as shaman and priest, druid is more so so ....)
---
Race: druid is only Tauren, and PvE is both shaman and priest Troll the best choice.
---
Orc shaman is the best for Meele enhancer, and I think UD priest was better for PvP with the fear break.
---
I would go priest or shaman both cool. I thought already a lot about that and asked basically the same question narrowed down to priest or shaman ;-)
---
~~Even 10 weeks doesn't seem like long enough before phase 2.  I would have guessed 12 weeks minimum.~~
---
A cant do X.
---
B has been doing X for 15 years.
---
Therefore, B&gt;A. Nice logic m8. It's like saying the USPS has been around forever, and they're the best mail carrier service and UPS and FedEx can't compete.
---
Is that how it was originally? I don't remember there being separate brackets in vanilla, but maybe by 1.12 it was changed to be bracketized like that.
---
nope, not really, and for sure not for every class. BWL stuff is on par with rank 14.
---
I dunno, I don't see a whole lot of them. :&gt;
---
Method playing classic is great. It means there will be a real week1 race now.
---
Everyone knows rag dies week 2. But there is real discussion if he can be killed week 1. Getting 40 to 58+, and enough fire protection pots, soft reset farming and boss killing in 1 week is tough.
---
Mage is THE kiting class. How could it possibly be worse for another class?
---
You’re replying to the wrong guy and yes you are correct
---
2 new races, overall better class balance, more content. That said I want it to be a good while before they release it. The main classic player base should get all the goodness out of classic before moving over. And I’d like to chose to move some characters over and keep some on a permanent vanilla server.
---
The racial Will of the Forsaken, which removes charm, fear and sleep is amazing in PvP.
---
how is class/spec balance a bad thing?
---
NF/SL is pretty much the best 1v1 spec in the game. Changing the points in Aff over to Destro makes you lose too much.
---
- No instant corruption
---
- No pushback protection on drain life
---
- No Nightfall for RNG burst dmg
---
- No amp curse for better CoAs
---
+ Shorter cast time on immo and shadow bolt
---
+ Shadowburn
---
Not worth the tradeoff imo. Your biggest strength as a SL build is just how goddamn tanky you are. Destro talents do nothing to supplement that, Aff does though.
---
I won't do deadmines with a priest that isn't dwarf and specced holy /s
---
"respect other players roleplaying"
---
Hahahaha hahaha, as if blizzard has ever enforced that. There is absolutely no punishment for fucking with role players, it's a pain in the ass.
---
Great, now I've got a song from literally 10 years ago stuck in my head. Holy fuck. I just looked it up and Ulduar was released in 2009
---
I think they could learn a leveling route in the 2 months before release.  I also don't think they will get MC first but I'd be more surprised if they aren't in MC week one than not.
---
Bears aren't raid tanks in vanilla. You will be an off tank at best sadly.
---
Tankadin here, missing shield toss.
---
If it's causing wipes, that's when I bring it up.
---
Especially if they're the type of person that is pulling for the tank, telling people what to kill first (which doesn't match the tank's mark), putting dots on CC, fearing enemies close to other enemies, etc.
---
I think you meant Warrior.
---
\- Only real tank
---
\- Best DPS
---
\- Can attack people trying to kite them from 3x actual melee range.
---
Seems fair.
---
Lol mine was "looking for someone to pocket heal me when classic comes out" and I started to get a lot less matches / matches and then unmatched shortly after so I changed it
---
Well meme’d
---
"I'm really glad I don't do this thing I don't enjoy. I have such a hard time imagining how the people that do enjoy it, actually enjoy it"...you got a solid closed mind m8
---
My RL leads.
---
As the MT of the guild, I am expected to know the fights beforehand. If the tank fails the raid fails. You also have to know when to use small CDs and larger ones. It's also extremely fun. I've been tanking for almost 11 years. Decided to retire the next raid. Our guild raged. It's my decision. They can deal with it. We have always ran 1 healer less than needed because of the tanks. My tank buddy retired last raid and I realized after all that time...I can't stand other tanks. We worked so well together that I got spoiled. We were so in sync with each other that on a new boss we wouldn't have to talk. I knew what he wanted to do and so I did something else. I've not found anyone else like that. So I'm out unless he comes back. 
---
What I'm saying, tanks HAVE to work together. You have to get along and have to know each other's weakness and strength. We knew each other and it was amazing. 
---
So get to know who you are tanking with, asap. Work with them in lfr. Over and over. Until you know each other. 
---
Beyond that. Good luck :)
---
People need to stop using Unpopular Opinion to make bad takes seem like they have merit
---
So horde and alliance could continue subbing.
---
id use the vw for tanking, the "dps" pets dont really deal that much damage
---
when the vw drops low, the warrior can tank for 1-2 mobs until the vw is back to full
---
in dungeons whip out the imp
---
So basically TBC with no flying mounts? Sounds like hell.
---
Classic: Doesn't even exist yet
---
Everyone else: **EXPANSIONS**
---
Ooooooweeeeee
---
The tank is the default leader of a 5 man.  It's pretty simple.  Just put a skull up on kill target, X on secondary, and CC targets.   Use bindings, like the arrow keys to make this quicker.   You might want a macro that explains these markings to the group, so you can hit that as you begin the dungeon.   Watch the healers mana, and keep pulling.  If the boss has some sort of ability that the group needs to know about that would risk wiping, then tell them in chat.  If it's just tank and spank, then go.  
---
The raid leader can be anyone.  You won't be the MT as a feral in 40 man raids.  Maybe 20 man raids, but even then there will be another tank and people to help.   Once you see it a couple times, it won't be hard to know what to do.
---
yeah, we love them. there wouldn't be classic without them.
---
I wouldnt do it on launch day. It's going to be frustrating. Way too many people, barely able to finish quests, lag, crashing servers possibly.
---
If I had the day off as is then I would enjoy every frustrating second of it. But I dont think it's worth using PTO time on. However that's my situation and not yours. So if you want to take the time off to experience it then go ahead. But I want to say that the servers dont even open until like 6pm EST as is. That might not be true.
---
Nice copypasta. Do you intend to repost it everywhere until someone finally upvotes it?
---
The game will need updates after TBC and after WOTLK, before you know it we back at BFA.
---
Rolling a dwarf pally, hopefully not too many problems with rogues.
---
I actually just checked that out, looks interesting but I think I'll try it out! Thanks!
---
thank you
---
The release is not vanilla. It’s Classic. 
---
Vanilla will never happen again
---
Well from what i seen many people dont think that way
---
Arena is huge for me. Also pvp gear with resilience so you can survive more than 2 crits... And overall class and specc balance.
---
I’m a mage boi
---
Call me mr. vending machine
---
I was looking forward to it to be honest, it must be hilarious to leave the bg and join the same again the next day!
---
Came here to say this
---
the best part of it is that the green items are better than whatever you farmed in vanilla ! and flying makes  world pvp.../s
---
Oh, I thought you were talking about dungeons.
---
That won't fly in any real raiding guild. They'd be removed from the raid no questions asked. Even in a PUG that person would likely get 1-2 chances and be kicked.
---
Then they'll just be actually mad
---
With the backdoor strat it’s the Horde who have the upper hand. Also the archers will have a much shorter aggro range in Classic which makes it much harder for alliance to turtle.
---
Why do you think they locked out the normal beta realm?
---
&gt; Making all previous gear useless
---
&gt; Making all previous zones useless
---
These were part of vanilla too.  Once you hit 60 and maxed your professions there were relatively few zones that were useful to you, and, outside a few niche builds that required stats that only show up once because vanilla had inconsistent itemization, you didn't use pre-60 gear.
---
I never expected the bot to have followed me from r/freefolk
---
The point of classic is to recreate vanilla if you change literally everything about the game it's not recreating vanilla.  Idk what's wrong with you people or why this concept is such a struggle for you to understand.
---
Hemo? Not really. Great for PvP, but you're investing heavily on bleeds that your raid doesn't want to give you the debuff slots for.  
---
Subtlety? You can make it work. Something like 12/8/31 makes you super bursty, since you're now capable of 3 (probably going to crit) ambushes per fight if you're good about timing things. Fights are about clever combo point/energy management since your damage is coming from crit backstabs. As opposed to "keep snd up, hope for sword procs" which is always how I felt when trying to play combat spec.  
---
The really nice thing though, is that you can find a happy medium between pvp and pve so that you aren't constantly respeccing
---
If you want to raid, there is one path for every class
---
That was on Malygos-A for about two days before a GM stepped in.

On private servers people pug AQ40 just fine. MC and BWL pugs are a nobrainer.
---
They have a 1.12 instance to compare values/numbers to. They just have to port it to current to be usable with their infrastructure. One of the blue posts specifically tested elites on their 1.12 vs classic beta to confirm the beta was accurate. They are also testing other information as provided from beta testers.
---
In 1.12 there is only one bracket as you remember - 51-60.
---
not every spec includes imp sprint though, another way to break root is always handy
---
So my intent was not predict what will happen. My intent was to elaborate what I thought would be cool, and then equate it with what could happen. 
---
Prediction-&gt; this could be cool
---
This could be cool-&gt; prediction 
---
Intent is the name of the game
---
True :D
---
The key difference is I'm not suggesting we add any of the expansions out right. I'm saying only things that pass a 75% vote get added. Dont even add TBc in its entirety. Add parts of it along with entirely new, voter approved content.
---
Because the people repeating it are jealous that they didn't get in, and would rather blame streamers than bad luck.
---
No changes.
---
You're actually right. Easy ZF acces for farm
---
That I can agree with
---
Of max level? I’d say over 90% will step into MC.
---
I'm so glad it did hahahah. At first I thought some random wildling named Tormund appeared knowing it was his time to shine
---
Most good hunters have a petpassive on their feign death/trap macro.  The taunt thing is usually reserved for the hunter standing on his trap waiting for the charge.
---
It can totally be done. Now when you get to the stuff closer to 60 you’ll need to get pretty tryhard with it and maybe even do the instance once as a healer to get familiar with it then go back as a tank. Remember consumables and try to do it with good friends/ guild mates. Weird specs can work and shaman tank is among the most viable weird specs there is.
---
Now which one of you cowards shit in my pants!
---
Yeah this is technically a prosthetic from the users perspective
---
This wouldn’t be an expansion. This is how I would have wanted Classic to be release in the first place. Expansions would come AFTER this
---
Druid videos I watched in Vanilla
---
Rubix 1 - https://youtu.be/1MQuN49uyGA
---
Rubix 2 - https://youtu.be/apogUm0XBB8
---
Rubix 3 Force of Nature - https://youtu.be/DMHufkFUWwU
---
Kindly stfu. This is literally the most important issue for me with Classic right now. I don't need dumbasses like you shitting up the discussion.
---
I would be VERY surprised if this happened. I believe the record for leveling 1 to 60 is just shy of 4 days play time (please correct me if I'm wrong) and even if you played 20 hours a day that is still 5 days real time after which is sure to be a pretty damned rough crash following it.
---
I bought one with the Cataclysm cover and the part on the right didn’t work properly ever and half the keys stopped working. It’s been in the trunk of my car since for about a year now.
---
&lt;Unguilded&gt;
---
The terron gorefiend questline might be the best single quest in all of WoW (except for wrathgate and ony attune). Caverns of time was super fun. 
---
Flying was totally fine because the world was built around it, don't really know what people are bitching about.
---
Kara had too much trash.
---
Considering you have until the lifetime of the servers/Blizzard to play the game, I think you have plenty of time.
---
One day our children may play this game and we'll have to login to our mains to help them level 20 years from now.
---
Then grandchildren in 50 years while we're logging in from the nursing home.
---
No wonder the rest of us aren't getting invited this guy is hogging them all!
---
&gt; because frankly i think it will be a mess
---
Disagree.   They've been testing pretty diligently and it appears a lot of planning is going into this to try to make the launch as smooth as possible.
---
I expect issues, but I expect it to be a generally solid launch.
---
Yeah for PvE as a priest I’d probably go holy at some point to heal and try not to respec very often.
---
From their [web page](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule)

etc
---
The implication is that name release will be simultaneous also.
---
So retail arena basically?
---
Shit, I thought ni hao was vanilla but it's obviously BC from the second line onward. Listening to it on repeat now. Fuck.
---
Does he have any from vanilla?
---
Classic does not equal vanilla. 
---
Classic is an attempt at a faithful recreation of a passed video game. Blizzard equated classic with vanilla, if they would have done it classic=vanilla+tbc it would seems as natural to you as this does now
---
Who the fuck would use the right side of the keyboard lol
---
I'm all for you enjoying the game how you want but this thread has been done a million times before the release date was even announced lol
---
&gt; Shadowmeld, become invisible while not moving. This trait DOES increase the character's stealth rating making Nelf rogues the stealthiest characters in the game.
---
still good since unlike now you could see rogues if you could get them in front of you.
---
Yeah, just like they did with Crucible of...no, wait, that took over a week (or even two if I recall correctly).
---
Just like they did with Battle for Daza...no, wait, that was also a week.
---
Oh, yes, just like they did with Uld...nope, took a while too.
---
IMO imp. sprint is almost a necessity for rogue pvp, so at least in my case, I usually go human for the perception bonus in rogue v rogue. But if you aren’t planning on picking up imp. sprint, I could see gnome being a pretty good race for that
---
Doing the honor grind in vanilla, Free Action and swiftness pots were used very frequently by top end pvpers.  I don't know what groups you played with, but the serious pvpers used them a lot.  Why not use something that increases your chance to win or your honor per hour?
---
Needs more Bassnectar
---
So would 3% dodge be better than say 1.5 seconds on gouge over the leveling process?  In the sense that you would be taking less damage and reduce the downtime between pulls?  I would assume the trade of is 30% more time on gouge for 30% more dodge (I am just assuming your dodge is around 10-11% but don't honestly know).
---
I had no problem as standard blue geared pvp arms warr tanking it, with pvp specced priest healing.
---
Basically every 5man composition has some form of cc or kiting ability, it wasn't hard to use them. Sure you wiped if you misplayed, but that's how it should be.
---
I'll go ahead and toss in Druid to meet the same criteria you have there for Priest but without fighting for gear. They are very fast levelers and you could even tank if you wanted to. The only big hitch is your lack of a standard resurrect. They're also great for world pvp with stealth, track humanoids, aquatic form; in organized wPvP tranquility and hurricane can be great. Druids are less desirable in raids but since you're not getting serious about it that shouldn't hold you back.
---
Back to your original choices — hunters are one of the go-to classes for wPvP. Hunter's mark is insane as is Bestial Wrath: in early stages you just send your pet in, pop Bestial Wrath, and run away. This will kill everyone except Druids. In organized wPvP you're valued for your frost trap which is incredible at controlling space especially with entanglement. In BGs you're an easy choice for WSG with your flag chasing and escorting. There are only a few really optimal pets so you run into the same cloning problem as Warlocks at high levels. Right now I'm planning to roll hunter and I can't wait.
---
I wouldn't worry too much about fighting for gear. At least one of you will be going tailoring/enchanting and you can all pool them materials to craft sets for everyone. All you really need to level those classes is a good wand.
---
nope, wrong version mate
---
Wow really? Someone told me they sell for decent as collectibles, but I wasn’t sure. I see a lot of BC, Wrath, and Cata ones on EBay and such but none like the Vanilla one I have. I’m not pressed to get rid of it anyways, it holds some sentimental value to me I guess.
---
They call me Giantsbane, want to know why?
---
So an opinion is a way to communicate a thought that is not objectively quantifiable. What merit it has is transposed by the individual person. 
---
You call it a bad take, so you are not giving it merit.
---
"I see you farming primals in shadowmoon valley".. why would a vanilla song say that?
---
Top retail guilds...people professionally being paid to play the game.
---
"Top private server players"...the professionally unemployeed.
---
Hmmmm, who's the bigger meme....
---
Well well we have a Sherlock Holmes here...
---
All true though. People just harp on about it cos it's when they got into wow. It has so little of what made classic great.
---
Leatherworkers can use a salt shaker to turn deeprock salt to refined deeprock salt on a 3 day CD. Refined deeprock salt makes cured rugged hides, which are required for certain leatherworking recipes.
---
You're testing the game for them... you're a tool, not a player.
---
Very exciting! Also all over the main page XD
---
Honestly depends more on realm with their xpacs. Last 3 xpacs I was a part of I had zero lag issues or disconnects, was incredibly smooth (outside of people everywhere) even including BfA launch. Classic will be a different beast though. Expect there to be issues.

Stop making mages look bad
---
maybe that's why belf allied with humans since they could see them so easily. a huge amount of nelf tactics was ambush from stealth.
---
Nah, Horde suck
---
Send help, I can't stop cumming.
---
Classic uses the 1.12 stat updates. Pservers do the progressive item thing, classic isn't for itemization. Just -what- items are available. (Like no caster hat in strat at launch)
---
Imagine unironically typing all this, lmao
---
You know how we have current raid tiers?
---
TBC would have been the next tier up in order of dungeons and then raids. 
---
You could cap it at 60 or 55,000, it would mostly be tiers of gear.
---
I'm just gonna block you to save myself from having to read any more of your brain diarrhea.  Have a nice day

Did you try activating war mode?
---
I'll show myself out...
---
Looking for insight on shaman. My levelling buddy is going feral druid to tank 5 mans. No aspirations of raiding. 
---
I never played shaman so looking to try it out with him. I should note that I will only play this character while he is on and will have a different main.
---
I want to heal in dungeons, but I doubt it's efficient to level that way. I know the typical levelling is done as enhancement but does that take into account having a bear with you? I was thinking elemental would be fun but I heard the oom problem is real.  
---
In essence, what spec would be the smoothest experience for a shaman while partnered with a druid?
---
The best thing I could suggest is having the wowhead web site open on the other page and filter all quests for your zone like barrens and sort them by level.
---
It would be cool if there was an addon for wowhead that allowed you to see what quests each of your characters had completed for the zone.  Which ones remained and what quest level they were, what was the min level, are they sharable, and the list of exp and item rewards.
---
&gt; WoW Classic uses a modified Legion client (7.3.5)
---
Well it's 8.x based now but the API is roughly the same so most addons that worked in Legion also works in BfA.
---
That and he’s a blood elf.
---
Well, first, you can't enter AV as lvl 40. Secondly, AV was a mix of lvl 50 at the start. Later on, more will be 60. Lvl 58 is a good medium, even for an AV in phase 6. There will be many players under lvl 60.
---
Also, at lvl 58 I think you have ALL TRAINED skills and spells. I might be wrong, but I think I am not.
---
What is missing is the last 2 talent points, but that will be a minimal impact for testing.
---
&gt; If you just want a relaxed, chill raid group you should probably be fine with "non viable" specs.
---
I was in a guild like this during vanilla.  I don't think they ever managed to complete MC, and UBRS was a struggle.
---
It's a catch-22.  If you're geared or skilled, build doesn't matter much, if you're just hoping to breeze through content because everyone says it's easy and you don't plan on putting effort into improving your play or getting good gear through other means, you're probably going to need all the help your spec could give.
---
Sorry, it's meant to replace memory for the one creating the path, and replace thinking and memory for those consuming it. The SHARING OVER THE INTERNET part could be called a tool, I suppose. Concepts man...

Unless this gets changed, I'm not rolling a Mage anymore. CoC kiting was my favourite thing to do in vanilla. This isn't some minor thing like being able to move your characters around on the select scrren. This is a HUGE change that fundamentally alters the way the game can be played.
---
This shit is NOT vanilla.
---
You joke, but it seems a lot of us got two invites.
---
Zylo &lt;3 He really makes wpvp fun and his forum posts were always pure gold. I got to be part of Zylo's Hand years later but it's one of the most memorable times I had in WoW. I hope we will bump into him on classic aswell.
---
How does one persons opinion make all the people playing a certain class in a video game make you look bad?
---
Is your real world identity tied to a mage, more than say a friend or brother?
---
Yeah that doesn't make sense because p2 doesn't increase a raid tier... so what, your saying 7-8 months from launch to bwl in p3? Fat chance.
---
They are better than BWL weapons due to being slower they are guaranteed as is the rest of the armor gear that is bis until naxx and late AQ for some and by the time BWL launches if they follow the same release periods, you have your first two R14.
---
It's an insane advantage for AQ having all your melees wielding R14 weapons. It's not like you get one equivalent from BWL each reset. We got two swords from chromaggus for the entire vanilla. We had 8 rogues.
---
No way can I pass up OG Barrens or OG IF, Elwynn forest, Goldshire etc.
---
So I'll roll an Orc Shaman and a human mage. 👍
---
In beta at 38, have still never done a single STV quest.
---
lol communicating isn’t your strong suit? Go to your safe space, cause other peoples words online make me feel bad haha
---
You'll have addons like that. They'll be called something else and be much more modern but the functionality will exist.
---
It does if you spec IMP Faerie fire, probably what you're recalling, its in the feral tree I think. Good for bear pulling in TBC.  
---
edit: imp fearie fire causes it to do dmg - IIRC
---
Guys don't meme-spec shame.
---
This is probably a joke but I just meant launching both at the same time so I can farm mounts on one monitor and level to 60 on the other :)
---
You are not in the beta TO PLAY THE GAME. You are for TESTING the game.
---
So, please, before whining about playing a beta (which is for TESTING), be happy you actually have ACCESS to Classic beta.
---
I want YOU (and other beta testers) to actually TEST the game, for the millions of us that can't. 
---
I am actually happy that the beta server will be close when AV beta server goes live...because people like you would rather kill some crap in ZF to get their lvl 40 BiS (which will be ERASED anyway) instead of TESTING the game.
---
So, shut up, and do your JOB as a beta TESTER.
---
&gt; but it's obviously BC from the second line onward.
---
I didn't remember the text by heart until I put it on, and it was the first one of his I heard.
---
Warriors weren't just tanks in retail vanilla tho, fury was nuts post BWL.
---
Oh right im sorry i answered too fast, my mistake, i agree with you
---
No but you can install Questie if you want. It does the jobb well enough.
---
Yeah! Same with getting to ungoro, feralas and silithus. But then again flying to menethil to get the theramore boat isn’t so bad either.
---
Makes sense, thank you. It's kind of like how the app works right now right? I can't log into the app if in on wow
---
The entire reason I got into wow was because I loved orcs, so this hasn’t been an issue for me
---
Kind of a bummer but I guess it's not that big of a deal
---
Are you implying you dont need to constaantly farm for mats? :D You will need materials allll the time to create consumables and items. You absolutly did use pre-60 gear for a looong time..
---
No?
---
I didn’t even ask a question.
---
Just gotta take the time to find the right gamers.  The shit ones seem everywhere now, but they were there in Vanilla, too.  Just had to weed them out of your runs.
---
Thanks for the response! Follow up question: are there any specific difficulties these classes would have while leveling?
---
No one on Method has played Classic before though.(It's a joke relax, losers)  Also if Kungen comes back then RIP Method.
---
Oof, youre special.  Thank the reddit gods for the block option.
---
This is the REAL one?  OK wow omg I better watch this one then!
---
They already did above!
---
Whoops.  I was thinking BWL was p2.  Forgot P2 was was the world bosses and DM.  I think 6-8 weeks is probably right for that.
---
Hunter
---
A fair criticism. However you can compare old raid videos to the same boss on private servers and usually it yield the same result.
---
Example. Warrior in 2006 vs Druid on armor cap on private server:  [https://i.imgur.com/nxCiLCZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/nxCiLCZ.png)
---
Or just be a Druid
---
The vast majority of alliance priests will be dwarves, I'm planning to roll a female dwarf (because why not, if you're going to be ugly, go all the way)
---
There is a survey on the right side (Ctrl F Survey Results) that has a bunch of information from a large sample size.
---
They didn't go wrong- they did exactly what they needed to do - I see no other way they could have released expansions other than what they did.
---
It's just that vanilla was the only experience where a 100% mount speed mattered and that plays into wpvp and economy. 
---
Outside of those 2 things you have 1 thing, pve - wows pve has been the best for the past 15 years, now we get to have all 3 again.
---
I would like to add that the first 20 levels of a rogue suck. You die a lot and don't start getting all your cool utilities and tricks until 20. But soon you're in your 40s and start thinking: Hell yea, this kicks ass.
---
As for mage: They are VERY popular on my server. Probably the most popular. Frost mages farming everywhere and they love it. Having said that, I could never go back to sitting down and drinking. Working extensively with mana and being able to conjure my own food kills the fun of First Aid and Cooking required if you're gonna play a rogue.
---
I say play both and see which one you like. It's a good reason to jump on a that which shall not be said type of server. Test out which one you wanna do in preparation for Classic.
---
If that is the result of a 1.12 AV, then both sides are making dedicated effort to have a turtle game.
---
I've noticed that when I hamstring a mob and try to run away they are able to hit me from much further away than they realistically should. It COULD be because of lag since I'm in the EU but it has happened enough times that I've started to notice.
---
Right, but items like this were also updated in TBC. I can't remember what patch this one got spell power in, but I thought a lot of the caster items were base stats only until 2.3.
---
And there are clearly still problems. They added 60 new quests to Dustwallow Marsh in patch *2.3* in order to fix quest droughts in the level 30 to 40 range. That was *with* the improved leveling speed. If they were having issues then then there definitely will be issues now.
---
https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150
---
That's what I'm thinking too :) quick p2 and then p3 early 2020 :)
---
Yeah pretty much, with what they have said + all the hype going on around Classic I think it very likely NA and EU will get a RpPvP server each.
---
Yes. Exactly.
---
People today don't have time to read...if it's longer than a fucking tweet.
---
Man, so many people will learn some valuable LIFE lessons when they will play Classic.
---
You prolly built 0/21/30 which is a viable build with higher Agi, and Wyvern is just strait bad so even if you wanted to be Surv you never take it.
---
Haha you should practice communication. Blocking will work on Reddit, but assuming you leave your moms basement, you will be exposed to all sorts of opinions. 
---
It would be better to learn how to deal with ideas you don’t like.
---
Definitely want seal fate daggers for a viable pve spec that is fine in pvp.
---
The irony of posting an image like this
---
This. You are beta testers, not early access participants.
---
2. yet so many MMO's do it   
---
3. A lot of people do  
---
4. Because this is not a PVP game, this is an MMORPG. Literally having PVP gear with resilience means that a PVP player only needs to sit in town, not move an inch and get the absolute best PVP gear in the game from a little instanced room that he can teleport to. Thats sounds like league of legends not an MMORPG
---
I know, right? :D
---
Classic is dead people. It's over.
---
Move along.
---
I suspect if Classic is successful/profitable enough, Blizz might eventually invest in and create a "Classic:TBC" release as a separate game. But i doubt this would happen for many years, and it completely depends on the success of Classic.
---
i just wish I could so I can collect tmog on live and grind to 60 on my other monitor. But if I can't it's not a big loss
---
So you didn't follow anything, you watch kill vids.
---
53 people attacking the same mob, and only one person gets the tag. Sounds fantastic.
---
Half the zones in BC need a flying mount. This won’t work. I agree that flying was a bad idea. It hurts world PvP a LOT. But you can’t take flying out of BC without fundamentally changing zone structure.
---
This is true to an extent, but it will never match the destruction an expansion pack does. Nothing in Vanilla mattered at that point. None of the dungeons in Vanilla mattered, from BRD to Naxx. Professions became useless until Outland. Vanilla reputations didn't matter. Most importantly, the leveling stopped mattering too. The game transforms from your character starting at 1 and growing to 60 to simply starting at 1 and then starting again at 58. Nothing between levels 1-57 matters in the end game, whereas in Vanilla you can start getting your Pre-raid BiS gear starting in the late 40s iirc.  
---
I'm not saying TBC is a bad game. As it stands, TBC did a *lot* right and even a lot of things better than Vanilla and I can easily see why people would enjoy having TBC servers, but I consider it a fact that TBC kills Vanilla dead.
---
This is something that worries me. Classic will have a closed economy. Guilds like that will strangle a server to death by sucking in all resources and outdoor bosses.
---
The biggest killer was all the things they did to reduce the social aspect of the game.  Group finder + making the instances way too easy completely changed the leveling process.  Instead of trying to find friends to grind dungeons with, you just pressed a button then face rolled through the content without talking to anyone.
---
0.1% to be more precise.
---
Human mage &gt; gnome mage. 
---
Has a better RPG feel, better animations, better jokes, isnt annoying... etc.
---
I have always loved silverpine I always go through that zone when I play horde.
---
&gt;Classic does not equal vanilla.
---
yes it does.
---
 [https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/wowclassic](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/wowclassic) 
---
it literally says "the game as it was before any of its expansions"
---
Except people who ask for WotLK want to once again experience WotLK, they don't really care about stuff that made Classic great. If they cared they'd play Classic instead. Not to mention that the entire greatness of Classic is rather subjective
---
I really love how Classic fans use the same "You think you do, but you don't" argument that Blizzard used against Classic servers in a first place.
---
What about the people who don't have phones? 
---
/s obviously?
---
Except that most people won't instantly clear the content.  Including you.  If half your raid is meme-specs, then people start to get rightfully upset.   They ask themselves, "How far COULD we have gone, if these leechers had a real spec?".   
---
No one wants to play a full prot or healing spec, but people make that sacrifice to raid.   When I am holy, and I look over at your ridiculous meme ret spec, then I get upset.   You are doing half the damage of the worst rogue in the raid.  You are useless.
---
Fishing, herbalism and alchemy can be quite profitable and fun if you like to go around the world. I marked on the map my spots for resto shaman "work day". This excludes mobs farming and doesn't cover every possible supply chain available with those professions... deep resto or other healer that doesn't want to respec for DPS capabilities.
---
* STV shore is quite good for fishing. Lot of people go Tanaris, while here it's surprisingly quiet
---
* check for people to rez next to denser pack of quest mobs on the shore...
---
* lake and river in STV provides greater sagefish, more rumsey and for levelers - wreckage pools
---
* Oily is always needed for FAPs while early on Firefin can be used for smaller fire protection potions, later on for the greater firepower potions. Stonescale eel for flasks or greater stoneshield potions, also rumsey black label as a stamina beverage
---
* from STV quick fly to Swamp of Sorrows for liferoot, blindweed and fadeleaf
---
* Fadeleaf is needed for shadow oil which is then in demand for multiple shadowy potions
---
* Liferoot can be turned in high quantities into "smaller" nature protection potion - sells if greater potion gets expensive or when people farm stuff
---
* blasted lands have some Sungrass, groomsblood - usually for stat potions, flask of titans
---
* Up in the north I go to TM and from there to ruins of Alterac and around them
---
* Wintersbite is needed for frost oil (quest turn in, freezing things, etc.)
---
* Grave moss for shadow oil and shadow protection potions
---
* wild steelbloom seems to be in demand directly or as a invis pots
---
* check for people to rez around elite ogres or near yeti cave
---
* WPL/EPL for always needed dreamfoil, chances for black lotus
---
* Plaguebloom for mageblood/moongose
---
* Arthas tears / gift of arthas are cheap but tanks like to use them
---
* Going to the other continent - winterspring for icecap for major mana potion and chances for black lotus
---
* Felwood sometimes can be visited
---
* Tanaris as a source of firebloom for greater firepower potion for fire mages
---
* Silithus sometimes for dreamfoil and chances for black lotus (sometimes spawns in hives)
---
That’s true. 
---
It might actually be smarter doing it the way you said, to create longevity for the game, as opposed to my suggestion that would be great up front and then possibly fade out.
---
Great tool! Anyone wanna critique my Warlock Improved Voidwalker Rush build?
---
https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=warlock&amp;talents=BSBTDmDnDoDkDlDwDxDyCyCzCACICYBUBVBWCTCBCCCGCHCfCgCJCKByCNCMCUCVCW
---
Yeah.  6-8 weeks for p2, then another 6-8 weeks for p3.  Not sure after that though.
---
Does anyone remember an onyxia video that played the song clubbed to death and then ended with book boom boom let me hear ya say wayo?  I used to love that one and I just can't seem to find it.  I have a feeling it was lost.
---
horde: hillsbrad farm/mine
---
alliance: duskwood graveyard
---
Dude, I still have mine!!! And I have all the old expansion faces from vanilla to wotlk!
---
&gt;by the time BWL launches if they follow the same release periods
---
hardly, as pvp ranks are phase 3 as bwl is.
---
so by the time people will get their rank14 weapons people will already have cleared 13 resets of BWL
---
&gt;We got two swords from chromaggus for the entire vanilla. We had 8 rogues.
---
You also didn't kill Nefarian first week, and then farmed it with multiple raids funneling gear to mains.
---
You'd have to pay for two subscriptions
---
Sounds good. Thanks a bunch
---
What's "horrible" about the icon?
---
Fat people need lovin too!
---
Most of my addons are just UI improvements so I can put together the same type of UI that I've grown accustomed to over the last 14 years. It's impossible to move elements to a different position at this point because my eyes automatically look for them where they used to be, it's like muscle memory :)
---
Other than that I suppose I'll get a AH addon, a swing timer, enemy castbar addon, LFG if that turns out to be successful, HealComm, dot tracker, questhelper, dps meter, threat meter and weakauras.
---
considerably higher, as the bar of entry will seem easier, now that people aren't on dial up and have reasonable voice coms without having to pay for a ventrilo server, I would expect a large number of the player base to do MC, Ony, but that number will die off as time progresses, AQ and to a greater extent Naxx are massive time / gold sinks.
---
For resilience, if you want to make sure only skilled people can get it, then you can lock it behind arena ratings.  I agree it's weird that you can afk to decent pvp gear, but I don't think the answer is making raids the only way to get the best gear.
---
Cushin for pushin
---
Completely Agree. Yes this mechanic is a non vanilla thing which completely destroys the game. Range means everything in vanilla and especially when you're kiting.
---
You're in for a treat in Classic. The word "community" started and died in Vanilla, and will be back in Classic.
---
If you think TBC had a community...well, that wasn't even a tenth of what a Vanilla community was.
---
So, you're in for a treat in Classic.
---
“World of Warcraft Classic is a faithful recreation of the original World of Warcraft”
---
So not exactly equal, but whatever no point in getting lost in the details. 
---
What I’m trying to get across is that blizzard could have equates “Classic” with Vanilla Style TBC and that would have been the norm.
---
I tried 10 mins to get a Summ of  how many in total pick which class on A and H... cant get it to work on mobile.
---
And you can do none of that shit in Classic.
---
You make a toon, you're stuck with it.
---
Don't like it? Reroll.
---
oh you're right the lvl 60 bracket was only for WSG and AB
---
| Just remember that this probably won’t happen ever again.
---
I wouldn't have a problem if they came out with a fresh server every year or two.Most people who have played through Vanilla will agree that the game up to BWL is the most fun, at least with progressive itemization - When everyone gets into the 1.10 gear, the game starts to become more faceroll.
---
After the events of Pandaria and Wod, I don't think I can ever go back to seeing Thrall as anything but a little bitch.
---
It says a lot about the current state of gaming when this is probably the most anticipated PC game of the year.
---
I'd encourage you to look into Frostadomus farming videos. That man has played Classic on private servers since before Classic came out and knows everything about everything.
---
I'm still disappointed as hell that WoW Classic has no aspirations for game balance beyond the busted 1.12 patch that they corrected nicely in 2.0.
---
Since the beta is mostly streamers, they're all tryharding and won't queue in to pvp matches unless they're all in BiS gear because they don't want to lose at all. Because of this, a 40v40 would never fill with people and would be impossible to test. 
---
Yet another problem with using a beta as a marketing tool instead of an actual test.
---
You'd have a hard time convincing most RPers you participated in killing even VanCleef. Generally speaking, the unspoken RP rule is that your character should, in essence, be somewhat like the supporting NPCs you see around. They might be a veteran of the Third War, and be an extremely proficient fighter. Maybe they even participate in Arathi Highlands skirmishes or the War of the Shifting Sands, but dungeons, and especially raids, are generally speaking done by the nameless hero (meaning not the character).
---
Because RP is a community storytelling platform, if you're the one who kills C'thun and you run into someone you don't know who also killed C'thun, your stories become mutually exclusive now. You cannot acknowledge that person's character without invalidating your own. Of course you can still go and kill C'thun in game, but acknowledging that in character is frowned upon. In the same vein, nobody is going to come across your corpse in Moonbrook and call you a god-modder for corpse running back and appearing healthy in front of them out of nowhere. People pretty clearly separate gameplay from RP in most cases.
---
Rule of thumb, if there's enough bodies there that your character being present wouldn't affect the outcome, and there is a stated lore outcome for the encounter that won't cause your character to conflict with someone else, it's probably okay. Big battles, the Stormwind Riots, small situations in Westfall/Duskwood/STV. There's a little more to it than that but you can avoid most conflicts just by following it.
---
TBC had better class design, better loot design, and much better raiding.
---
It was. And then you realise the fronts didn't change at all. Felt like loading a save game and sometimes you saw the same names from yesterday xd
---
Any area that can net you about 8-10g per hour at level 30 is going to be a great spot. This isn't including RNG drops of course.
---
There are some keys spots that can probably be found on youtube, but in general you just want to explore and find an area that you find to be efficient for YOU.

I've read about Hunter too for ease of play and leveling, but they aren't too good for PvP or End game content?
---
Picking between MAGE and HUNTER. Give me reasons to pick one or the other.
---
Interested in world PvP and raiding. Don't necessarily need to top the meters, but do want the ability to see various raids and gather gear to help in PvP. Worried mage could be overly saturated and need to compete with priests and warlocks for gear, but do offer more ability to see PvE content. Worried hunters would be left on the sideline more often in raiding, but have more opportunity to get gear with less competition? Going horde FWIW.
---
Just wondering, do they blacklist battle.net but not reddit at your workplace?
---
Yep, that was basically the norm. And when I say the norm, I mean for most raiding guilds, not only top hardcore guilds.
---
If you didn't show up in time...this is disrespect for your guild mates. Their TIME is as valuable as your's...except is the time of 39 people vs the time of 1. It doesn't have to do with anything else, but the respect you have to give to other 39 people, the moment you accepted to be part of a raiding guild.
---
These guys aren't supposed to be flagged, similar to how the Tiragarde keep marines aren't supposed to be flagged, or the dwarves in the southern barrens. Private servers were wrong
---
&gt; Warlock is notorious for being hopeless in pvp until they get the later raid gear.
---
couldn't be more wrong
---
Very nice
---
I'd buy that. Even pay up to $5. Then clean it and keep it on my desk. Not to actually USE, but it'd look nice.
---
I’m not sure how you can call the alliance racist with a straight face. As if there is no reason for their hatred. The orcs were part of a demon army that invaded Azeroth. A demon army that would have killed every human in the eastern kingdoms of it had the chance. They aligned themselves with pure evil and somehow the alliance is the bad racists for putting them in camps and giving them a chance to come down off their demon blood high, when they could have slaughtered them all. The fact is orcs invaded Azeroth as agents of the burning legion and they should be glad their existence was tolerated at all.
---
While I personally would enjoy a better balanced vanilla, that's not what Classic is trying to be, and that's not what most people want. So I can't really support it.
---
I love real vanilla, so I don't need changes.
---
Yea, that was the only thing I said.
---
He is the hero we need!
---
It's not supposed to be balanced. The endless balancing is a massive part of the pvp issue today.
---
Yeah, but then you'd be playing on a PvE server
---
&gt;What I’m trying to get across is that blizzard could have equates “Classic” with Vanilla Style TBC and that would have been the norm.
---
sure but they didn't. the demand isn't there. you're not actually making an argument
---
One of the best PvP classes at endgame when played well. During early content a good Hunter is very good DPS. They stop being as competitive for DPS in the later raids, but they still bring utility to raids.
---
Thats giving far too much credit to me back then. I was prob 5/11/33 at that point, long before I looked online about talent builds for level 60.
---
"World Firsts" ♿
---
You should have cried when Blizzard posted about 14% parry...that was the moment when private server meta died, because of heavily undertunned raid bosses.
---
But you wanted Vanilla, right? Well, this is Vanilla : Protection Warrior as tanks, Fury Warriors as DPS.
---
I was a casual WoTLK player, I would say most of my time was spent in Vanilla and TBC.  Im totally with you on the TBC was the start of the downfall... as soon as I was getting green gear to replace my t2/3 gear on my priest something felt off.  I had to roll an entirely new character to cope with it.  The dailies started out as a good idea, as we did versions of them as repeatable quests in vanilla, however it felt forced.  People would tell me "remember to do your dailies", it felt like work. Those "quality of life" elements just made it feel like "real life" elements, and I don't want those in my RPG's.
---
$10 on eBay, $14 new. Might be fun to pick up. Does it work very well?
---
Tip: Press share next to the thumbs up and thumbs down, and check the box that says "start at"
---
Futher suggestions would be to follow the guidelines for buttons in a bar (the top one), maybe make it an custom actionbar (assuming your are not cause of the back button). Add a FAB to reset current branch. And some of the suggestions mentioned by other people sounds amazing. Level counter and such. Keep up the good work.  
---
edit: spelling
---
I hear you and I get the edit, but to kind of further your case a little more - I’m led to believe that they are finishing it all up soon. AV testing and then they’d probably do raid testing in house, to keep it fresh for those to hit a 60 experience again and have it authentic rather than fleeting. Idk though it’s just my 2 cents
---
I mean that is exactly what fighting for 10 minutes without anyone dying feels like, and it is not fun.
---
What if a random character size was in the original Vanilla code and just no one noticed at the time. :o Talk about some hidden flavor.
---
While leveling you don't need to be specced into Resto to heal, but you will want to keep another set of gear. Otherwise just play enhancement and smack stuff with him.
---
Elemental becomes viable around level 40. Kargoz has an extended guide on shaman leveling if you're interested.
---
Horde doesn't have better racials than alliance.  Stoneskin and escape artist are insanely good.
---
A horrible, overpriced drink.
---
Thank God and Blizzard that Phase 1 won't have any of this.
---
Both dungeons and raids.
---
Have had DPS in dungeons as early as RFC that are incredibly toxic and arrogant.
---
Hope there will be some Oogas to annoy these speedlevelers.
---
Just do it. Classic is becoming the most popular game on Twitch, just go all-in with a decent gaming rig &amp; stream full-time.
---
[battle.net](https://battle.net) is flagged as 'gaming'
---
oh I do not see red x next to a spec.  Maybe an issue with my IE browser or antivirus.  I've found it by tooltip, but on my pc I don't get the image or alt text of the button.
---
Hey, any reason is acceptable.
---
The human/dwarf mobs in Mulgore, Durotar and the Barrens were never flagged. They were not hostile to Alliance characters, but attacking them did not flag Horde.
---
Alliance players could go to those areas, buff and heal the mobs, and trick the Horde questers into flagging themselves through various means. But you couldn't just show up and murder the questing lowbies.
---
Alliance warrior vs Horde warrior? I feel that being close to Black Rock is a huge quality of life improvement at 60.
---
Are you trolling?
---
These are good points to consider. Thank you for the input
---
pull out good old excel if it's important to you
---
Counterpoint - I can go to work, come home, lift at my home gym, have a scoop of protein powder and then plop down in from of my multi-screen setup and watch Asmongold playing some classic WoW and not worry about some fat nerd with more time to spend than me, because it isn't me playing and is instead someone else who have enough time to play. Vicarious vanilla WoW PvP is the best version of vanilla WoW PvP in the modern era. I can have that running while playing Hearthstone in one window and having a podcast running in another. Bliss my friend.

---
So I'm gambling on WoW actually releasing on the 27th, I've taken that week off work and plan on rushing to 60. I will eventually level a tank because bad tanks make my soul hurt.
---
1) Roll a hunter, and compete to be among the first 100 to max level, then roll a warrior. 
---
2) Roll a warrior, and be among the first tanks to max level.
---
3) Slow down my leveling by boxing a Hunter/Warrior combo. 
---
The real question is, how much slower is grouping from 1-60 going to be?
---
1.12 av was not the super long av that everyone associates with vanilla, unfortunately
---
I booked off a full week for classic, and imo the first day is the most important. Not for leveling, at all, because it'll be a shit show. But for the experience. The experience of lag, of crashes, of chat being flooded.
---
At no point in Classic's existence will there be as many people online as day 1. I want to be there for it.
---
Got some evidence?
---
Yes you are 100% right. AB and WSG won't seem epic 15 years later.
---
How hard do you think vanilla content is? 
---
Do you really think there is a need to tryhard minmax to this level?
---
This is a great example. Thanks for the explanation
---
Now I have to find out which spell is most mana efficient for my shaman
---
My shaman is currently 34 and I have +23 healing
---
The fact that you're even worried about this at all shows that you've got the right priorities already. Keep doing whatever it is you want to achieve in life, but don't let that mindset control all of you... Entertainment is a fundamental need for humans, and spending an hour a day on playing a videogame is not going to prevent you from reaching any goal you set your mind to. Spending time on a game for entertainment and being a generally ambitious person are not mutually exclusive.
---
I would argue that going through the dark portal was the beginning of the attitude that the world doesn't matter.

The people you know are a very small minority. M+ is the best thing to come out of WoW in years. Aside from the MDI trying to make it an esport, that shit's weird.
---
TBC was the start of the shitshow,   
---
from level 20 - 60 leveling was way faster  
---
flying mounts was shit  
---
the daily quests in dungeons was just a chore, before you did anything you had to do dungeon daily because it was that good, and that was bad.  
---
arena was not that bad, but still I would rather watch a tourney of WSG with 10 level 60's instead of 2v2 that i have no clue of what is happening 80% of the time or some shit like that.  
---
preview content became useless really fast. Like why would you do preview raids if new items were so strong and easier to get a hold of?  
---
Horde was summed in one word = Blood elf, and I fucking hated it. And yes horde was a fucking lot stronger in tbc  
---
server pops when from like 55%A-45%H to 30%A-70%H  
---
Last but not least main city shared, I mean it is a fucking war, why the fuck would we share a main city? ffs
---
The AV realm will be up for only this weekend, so be sure to get your 1 AV game in!
---
Horde have Thunder Bluff though. Always found the place to be really relaxing and it's not car from Org
---
I'm not even playing the same class!  Bug testing for all the hunters so they can't blame bugs come launch.
---
Would you be able to make profiles that you can save and load as a reference like when we respec so we can just pull up a template on our phone and follow it instead? like instead of just 1 per class make a list that you can save and load to/from. That'd be awsome

If you are ignoring the effect of your choices than neither is "complex" you are just clicking a button randomly. 
---
Sure if we are just counting button clicks then clicking 51 times is in fact clicking more times than clicking 7 times but that not what the word complex means.
---
You can say I'm arguing in bad faith by quoting dictionary definitions and arguing semantics but the word complex has a definition which dont seem to understand. You can disregard the definition of the word and instead make up your own if you want but you're wrong.
---
for the arena and class design/balance for both PvP and PvE  (not perfect but my favorite and most fun)
---
Day?  I'm off all week.
---
There will be a TBC server option. With character copy.
---
But there will also be a Classic+ option in the same time. Also with character copy.
---
While there will also be permanent Classic realms.
---
Blizzard have to deliver both TBC and Classic+, and keep Classic realms as well, if they want to keep subs. And I think they want to keep subs.
---
We will see which one will be more popular : TBC or Classic+.
---
And it will end this debate once and for all.
---
It seems like it already has in private servers. I'm amazed how many people will flip out if you pull a "extra" group in a dungeon. Without fail every time the group bitches and I start cutting corners in pulling, the same damn dps who was complaining goes and butt pulls the group we skipped. &gt;&lt;
---
Not to mention the lengths people will go through to not kill anything. It's seriously 3 pulls to clear out under the bridge in scholo once you have the viewing room key, we do not need to do this weird FD dance every time.
---
I played PVP server from Classic and World PVP definitely took a dive in TBC. It did still happen but fights were easily avoided, particularly after a gank as you could easily get mounted.
---
It also led to more bullshit interactions whereby people would evade fighting by flying until the opportunity suited them with little counterplay available. 
---
It also removed geographical bottlenecks caused by terrain which would have provided opportunity for WPVP to arise organically (think the mountains near the Arena in STV)
---
As a Druid I did enjoy flying, and absolutely took advantage of the insta-cyclone the tank at Kazzak, gank and run until fly, gank in air and fly before hitting the ground, etc that came with it, but from a WPVP perspective it was cheesy as hell.
---
That said, I'm still not 100% decided on whether or not I'd like flying in TBC.
---
However one thing I do think that needs changing for TBC from a PVP perspective is ease of accessibility of PVP gear compared to the raiding counterparts. I'm not sure of the best "fix" for this issue but resilience not working against NPCs would be a good start.
---
When is the next stress test?
---
Sounds like retail is more of a fit for you
---
As someone who isn’t rolling night elf but really wants to get a nightsaber mount, thank you! Been dreading making that run since I decided to work toward Darnassus Exalted from level 1
---
Why go down the wrong path in the first place? Nah, screw BC and WOTLK, they should start by finishing the classic world if anything. It doesn't make any sense for them to just repeat the same mistakes.
---
I like how the name of every single region is outside the region it describes.
---
Keyword: trivial. Doing a 0/22/29 spec for imp. weapon totems in phase 1 will just be gimping yourself and your raid harder than necessary.
---
Wow, really nice work!
---
I think cdew does
---
Chinese all of them?? such a mess should be reported to Mr.Trump.  
---
From what I know about herbalism from other games: there will be tons of weed of all kinds in your bag. Bags in WoW are of ridiculous volume. Hunter sacrifices 1 bag...suspense...
---
In fairness getting bis gear involves a shitload of “testing”. I can sympathize with people who don’t want to PvP at a big disadvantage. The best approach for BG testing is pre-made characters, which is why Blizz are doing it.
---
Nice map.
---
I think there are a few spots missing. Deviants can be fished outside of wailing caverns as well can't they? They may be fishable in a few of the oasis pools in the barrens.
---
I laughed way to hard at this - might have to try stealing this idea!
---
why are you starting with 2 points in corruption and then not going the full 5 points in it anytime soon?
---
It's really not negligible at all. In a pure mitigation set, you have 0% hit chance from gear. So you have 8% chance to miss every ability. In a mixed set , you can have many mitigation pieces and have 8% hit gear. This means you have 0% chance to miss your ability. This is actually very impactful for your threat and your consistency.  Inconsistency is very bad for threat and limits your dps. Let's say a dps is 1k threat below me. If I have 0% hit, he doesn't know if my next threat ability will land or not. If he casts another frostbolt, he might pull aggro then. So he has to wait. If I have 8% hit, he KNOWS that my next ability will land. It makes things predictable and allows your dps to do much more dmg. Never mind the increased crit, AP, you get as well.
---
Also, as the user above said, using stoneshield potion is essentially the same as like 2-3 mitigation pieces. Vael also mainly does fire dmg so if you pick up the UBRS buff that gives 83 Fire Resist you basically are wearing like 2-3 pieces of fire resist gear. Finally, inspiration is a priest talent that increases overall armor by 30% when you crit a heal. One priest just spam flash heal low rank for crits to keep it up.  If you had tanks in full defense gear not using these insane mitigation buffs when you killed Vael, then you can easily see how you can get much more threat gear on without dying to Vael, right?
---
Threat is very important for Vael in particular because he gives everyone max rage and mana and your warriors will want to pop recklessness and spam max rage executes. in full mitigation set, they can barely cast execute on the boss. This makes the boss die MUCH slower.
---
Hey man, sorry lol. It’s just so great! I want everyone to see it!
---
I spilt milk on mine and it died
---
Shamans and then Warriors are the most picked, according to a recent survey.
---
Classic is going to have two HUGE drops in population. One a month or two in when folks realise they don't like slow leveling, long dungeons, and struggling to pay for mounts. And another after they clear Naxx for the first time.
---
I've been playing on EverQuest classic servers for the last few years and it's the same every time, WoW won't be any different.
---
If I have an active subscription, can I just download the client somewhere? Or do I need to be invited?
---
Didn't Shadowmeld behave like a vanish in Vanilla? If so, then being able to vanish in combat, is pretty great. It can interrupt spells, and you can Smeld -&gt; Cat -&gt; Stealth and run away during combat.
---
Wouldn't be opposed to it - it doesn't really have an impact on gameplay at all like you said.
---
Those stats simply don't benefit my gameplay in anyway. They're useless numbers, in my opinion.
---
Anything gaming related is blocked at my company...but reddit is not.  You can get an RSS feed or something to be able to read stuff like wowhead and mmo-champ...but that's what my phone is for, I guess.

---
That's the big thing. Method's probably got 60-80 people at the ready to funnel everything they can onto 40 toons for months on end.
---
The gameplay is great on both sides anyway.
---
When discussing this before didn't they say they'd be interested in doing it for BWL onward because they know MC will be down to leveling and they just don't have enough experience. On top of that Method members seem to be all over the place, some playing eu and some US , unless this is a different group led by Sco and others in the guild.
---
Honestly take this with a pinch of salt. I wouldn't be surprised if Sco has been in talks with a top Private server guild to play under Method when classic comes out.
---
Flying also makes farming stupidly easy, and the economy goes belly up, because inflation is rampart..
---
I started TBC with almost 3,000g, from Vanilla.
---
At the end of TBC I had almost 800k gold, 2 guild banks with mats worth another 200k+.
---
And it was possible because of flying mounts.My Jewelcrafter and Blacksmith needed a shiload of ores, and mining with a flying mount was 20 time faster, at least. No need to kill anything, just swoop in. No need to avoid anything, just fly above.
---
Pretty much everyone I knew in TBC was 100 times richer compared to Vanilla.
---
Flying is A DISASTER for an MMO, and we have to thank TBC for that.
---
I would prefer less tools/addons as possible to work in Classic. I want to enjoy Vanilla not Classic full of addons/tools.
---
IU ones are fine obviously since they don't impact immersion.
---
Vanilla trees are a much better skinner box than current trees that is true. You get something every level even if it is tremendously minor. But you did not have more choice. The choices in the vanilla trees are very obvious or meaningless BFA trees change how you play your character, which traits you want, and what stats you want. As I've said before in this thread I dont think my raiding build changed in TBC or WotLK in bfa I change my talents twice a night. In TBC I had no choice there was one correct build in BFA I can make choices on a fight by fight basis
---
&gt; Since this is a huge nerf to the rep grind, I hope this won't be possible from the beginning. 
---
... This wasn't a nerf. It was the only way to get certain factions to exalted (like Darkspear for example). There was no way for an forsaken to get exalted rep with Darkspear until those cloth turn-ins were added. Even then it was a massive grind. Also as of the stress-test the npcs for the cloth turn ins are there.
---
I've leveled a few shaman in vanilla and you can heal 5 man dungeons as any spec, just make sure you get int/spirit gear for a healing set. Also use downranking for Mana efficiency.
---
Most guilds wont clear MC and Ony as easily as everyone on this sub is saying. The first time the average guild rolls up to MC and Ony’s lair there will be 5 players that arent attuned!
---
Even once the raids are cleared gearing up 40 folks takes many many runs. RNG can be tough as well - some guilds will have 3 TFs in the works for their tanks after 20 clears (5 months of MC runs), others will have 0 and still be desperately looking for one for their MT.
---
Core guild players will also understand that just bc they have enough gear to be ready for BWL you really need at least 30-35 people in good enough gear - gotta take care of the more casual folks in the guild and replace folks that disappear.
---
Only guilds that have 35 core players will be tired of the game before phase 3, and even then they’ll still be working bc they’ll have been denied a TF or have only seen one t2 mage helm in ony and they need 5, etc etc
---
For some reason to this date it was my favourite bot on the market.
---
Careful my friend, the #nochange cult is always looming in the shadows with cloroform in head patiently waiting for posts like these. Tread lightly
---
This will be a feature in the game, as it is a 1.12 client and was already well implemented.
---
I mean no shit? Method has multiple big streamers ofc they should be avoided. On top of that its very likely most the BFA guild an't involved in this unless its BWL and onward.
---
Frost nova only has a range of 8 yards.
---
That's a very juvenile thought process. This is a targeted testing environment.  It has no effect on the static beta environment.
---
The internet is really really great.
---
You can keep stats, you just have to do it yourself.  You can spreadsheet your AH gains or whatever if that is important enough to you.
---
The Ulduar song was by Cranius &amp; Summergale. 
---
But man I loved Nyhm's Ni hao and the mage song.
---
I'm not here to argue, just try not to confuse Unpopular Opinion with beating a dead horse
---
2 - Even when you get to naxx in vanilla you will still go to MC for something and there are some items that you carry along the way, tell me how is that a problem.  
---
3 - It is a huge problem, basically the game shrunk to a few areas and you had no reason to be no where other that those areas, which killed the "world"  
---
4 - Because it is a MMORPG, not a 2v2 or 3v3 game, what you are saying is that a pvp doesn't need to know anything about the game other than fighting against other player. Vanilla forced people to be PvE'rs and do PvP while at it, you would fall behind and would not be able to win against other players if you didn't play the game.
---
Bots quest nowadays FYI :P

Creed - Revenge of the Windfury (orc shaman) https://youtu.be/DLrrXaTq1Yc
---
Is there still any links to the old maths that showed Ctun and Hakkar been impossible? Would actually be interested in checking it out.
---
Everyone ends up in Westfall, because the longest, best rewarding low-level quest chain is there.  It also has the Alliance's first dungeon.
---
What classes do you think benefit most from being a given faction? For instance, Warlocks benefit from being Horde to not have to play against Undead and perhaps Rogues for not having to fight 25% stun resist Orcs. Are there any other apparent ones or that are highly impactful?
---
I raided hardcore from Vanilla to WoD with the same guild, and MoP was *easily* the best expansion for raiding, not close.
---
You can't just wave your hands and say "nostalgia" to explain away everything. Correlation is not the same as causation.
---
why?  We won't be able to play the other realms, so we'll have nothing to do besides this.  Might as well have some fun with it...this way scum Alliance can't be a bunch of sissies and never queue up.
---
They’ll practice for sure. Not very hard to set up your own local server for the guild to practice undergeared speedruns.
---
thanks for the informative reply! then i see RP servers in WoW isnt for me.
---
2 points brings Corruption cast down to 1.2 secs, which is just under the GCD of 1.3 sec. So there isn't a major DPS boost from the final 3 points because it isn't actually allowing you to cast more spells faster. It does forgo instant cast corruption while moving, but that is a minor issue in PvE situations as you can usually stand still while casting for 1.2 secs. This prioritizes getting improved Voidwalker and then Suppression so that you have some hit chance which is a larger DPS boost than the last 3 points of corruption.
---
The above may be bad, which is why I am open to critique
---
Whatchoo talkin bout Willis my six year old fully intends to level up a mage with me starting on day 1. I was 23 during vanilla beta. Now I get to do it all over again with my favorite person.
---
I thought so. I remember doing A LOT of fishing outside of WC back in the day. I was pretty sure deviant farming was the reason.
---
Normally you can't cast it in combat. Quick WoWhead check reminded me it stacks with Prowl though, making you very hard to detect.
---
Shaman and paladins aren't rare , unless you looking at the total population.   If you look at just one faction, which is the metric you should look at for scarcity, then they're not rare at all.  Shaman will be among the top played class on the horde faction in classic.  Same for Paladins on the alliance.
---
&gt; Why in particular?
---
- Rated arenas
---
- No need to PvE for PvP (I mean, you still do, but it's way less needed)
---
- Heroic Dungeons are an interesting challenge
---
- All specs are at least viable
---
- Raids are really fun and engading
---
- An actual use for reputation
---
I hate the flying mounts tho
---
Missing out on instant corruption until 29 will really increase the time for your mob juggling. I’d suggest picking it up earlier
---
Friday will start AV testing. They will create a new server and all characters will be lv58 with appropriate gear, gold, and mount.
---
All other servers will be unavailable while this is active.
---
Depends on matchup. Against lock? Sure. Anything with a stun? Orc is better.
---
It a bug to be sure as the guys in southern barrens don’t flag you.
---
Ah. I wonder when they changed it. I played Nelf druid in vanilla and stopped until WoD and in WoD I used it as an in-combat vanish, but I can't recall if I did that 15 years ago lol
---
It is the 1.12 verison.
---
Fair points, wish them luck. 
---
To be honest, since there's almost no mechanical challenge, world firsts will probably be simply achieved by a hardcore guild that practiced enough and has the best setup and luck with drops.
---
&gt;The problem with adding more content to level 60 is a lot of people will never see it. Many people won't ever clear Naxx,
---
MOST people will be in BWL, while top guilds will farm Naxx.
---
You can't simply postpone new content with 6+ months because MOST guild CANNOT go past BWL, no matter how hard they try.
---
This is a REAL MMO : people that are skilled AND invest more time should always be rewarded more than the ones who are less skilled AND invest less time.
---
I won't have ANY problems if most guilds will be in BWL or AQ40 and top guilds will farm Tier 3.5 or Tier 4 in post-Naxx content.
---
You have to understand that there aren't enough hardcore players...and without hardcore players, games will get stale VERY FAST.
---
There got to be a balance. New content MUST be added when a certain % of the player base is slowing down their game time, either because they are very good, and are farming high-end content, either because they aren't good, and are stuck in mid-end content.
---
I won't be surprised if Sco has contact one of the top private server guilds about playing under Method. I highly doubt the BFA roster are going to get together to race. If they do its 100% from BWL onward
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
You can't summon into Instances in Classic and you need Warlock + 2 People which is 3/5 of your Party who need to run to the Instance.
---
Also a complete fucking waste of time. You can’t change an entire culture with a single Reddit post because A. most people don’t read Reddit and B. People that are elitist on Reddit don’t care what you say and will be elitist still.
---
I interpreted it as a marketing/hype tactic.
---
https://i.imgur.com/HcreElo.gif
---
Can you remind me which version that is? I'm looking at patch notes but I see nothing about WF
---
3 - that's pretty much what happens at 60 anyways.  Are you walking around all the random low level areas at 60?  
---
4 - yeah so you don't need resilience to raid?  You don't have to pvp to pve.  But for some reason you think it's ok to force pve to pvp.
---
Sounds like a good plan. Maybe grind to 56-57 then go find the attunement quests. You can still grind while waiting for groups, and then you get into these instances when you get good gear and xp.
---
Thing is, everyone will be in the same boat, so getting groups will not be too tough.
---
The world first race was damn near always a thing. Sure it wasn't streamed but it was always around. Things change mate, mightn't like it but this is how it is now.
---
That's because Horde players don't breed
---
I'm not saying sell it. Keep it cause the sentimental value is worth much more.
---
Not *very* strong, as it's not a complete reset, and autoattack won't give you much threat and much rage (less than from a hit I'm sure). But it's a good point.
---
I really hope blizz makes a separate game for the people who want TBC.
---
I want classic to end with Naxx - nothing more added beyond that. No gear, no new raids, etc. Just a firm, hard ending point of having the best gear in the game that I can aim for.
---
Happy for those who want TBC tho.

I think you'll have a good time. It is the 2h monster Enh shaman.
---
Adding to that: On a personal level, achievements create a "meta layer" between player and game world, which decreases immersion significantly by laying bare its "mechanical underpinnings".
---
Of course, some people do not care about that, but for others, achievements actively destroy a lot of the enjoyment that the world feeling like an "actual" world brings.
---
Yea, I know it. I've been mythic raiding since 2013 and went back to private server raiding in 2017 after ToS, I've done all of vanilla and most of TBC. I've never been in a guild that doesnt have roster problems at some point, and even after roster problems, it's impossible to have a roster full of fantastic players.
---
There's still much things in TBC that are not those OP said.
---
I also aggree with OP, TBC without those things would be awesome.
---
If it is the current method roster that are planning to do this (and not some roster made specifically for classic) then I highly doubt they'll even try for MC and just do BWL onward
---
i wish they would test both 1.12 av and the older AV with the beta, get a vibe on what players prefer. I'd definetly prefer the older AV, day long matches were amazing
---
Not really.
---
Im saying experience &gt; no experience
---
You wouldnt hire a devoloper that only has experience in python to do c++ programming
---
Probably mostly because it's a special server set up for this specific task and because they don't want to wait for people to level to 58 then queue, but I'd be lying if I didn't have a thought in the corner of my mind that they're trying to limit the amount of fuckery that streamers might get up to given free reign.
---
Well maybe some players wanted to level to 58 and do only AV, now they're screwed :\^]
---
You also cant change your hairstyle. So choose wisely
---
Hell yeah man, it helps you a lot for early tanking of dungeons.
---
&gt;I enjoyed the zones even more because of flying. I spent a lot of time in TBC exploring the zones, finding nooks and crannies, hanging out in places I thought were cool, admiring places from above, etc.
---
Didn't think this was worth addressing since it was the same thing I said, and you discounted it. Why would I have to then readdress the same thing? We disagree. That's ok, but the only other point you made was about hide and seek lmao.
---
Edit: after seeing your tier list of expansions 
---
"TBC, wotlk, MoP, vanilla" 
---
You obviously just don't like certain aspects of vanilla to rank it after not only tbc but wotlK AND MoP (mop was not as bad as WoD or BfA but not that much better ) 
---
And that's fine, but tbh your opinions are innately biased against the fundamentals of classic, which are what **a lot** of people want.
---
ahhh thank you.  that's a bummer I saw Aug 27th and assumed tuesday for east coast US. Appreciate this
---
The good thing about WotLK was Blizzard fixed the paladin class: A protection paladin that can tank/taunt and a retribution paladin that can heal with efficiency.
---
Right because that's any different that summoning from outside the instance with 2 people. 
---
Just admit it bro, there's not much difference between classic and retail in regards to getting to dungeons. 
---
Well except for the fact that retail dungeons offer better challenges.
---
It’s the final and most stable version for talents and abilities. 
---
You will have wind fury, you will enjoy it
---
My parents were pretty poor when I was 13/14 but I got to buy an Xbox 360 / games and a bunch of other stuff because I sold thousands of gold botting in Vanilla. 
---
My parents were split so I had to tell each one the other brought all the stuff for me to avoid them getting suspicious.
---
Pour one out for me boys. Secure Miltary Area, no phones and no gaming related things online. Reddit is my only vice.
---
You will be :)
---
Idk why people want TBC. TBC is when Blizzard started pandering to the casuals. They gave the horde paladins to stop their cries.
---
I would buy it for 2$
---
Nyhm is the best, Hard Like Heroic is so much more fun now I understand english
---
Yeah that's true. There are always people that will stick around, and explore the barren waste lands of any given server. I have friends that speed run Mario 64 all the time, but its not an MMO... Idk if you have followed the fresh scene at all for the last several years, but there is a pretty obvious trend.
---
True that!
---
Im leaning towards Mage btw, seems like the best choice for me
---
I see you’re going for calmer, late-night/3 AM songs.  
---
Maybe you can add Dancin by Aaron Smith or some more Porter Robinson songs beside Shelter. Perhaps some synthwave? Or just Sweet Child O’ Mine by Guns N’ Roses. I like the idea of an adventuring playlist so I may look for songs to help with the playlist.
---
&gt;Lok'tar Ogar, brother!  
---
Let me hype you up about the Horde, right good and proper.  
---
You don't want chaos? Great. There is no chaos in the Horde. The Horde is not about chaos. It's about brutal *efficiency*. Orgrimmar's buildings are as they are because they get the goddamned job *done*. The Forsaken literally clawed their city out of rock just to fucking *survive*, man. You know how much pain and anguish exists within a Forsaken's mind, having achieved sentience after enslavement to the Lich King? A whole hell of a lot, I tell you what, but they've got a job to do, and that job is survival (and pure, unbridled vengeance).  
---
Survival is the name of the game. The Horde is a band of merry misfits, just trying to survive in a hostile world. The Orcs didn't want to be here. They were literally brainwashed by a bunch of fucking demons that shattered their homeworld and drove them insane, but they broke free of their bonds and, as a reminder of their former enslavement, impaled Mannoroth's big fucking head on a sixty-foot-tall pike. The Darkspear Trolls, maligned and hated by their kin for the grave sin of daring to help non-Trolls, eke out a meager existence on a pile of small islands. The Tauren find peace with nature in a small enclave surrounded on all sides by desert. The Forsaken, cursed with their very existence, struggle just to keep on not-really-living and not-really-dying.  
---
They find brotherhood and camaraderie in their shared suffering, and they fight for honor and the hope of a future prosperity.  
---
What the fuck does the Alliance have to offer? Ancient, decadent cities of their long-dead ancestors that they claim credit for, when in recent generations their legacy has been little more than xenophobia and racism? When Garithos, made leader of a full regional contingent by sheer chance, utilized his role to damn the High Elves and let the Sunwell fall? Or perhaps when the forces of Stormwind, instead of focusing their hatred against a literal intergalactic army of demons, decided that it was really the Orcs' fault that the Second War happened, and proceeded to enslave them and put them in concentration camps? So blind to incompetence and nepotism in their ranks that the highest elite ranks of Stormwind host not only the daughter of Deathwing but the nascent Twilight Father? And the Gnomes and Dwarves tinkering away in a mountain, giving fuck-all attention to anything north of Grim Batol? Or maybe the prissy and ancient Night Elves, screwing about in a magical tree in the north of nowhere, so incompetent in their racial history that they lost both Azshara *and*Nordrassil? Well of Eternity kaputt and all? And despite having millennia-old expertise with the machinations of the Burning Legion, they still don't prepare properly for Archimonde's assault? Nor does Dalaran, when the Kirin Tor are besieged "without warning", having conveniently not only ignored Medivh's warnings but also ignored the fact that he was possessed by Sargeras in the first place and also they're a bunch of goddamned super wizards? Might as well just put a big ol' bubble around their city and pretend they don't exist so that they don't have to help out any of the besieged citizens of Lordaeron.  
---
The Alliance's legacy is inaction, their birthright unearned and their morality tainted by base prejudice. They lay about, and when threats arise, they continue to lay about until it's too late to do anything but damage control, and then they blame their problems on the funny green fellows and throw them in camps. They're corrupted by the malaise of prosperity, and their shining cities belie their slow downfall.

PvP???
---
This was not a mechanic in Vanilla no; it came around Cata/Mop when the deadzone was removed.
---
Well, I’m in the more prominent pve private server guild and we don’t have any contact with method. I don’t doubt that they will start recruiting soon though. The pool that they can recruit from will bring a lot better players than the average top private server guild (we do have some wf to top 10 players though) so I doubt that they will try and work together with any private server guild.
---
58 . That's risky business. Bosses smash through early raid geared 60's. It'll be interesting to see if  can even finish at that level.
---
It will be interesting to see how the factions balance out, if one side is more popular than the other we could see a lot of annoyed people waiting for the match to begin
---
That's actually a good question, since they are technically two different games with separate clients that simply share a common login.  
---
I don't think there has been anything like this, where a single game subscription in B-net gives access to two different games.  
---
It probably depends on what resources they share on the server side.
---
&gt; The answer is go play a tbc private server.
---
Already doing it. But I'd love to play TBC arenas oficially again
---
1) Heal in raids as a shaman.  
---
2) Get the Hand of Rag.  
---
3) Murder people all day long in BGs with WF and dance on their corpses.
---
4) Eat Fried Chicken.
---
Wow good you told us. No one ever did this before. Man thanks to you.
---
If you have atleast the same gear as your opponents or better you can atleast have some lucky procs here and there.
---
But the specc is not very viable against good players or in a premate Situation.
---
And you will have a hard time gearing it.
---
But sure if you are rank 13 and have a nice 2h you can still onehit bad geared ppl.
---
Nope I haven't found any at all.  I tried looking for these, because I'm in the same boat.  There was an addon I used in WotLK that showed all quests, sortable by zone, and was actually able to query the server for what quests you completed and didn't complete.  You only could query the server, because achievements were added (the quest achievements) and they had a record of the quests you actually did.  
---
I had an addon for Vanilla that was similar, but it only tracked it if you actually had the addon from when you first logged on.  Otherwise, you'd need to manually mark them as completed in your addon since that query functionality (added with achievements) didn't exist in Vanilla.
---
If they leave that functionality in, I'd be happy because then us hardos can actually track what we did and didn't do.  I'm the kind of guy that's planning as a Tauren to run to Camp T, X Roads, and then Ratchet after Mulgore, and then SWIM to Senjin Village from Ratchet so I can get a single quest to go to Razor Hill and start the Fizzle's Darkclaw questchain that leads to Margoz and Skull Rock and ends with the Demon Seed in The Barrens, just because I hate missing cool chains.
---
It's not about beating the others in your raid, it's about providing the most performance for your chosen role, and as a NE Rogue, you are not.
---
Usually Corruption is a waste of debuff slot. But if your guild didn't have Thunderfury and/or good shadow priest and/or enough hunters, then maybe it was beneficial to have 1 or even 2 Corruptions. Or, more likely, your raidleader wasn't perfectly knowledgeable either :P
---
In any case, you shouldn't say "dots" about the one dot that 0-2 of warlocks apply. Probably this is why you got some downvotes.
---
\*ba dum tss\*
---
I see you farmin primals in Shadowmoon Valley...
---
&gt; as any spec can handle everything before Strath / UBRS / LBRS / Scholo / DM E+N+W.
---
Not like you need a raid PvE spec for either of those, you'll have no trouble clearing them with a retadin healer, arms warr tank and shadowpriest + druid dps. Same goes for Molten Core for that matter. 
---
Minmaxing raid spec is nice for quick progression and general comfort grinding out the encounters but you'll progress just fine without it.
---
There isn’t another auctioneer as far as I’m concerned
---
I started raiding as a druid tank but was able to gear up as a boomkin and actually raid as boomkin once I got the gear together. How terrible that specs other than resto were viable for druid
---
Yea that's why I thought I'd be able to play both would be because they are the same game but are very separate
---
Yea, there has been a massive surge of new players lately and they are all preparing for Classic. Lowbies everywhere. Of course, I can't tell you which server it is as I don't want to be banned a third time.
---
How would you suggest one follows something in 2006? They put this progress on their website.. they posted kill videos and talked on the WoWForums. What else would one do? Was I supposed to invent the Mythic Plus Invitational 10 years before it existed to satisfy cryptic reddit posts?
---
Fair enough, I just don't see the current method roster all jumping into classic. A few have stated they won't play at all so they will be recruiting 25+ members most likely. Doesn't sound like a good bases to go for WF unless they have something planned to fill the roster out.
---
He... uh... he doesn’t know how to haggle.
---
same in my workplace... also, crunchyroll is not banned but mangadex is marked as "ADULT CONTENT"
---
If you can, try to level with a party as much as possible. You'll be fighting tooth and nail for every mob kill.
---
*raises hand
---
We used to have children to help tend the family farm.
---
Now we do it because we need reliable leveling buddies. :)
---
Yes, I will equate it. It’s a lazy mans system sitting in the city waiting for someone else to do something for you using an ingame tool. You have to admit it, it’s essentially an easy to use teleportation tool. 
---
Additionally, you can’t fly in that zone. Yet. Every expac was like that, barring cataclysm. And each time the flying was implemented, the state of the world felt hollow.
---
Warlocks have to utilize resources, it’s an earned teleportation. And meeting stones were not around.
---
So, no, there is no “easy” way to teleport to dungeons in vanilla. Plain and simple. Sorry you are getting a little heated about it. What you said was simply so little truth that it would be considered untrue to the spirit of what the original topic was about.
---
But hey man, you do you. I’m going to just stop responding to you. I can tell this matters a lot for you.
---
Next day?
---
AV lasting from reset to reset was the best!
---
Yeah I agree with all of that too. The best thing that a person can do is to join a classic class discord and read actual discussion on all of the types of gear that should be obtained, and the types of situations where you should swap certain pieces. It's difficult to represent that kind of information in a simple list with a clean UI though.
---
The people who want to perform at max are already engaged in those communities; the BIS cheat sheets are more designed for casual players who just need to know what's "good enough" to get a raid spot. But yeah of course I agree that bad priorities and unobtainable gear definitely makes a BIS list a lot worse. I made some complaints about that site's shaman recommendations awhile back and it was updated since then with better information.
---
That seems more right to me but I have no idea what kinda data they (or op) pulled so who knows.
---
What? im not sure what you are saying but 1.12.1 is coming back, it will be here, only difference is it will be over with sooner this time around. Fresh servers are just a meme now... classic will be the ultimate fresh.
---
Also just to keep in mind, Darkmoon Faire is being released in phase 3, so I’m sure we’ll all have plenty of time for turn ins.
---
With their contacts and brand they can mass recruit top percentile players, I wouldn’t worry about that part. Getting their WF MC clear I however doubt though.
---
I'll be doing something pretty similar myself - just without all your charisma in front of a camera lol.
---
Good luck, stay healthy, get hyped!
---
If you don't mind me asking: what layout did you use and how did you implement the arrows between certain talents?
---
Titan Panel, I haven't seen that anyone is developing this for Classic (unfortunately.)
---
I am really interested to see your source where it states warriors are tanks only because fury is by far one of the best dps specs in the entire game. So whomever wrote that is actually dumb or you are spreading misinformation. One or the other.
---
It has become obvious that we outnumber them. People tend to follow whatever they think is most popular. Explains the influx of pro-changes people into this sub.
---
they are a meme, but pve boomkin/elemental do care.
---
I'd take those gold values off there, don't want to mislead people about how much gold you can make. I've never seen any pserver have lotus at "134g" or Shadow Oil at "12g".
---
As a hunter I hate playing against shamans but love spamming Viper Sting on paladins.
---
WF shaman seems to 'unlock' once you have a top end weapon. At level 60 this is any of the 60+ dps weapons (including the unstoppable force). I had a Herald of Woe, and even as a elemental/resto spec, I could still do some serious damage with it when I got a juicy WF proc.
---
There is some standards when creating apps. The contrast on the icon with the dark background will make the dark background blend in with a users potential dark background. I would recommend the arrow image, without the contrast border and 100% without the talent counter.  (in case OP wants to keep the arrow image as icon)   
---
Tbh, i just don't think OP have tested the icon on various backgrounds. It's not a big deal and horrible is a strong word but it's not a good practise within the profession. Hope it satisfy your question
---
You can log into retail and the stress test at the same time, if classic is it's own client then I'd think you would be able to.
---
People still thinking horde has better racials makes me irrationally angry
---
And my AXE!!!

---
Shawn Bean plays Bolvar in World of Warcraft 2 movie... I’d love this.
---
As someone who almost exclusively World PvP'd through all of Burning Crusade and WotLK, I can say that flying mounts - at least in the old world, completely ruined most of it. The benefits of flying mounts do not come close to outweighing the detriments. 
---
Tricky players could sneak their way onto the Westfall lumbermill roof or the Crossroads Inn roof and wreak havoc on enemy players down below, but that was ruined once flying mounts were added. Not to mention how easy it makes for players to flee. If a player attacks someone and gets killed, the player that was attacked earned the right to try and chase their ass down and kill them one or two more times. Flying mounts (even worse, instant druid flight form combined with Shadowmeld in combat) really ruin that.
---
The only positives that flying mounts brought for my dedicated group of World PvPers was in Cataclysm, where they allowed us to more easily siege around different parts of Stormwind and begin largescale fights with Alliance on the rooftops overlooking the Dwarven District. But even that wasn't worth losing unmitigated PvP access cross the rest of the world.
---
I'd say the big offenders for negatively warping World PvP are flying mounts in Azeroth, a heavy increase in city guards spawning over the years, and sharding/cross-server zones (which almost completely ruined Deeprun Tram PvP since it was made into cross-realm as well).
---
I’ll be raiding at least until I down a boss in Naxx.
---
Wing Clip/Raptorstrike/disengage/feign/multishot/arcaneshot/serpent sting/conc shot/distracting shot/cooldown macro. (edit: Just remembered that  hunters mark was shift+5)
---
My muscle memory got set 15 years ago and I can't seem to change it.  Change one thing and I'm instantly playing with two left hands.
---
It still seems pretty shitty people decide they don’t want to do their job. Beta isn’t a free game, everyone is supposed to do what Blizzard requests of them.
---
Also, it makes me really worry that there will be no legitimate battlegrounds when the game releases because of this same mentality. They will just sit empty for months...
---
IMO you should buy vendor bags asap, they will return your investment very quickly. Throwing away vendor trash will keep you poor longer than bucking up for the bags.
---
I see
---
In my WoW canon, the main reason Ony was in SW was to bang Bolvar. Self polymorphy has its perks.
---
I actually studied this once while auctioneering. Right had a 1-2% higher favoritism vs left. Middle was 1% after counting 100 visitors.
---
I remember yelling this with an accusation that those in the middle queue were likely to be the kind of people that choose the middle urinal AND talk to others at the same time.
---
Very true, don't even think the armory was active at that time either.  Usually when they ask what talents I chose and being a foolish newbie I'd tell them.   There is always those types of people in every game unfortunately.
---
Didn't XPerl back then let you look at talents, or see what tree they had points in.  Cant remember.  I do remember there was an option that would show their tree name when you targeted them under their portrait.   Like it would say Balance or Feral under a druid where he had most of his points.  Its been so long I can't remember exactly when that came in either.
---
Half the raid won’t be meme spec, people want to rank on the logs.  
---
What one ret is doing shouldn’t matter, but apparently matters to loot whores and people that want 2 minute Rag kills.  Raid gear is required for pvp.
---
Yes, from 0.1% to maybe 7-8%.
---
Knowledge and experience are barely relevant for Naxx. TIME COMMITMENT is what matters...time commitment from 50+ players in a guild, all of them being hardcore.
---
You are dreaming if you think that more than 10% of the player base will clear Naxx in Classic.
---
There aren't ENOUGH hardcore players for Naxx to be cleared by more than 10% of the player base.
---
Lmao it really obviously doesn't matter that much as it does to you since youll nit pick every little thing without any knowledge of how retail works to try and prove that LFG is a baby way of grouping in wow.
---
Obviously you can't change your race. Ud is better overall.
---
This would not be classic. Classic gear and raids would be worthless. And even releasing burning crusade later would destroy the whole leveling in the game and not endgame thing. I really hope they do it... at least in another way or something. Every regular step forward in the timeline brings us further away from the game we all want with Classic.
---
But right now everything else than Classic is just not an option anyways. And the future will tell what the future holds.
---
The biggest diffrence a normal player will notice compare to the typical privat servers is the availability of world buffs.
---
Since alot of buffs will be on a timer so no easy fully buffed raids.
---
Some areas in TBC, including at least one raid will be inaccessible. Level 60 content would be irrelevant if they just level to 70, at which point it's pretty much just TBC. Also, continent shift, everyone would be in outlands, chilling in shattrath, old world would be dead.
---
Classic will be much easier
---
You think horde has better male models?  I’m not a fan of hunchbacks.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I’m a horde player all day, but I’m going to miss my blood elf model.
---
I played wf shaman in vanilla with the earthshaker weapon. It just too inconsistent imo.
---
If you think pserver players have less of a life than Method you don’t know the first thing about Method.
---
The first MC clear goes to the guild logged in the most following launch.
---
Are you talking about neil attacking the warrior?
---
They are both moving towards each other.  That's not what the leeway 'bug/feature' is talking about either.
---
On top of that, neil has sprint up which is only going to further interfere with character position server side with relation to what the client shows.
---
That's a really flawed example and doesn't even address leeway.
---
To do a test like this, you should be able to continuously reproduce the example.
---
You don't scour through 100s of videos from vanilla and find the .01% occurrences and go LOOK LOOK LOOK GUYS WE FOUND EVIDENCE while ignoring the 99.99%  of the times someone is able to kite outside of a 5y range and not get melee'd.
---
You use the 99.99% as the norm.
---
The norm in vanilla was not being able to melee your target unless you were visible on top of it, even if your bars were not 'red'.  I'd cite videos for this but what's the point, it's every vanilla video out there, take your pick.
---
Ah right sorry forgot about that! (Unless you're a warlock... then you can lifetap to no life -&gt; hellfire and walk as a ghost through the door and respawn on the other side then hit the torch and open the door)
---
&gt;There might be a link also to the time Hunters underwent the removal of the deadzone as well as Tauren racial attack range removal (both TBC)
---
Hunter deadzone was removed in cata or MoP, not TBC.
---
But if they change a single thing, the next logical thing is to add LFR!
---
So children up vs. a bunch of disabled old farts? I'm good to go.
---
Thanks for the unnecessary argumentum ad hominem :D
---
Unless they completely redesign how the game works any and all content added to the game does this. And with a game that's dependent on fresh content to keep people interested it's an inevitability. You can dislike it all you want, but the alternative is just worse.
---
17/17/17 Variety Pack!
---
I'm going to guess this is how Vanilla was. I played WoW from Vanilla to Wrath so I have vague memories to go back on and this video confirms what I've always felt, that PServers were a little *off*. 
---
I thought I was lucky without the amount of bags I would find on new characters, because I remember in vanilla getting a bag was a big deal. I even raged that Draenai and Blood Elves get a 4 slot bag from one of their level 1-5 quests. I also recall being almost floored by how expensive leveling skills felt in PServers. We know the prices aren't wrong, but I foolishly bought every single skill leveling multiple characters in Vanilla (altoholic) and never did I go almost completely broke buying skills. This is probably on account of the extra trash gear that drops from mobs in Retail vs PServers.
---
I also remember the kobold mines and murloc camps being difficult, but trying to level a human rogue on a PServer and venturing into Fargodeep Mine was just an absolute death sentence, where I didn't have nearly as much trouble leveling a melee character in Vanilla.  
---
Either way I'm really glad to hear about these changes. Vanilla leveling was never really hard, just time consuming and punishing if you overdid it, and definitely still time consuming.
---
Imagine if Halloween was a questing zone, but with a badass storyline.
---
Even it it's just 1 person, they're still a leech.
---
You've nailed down what I couldn't put in words. I preferred "wow you have item x, you killed boss y?" rather than "achievement says you did stuff"
---
All TBC supporters should read this, before dismissing a different path for Classic.
---
This (and MUCH more) are among the reasons why TBC should only be a side option server for Classic, and not the default option.
---
I have a TBC ui screenshot too and my 1 to = is nearly the exact same.
---
&gt;I hope they're present in phase 1 so we can enjoy them while on the way to 60. I'm probably not going to head back to ST for a quest after having been level 60 for months.
---
Me too dude. They are fairly strong when leveling but they won't break any BiS lists. It also gives people an extra push to actually do ST
---
Also got there once by slow falling under the world and hitting the water (or lava? Which doesn't do damage if you're out of the map?)
---
For the most part when leveling up your end rank spells are going to be the best until you start actually stacking a couple hundred +healing from pre-raid BiS gear.
---
Some tips for low level dungeons and just dungeons in general when you are undergeared at 60:
---
- Heal the tank. If the DPS get agro let them deal with it and bandage themselves unless you are confident you are not going to run out of mana. Most classes have things they can do to keep themselves alive. Make them use their tools to live instead of your mana. If it's a consistent issue tell them to hold off for a few more seconds to make sure the tank has solid threat. 
---
- Especially while leveling the 5 second rule is certainly going to be good for you regardless of your class. Try to top people off them stop healing for a little while unless the tank is getting nuked. 
---
- Use your tools to reduce the amount of damage a party takes. As a shaman don't forget to ground that fireball and rank 1 earth-shock those flamestrikes. Reducing damage taken is better than effective healing.
---
You're not farming copper in barrens, are you ? or silverleaf ? No, you're farming mats in the top tier zones, because the mats in those zones have made all the other mats redundant.
---
As a fellow casual, I've ruled out warlock for the sole reason that shard farming would take up too much of my limited playtime.  Perhaps as an alt one day.

---
By your definition, it would be impossible for world PvP to exist.  
---
If two 40 man raids where everyone is the same level (they would both be PvE specced obviously) fighting each other when both guilds have a very good idea its coming is considered "ganking", i'd love to hear your definition of what "fair" pvp is.
---
Yea, i dont see raid testing beeing done on the beta either
---
If you look at it from a faction or cultural perspective and not a race perspective it makes more sense. Think of Trolls. Most troll tribes are bad, but to say all trolls are bad paints a broad stroke. Darkspear trolls align with horde and are more closely related cousins to the Night elves than the other troll tribes are. They're less savage and more spiritual and welcoming to others than most trolls.
---
Undead as a horde race are similar in a sense. They were once alliance, then turned scourge. Then freed from the lich king by sylvanas. Then exiled from the alliance for being undead. The horde accepted them. They are no longer scourge. Saying that they are would be like saying there are no differences in trolls from tribe to tribe, they're all the same trolls (which is not true).
---
The scourge are bad guys to everyone other than themselves.
---
I didn't start until the end of TBC, can you bestow me with the knowledge of how a female dwarf priest might acquire a world buff?
---
Played enhance all of vanilla, did the pvp grind to r13, raided as enhance through mc, bwl, and some of aq 40. Had a great time, go for it!
---
Warriors have dark iron (blacksmith made) gear which has raw fire resist on it and stam https://classic.wowhead.com/transmog-set=1055/dark-iron-plate
---
There is the volcanic set which is leatherworker made, but it has just fire resist and no stamina.
---
So the problem is, fire damage is unable to be mitigated by armor, so you are just eating tons of damage, and are unable to pop a major fire absorb potion to eat some of it.
---
There's one or two other leatherworker made pieces but they require core leather which means you're already deep into MC.
---
Little bit of a pickle and was hoping you could help!
---
I'm deciding between a Warrior and Paladin. I'll be leveling with my girlfriend who will be playing a Priest.
---
I like the sound of the Paladin at 60. Great healer in both PVP and PVE and it's a healing style I've not played before. The issue with Paladin is that I'm not sure I'd want to play Prot or Retri in dungeons whilst my girlfriend heals, or whether they'd even be viable.
---
Warrior is a good choice for me too, I like the option to tank dungeons and DPS in raids. Fury looks fun and I have more experience with Warrior in general, so I know what I'm getting more or less. Fury (and Arms) certainly seems more involved than Retri.
---
Basically, I'm flip flopping between playing a healing plate wearer or playing a dps/off-tank plate wearer. With a conflicted side of girlfriend also playing healer.
---
Can anyone explain the shorter PVP queues on Alliance side? I thought slightly more people played Alliance, which would increase the queue time.
---
I recall in vanilla, queue times for the Alliance was 2x or 3x as long as Horde. Granted, the Horde were the ungerdog (1:2 H:A ratio).
---
You can call a thought juvenile and not a person.  Thanks for the false dichotomy to try and stir the pot :D
---
I think you'll find more people dislike key factors in tbc and wrath more so than vanilla, flying, world pvp, resileance, loss of attunment quests, no more class quests, its not as clear cut as 'lets be real' I'm defently inclined to believe people would continue to play classic for years and years to come there are multiple fairly populated vanilla pservers for vanilla wow, besides this was all ways a classic project.. when did it become what's happening after naxx is finished ?? We don't actually want classic we want tbc carry on
---
My cynical heart says it's because they don't want testers to realize how nerfed the NPCs are. At 60 post-1.11 AV is a joke
---
Damnit Bob
---
Same way you can play WoW with a controller, I forget the program but its an easy to find macro maker. 
---
You can set all the extra buttons to do whatever you want.
---
I remember that really hurting progression for a lot of smaller guilds looking to progress or fill in bigger guilds.   One thing I saw was people that would join your raid to help fill a slot, and would push to do a specific achievement, then bug out after they got it.
---
Yeah that's not going to happen. Once everyone hits 60 it'll be the same zergfest as ever.
---
But Maelstrom Weapon wasn't a things then. Other than that, would buy.
---
&gt;Beastiality
---
That's racist
---
Yeah I guess progression isnt the right term for it.  Just the journey of getting into mc will be fun to watch for all streamers
---
Gonna cap snowfall and turtle every game, gonna be a blast.
---
Intrepid rank 14 Night Elf Warrior
---
For example the Buff if you hand in the head of onyxia should be on a timer, on privat server you can just hand it in everytime and Buff everyone in og.
---
Or the buff Thrall gives when you hand in the Blackhand quest.
---
The same way they were acquired at the end of BC.
---
&gt; Didn't think this was worth addressing
---
You honestly didn't need to respond at all. You said that beauty and design were harmed due to flying, I said "not for me," and that should have been that. Instead you decided to try to argue that some specific instance of enjoying the world wasn't valid enough of an argument for flying.
---
&gt; You obviously just don't like certain aspects of vanilla
---
&gt; your opinions are innately biased against the fundamentals of classic
---
This is a lot of conclusions to be drawing from a tier list of what expansions I preferred. If you really care, there are a lot of older comments from myself that explain how I feel about WoW's game design.
---
In short, it's not things about Classic that I think are *negatives*, it's things about newer expansions that I think are *positives*. As mentioned, I'll happily play Classic for a while, the things that were changed or added in newer expansions being missing doesn't make Classic a worse experience.
---
The easiest way for me to summarize how I feel about newer expansions is to say that being a better *game* doesn't necessarily mean being a better *experience*. You seem to agree with me on this. Things like dungeon finder or auto-learning spells are unarguably improvements to the *game* (less clunky, more streamlined experience), but don't necessarily make a better *experience*.
---
World first Classic has a place boys. It had a place even before Method made their announcement.
---
The consumable thing was 2.1
---
In that same patch they buffed a lot of gear; you could say they balanced each other out.
---
The definition of a Wrath baby.
---
Glad you're interested. It's a similar spec to classic ret. Most of the difference comes in gearing. 
---
Here's a generalist 60 build for PvE that can also duel and do some light PvP. https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#sIVzZxhZVfotrcqo
---
If your guild wants improved BoM on your build, here's a pure raiding/PvE build. https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#sIVzZxhZEf0xbcq
---
Faster weapons matter, but what matters more is haste procs. Weapons like the Jackhammer and Manual Crowd Pummeler are currently simming to be the best weapons SP ret can use, because a hasted weapon still procs a SoR value of the weapon's original speed. IE MCP is 2.1, you use the active and it goes to a 1.3 speed, you're getting 2.1 speed SoR procs. Jackhammer is 2.5 and goes down to 1.7 while getting 2.5 speed SoR procs. 2h weapons are generally better than 1h because of 2h specialization in the ret tree, but 1h pieces like Flurry Axe can be really good in a pinch. 
---
You could probably get away with a fast caster weapon if you wanted, but I would advise looking for a haste or bonus attack weapon. 
---
MC's itemization is pretty bad, I won't deny that. Most of your gear in MC is gonna be prebis and you're gonna carry a lot of prebis into BWL. Mostly look for Spellpower gear across the board. We're entering p1 with 1.12 itemization, so a lot of prebis gear has it. Look for pieces like Plate of the Shaman King or other hybrid pieces with SP+str+int if possible, there is a lot of offensive hybrid loot that never gets soaked without a ret pal or enhance shaman. BWL cleans it up quite a bit, and Judgement is so fucking good for us that full Avengers+AQ offpieces only give us a 20 dps buff over full Judgement. In AQ40, while we dont get major gear upgrades, bosses stop resisting chilli, which should net you an extra 400 damage on chilli procs that was getting resisted before. 
---
T1 is kind of a meme set, but I think it's a fun meme, it's not spellpower, but it lets you do gimicky hybrid shit. Take it as last prio for the set, it's situationally useful in every raid. Great tool to have in your kit, but it's not one for pure DPS. 
---
I dont have specific BiS lists for MC, I've done most of my testing in prebis and tier 2. Here's the ret discord, we have some bis lists pinned there. https://discord.gg/ppHrfJ
---
I played challenge modes in WoD, and mythic+ for a minute in Legion. It’s hard to compare them. First, they’re both hard, at least in large part, due to the time element. You *have* to clear it in X minutes for a certain medal or for extra loot. That does make it harder in a sense, but that’s not fun for me. I have much more fun wiping on a boss 3-5 times and finally triumphing over it.
---
But also, I’d still argue, if you take away the time element, that heroics were harder. The only caveat to that is you could outgear 5-man heroics. You couldn’t outgear challenge modes by design. But in assorted dungeon blues and 2-3 pieces of Kara loot, 5-man heroics ranged from pain in the ass to wtf is this shit. 
---
As far as M+ goes... it’s hard to say that *literally anything* is harder than M+ when it scales infinitely (or at least damn close). There’s always a harder mode, so yeah... But I hate that gameplay in an RPG. When I did M+ it would always be 2 outcomes. One, we steamroll it and get easy loot while half AFK. Two, its too high for us and the group disbands after 1-2 wipes. I loved the concept at first, but I really just want set-in-stone, difficult, go at your own pace, 5-man content.
---
you should be, considering they are a different option in the menu   
---
you can do it with classic beta and retail, shouldn't be problem with classic and retail
---
I agree with the first part; yes, hunters incorporate the pet passive, but that’s the whole point of taunting it. It completely negates the pet passive and makes the pet attack you as if it was just another random mob.
---
Absolutely true, afraid to queue without mounts and BiS at level 40.  Streamer culture.  There is no way the streamer's didn't each get a batch of their fans invited.  There is no other way to explain the obvious generational gaps in the beta.
---
Yes, they are server specific, and the one I'm playing does have some screws screwed very tightly... plus at level 60 people already AFK mostly even though Naxx released. Those that play need those stuff and prices escalate. Oh, and arcane crystal 40g :)
---
[https://www.wow-auctionhouse.com/](https://www.wow-auctionhouse.com/) this could be used to asses some prices across time and servers
---
Can confirm, went from 10g to 1000g
---
This is pointless. Keep believing classic is difficult if you want. It isnt.
---
&gt; I hate the flying mounts tho
---
The zones were DESIGNED with flight enabled fortunately. Not like Azeroth which when flying was added, the zones weren't built for it.
---
1.12 AV doesn't last that long.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=865/frost-nova says the radius of both damage and root are 10 yards
---
NPC will spawn on the right places
---
Well there won’t be BGs for 5-6 months until phase 2, so you won’t have to worry about them sitting empty on release.
---
Yes, those sell when people want to pirate or ninja :D
---
Sure I guess there'd be some of that but for warriors/rogues we're mostly talking devilsaur.
---
Doing dungeons 10 levels under the level is not "testing"
---
If you want to discuss plans hit me with a DM! :)
---
And not sure if serious but thanks! Feels good to hear I didn't look too unnatural in front of camera as this was my first video.
---
My buddy got me one when they first came out! I actually loved it for as crappy as it was lol.
---
Awesome! Really enjoy hearing from John
---
Fuck. Daily. Quest.
---
TBC was good but it started the shit trends we have now.
---
Yeaa that thought appeared out of nowhere, also how about the unnecessary part?
---
I love real Vanilla too, I just think it actually does have a lot of room to be a far better and more interesting game to play. TBC improved upon almost every single thing that I can think of aside from removing us from the vast and well built world of Azeroth...and flying mounts too I guess, those were a mistake.
---
Keep in mind here also (and this is something I have to remind myself too) patch 2.0 was developed and made by the entire Vanilla dev team with their full and proper vision for WoW. Leveling in TBC was even more brutal and unforgiving than Vanilla, dungeons were tougher, raids were absolute masterpieces, and almost every single spec had its own niche role in raiding with some unique benefit. Class balance in general was pretty stellar too with some really good PvP diversity, even in the 2v2 bracket which is the most cancer one.
---
Class mechanics were way better too since no one was spamming one single button for their entire raiding careers anymore.
---
Are you sure you're not getting downvoted because you generalize a lot of negative traits of a playerbase while filling all of the check boxes of all the things you're complaining about in said post? Did you stop to think about your post before you hit enter?
---
I swear to god if streamers were on a bridge and they didn't jump, people like you would jump just to spite them.
---
Problem with that logic as well is assuming these retail players habe no transferrable skills to Classic. Yes it is a 'somewhat' different game, but it's not a fucking hard game. Esp. for competent people, like most of Method...
---
It's more like comparing someone that knows how to use Windows XP and someone that knows Windows 10 and saying the Windows 10 user won't be able to figure out Windows XP.
---
Python and c++ are vastly different. Classic and retail, when it comes to raiding, really arent that different, aside from retail having way more mechanics. I think people are attributing more skill to these seasoned private server players than they deserve. The only thing difficult about MC and classic raiding is showing up every week to do it over and over again.
---
I have the same decision but druid and mage. My one complaint about mage is there's going to be like 20% of the pop playing it.
---
My several page long list of complaints with druid starts with no ooc res, and several talents, skills, and even set bonuses not working inside. 
---
Priest is a pretty solid choice for 1v1s. It's very needed in both PvP and PvE. It's insanely easy to get in groups. Mages are good but won't warrant the sheer numbers of players rolling them. It will be much harder to find groups as a mage.
---
Ohhh gotcha. I remember the hanging but not sure if I ever knew/paid attention to the fact there was a buff associated. Thanks
---
dont bosses and mobs get parry haste as well?
---
/r/streetwear
---
The problem is Prayer of Healing isn't smart. It only works for one party and requires everyone be damaged. When casting chain heal on a raid member that isn't in your party, it will jump to any damaged raid or party members. Chain Heal is much more effective at dealing with raid damage that doesn't necessarily hit everyone.
---
For single target healing, it's Paladin &gt; Priest &gt; Druid &gt; Shaman.
---
For multi-target healing, it's Shaman &gt; Priest &gt; Druid &gt; Paladin.
---
What kind of sorcery is this?
---
One thing that I hated was the combined city, sure in Vanilla we had Rachet, Tanaris, and Booty Bay, but they didn't feel 'safe', many times I'd be jumped walking past a place away from the guards, or have a couple of players take me down and try to outrun the guards.    Shatt and Dalaran didn't have this same feeling, and I didn't like mingling with those damn Alliance.
---
They are not, you need to constantly travel through them at the very least
---
If people want to flame you about spec, you just put the group together yourself, and if people want to complain -&gt; boot and invite the next person in line.
---
Leveling as feral I healed most dungeons, or dpsed or even tanked. Didn't matter when leveling. Even at 60 when farming gear nobody cared that much (early days of classic) hell even on Pservers people want to be all try hard so be it. They can wait 20 minutes for that "META" built person, or I will already be half way through strat by picking up a moonkin.
---
Meta builds are for bleeding edge end game progression (read: AQ+). MC you need about 10 people knowing what to do, to clear it. And yes I know of people who have 3 manned Rag.
---
Playing WoW is waaaay better than working
---
Oh no someone posted how they want to play the game, better call them an incel/neckbeard!
---
Troll master race evolution in action. They're getting bigger, taller, stronger.
---
Nefarian, onyxia, hard trash after twin emps in aq40, magmadar, bug trio, gluth off the top of my head
---
Here is the real answer; why would you want to play a character in a game that is the same race you play in RL? Go dwarf.
---
But if there was no lich king, blizzard wouldn't be able to make another lich king expansion in the future when they inevitably run out of things to do. Reintroducing reskinned fan favorites every other expansion as the protagonist or antagonist is kind of their meta game design at this point. It's one of the few sure fire ways to bump sub numbers and get people to buy the new expansion.
---
That's a good point I didn't think of.
---
That's why it will be my duty to cap snowfall.
---
Go night elf
---
Many interesting points indeed, there will always be clips of outrageous situation in both ways because of servere lag, player lag etc and general desync issues.
---
However the reason they only got 1 auto-attack through in that Neilyo clip is because Neilyo Backpeddled afterwards, which completely nullifies any leeway, when he did get hit he strafed for a brief moment.
---
You can see the same thing happening in the TBC and 3.0.2 videos, kiting with backpeddle, but as soon as any other input is made, even backpeddle-strafing, leeway is triggered.
---
This is also exactly how it functions in the beta right now.
---
Running and stopping in quick successions also seem to prevent leeway from triggering, at least most of the time.  
---
Looking back at retail vanilla and TBC videos, it's clear that some rogues knew about this mechanic even back then, example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EITksIO5aA8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EITksIO5aA8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=700)
---
As of that clip of Tauren warrior hamstring, that seemed about right, Tauren gets increased range but hamstring doesn't get leeway when you're slowed, only auto-attacks do.  
---
This I've already confirmed on the beta.
---
Go mage, if you play shadowpriest you will struggel with getting gear, and even a casual can go mc/bwl and a mage can get some nice gear to pvp there.
---
While a shadowpriest has allways a harder time getting gear, ppl not giving you the raid gear you want and having to rank to rly get viable gear.
---
You just cant go wrong with mage in classic, if you like it there is no harm in playing it.
---
Saved. Thank you for this!
---
This is cool but these are just a drop of water in the bucket compared to everything.
---
The final raid in Classic is scheduled to be Naxx. So when you clear Naxx, you go back to Naxx to clear it again.
---
The event that they can win tens of thousands of dollars playing, yes. Most Method guys have small streams, so the cost of dropping that isn't worth it especially with their sponsors for it etc. It also gets massive views in China, hundreds of thousands hence the timezone it was played in last time.
---
My gf ordered me his book for christmas. I got it \~2 weeks ago....
---
Regardless, It was a good read.
---
I don't know, as a paladin tank I never had too much problems on TBC heroics, while some pulls in challenge modes were mental. Quitted retail before M+
---
Clearing 5 heroic TBC dungeons in less than 90 minutes was the norm for most players.
---
&gt;the brutalist 5-man content in wows history 
---
ROFL.
---
MY man!  Laying down some knowledge on these Alliance scum.  Break their bones!
---
I am taking 3 weeks. Gotta get it ALL out of my system.
---
Actual gold value isn't as important as the relative value.  If something is worth 10x as much, you can probably bet on it being worth 10x as much at the same phase in retail classic.  Use it to compare the value of things rather than actual gold gained.
---
I mean yes a game from 2004 is less demanding on your hardware than a game from 2019. 
---
Wow has always been a CPU bottlenecked game more than a GPU one
---
Ready for them long, long days in Alterac.
---
Azshara is great for Dreamfoil and some Mountain Silver. I wouldn't even bother to dismounting for Golden Sansam.
---
Gurubashi Berserkers in ZG also. You likely won't wipe but it is obnoxious.
---
Paladin buffs are better though
---
Yes, Drakedog being the main one.
---
Also I was a Warlock back then with only rank10 gear and some offpieces from Pugs and never felt myself that much outscaled. 
---
Obviously the better gear you have the better, but you can PvP with some basic gear as a Warlock and even 1v2, 1v3 people with good gear.
---
There won't be an insane amount of people you can't even talk to. The amount of Chinese and EU players, even if it's the same, will be diluted down by masses of NA players.
---
There's a hanful of weapon setups we think might be good. Manual Crowd Pummeler is BiS. Period. Nothing competes. the Jackhammer, Flurry Axe, Blade of Hanna, and Ironfoe also look pretty good. 
---
We've gone into some bigger 2h theorycrafting, but havent found anythink that would make a meaty 3.5 really work in our favor in pve. We still use 2h weapons, but we use very specific ones, and there's the potential for 1h to be better, it really depends on the piece. 
---
As for no contest, we mostly soak hybrid loot that nobody other than Enhancment Shamans would need. Faction lock the classes, and things are as things do, we dont fight over 2h weapons, we dont fight over hybrid loot. We do share some itemization with warrior/rogue, and some with mage/lock, but it's minimal and we're never cucking either class out of full sets of gear. Only about 4 or 5 pieces on any given spelladin bis list RN have overlap with other classes. In prebis, there's the option to opt out of competition entirely by going for armor classes that clothies cant use, hybrid leather, mail, and plate. 
---
TLDR: It depends. Some 1h weapons are good, some 2h weapons are good. Here's the ret discord if you wanted to do more research or ask more questions. https://discord.gg/ppHrfJ
---
BGs on the beta are cross-realm.

\&gt; I really love how Classic fans use the same 
---
some Classic fans.   I wish everyone got a chance to experience their WoW nostalgia again.  My ex loved Cataclysm, and she constantly says she'd love to play that one again.   If Blizzard chooses to go down that path, re-releasing each expansion as it was, then I hope everyone gets to enjoy their nostalgia.   However, I also agree that Blizzard has a rare opportunity here, and if Classic is as successful, or more, than it originally was they could take steps to prevent the downfall that occurred with those expansions.
---
[None other than my main man, the legendary Auctioneer Stampi](http://imgur.com/a/sWwH8RR.jpg)
---
&gt;say that being a better game doesn't necessarily mean being a better experience. You seem to agree with me on this. Things like dungeon finder or auto-learning spells are unarguably improvements to the game (less clunky, more streamlined experience), but don't necessarily make a better experience.
---
I don't agree with you, and the repeated italics don't help lol. 
---
Dungeon finder and auto learning spells are definitely arguably not improvements, an improvement is an addition or adjustment that makes it better.
---
 Just because a change makes something faster doesn't make it better, look at the Concord, fastest commercial jet ever to fly was first flown 50 years ago (1969) . Doesn't mean it's better. 
---
You gotta reexamine your broad generalizations man, faster =/= better , lawful =/= right etc 
---
And tbh, a random redditor isn't going to be able to help you with that so that's all I have to offer
---
Mixed bag.
---
Spawn timers will not be as easy as pservers, due to dynamic spawning.
---
Herb spawns won't be as fast.
---
People want to say damage is off but hard to tell at this time.
---
That is incorrect. You learn new skill ranks at 60 that are non-talents.
---
Ha, funny. mmo-champion is the only site I've ever been blocked from at work, because it's flagged as "gambling"
---
And of course being immune to fears is pretty nice in pvp aswell.
---
Even if you look at the opening cinematic for vanilla, the map it shows in the opening sequence lists EK as Azeroth only. They changed it so that the planet and that continent could be distinguished separately.
---
He has treeform aura, this jumper is illegitimate.
---
You can also get the original map from the site listed on the bottom of it :)
---
I never thought about that back in '05/'06, but now my kids will probably want to play too when they're not playing Minecraft/Roblox/Sims/Lego Harry Potter/Smash Bros.
---
Damn, that's actually pretty clever. Never tought of the CGD limitation.
---
But isn't the GCD 1.5 seconds?
---
"mostly" streamers? LOL how many actually big name streamers are there?
---
But that point only gos for Holy priest, and then you have to respecc, and a Mage is allways wanted in 5man groups to because of the water.
---
And typical you dont get loot to progress your shadowpriest, and loot good for shadowpriest dos not rly exist in early raids.
---
Don't even mention Golden Sansam :D
---
Sorry that I forced you to read this against your will.
---
Not enough hp bars on the screen for a 40-man raid.
---
They could achieve this in so many different ways without retconning their lore.
---
Off the top of my head: Varimathras and/or Balnazzar and/or Lord Banehollow take control of the scourge remnants. People would love that shit becuase it would bring back Dreadlords (a severely underserved antagonist group in WoW) into a big role - which they had in WCIII but then became very minor characters ever since.
---
EDIT: I know you were being facetious haha - but this is super cereal!
---
Races vs Ironforge dude
---
Nice reading comprehension. 1 Ret vs 1 Warrior in a 40 man raid is not going to make the difference between you killing or not killing any boss.
---
Not sure what you mean, Drakedog was very well geared.
---

---
Just some parts of it, because whie levelig you couldn't fly.
---
So yeah, Kazzak, Ogri'la and some other points could not be reached on foot, but let's say 80% of the map was usable without mounts.
---
I believe threat was bugged by some amount in BC. I was always jealous of Prot Pallies and bears with their awesome AoE capabilities. Meanwhile on my Warrior it was like trying to work an abacus on a treadmill going down a ski slope.

I'm just going to park in Azshara and make my kids fish and farm soulstones.

Also very curious about this! I asked the other day and no one replied. Someone who knows the answer reply to this man's.
---
Kinda opposite since pservers ban worldbuffs for the first month of a raid and blizzard won't. So have fun when pserver veterans clear BWL 30 mins after release
---
Most anticipated according to whom?
---
You wonder? You've been guaranteeing people it is 10x easier on private servers all over this sub.
---
Pvp gear is out in phase 2 not 3
---
"There must always be a Lich King" may be a stretch, but I think installing something of an ally, or even neutral force, as leader of the undead is pretty sensible.
---
Then garrisons and we're all instantly ported onto our own islands all alone, never to see another player again. Ahhhhhhhhh
---
The real question is do they take away from your gameplay?
---
1.12 is indeed much easier. Most private servers, regardless of actual patch level, are based around the hardness found in earlier vanilla (1.2/1.3 ish).   
---
Blizzard did a series of patches called the "class buffs." Essentially one major class overhaul per patch. Completely new talents and in almost all cases major buffs across the board.     
---
It isn't 2.0.1 levels of easymode. But it definitely is easier than when many people leveled in vanilla. It isn't the 1.12 patch itself alone that caused it, it is the ten patches between 1.2 and 1.12 over almost two years that did.
---
Its nice in pve, but in pve you can argue human too for the more spirit.
---
But if you go pvp dwarf is so nice for priest, not because of fearward, ofc its a bonus. But Stoneform helps you alot as a priest in pvp.
---
You can easily clear end game content in retail without ever typing in chat. That’s nearly impossible to do in classic and you’re much more likely to make new friends on your way to sixty. I’d keep that in mind when making the decision to play one over the other
---
Hence why I said he didn’t follow anything
---
"I'm a dwarf and i'm diggin' a hole, diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole"
---
Had to be done....
---
Please remember to eat, drink and sleep occasionally, so we don’t have to hear on the news about your death.
---
Mage. Needs more water.
---
Oh man, I didn't know this was a thing.  I see 5 people from my very first guild for 14 years ago, though I only recognize 2 of the names.  Only played with them for 3 months before rerolling on a new server (which I don't see anyone I recognize from), but it does bring back a lot of memories.
---
i really disagree with it not increasing your kill speed, nd in reality a chest piece w/ stam would give you one, maybe two more autos worth of survivability, when a crit would get you finished much more quickly
---
Op. You're a loser.
---
They can't fear you if they can't see you ;)
---
Cool. I dont know why I waited 45 minutes then? Asmon's fanboys are queing? I was trying to queue into the 38 bracket not 40?
---
I'm removing all the people who don't want to be there for the sake of PVP.
---
Just like every other guild, we all know everything about these fights. 
---
This has to be a joke. Is Method moving to NA?  Because that is the only way they will be able to compete for Classic "World First".
---
Shouldbe enough time to finish 1 round
---
Distributing the classes among both factions is definitely a step down that very road, though. Additionally it can't be done for tauren without feeling ham-handed and forced and immersion-breaking. Sunwalkers? Really? That was the dumbest thing ever.
---
I'd probably be all for it if they were called Sunwalkers and had a shit ton of Tauren flavor and some alternative to the distinctly non-horde armor sets. Same for dwarves. Shaman makes sense for dwarves, in the lore, but paladin makes literally zero sense and is the most asspulled bullshit for Tauren. It's gonna be a hard no from me, personally, because the lore and immersion are more important.
---
Alternative idea. Play the opposite faction and kill your dad every time you see him. That'll teach him not to pick the wrong faction.
---
The alternative is horizontal progression. Destiny has been doing that ~in places~ and I don't really see how it's worse.

How do you know I am not a Dwarf in real life?
---
It's crazy, a couple of days ago I was 100% going mage since I played rogue, paladin, warlock in Vanilla... but for some reason I've been leaning towars priest hard.
---
Idk why, I know mages are great at farming but what do I need to farm for after grabbing epic mount and having a good chunk of change for consumables...
---
Would really like to raid on mage and eventually clear naxx but priest has been calling me for some reason. 
---
I just wish penance was in Vanilla because it's one of my favorite abilities - but oh well, idk what to tell you man =P
---
Trust me, I die plenty while paying attention

---
Gotta keep in mind the cap increase was only like a week ago? If you’re not a streamer in the beta and playing it fairly casually 30-40 takes a little bit of time. They should have waited a couple weeks before they started AB testing imo.
---
Well its useless to play now. I'm super hyped for classic but beta is useless as the progress gets resetted
---
Yes but you dont need the buffs for these instances, i am talking getting buffs for Aq40 or naxx.
---
it will be hard when the ony buff is on a 6h timer and noobs handing the head in, i would bet nearly impossible to get your guild buffed.
---
Nintendo's Mario disagrees, that Mario Bros franchise (and mario Kart, and other Mario inspired games) have sold more copies and garnered a higher market as the franchise aged and with each iteration.
---
True.
---
I find it easier to decide what your goals are and pick a class based on that.
---
the trinket needs a rare drop (ace of beasts). it was arround 1000g+ on l1ghts h0pe.
---
for the neck the cheapest way is to turn in vibrant plumes as long as you're able to and then thorium widgets for the rest. being engineer helps a lot since you can do the widgets yourself and the mats alone are usually quite a bit cheaper.
---
I'll be paying a LOT of attention to this. My workout routine will be focusing a lot into getting my cardio as good as possible, I'll be doing a lot of research which food / drinks will be the best and healthiest and I'll have a workout routine during the leveling aswell.
---
So dw, you will not hear any sad news regarding this. :)
---
I reckon chuck this one on the wow forums, see if you get blue attention.
---
But isn't it tier 0.5?
---
&gt; Kinda like in retail where there is a storyline in each zone?
---
That comparison is really far fetched.
---
The blame is that there is a reason to PVP other than for the sake of PVPing.
---
Nope. Started early TBC and played straight through both TBC and Wotlk.
---
Nice contribution, though.
---
I played a lot of WoW Classic, but I got stuck in alt-itis mode. I never actually reached level 60 to raid. When I went to college, a shy closet-gamer, it was the same year TBC launched. I remember meeting several other dorm-mates and feeling inspired to actually level my character to 60 to be prepared for launch. 
---
Creating a guild together, running heroic dungeons for keys, and progressing into 25man raids with IRL people was the greatest gaming experience. Nostalgia is definitely a massive reason.
---
That said, I really enjoyed some of the niche class balance. As a S. Priest main, I loved that I had an important role in raids. Also, the raid content was my favorite of any expansion. As someone who loves the WC3 campaign (replays it every few years), Tempest Keep, SSC, and Hyjal felt so immersive in the story. 
---
I am excited to re-live Classic so that I actually raid at 60. (The Beta has been amazing) But I do truly hope they consider releasing BC at some point as well.
---
Sorry but he can't as Bolvar won't die in the first 15 mins of the film.
---
That's not Vanilla EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
---
Except there are rewards exclusive to AV.
---
This made me laugh. Lol Jesus
---
That's the one.  Man... takes me back. lulz.  
---
I wish I had the skillset to create something similar.
---
Mostly I just want a DPS/TPS/HPS meter, but also the marking tools
---
Shouldn't the goal be to capture the zeitgeist of AV, which is definitely the multiple day slogfest of every version before 1.12?
---
Booty Bay, obviously
---
Why did the attacker not retrieve the dagger?
---
*Thrall*
---
Yep! But also the size of the zones were HUGE, so being able to fly around did cut down on the travel time.
---
And yes I agree 80% (if not more) of the map was useable without a flying mount.
---
The point I was trying to drill home is, absolutely, flying added to some of the zones, didn't completely destroy the flow of the zone.
---
Keeping flying locked to 70 (or 68 for druids) was the best call. It was the ultimate carrot on a stick for people, and it unlocked your endgame areas.
---
As for your other points, I loved heroic dungeons, they added further endgame for dungeons, that you would outlevel otherwise.
---
Horde only gets Sylvanas
---
Alliance gets Jaina AND Tyrande
---
If it did, it would slowly fill up with multiboxers ranking multiple characters. Now that I think about it, that's probably a pretty good way to rank when there aren't BGs
---
Theres 0 chance method gets world first. Its a race to 60 and without practicing routes for a long time it’ll be tough. Theres plenty of pserver guilds that are beating past WR in leveling times. It’ll be close if method no lifes level routes but i dont see them doing that
---
Nah Deadzone was removed in 2.3.
---
This is kinda cringy that I remember this but one of Nyhms songs from TBC mentions it.
---
Sco literally cleared Naxx in retail you dribbler. Also i enjoyed watching the mostly retail premade killing Perplexity, Monkeynews and them boys in AB on stream last night. Private server incels running for cover.
---
No problem. I thought the same thing a couple weeks back. It actually works out better, if you take vacation on Tuesday. Hopefully the worst of the server issues will be resolved in the first night. Should be less of a crowd too. Regardless, I'm keeping my expectations for Monday night pretty low.
---
I'm really looking forward to see how crazy open world pvp is during phase 2 :) will be the largest amount of time that open world pvp is just pure chaos.
---
I mentioned in another reply that I might be all for it if "Tauren Sunwalkers" actually had a truckload of tauren flavor and cosmetics rather than being the most ham-handed, asspulled paladin race in history. A "sunwalker" walking around in Judgement is the lamest, most immersion breaking thing ever.
---
I also have a strong preference for faction rivalry, and thought the other direction--making even more faction-locked classes and more class-specific racials like priests have would have been a better direction. Probably a nightmare to balance, but a hell of a lot more fun and flavorful.
---
Dwarf shaman makes sense, it's in the lore with Wildhammer dwarves. Tauren sunwalkers, when depicted as literal paladins, make no sense. I think forsaken paladins make more sense than that. At least the game had Sir Zeliek and a number of blue posts stating the undead are capable of wielding the light, it just suuuuuucks for them so very few do. Undead paladins make more sense than "Sunwalkers". Sunwalkers given actual racial flair and distinction make enough sense, but that isn't what we'd get. We'd get Tauren Paladins.
---
People tend to stack Strength and Stamina when leveling Shaman. What they want to do is stack Agility.
---
Agility gives you crit chance, Dodge and armor.
---
Because you crit more often, you activate flurry, which increases your attack speed by 30%, which means more frequent WF procs and more frequent crits. 
---
 I have reached 20% crit chance on my lvl 42 Shaman and I just shred through mobs.
---
How do you know? You weren’t even born during vanilla, KIDDO
---
At least you can bubble hearth after you realize how ineffectual you are :)
---
Blizzard let trollgodx stand on people for 5 hours in the level 30 duel tournament (despite player reports and streamer outcries) a couple weeks ago. That could be defined as harrassment, but it's still not behaviour that Blizzard would punish for.
---
Everyone has a right to play the game as they see fit, until it crosses the line (hate speech, camping quest NPCs too long etc).
---
&gt;pserver top guilds like what they did doesn't account for anything.
---
It counts for nothing
---
I liked dalaran a lot outside of it being a sanctuary, but you forgot to mention how daily quests took off in wrath

You missed my point.  I wasn't referring to those upscaled standard ones.  I was referring to the terrain ones here:  [https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=1260](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=1260)
---
imagine if thats something they did with Classic+ (i know not everyones a fan) add an exalted questline or lvl 60 hub for the two warring factions only accessible after revered.
---
Very excellent tool
---
&gt; he issue with Paladin is that I'm not sure I'd want to play Prot or Retri in dungeons whilst my girlfriend heals, or whether they'd even be viable.
---
Getting a group as ret/prot would be difficult, as many people look down on both as ret falls flat in terms of damage, and has minimal utility (not none, just a few small tricks which are nice). And prot is not stellar outside of a few 5-mans and 10-man raids, due to lack of taunt, and as people gear up, TPS starts to fall off. (But amazing AOE threat though!)
---
As for warrior, for sure, probably your best bet with your gf to be honest. Warrior REALLY needs a healer to level effectively. Priest can be pretty boring without someone with you as well.
---
Prot is amazing at 60 for tanking, you will always be able to build or join a group instantly with your combo so go for it.
---
Game, not franchise. It's a different effect on the human brain.
---
&gt; New content MUST be added when a certain % of the player base is slowing down their game time, either because they are very good, and are farming high-end content, either because they aren't good, and are stuck in mid-end content.
---
Has this theory ever been tested? Why the "must"?
---
Invite only. Keep checking your mailbox!
---
You mean the system where no content matters anymore, since you can just do whatever you want and you don't need to put in any investment. Horizontal progression doesn't solve this problem in any way, it just makes even more content redundant. It's a system where you do everything once and then there's little to no point going back.
---
Lucky you.  I work for DHS and they just banned Reddit last month.
---
&gt; Furthermore, these private server guys aren't even tryharding, they just chill the fuck out and report bugs and run sub-optimal premades. Like seriously.
---
Might be an unpopular opinion, but I'd recommend Druid. I've mained a paladin since launch, but have been playing a tauren Druid recently. While it's a very different and more involved playstyle, I find similarities on how dueling/wpvp and leveling efficiency work. Both pally and druid are a pain in the ass to kill. You can usually outlast/outrun whoever is messing with you. And while questing/grinding, you can do so without almost never stopping to drink. Buff, heal, melee, repeat.
---
Well i guess time will tell but I don't think it'll require such hardcore players like before. It's no longer a time of trying to overcome encounters and properly specing more than it is just refining what is already known.
---
talents are not new to me but i cant for the life of me remember how i speced back in vanilla so there is going to be some experimentation going on for me, a lot of the old mage specs i am seeing have a worrying amount of points in to arcane and i don't remember going that far down that tree
---
Strath, ubrs, and scholo are the more difficult dungeons.  Usually you start with brd and finish your onyxia and mc attunement.  Then begin to farm gold for your epic mount.  Once you have some decent blues, move into strath and brs.  Scholo is probably the toughest.
---
Really? I swear it was sometime in Cata that I was like "wtf they removed hunter deadzone? you can just autoshot things that are in melee range now?"
---
I don't see anything about deadzone in patch 2.3 notes.
---
Never did get those buttons to work
---
Good to hear!
---
Then good luck with this!
---
&gt; unless you're planning to just beastmastery through it.
---
What's Pandaria and Wod?  Those sound like some excuse of game content that a declining talent development team would release...
---
You best just forget about those silly words and just remember one: Classic.
---
I sat in queue for over 3 hours at various times this week (never got in), I'm not sure more than 5 AB matches actually happened in that bracket since release.
---
Why TBC sucks: 
---
1) Flying mounts
---
2) Draenei
---
&gt; But isn't the GCD 1.5 seconds?
---
It might be! I just know it is more than 1.2 secs but less than 1.6 secs. Which necessitates AT LEAST 2 points in improved corruption. Typically getting all 5 points would be a priority, but then you have to get other things like Imp Drain Soul or Suppression later than you would.
---
I was coincidentally, on chronos the third last night and that is what black lotus was selling for.
---
On the other hand I have no idea what they will go for on classic launch. But then again, this is a level 60 guide.
---
Neither was the rank 1 premade, they are just mechanically more skilled than pserver dribblers. It's been fun to watch the realisation of just how poor some of them are as players.
---
[Here](https://willitclassic.com/addons)
---
I ran a version of Titan panel during the stress-test.
---
Funny I googled “wow classic name reserve” and got loads of results including the blue post itself
---
Mythic raiding is the only good part about current wow that is better than pre mop expansions. Everything else about the game, literally everything else, is garbage.
---
As for the choice which one first, if you go hunter first, you can feed your warrior bags/gear/mount which will help the leveling process a ton.
---
If you have a guild or friends who are going to play, this will greatly reduce the pain, as myself I will be leveling with one of my guild's warriors in the first few days with my druid, as my pain point is 1-10 (warrior helps with that), and while it speeds up from 10-20 with bearform, still not amazing. (Again, having a partner is going to speed that along) And once I hit 20, I just blow past most people with catform.
---
As for grouping while leveling, I am not sure if it's the old style drop quest, where most quest of "collect 10 of X" means you will have to take turns with the drops, or if it's shared so can't say for sure!
---
no need to downvote a legitimate question people. or if someone would explain why they do such things feel free.
---
Shouldn't capturing zeitgeist of AV be the goal?
---
Wait the rush out in NA. EU should take time off for the midnight launch. At least in my country it's immediately after the long summer break, so I expect only neckbeards and university students to be online at midnight.
---
...okay
---
So then the next question is: where do BC quests/zones and dungeons fall? Do quests/dungeons drop better gear than early classic raids?
---
UGGHH, Varian, I'm trying to get around the keep but I'm dummy thicc and my shoulders are too wide to fit through the doors.
---
There really is no rocket science. 
---
Unprocessed food.
---
Get good at food prepping.
---
Drink water.
---
Exercise. Weightlifting to keep the upcoming back problems from sitting 15 hours a day in check and cardio to keep the heart from giving out.
---
Done.
---
Oh damn, I had this keyboard as well. It was a piece of garbage, and I loved it.
---
They tried to make it modular so that you could add different interfaces for different purposes. All that did was make the build flimsy. It had WoW on it tho so it was dope.
---
I had a guild wars one I am such a rebel
---
&lt;gANKPARTOL&gt;
---
&lt;LFG UBRS NVM AB LOL&gt;
---
Was in both on alts and whatnot.
---
How about you just recruit me to your guild. 😬
---
now i know you're just trolling
---
Set bind to Kargath as horde, mages hang out in Kargath and can port you to org all the time.
---
2 races which are amazing for horde warriors: Orc (stun resist), Tauren (hp). The other things that compare are Night Elf (+1% dodge), and Human for the sword spec (from memory, but even then lackluster).
---
So it comes down to raid buffs, which would you prefer, windfury, or kings.
---
Except that without them you wouldn't be able to play official Classic WoW come august
---
I liked the class "balance" in vanilla more personally.  This lead to better class identity and not just a Role.
---
They didn't feel easier at the time, but raiders have been training for years on these mechanics.  Modern mythic raiders will laugh at having to handle one mechanic at a time in Classic.  Gear will be the only factor and the guilds pushing to clear raids the first day will certainly have the gear to do it.
---
I wonder how the Classic community would react to a Mythic version of Classic Raids.  All gear rewards are same power but recolors so the only reward is looking cooler.
---
Can’t have a gaming post without some detached old person preaching the same stupid fucking line over and over. No one dies from gaming too much. Go name me 5 people that you heard of dying from gaming too long off the top of your head. I bet you can’t, because it doesn’t happen.
---
Wait. There was that one time in a Korean bang...
---
So have fun when pserver veterans clear Naxx release within 1½ hours with full worldbuffs?
---
you can't rebuff onyxia buff on naxx progress on private servers either BECAUSE YOU CANNOT USE WORLD BUFFS ON PROGRESSION
---
The goal is to recreate the 1.12 experience on the current game engine. Not to mix and match what people thought were the best parts of the game from various patches.
---
Ohp that's right, I was thinking of trainer spells.
---
Every level is literally double the fun!
---
It wasn't ever a thing. Sorry
---
if classic WoW was about the open world PvP, then WPvP wouldn't vanish the day BGs come out.
---
Sure, i appreciate pservers and the community but their speed kills of the easiest raids in wow history are meaningless
---
No patch rules forever my son. Just enjoy it while it's here.
---
Lets come back to this post when method doesnt get a single world first
---
&gt; 3th
---
Err..
---
I have about 10 people to play with, but I'm the only one who's got that week off, so I'll be quite a ways ahead of them for a while.
---
If I do grouping it would just be my box combo to rush 60. I'm planning on (server stability pending) putting in way too much time during my week off.
---
You act like it's not moronic to think that because someone is good at retail they are automatically good at classic wow.
---
sTreAmRS r bAd
---
Yeah, that's not really how it works. Sounds like it's not something you're familiar with but you're knocking on it. :)
---
Where the fuck do you guys crawl from, lmao.
---
A true legend. you missed ghost mushrooms though, which are great for shadow spell pwr pots!
---
It was kinda neat in that you actually had to "specialize". I suspect, like the new talent system, it was more for the devs' sake and made it easier to balance than it was when we could just pick all the broken/OP low-tier talents we wanted lol
---
If you are mechanically skilled at retail you have all the tools to be good at classic as long as you can be bothered, opposite is not true.
---
That's a statement that I would expect to hear from someone who has no idea about how much time commitment classic wow takes.
---
The honor rewards for winning a battlrground are so lopsided. If honor kills gave more honor then world pvp would matter more. It is utterly bogus that you earn more honor for stomping arathi basin in 5, minutes, than yiu do for killing hundreds of players in the open world.
---
Sweet video - Does troll friend get his own video sometime?
---
If anything deserves attention, this is it. This is definitely the most game-breaking bug to date. Core movement mechanics apply to all classes and mobs, and have drastic implications, both good and bad, pve and pvp, for everyone.
---
Deadzone was the 3 yards between melee and ranged IIRC, so Cata probably just removed minimum range entirely
---
Why it's good:
---
1) Everything else
---
Excellent point made!
---
Yeah. Although it seemed to be more of a problem of one side just not queueing, while there were plenty on the other. Just hearsay though.
---
^^^^REEEEE
---
Shadowmeld on a boat or near a hazard, Mind Control and make them jump off.
---
Way more fun than Fear Ward, you get to be a sexy Night Elf and all it cost you was essentially having no Priest Racial spells :D
---
More TL;DR
---
Pserver raids are stupidly easier. 5.6% parry on private vs 14% parry on Classic, for raid bosses. A 250% NERF. Dodge : 5.6% vs 6.5%. A slighter nerf, but still, A NERF.
---
And that is for Parry and Dodge alone. I wonder how much they fucked up on resistances. And glancing blows. And parry-haste triggering algorithms. And critical chance and misses. Not to mention that all private servers have a mix of 1.12 and a pre-TBC patch (which already nerfed most content).
---
The ONLY thing that was buffed on private servers for raid bosses was armor...but that was irrelevant, because the armor reduction debuffs had the same effect : armor reduction would be close to zero.
---
So, basically, raid bosses on private servers are a JOKE.
---
And over on the dale up in the north, lotuses are going for like 50-60 gold each. But that's likely due to higher population and the dynamic respawns that come along with it.
---
But still, hard to tell exactly what things will cost in Classic.
---
Other side of the coin, for the 1-60 stuff I am willing to bet that there weren't enough people to do any of that content so it was effectively dead. Not sure this is a good solution but at some point, old content just becomes something to level through. Dungeons, raids, elites, etc. are completely skipped because there is simply no one there to group with, particularly with the low population caps. This is just a symptom of vertical gear progression but I dont see how you can go horizontal for 15 years either.
---
Personally one of the reasons I’m looking forward to classic is actually playing WSG again. 
---
I hated cross server BGs because there was something special about world pvp fighting someone you had spent the whole day fighting in battlegrounds. Sometimes you had such a mutual respect for them that you went the other way, other times you had to pay that Druid back for capping the flag.
---
Two different games mate. 
---
Classic WoW players aren't slow if that's what you're trying to say.
---
We had flag as "violence" one time at work -\_-
---
In a way, yes. You're taking valuable coding time and maintenance to put toward this feature when that time could be better spent improving the game in meaningful ways.
---
Also, that would be a really backwards way of designing and implementing features wouldn't it?
---
Yea, dude, I remember playing with a few pregnant women back in 06. Now their children might be helping them out this time around!
---
TBC until Sunwell was just a superior Version of Vanilla.
---
Horde win 90% of all matches except against “esfand” wsg premades. They haven’t even been playing AB as a team though no idea what’s going on.
---
&gt;There's genuinely absolutely no way someone who works 9-5 will ever come close to catching them, so that seems "unfair" to some, I'd think. 
---
This is the exact argument that got us LFR and ridiculous catch up mechanics.
---
Oh I know.  The deadmines and stovkade rewards alone are mandatory.  If I'm on a decent grinding toon I generally just find somewhere quiet and kill.  Westfall is rarely that place.
---
Still sucks mate
---
Good Choices i like these especially Atod! Added!
---
Good ol lefty
---
Unfortunately, the PCs are so overpowered at this point that there really needs to just be a wow 2 that's set far enough in the future that faction allegiances could be completely different among the races. 
---
Dreadlords ain't shit compared to old gods, ashara, or the other legion baddies we've faced and defeated already. Imo they need to make classic servers, tbc servers and wrath servers along with whatever their next expansion is that will hopefully set the stage for their next warcraft game that would then set the stage for wow2. The game was much more interesting when the villains weren't gods and there weren't space ships or other science fiction creeping in.
---
Not that I disagree with you per se. I think you're right in that your idea would be a lot better than another lich king encounter that it looks like they're going to have us do in the future.
---
There are plenty of guides online. I would also recommend using a talent tree calculator to play around with specs. You can use these to move points around and see how your character could be built at different levels.
---
You can be a poor mechanical player and be great in classic, Skarm the tank guy clicks is abilities for e.g. Obviously some classic players would be great in retail (good raiders in my mythic guild raid on pservers) but the skill requirement to succeed is drastically lower.
---
But what if it’s the wrath gate story leading into the assault on the LK?
---
Tldr: teenage girls play alliance, for The Horde bitches! Zug mutha fucking zug!
---
If end-level gear outgeared Outlands gear it'd make Outlands "pointless".
---
it is one of the reason people don't bother with WPvP yes.
---
the other reason is that WPvP is basically never fair in term of number and/or level... and mob aggroing you.
---
another reason is the lack of diversity ; objective in WSG-AB force you to strategize on other than mindlessly killing people.
---
Initially it was planned  for phase 2 with BWL when there were only 4 phases.
---
Now BWL is planned for phase 3 and pvp ranks are TBA. The only thing planned for phase 2 are DM, Azuregos, and Kazzak all of those came before pvp.
---
I think resilience added an interesting dimension to gearing decisions. I remember lots of people debating different builds -- Do I go all out stamina? All out resilience? A balance of both? Skip them and aim for pure damage or healing stats? The correct answer varied by class, comp and spec.
---
And I think it was sort of a necessary evil because you couldn't have things like 3-minute Mages one-shotting people in 2v2. Maybe there were better ways to achieve that though... I didn't like the fact that resilience was a totally useless stat in PvE, sort of made it feel like "fake" gear.
---
Think it may matter by server, I remember gold being $75/1000g on my server.

---
If I rolled a hunter would I have trouble getting into raids later on?
---
But it’s impossible to give players an account that is not a throwaway in any way before the actual game is out. This is the best testing possible.
---
TM vs SS is not "wPvP". World PvP is ganking outside BRM, fighting in EPL, wherever, not running around in stupid deathballs casting spells at each other from range. BGs are fine - they sucked a lot of people who didn't actually want to wPvP into instanced content. 
---
Phase 3/4 are peak Vanilla IMO. Vanilla only starts to go downhill once raid gear becomes too imba and overshadows the rest of the game.
---
You mostly stop hating life in the 40s
---
Yep i actually remember him added!
---
Unless they lower the maximum Respec costs you will have a hard time finding a good raid spot as an enhancement shaman...
---
How so? Isn’t that what the person I was respond to said?
---
On the point of pre-nerf Ctun, it'd be interesting to see if they release it in that state. I've never actually looked at the maths showing it was impossible. Be interesting to see with the current level of play if its doable.
---
You mean mobs having 10% more chance to parry on Classic than what PS have will make it easier?
---
after shrinking, before it was one of the largest zones in the whole game, retail twilight highlands about the size of vanilla barrens
---
It doesn't feel that big because you spend the whole time flying
---
titanpanel / fubar + killcount, goldcount, xptolvl etc..
---
almost everything was trackable through addons.
---
i would prefer a built in solution too. i want to know how often i clear ubrs etc..
---
We are getting cross server BGs. I think WSG was way more fun in classic than later on.
---
Nah I agree it makes no sense to make an invite only beta and invite all the popular streamers.  It makes me salty and it ruins part of the fun.
---
&gt; Not to mention that all private servers have a mix of 1.12 and a pre-TBC patch (which already nerfed most content).
---
Some parts of the data are from well after that, too... For the longest time private server used 2.3 quest XP values without anybody realising. Much of the data that makes up private server databases wasn't captured until WotLK when people realized that the old world was going away forever with Cataclysm.
---
hum, MC is easier than LFR mechanic-wise.
---
of course, if you gather the dumbest of the dumbest you can find, you'll manage to wipe...
---
but there's honestly more stuff to watch out for in modern LFR than in molten core.
---
&gt; You can be a poor mechanical player and be great in classic
---
No. In raids? Sure but not in PvP.
---
EDIT:  
---
&gt; but the skill requirement to succeed is drastically lower.
---
Define succeed because I think you're talking about raiding and extrapolating from that - which is wrong.
---
Explain it to me then. If new content doesn't stack on top of the old but instead remains in the same tier as the old content, what motivates people to keep doing it, or the old content ? 
---
I get that you can use stuff like customization and flair items to motivate people, but I don't think that would go over well for Classic WoW.
---
For the stress tests too? Damn, that's a lottery, I have no interest in Live. :(
---
They should have rebalanced classic with TBC elements and included Karazhan after Naxxramas (like they originally planned), QOL changes like leveling time for alts, longer buff durations for paladins, more balanced specs, dual spec, arenas, more simultanious dots, etc.
---
Not gonna touch it in the old version, as it won't be anything like the original experience anyway for those who experienced it already.
---
**&lt;Get of Fenris&gt;** - Horde - NA West - PvP Server - Mediumcore
---
**What’s it mean?:**
---
“Fenrir” or “Fenris” is the big bad wolf god from Norse mythology who bites off Tyr’s hand (ring some bells?), straight-up kills Odin, and casually ushers in Ragnarok aka the apocalypse. The word “get” in noun form means: an offspring or the total of the offspring. Thus “Get of Fenris” translates roughly into “the children of the wolf god who brings about the end times”.
---
​&amp;nbsp;
---
**Our Philosophy:**
---
Despite our scary name (meant to strike fear into the hearts of the Alliance) The culture is a peaceful gaming environment free of bigotry and general “gamer rudeness” and one in which mistakes are expected to be corrected with regards to guild events such as raiding or PvP premades. Most of us are older than your typical gamer at this point in our lives, and we demand maturity from our members, you know - like how people expect one to act in the real world.
---
**So what about loot and stuff?:**
---
We will be using a EPGP point system for loot distribution and priority. The system rankings for loot priority will be charted on our webpage for transparency. EPGP is superior to DKP for many reasons that a quick google search will tell you. Certain BiS (Best-in-Slot) items from 40-man raids may have pre-requirements to purchase with EPGP. The MT will be loot counseled items during all progression.
---
**What Gets us apart:**
---
We have a built-from-the-ground-up donation system where players may contribute materials and consumables to the guild bank to gain EP and raise their loot priority. This allows top performers an edge, and those who may be busy with life to still have access to end-game consumables if they were unable to farm them. It also provides the guild bank income which will be passed down to our raids. Do you like free enchants? So do we.
---
PvP has always been a passion of many of our members, as such **we will have an in-house bounty system for world PvP in which players can earn EP for the collection of “scalps” (screenshotted 1v1 or 2v2 kills of bounty targets listed on our webpage).** This gives incentive for higher level players to assist lowbies just trying to level who may be getting camped (PvP server), and allows for hardcore PvPers to gain some loot priority in raids. Plus we think it’s cool.
---
A lot of guilds will tell you they encourage a mature playing environment, and they are likely being truthful. Few guilds actually achieve this, but do trust it is a top priority for us so that we may all enjoy our hobby. During raids we demand focus, but we also know how to have fun. We never allow bigotry to go unchecked, and although we sometimes disagree, we respect everyone in and out of guild. We do not brag of our successes, and we believe recognition is achieved through action. Many of us have known each other for going on 15 years or longer and we have already have a strong community. We really look forward to starting a new chapter on Classic and hope we’re a good fit for you!
---
​
---
**A Brief History:**
---
GoF has been a gaming community since 2004 with several hundred members over many MMOs in as many years. We started on Vanilla WoW, achieved a lot of end-game raiding and PvP success, and generally played the game like few then could.
---
**Raid Times:**
---
Phase 1 we will have two (yes TWO) Molten Core groups. East and West coast.
---
East Coast: Sun/Mon 7:00 - 10:00 PM EST. (4:00 - 7:00 PST)
---
West coast: Tues/Thurs 7:00 - 10:00 PM PST (10:00 - 1:00 EST)
---
Members may sign up for either that fits their schedule. Some more hardcore members should be able to raid both events with an alt/main.
---
**Guild Priorities:**
---
Raiding 40-man content (3 days weekly) and PvP (When not raiding. Premades and 20-man content will be ran on non-raid days).
---
**Contact us:**

---
Drop us a line and let’s talk Classic! Our server is already very active with players getting ready.Not playing Horde? Ask about our IRL friends who are rolling Alliance and are good solid raiders. Even though we’re gonna like, gank them and stuff.
---
&gt;but seeing these streamers rip apart every aspect of the game before the release date, while not reporting any bugs
---
You aren't seeing the vastly bigger number of what people not streaming the game are doing.
---
Didn’t work for me
---
Yeah I'd agree with that, you can still rank high as a bad player in classic though.
---
Uh, what? No. You can't change your race. Why do you deem UD to be better than orc?
---
Good points you got there.
---
Though, I would throw another train of thought here. How much of this careful movement we see the Rogue doing is actually the player meticulously deadzoning the Warrior rather than playing specifically around leeway in the clips?
---
Will not be able to buy R14 characters or subsidise the admin's holidays. 
---
Sorry, could not resist.
---
It's almost an early access season at this point. It's going to last a long time and there's a ton of eyes watching it.
---
the thing that WF guilds are extremely good at is adaptation
---
they were able to kill bosses in retail after only seeing them for 1 hour on PTR with 1-3 tries
---
pserver players have more knowledge but they haven't been challenged on this level before
---
I bet on Method
---
lvl 58 mhmmm maybe they want to throttle the playspeed of the 1.2 av by not having epic riding mounts 😂🤣
---
we told you it wont Finish in 5 mins!
---
I think they are getting good info still. But it’s way more about the hype. I got in on day one. I’ve only run into a handful of bugs which all have been pretty minor.
---
ok cool anecdotal evidence vs years of theorycrafting
---
&gt; The goal is to recreate the 1.12 experience on the current game engine~~. Not to mix and match what people thought were the best parts of the game from various patches.~~ because that is the only version they have.
---
  They don't have an older version of AV even if they wanted to put it in.
---
I'm torn between Enhance Shaman, Warrior and Mage. Although it could change before launch. 
---
I've played since late TBC and have mostly mained a warrior. 
---
It's looking like I'll have a duo/trio group levelling but schedules may not line up yet. Unsure what classes they will play. Saying that I'll probably have a trio at max level to play together frequently.
---
I've always focused on PvE but PvP does really appeal with how open world PvP seems to be a focus in Classic.
---
Will 9/10 be going horde.
---
First on server to linen bags gets either early money for buying abilities for a bit or very easy skill ups as people bring the mats to you.
---
Well I think it'd be pretty hard to argue against that this is definitely more of a "hype beta" than a legitimate, thorough testing beta. In fact I figure it might go down as one of the most fruitless betas of all time, testing wise. But that's okay because it isn't about that.
---
If you didn't get an invite, you really aren't missing much that you couldn't just go and experience on an undocumented server (though I discourage you from doing this.) You just don't get to be a toy in a streamers sandbox, which I guess is important to some people.
---
They said there will be cross realm BGs right when they are introduced in phase 3. If that is the case, it will depend more on battlegroup than faction. 
---
Alliance could end up having longer queue but it won't be by much.
---
What percentage of people on the beta do you think are full-time streamers?
---
Played one in vanilla and I'd say its not as bad as you think. You just have more things to play with. You'll use the same 5 or 6 spells the majority of the time.
---
It made it feel big.  Like you were part of an actual world conflict, not a little battleground.
---
explain to me how everyone getting to copy their characters and start on a new server whole new xpac would have the exact same detrimental effect on the population health of said vanilla server? I actually loved tbh, if not for flying and dailies then for classes being fleshed out/balanced and arena. 
---
But i feel any type of TBC progression would harm all either of the servers. 
---
Ex1. Say server A is progressed to TBC, then we lose our classic server "museum piece" and people are left behind, this is an unlikely approach. 
---
Ex2. Vanilla servers allow character copies to the new TBC server, this hemorrhages a vast part of the vanilla servers community, and leaves the TBC server with an authentic outlands release, but a very desolate 1-60 world for all the new BE's and Draenei. This seems most likely.
---
Ex3. Completely fresh TBC servers(?) no transfers, this means a developing world and a very active 1-60 scene for new race players and players in general. This also means having an inauthentic dark portal / outlands launch, with no one having raid gear or any money for flying. I feel this is the least likely approach
---
I can't think of a solution for TBC release unless it was far past the finish of Naxx and multiple releases of progression Vanilla servers
---
Nah, tier 0.5 is the upgraded (epic) dungeon gear like lightforge/shadowcraft
---
I'm pretty set on playing priest, and I pursued my friend into playing warrior. How much will we want to kill ourselves while leveling from a scale from 1-10?
---
&gt; Dreadlords ain't shit compared to old gods, ashara, or the other legion baddies 
---
That's a fair point. That being said, they have had "weaker" antagonists after the PCs already beat some Old Gods. The Iron Horde comes to mind immediately - I can't imagine they are any stronger than Nathrezim. So I am sure they could find a way if they wanted.
---
Honestly, the lore is just so fucked up at this point that I hope they just reset. But I doubt that happens.
---
The PvP balance, the dungeons, the raids and all the zones (yes, even Hellfire, lol). There was something special about TBC, it wasn't perfect (PVP Gear madness and flying mount) but it did so many things right. I hated Wrath though, this is where dungeon finder started and this is where WoW truly went to shit.
---
Anyone remember the shadow priest PvP videos by Nox? I think that was the name but I've been trying to dig them up without any luck.
---
Stoneform i would also say is relevant for post BWL raids. Unless its just a private server thing if you become immune to poison it drops any secondary effects as well. Say a boss hits you with an attck that deals damange tacks on a poison that drains mana? You dont take the initial blast of damage
---
You missed my edit
---
Again: Define succeed. Get high ranks? Get fast kills in raids? Wrong and wrong mate. 
---
Classic WoW is about dominance on the server. It's a turf war that includes all aspects.
---
And as I said, no changes. The game should be an accurate representation of the expansion I played 10 years ago. Flying is an integral part of TBC, and for it to be cut out would mean it would not be an **accurate** representation of the expansion.
---
&gt;	It needs to be what made Vanilla-WotLK great without the things that took away from and eventually ruined the game.
---
So why don’t we take out a lot of the bad parts of classic wow? Why are you trying to remove things from TBC, but not classic wow? Vanilla has many flaws, but they are leaving them in so it can be an accurate representation and experience that was original vanilla wow.
---
You didn't call the 'thought' juvenile. You called the 'thought process' juvenile.
---
While I can see how that can be applied to just the theoretical thought process, it also can easily be interpreted as targeting the person. I'd argue that most would take that as at least a slight insult.
---
Definitely not a false-dichotomy.
---
No problem, the talent icons are in a flatList and the arrows are rendered with specific CSS so that they appear in the right spot. Each arrow belongs to the talent that it points to.
---
Orc Shaman class fantasy is the best imo. Communing with the spirits, being a living conduit for the elements. Swinging axes and maces infused with fire and lightning. And it's not like a mage where you conjure magic and warp and twist it, you're literally working alongside the elements and out of their respect for you and your respect for them, they imbue you with their power.
---
And then the character identity of being super wise and respected among your people, but on the flipside being kind of crazy looking and superstitious from an outside perspective because you're covered in bones and leather and smoking strange herbs.
---
Behind your robe maybe you even look docile and weak, but then someone threatens you or your people so you summon the strength of the earth and go [Master Roshi](http://imgur.com/gallery/AlvnyTS) on them. Yeah... that's nice.
---
[Delet this](https://i.redd.it/hs5bpm5y5s121.jpg)
---
I am not as concerned about the bug reporting as I am the exhaustion of the game. I think most of us can agree that the first play through of WoW was one of the best gaming experiences of our lives, but if 1-60 isn’t a surprise to those new players it makes their experience less significant.
---
world first bad luck no beta invite
---
I never understood Blizzard’s position on this. I’ve never been an RPer or much of a PVPer but when someone says RP realm to me, I assume they mean RP-PVP. RP and PVP just seem like perfect bedfellows. I hope Blizzard sees sense on this one.
---
https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24906-AtlasWorldMapClassic.html
---
ST alone should be enough to do ST IMO. It’s easily in my top 3 classic dungeons.
---
Every single expansion has added good things and bad.  There never was a "perfect" version of WoW.  Some of the most glaring issues: Vanilla had miserable spec balance.  TBC added flying.  Wrath added heirlooms and doubled down on TBC's smaller problems.  Cata had a mostly lousy story and radically changed Azeroth to the point where some old content no longer existed.  MoP had Pandas (hey, we all have biases).
---
Generally, most people feel that Cata is the first expansion that added more bad than good (or at least not enough good to outweigh the perception of the bad).  There are very few people pining to replay Cata relative to TBC and Wrath, so that should basically answer your question.
---
Probably not many but that's not my point.  no one should be streaming the game for months, it might hype people up at first but eventually it kills the hype.  I'm not some anti streamer retard or something I just think it ruins the fun to let people put large chunks of the game on display for months before you can play it.

Honor system is phase 2 with BWL being phase 3: https://www.wowclassiccountdown.com/content_plan_pve_and_pvp/
---
And i killed Chromaggus on the second reset after BWL was released, so pretty much the same as first week.
---
Cap players at 59. All the dungeons will be available, turn off the raids, or provide some testing in raids separately.
---
1) Heal is primary role in PVE, as for druid/enhance sometimes you will be filling an off role. Enhance shaman is usually 1 per raid, for improved weapon totems, nightfall bot and other such tricks. It's quite boring unfortunately but hey it's something!
---
As for Druid, feral offtank is usually 1 per guild, and is a fun role (but painful)
---
2) I can speak to Druid in pvp, it's a blast. The style for druid is attrition (it's SLOW but you can kill basically anyone that way or force them to run the heck away!) As for healer, you have so many tricks up your sleeve it's hard to kill a druid if they are paying attention. There are 2 "main" pvp specs - , FC (flag carrier build, feral/resto hybrid can be used as pvp healer with utility sprinkled in) and pvp feral (basically deep feral, many times taking nature's swiftness for an instant heal).
---
3) RDruid healer is pretty high up there, not a tank healer but amazing for raid healing, having innervate/brez is really nice, but no out of combat rez hurts for 5-man content.
---
A) As for World PVP druids are Nightmare Fuel. They stealth like a rogue, they heal super well, and in the outdoors, can travel form away and re-stealth then re-engage. One of the strongest WPvP class in the game. If you find yourself outnumbered, easy to escape as a druid.
---
B) PuGs not sure if this is related to pvp or pve, so going to speak to pvp, you're still healing, but if you're playing AB and nobody wants to camp a flag, throw on the feral gear and stealth close to the flag (not on it due to flare), and you can either stall, or hold your own against 1 or even 2 people who try to sneak cap the flag. Can't be sapped in cat!
---
C) Premades is where druids are highly prized, especially on WSG weekend. Feral flag carriers are few and far between, but can be amazing when played really well. Engineering/enchanting are your two professions if you want to do the Grand Marshal/High Warlord grind, engineering has a ton of toys for a druid to use to aid their flag carrying experience, and enchanting has the top trinket for ferals (heart of the mountain) which will help when your other toys are on cooldown.
---
Thats druid you imp
---
Negative. If you are looking to book a day off, book the following day off. Just play launch day after work.
---
Wish me luck boys! Last semester of college is August 26. I’m gonna be playing wow classic at least 16-18 hours a day launch week
---
I don't do them personally. One of guild rogues was farming them from DM.
---
Good luck brother! Don't fuck up your health tho, stay safe.
---
so, no person haven't followed anything before 2010?
---
Because if you have to sit a fear as a rogue you've already lost. The fact that you can instantly clear any fear and make yourself immune is too strong. Whereas an orc you maybe will sometimes resist a stun.
---
Either way I would rather sit any stun than a fear.
---
Every single person in the beta was chosen for a reason, be it marketing hype, a proven track record of bug reporting, or simply because they know a Blizzard employee.
---
You don't fit into any of the categories above.
---
And everyone else has the choice to watch it or not.
---
&gt; None of the dungeons in Vanilla mattered, from BRD to Naxx.
---
&gt; whereas in Vanilla you can start getting your Pre-raid BiS gear starting in the late 40s iirc. 
---
See: "niche builds... vanilla had inconsistent itemization."  Raiding rendered most pre-raid gear irrelevant, except in the cases where itemization almost didn't exist, like feral druid gear for most of vanilla or non-cloth caster gear.  New raids usually rendered most earlier raid gear irrelevant.  There were a few cases where the itemization was just bad and that might make something earlier relevant for longer than Blizzard intended, but by and large whatever came in the latest patch was what was relevant and if you couldn't get it... good luck against those who could.
---
&gt; Professions became useless until Outland.
---
They weren't useful until close to max in Vanilla either.  For the first few weeks maybe it was different, or maybe you got really lucky making something useful for a twink while you were leveling a profession, otherwise the only "useful" recipes you got before Artisan were novelty consumables with unique effects... effects that still weren't duplicated when TBC rolled around.
---
The advice was always "skip crafting professions until 60."  I admit I didn't skip them, but they only slowed me down.
---
&gt; Vanilla reputations didn't matter.
---
Only a few mattered at 60 in the first place, and some of the most interesting reps only mattered because of unique rewards that, again, still weren't duplicated when TBC came out, like those rare mount reputations.  Beyond that, raid patches almost always rendered earlier reputations irrelevant.  You leveled a reputation for a single raid, and when you were done with that raid the reputation ceased to be useful.
---
&gt; Most importantly, the leveling stopped mattering too. The game transforms from your character starting at 1 and growing to 60 to simply starting at 1 and then starting again at 58. Nothing between levels 1-57 matters in the end game
---
With rare exceptions, nothing before 60 mattered in the Vanilla end game either.  The game was a race to 60 because "end game is the real game."  I agree with everyone saying that's not a great way to look at it, but outside your experiences and the friends you made along the way very little of what you did before 60 mattered at 60... and TBC didn't prevent you from making friends as you leveled.
---
All that kept zones relevant for 60s in vanilla was raids, high level instances, and the occasional mat farm in high level zones.  TBC didn't do to vanilla anything that vanilla hadn't already been doing to itself.
---
I would only play a Rogue if you love melee and you generally love the stealth/dual wield/energy regen playstyle.
---
I don't think so, but we'll see.  You need a few hunters to either have Tranq shot from 1st boss in MC, or really good gear to tank/heal through Magmadar's enrages.  So most guilds are going to need to clear MC a few times for hunters to get Tranq shot.  
---
Not to mention you have to down the 4 lieutenants in MC, get Rep up with Hydraxis to be able to douse the runes to summon Major Domo, who then summons Rag.
---
&gt; I wouldn't worry too much about fighting for gear.
---
This exactly. Fighting over gear is only a worry at 60, and even then healers get priority in raids right after tanks. And +Healing gear, isn't useful for DPS classes.(+Healing doesn't translate to +Spell Power)
---
The problem with Forsaken Palladins though is the fanbase aside from Forsaken fans demand it never happen. Even though we see undead palladins and see people like Zeiling willingly lighting themselves on holy fire to purify a corrupted Naru.
---
Hey Dirty D, no, Trollgodx isn’t interviewed, just a follow up chat from last week’s episode for some slightly differing opinions to be heard.
---
FPs don't exactly represent the pinnacle of interaction.
---
Don’t you have a job or something bro?
---
I do wonder if this is even a announcement though, to me it comes over as pretty sarcastic, especially the remark that pserver guilds don't look as a threat to them and that it will be "easy". I'm sure the content will be easy for them, i mean Method was already a pretty high ranking guild in Classic. But to call out that pserver guilds are no competition for them seems like a very sarcastic remark, seeing that those guilds have years of experience on Method.  
---
I do expect them to play classic though, i mean the new BFA patch will drop in 2 weeks or something, the new raid opens up in 4/5 weeks i heard, so the World First race should be well over before Classic drops, so they have ample time to play classic as after the progress race they only raid for a day or 2 at most i think untill the next raid hits.
---
Good news for you is they'll probably keep the Classic servers open when they release TBC, so you can continue playing Classic while the rest of us move to the more complete and polished game that is TBC.
---
See, we both win!
---
Leveling after phase 3 is so easy with ice barbed spear at evel 50ish.
---
If they do (which I agree is likely), it's a shame because they have such a good template in OSRS.
---
They are viable in raids, so I wouldn't think so. Just make sure you learn the class so you don't add to the Huntard stereotype.

+1. That's one reason the phased roll-out is fantastic. Play the phases you enjoy. I think Naxx is toxic but I'm not going to say Naxx should be deleted - I just won't play when they roll that content out. If they release BC servers, I'll come back and check that content out. It's absurd to expect others to play exactly the version of WoW *you* like and only play that version.
---
(That's also why I think "1.13" is destined for disaster - nobody can agree exactly what makes vanilla WoW special)
---
Wait, is Classic not considered to be a retail product?  I always used "retail" simply as a means to differentiate official servers from *cough* unofficial  servers.
---
TBC needs to die
---
Not for me. I must say I hated to raid with another 39 ppl, it was such a mess. Half of the ppl slacked and other did not know what they are doing... I prefer more 10 ( hello my beloved Kara ) or 25 raids... So for me TBC was ideal.

Speaking to a druid, the pain part is 1-10. (So find a friend) Before 10 your mana pool sucks, your spell damage is pretty bad, but after that you get bear form and start becoming a warrior. Once you hit 20 you get cat form and become a rogue, and you burn past basically all other classes. (Hunters and warlocks do give you a run for your money)
---
So yes druid leveling is a blast, druids in raid don't use HoT's because of the incredible mana cost, so used sparingly, but in PVP hots are great as you don't have to stand still as much as the other classes to heal.
---
Yeah he was pretty good and some good music!
---
I know it's a joke, but Tiffin Wrynn was blonde.
---
Sorry that I responded on a public message board and you don't like my answer.
---
Another thing to consider is that Druid is for the most part the least functional vanilla class. It doesn't excel at anything really. You can find success with it for sure but you will notice that the specs don't really have much synergy within them and at each thing you do, someone will do it better. I'm not saying it to discourage you, but just to more accurately represent what I believe was an unrealistically positive review of the class.
---
Classic will release right after a progress race, so top retail guilds will have time on their hands when Classic launches. Top raiders probably always are "bored", since they clear new content in 2-3 weeks, and then need to wait (farm) for +- 6 months before the next race.
---
Considering how it went when streamers decided to do a guild on Moon Guard, I doubt it would end well for either party lol.
---
Or because they played back then. The account I got beta access on hasn't been active since TBC.
---
Holy shit this is so entitled... It's literally not about you getting an opportunity to play it - the beta is for two things - to increase visibility to the classic wow project, and to test various technical issues.
---
And before anyone says "these streamers aren't testing shit", being in a beta, and playing normally is a very good way to help test things. Sure if you see something that is glitched or obviously messed up you report it, but it doesn't mean they need to run around for hours on end hunting for bugs.
---
You can experience classic at the end of august
---
I kind of remember the marines being flagged...
---
But its so long ago...
---
But I kind of remember...
---
Throw some \s in there then!
---
I wouldn't mind a sequel. Just enough expansions to make it make sense and then have wow 2. If they're going to do a reset I think they'll have to make a classic wow expansion that isn't tbc and just go from there. I definitely dont see that happening

---
Probably a bit of both, mostly trying to deadzone the warrior I'd imagine.  
---
But we did try the "quick-stepping" in the beta and it does seem to work most of the time.
---
We'll just have to wait for Blizzard on this one though, would take them 2 minutes to confirm it on the reference client.
---
Did you have two accounts that each got one, or one account where they gave you an extra for a friend?
---
one does not simply
---
Works for me
---
Insert 'donald trump wrong' meme here.
---
Incorrect. the goal is to bring us the most complete re-release of retail vanilla, known as classic. 1.12 is the base, but they have several patches (stages) worth of content, as you can read on the forums. To the best of my knowledge, they have named this 1.13; look at the screenshots.  
---
The community has driven much of what content is going to released. Blizzard literally has already been mixing and matching what people thought were the best parts of the game from various patches.
---
I think its even 55 when you can pickup the quest for MC attunement.
---
Look at it this way, let's say best case 100k people are watching the streamers on an on-off basis.  That's still probably less than 10% of the people that will play Classic that first 1-2 weeks.  Average numbers lately have been 40-50k, so 5%.  Even if every one of those viewers get burned out just watching, or lose the hype, there's still the other 90% that don't watch that will be there week 1, ready to go.
---
If you're concerned about everyone else losing hype, it's likely just projection on your end.  You should stop watching streams and keep yourself occupied with other things till August 27th.
---
What this guy said. 
---
They even said that the last wave of stress test invites took a toll on them to pass out. They don't want to spend their time getting a new 10,000 people in the beta when they could just have the same 10k test different things.
---
how do you know how people are going to feel?
---
It's completely different kind of farming than usual grinding.
---
You dont earn as much but you also dont put nearly as much effort/risk for it  also pickpocketing is much faster than actually killing mobs
---
GL hope you don't die bro
---
hehe true, damn it will be a desert after a week lol
---
Besides having the same people test the things is mich more effective than having to explain to new testers each time what are and arent bugs and so on...
---
I don't think it CAN be tested yet because no one has a level 60 on the beta, and I don't think anyone was pickpocket farming with a level 30 rogue alt.
---

---
&gt;Untalented firing range of 5-35 yards, eliminating the deadzone.
---
guess it wasn't important enough to mention, haha
---
For the Horde is already forming a roster, but want to be effective and Have fun, rather than nolife it. No doubt they will still be very fast in killing stuff, since going ultra hardcore won’t be required when everyone is level 60
---
They go with members from all Addons back in the days plus new members that are being invited
---
Not sure about stress tests to be honest, check your battle.net client, should have a button for classic wow, or under the wow button, the dropdown box where you have your live client, might be in there! Good luck!
---
I think it has to do with how slow leveling is. Most people are the ones you don't see in streams who are still leveling and finding bugs. I found one a few days ago in Silverpine forest when I was leveling a new character.
---
There are a lot of zones and instances to test.
---
No, I definitely did mine on my Shaman prior to the AQ war effort beginning.
---
"...but I taunted - why isn't the mob coming back to me?"
---
And sadly, pretty much half of the time the problem will be the DPS guy. God I'm so damn happy that the answer to any and all complaints about Classic will be "get used to it or get out". No more arguing about how things should be, it will be bliss.
---
Nah, they would just stun lock a dwarf
---
This is kinda funny, since I too remembered it being Cata. Then I came across [this](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.3.0_(undocumented_changes)#toc).
---
I cited based on that one, which is not a credible source by no means but since that same info of Hunters I saw on another source as well AND [here](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/patch-notes/4-3-0) is no mention whatsoever about Hunters and range anywhere on any of the patch 4.xx... I simply had to pick lesser of the two evils :p

Alcoholics love dying. My friend who was a wow player/alcoholic/drug addict also died a few years ago. Drove his car right into a tree. Could you imagine these fools on mounts in classic? Keep classic roads safe!
---
If that were the case why the fuck is Druid the third most popular?
---
I mained a Shaman in vanilla and I'm trying out Lock as my main and alting a Shaman. Best of both worlds!
---
That actually makes it the exact definition of a false dichotomy.  It's not an either or.   You don't get to decide the ambiguity of a direct statement.  This isn't an ambiguity fallacy.  If you want to argue semantics (you do) a thought process is still only a sequence of thoughts to reach the final thought.
---
I agree that AQ and Naxx ruin the game. I understand the necessary evil of bgs and the casual audience. Why though did Blizzard make honor kills award such little honor? Killing players should have awarded way more honor, especially in World PvP. Give players multiple ways to rank up. Sitting at stables and winning AB in 10 minutes for 2k honor was a joke.
---
What about for priests? I really like doing dungeons so I plan to group up frequently in Classic. Would I still be able to level at a decent rate if I spec into holy as I go?
---
Yeah I will be 60 before Sunday I think my goal is (server stability pending of course) should take 5-6 days played to hit max. 
---
It's the early zerg in the starting zones that will be the rough part.
---
Less toxicity hopefully

Sorry bro i can't recall that one if i saw i might remember though

you don't need a sub to post on the classic wow forum over there.

Are you messing with me?  I’m on iPhone and Holding does nothing for me.

Thanks to jscoppe and  785432073923458923!
---
This isn’t funny or tasteful.
---
In vanilla Alliance had long queue times, mainly because very few alliance queued for BGs towards the end and the faction imbalance then. 
---
I think it was in Mists that the alliance BG queues started to be faster due to people swapping to the horde with faction changes.
---
If only that were true
---
Less incest?  LOL, someone connect the dots please...
---
To each their own i suppose :D.
---
For me classic feels a bit more "pidgeonholed" and TBC still had class identity
---
You would look like an absolute clown in this shirt. Don't be a walking joke pls.
---
it's been reported so far in the Beta that the big money maker, Rogue's Diary, only sells for 2.5 silver, instead of 45 silver, which was a big reason why pick pocket farming is viable on private servers.
---
Since it appears this gold making nerf is in game, pick pocket farming does not seem that viable come Aug 27. I'm not really sure how rogue's plan to make money in classic... maybe Herbalism at 60?
---
More power to you if this is what you're set on but don't be surprised if you get burnt out. We're all hype on Classic but I'm not sure 60 is going to be worth what you'll put yourself through. I'm of the mindset that its about the journey, not the destination- I'll be enjoying taking my time to 60.

A lot of my friends drink over 5 liters of vodka each week, but in Bulgaria it's considered light alcoholism so... guess I'll have to make alts soon.

There's also just so many people trying to get in. Even if the refreshed the people in the beta every few weeks, most people wouldn't get in.

Warlocks are going to want those ghost mushrooms.

*So get them first.*

Pservers have black lotus respawn time at 6 mins, classic will be around 2 hours. It and everything that requires it will be vastly more expensive than you're used to.
---
Depends on your friends, if one of them is rolling a druid or warrior, I would say mage is strongest for WPvP out of the 3.
---
Enhance is a special case for bg's primarily (not sure about wpvp as an enhance didn't see many), but in 5-mans not the strongest. (Unless you don't mind healing! Which is fine even as enhance)
---
Warrior, if your friends aren't playing one, always use a tank for PvE, and for PvP.... you smash faces literally.
---
You mean that classic feel?

What’s the point of increasing your honor per hour?

People are STILL whining about this?!?

---
Who is willing to bet that the "appropriate gear" will be nothing but green "of the Bear/of the Monkey/of the Eagle" stuff?
---
It could be. The whole layering thing is because that's what blizzard fully expects to happen. They want to pack people on each server in hopes that the few remaining ones one be in a ghost town.

TBC is my favorite, but Resilience ruins PVP for me in TBC. I much prefer the fast paced unbalanced shitfest of one shots and perma CCs. 
---
Dancing around pillars for 10min straight to try to kill a healer in 2's becomes unfun, while you try to prevent priests from full mana burning your healer, and druids infinite kiting you. This is my 11 year old salt about playing War/Paladin and having to play around mana burn, and innervate druids.
---
I just much prefer dying quick/winning quick and going onto the next over losing/winning in 5-10minutes :S
---
yeah, GL ranking up without BGs, it's not even certain servers will sustain Rank 14s

Neither is forcing your familly into griefing by killing yourself at 32 because you were a drunk moron.

You stop thinking in terms of new content/old content so *strictly*.
---
Here's what WoW usually does: Vanilla we have 1-60 and there are various things in it, like gear and craftables, and these items are acquired within the 1-60 world. Then TBC comes out, everything in 1-60 is obsoleted immediately, and all relevant things are now gathered from 60-70.
---
On the other hand, for example, Destiny had a few planets, then got an expansion. One of them they didn't go create yet another planet and sent everyone there. They went back and added a bunch of events to all the planets and sprinkled new zones around and those things would be helpful towards the new endgame. To get to the new zones you'd have to walk through the old ones. Mobs would get upscaled, some useful stuff would be added to old zones, materials remained relevant. Furthermore, many old weapons would remain useful, or could be upgraded through additional quest chains to become useful. Certain items would be retained specifically because of a utility aspect, i.e., they're more useful in one raid vs another, or they're useful for that odd quest, or they're useful for PvP.
---
Things like that. It does require more creativity from developers and a bit of a hollistic approach but I found it a lot more sane than the WoW approach, where every expansion is effectively a new game and the old world just dangles around for no reason, becoming more and more cumbersome and something devs try to smush so that people can race through it to the new pre-cap.
---
This is really cool - I love the timelapse video. You push your glasses up a lot, (I do too).

Keep up the cool work! Can't wait to see rag! (request for Through Fire and Flames by Dragonforce for that one).

Also, props for posting something here other than a complaint about beta access, or other stuff, this is a breath of fresh air.
---
yeah I do! I added the Aaron Smith song, thanks for that suggestion!
---
Also hold overs from WC3.
---
Im really stuck on wanting to play a mage or warlock. Mage for farming and money and food for days, but warlock has the best class fantasy but im also hesitant on them because wasnt in vanilla where warlocks just spammed shadowbolt for their rotation and nothing else?
---
I can smell the sweat from here
---
&gt; as well as the database that blizzard is using, uses new code, logarithms
---
IMO they should stick to the natural logarithm.
---
I will be playing a Tauren Hunter, mostly for nostalgia as that was the first class I leveled to 60.  
---
Also, for the Horde racials for Hunter, it's actually pretty even.    
---
Trolls are probably best in terms of overall, but it's close.    
---
Orcs are the best for PvP and the axe bonus helps if you become a nightfall bot.    
---
Tauren have a very useful stun, extra hp which is both helpful in PvP and PvE and nature resistance.   
---
The unspoken thing about Tauren is they have the longest melee attack range in the game - which means the deadzone for a Tauren hunter is literally 1 yard.
---
Blizzard just need to invite more people, but are they going to do it ? Who knows
---
Me
---
You forgot mana burn for priests.
---
More overall honor.  More efficient in the grinding you're doing.  If you are needing to gain several hundred thousand honor in a week then gaining more per hour is very important.
---
&gt;Honor system is phase 2 with BWL being phase 3:   
---
&gt;https://www.wowclassiccountdown.com/content\_plan\_pve\_and\_pvp/
---
I stand corrected. However, it's not sure Rank14 will be sustained on servers. Most likely not on PvE servers before BGs.
---
&gt;And i killed Chromaggus on the second reset after BWL was released, so pretty much the same as first week.
---
And did you do multiple raids to funnel gear to mains?

Here is her character
---
Ok I'm choosing to watch and I'll definitely be playing classic less as a result.  It's not a beta it's a showcase.
---
No debuff spec works in classic. You don't have the slots for it to work.
---
Horde racials are very pvp focused. WOTF for undead, breaks a ton of CC's, Orc resist stuns, Warstomp is a stun.
---
So anyone with a fear (Warlock/priest) great when horde. Anyone with a stun (rogues) are better when horde. And any healer, better when not facing down a tauren.
---
There's another thing to be said about shaman totems, which are amazing. Things like grounding totem eating a spell (can eat a polymorph, deathcoil or pyroblast), tremor totems breaking fears/charms, and windfury on warriors can be pretty scary.
---
worked great in vanilla if you get a few guild twinks and gold dkp system for mc ony and even bwl
---
Why do you need all that honor?
---
We don't really know yet.
---
Exactly, its not something that everyone should get a 'turn' with. 
---
We're not all winners - welcome to life.
---
This is ridiculous, you sir, commiting a crime against gnomity.
---
Jokes aside, everytime I play a gnome it looks and feels adorable but after a while I start to get annoyed because gear looks absolutely terrible on them and I feel like I'm not progressing at all.
---
I think flying ruined the level design
---
What? You want real shadows? Obviously retail is the game for you, not classic!
---
If they want to do TBC servers - fine.  But people should have to transfer they character to them without being able to come back to classic servers.  
---
Classic servers NEED to stay unaltered and pristine after all phases are done.  It would be dumb to upgrade them and transition them to TBC servers after all of this work.  Not to mention, I have no desire to have those changes in my game.  I want WoW to just end at level 60.  I've played the rest...and it doesn't compare.
---
Huh. Could’ve sworn it was Nijmegen and summergale. Oh well good song either way.
---
I resto shaman tanked phase 3 of an only kill in late vanilla. It wasn't on purpose. Too many people took damage during phase 2. Chain heal is so op in a 40 man raid.
---
Where did they say this?
---
It used to be worse.  You used to have to maintain the rank to use them.
---
Lol. Honestly shadowmeld is better than perception in most circumstances, but those other NE priest specific racials are just so lack luster.
---
St is hell lol but a must do
---
wtf, no it isn't??  
---
they're adding layering because they're fully expecting thousands of people running around in the same zones for the first 4 weeks
---
Wow, that's a lot of confirmation-bias sperging. My favorite example is as follows;  
---
Nelfs: lose tree, well  
---
Author: KEK! FEKIN' TARDZ!!  
---
Orcs: lose entire planet, their minds  
---
Author: ZOMG SO BADAZZ!  
---
If you roll horde, you'll be on the side of people like this. Remember not to leave your mud hut without your Hot Topic giftcard and your Virginity to protect you.
---
Yeah, this tacit acceptance of Asshole Culture in recent years is ridiculous and obnoxious. You're playing a game with a huge social component. Fucking with people of the opposite faction is part of the game. Fucking with people on your own faction makes you an asshole.
---
I'm sick of this bullshit. Being an asshole is a character flaw, there is something wrong with you if you enjoy being an asshole. People are going to call assholes out for it and it's time they learned to deal with it like normal people.
---
When I played warlock, I never carried food/drink in my bag. I never really needed to. (Lifetap + drain life, unlimited mana!)
---
As for rotations, all casters are 1 button in classic (sorry) but at least in pvp it's dynamic!
---
Anybody I get into wow I immediately show them nyhm lol
---
Whoa whoa whoa... We simply do that as a form of conservation you guys flush your crap into the river. We use ours to grow things.
---
Mostly dried semen, but the crust on W,S,D is prob mostly sweat. /Shrug.  *Who knows*
---
Sounds like a whole lot of your own self created problem.
---
That's what she said.
---
Because they need a basis for starting somewhere. They very well could take out the "bad parts" of Vanilla WoW, assuming it passed the vote by a super majority.
---
There's no reason the game needs to be an "accurate representation" of the game you played. It just needs to be the best game it can be.
---
I think some clever rogue should be hired by people doing farming in highly contested spots to stalk around and assist them if someone from the opposite faction tries to gank them. Or even more funny, pay a rogue to stalk someone farming that is on YOUR faction to reduce competition for yourself, that would be funny.
---
Leveling is actually harder
---
They don't scale in Vanilla. 
---
They're useful because shifted imp is unkillable and provides HP buff, because you can sac suc for +15% damage, and because you can spec MD and tank Twins with felh. But that's it.
---
Honest talk, you’d have better luck on the pve realm. 
---
People who roll on pvp expect adversity, from experience playing on rp-pve people freak out easily there.
---
World first is stupid; world first happened 15 years ago. 
---
Speed running eh, humans Are by their nature competitive and want to show they're better than their peers.

Probably cant use it due to no digital signatures on the drivers.

"big streamers will have no affect on Classic"
---
Old AV needs to come back. What needs to change is how players earned honor in old AV. The main reason Blizzard changed AV was because players were complaining that the honor rewards were so low. AV would last so long that you often wouldn't receive the completion bonus. Honor kills from other players gave such little honor. Honor kills in general didn't award enough honor compared to winning a battleground. In Old AV the diminishing returns from honor kills often resulted in players earning almost no honor for kills. The honor for completing objectives in Old AV was also too low.
---
What if players received a big honor reward for every 30 minutes they were active in old AV? You wouldn't need to be present at the completion, but could instead receive a substantial bonus for being active. Of Blizzard reworked the honor distribution and gains in Old AV, then it would have solve a lot of its issues. Old AV had some of the best PvP fights in WoW. It felt more like a World Zone than just another battleground. Blizzard should bring back Old AV it was a defining aspect of classic WoW. Award players with a bonus every 30 minutes for being active, and rework the honor gains from objectives.
---
Deadzone will still get you murdered by good players a lot, but it's a start fixing it.
---
&gt;I would just implore the playerbase to enjoy it
---
Don't tell us how to enjoy the game.
---
Asmon is a moron, what else is new?
---
Except +2 range in this context is nearly a 50% increase.
---
&gt;So many people will rush to 60 and miss the experience that levelling could provide. Raids will be cleared almost instantly and people might moan about lack of content.
---
&gt;honestly it just means who will sleep the least and level the most efficiently.
---
Let them. There'll be players of each type.

Pve realms are kind of safe haven for walkinadressaroundtheworld kind of guys

You don't get to tell people how they play the game or how they'll enjoy the game best. Speedleveling, speedrunning, world firsts, etc are the most fun things WoW Classic has to offer to a lot of people. Doesn't mean you have to join them.

---
I’ve really been trying, but still haven’t figured out a good way for the user to “catch up” if they’ve ran out of quests and outleveled tons of content. By the time you picked up the guide, questing had already started becoming significantly more linear since you were ahead of schedule and content becomes gradually harder to outlevel. If someone ran out of quests around level 20 and picked up the guide then I honestly think the quickest way to fix your situation would be to start over entirely. You’re progressing a dozen different questlines in like 5 different zones on both continents all at once, so catching up would take forever and you would still be missing out on all the benefits of doing level appropriate content.
---
What you described sounds a lot like questie. Having access to a proximity addon like questie enhances playing greatly, especially if you’re going to be playing ridiculous hours in zombie mode. A friend of the project recently managed to convert all the spawn points for monsters into a format that I can use, so I’m in the design phase of creating a tool that shows you this information on demand in a hopefully elegant way. That being said, even if I manage to pull it off, I’m still going to be using questie when leveling.
---
I’m not sure what you meant with the first point, but I recently added a link button to the sidepanel which copies a direct link to your clipboard that leads to the exact page you’re viewing. Like this: [http://vanilla-questing.me/orc/350](http://vanilla-questing.me/orc/350). It should make reporting bugs a lot easier.

Thanks for your feedback!

I need help on Mage or Warlock.

I played a Mage my first time through the game (started in BC, played through Cataclysm). 
---
I love playing a caster, but I feel like I want to change it up. I'll be playing pretty casually but would like to find a guild to eventually raid with when I get to 60. I'll be duo leveling with my fiance who wants to play a priest. 
---
Some questions I have:
---
How is Warlock more enjoyable to level than mage?
---
How is Mage more enjoyable to level than Warlock?
---
How annoying is having to hold Soul Shards?
---
Are there multiple viable specs to level a Lock?
---
What is it like raiding with a Lock? Am I just on fear duty?
---
Any other input?!
---
We were all level 60 and in raid gear by 1.12
---
It's not my problem it's blizzards.  It doesn't matter to me when I get bored of classic I have other games to play and it sure as fuck ain't retail.
---
Yes. You are correct, but they are increasing the player caps per individual server above what was seen in vanilla.
---
then you can never get that high rating because you're only facing people with that BIS gear because they crit you to high hell 9/10 games and you never see a single crit.
---
&gt;In my mind what made classic so great was that people really didn't know what they were doing.
---
YOU probably didn't know what you were doing. World first players knew what they were doing.
---
That has what it ALWAYS has meant. It has never meant "the best players in the world killed a boss". It was always "these people put in the most amount of work and time"
---
Better racials? You smokin' crack? Implying Human racials aren't some of the most OP in all Vanilla. Also, Dwarf Priest Fear Ward.
---
I swear, Horde players live in a bubble.

I am the weirdo that likes Undercity... but also I liked Ironforge so much I would stealth in with my Undead Rogue and just look around/people watch/maybe gank flagged players like an ass.
---
I'm almost certain they will be in game from the start. Like Maraudon. Hurts no one.
---
Speed running is a cool thing to me - I want to see a guild get through MC in 40 minutes or less, or BWL in 30 minutes, I want to see leaderboards for bosskills, how fast can you do vael? How fast can you do tougher fights that require resistance gear, that kind of thing.
---
World first is off the table imo, but speed records could easily be the 'new meta'
---
+ Mebooga has to be blacklisted by the entire server asap
---
Lol. I think school sets people up for this kind of thinking. 
---
Hell they made me think 50% was a passing grade but I see people hobbling by at like 10% all the time
---
Stormwind.
---
If is amazing but sw holds a special place in my heart
---
\#4 was the one I watched the most. Introduced me to Soilwork and Silverstein which are two of my fav bands.
---
If you are trying to rank up in the pvp ranks, you need it.  In Vanilla I only hit rank 11 (for the cheap epic mount) and I think it was around 400k or so that I did that week.  Rank 12+ people are getting 500k honor or more per week.  If you wanted to pus for rank 14 some of those guys were having to get 1mil or more honor per week to hold or move up. The exact amounts of honor you would need changed server to server, but even in less active servers you still needed 100-200k per week to keep moving up the rankings on the higher side.
---
yes of course, there's going to be a lot more players than on release back in 2005 lol
---
And I would imagine quick-stepping *should* work in the Beta, for there obviously is a leeway present. Is there actual leeway in the clips of the old era, only Blizzard can tell for sure.
---
And possibly the most annoying thing is that indeed it would likely take Blizz a small time to actually double check this. Thus I advocate the highest possible visibility for this discussion :)
---
We'll just have to wait and see like you said.
---
They would need to have made a first Warcraft movie for there to be a second one.
---
So yes, useless in terms of their own damage. :( boo.
---
You forgetting Josh?
---
## Method is going for World Firsts in Classic........  AGAIN
---
Cause you know, it was already done before.
---
I'm on Android, don't know if Iphone has some fucked up icontrols or not
---
Just let them, if they can find they own goal withing the game more power to them.
---
If they don't and quit soon well ... they wouldn't have lasted long anyway IMO.
---
People have been playing vanilla private servers for over a decade, that means something.
---
Classic will be successful, live long and prosper and have its own audience, BUT it won't be for everyone, that's fine too.
---
heroics into Kara&gt;gruuls lair&gt; magtheridons then pushing into the scary raids after that like ssc and Tempest keep. Its imo the games progression that has felt like progression
---
I can deal with the semen, now the sweat... that’s unacceptable
---
I left about 3 or 4 months after Wrath launched, decided to see what the game was like now earlier this year. Quit again after a single month.  It's barely the same game.  Everything has been dumbed down, simplified, and gutted.  It was depressing, especially after spending years on a TBC private server.
---
Lol have an up vote m'lady.
---
Which is NOT against the ToS btw.
---
And a shitty tank!
---
It’s cross server just no one is queuing.   I’ve waited 6 hours before without it popping.
---
I'm streaming so if you attack me you're a stream sniper LUL
---
Ofc he does, dying players suck
---
What you're describing is the same vertical progression you see in Vanilla WoW though. Yes, it's not a hard cut like you see with an expansion, but it's still a vertical progression where old content becomes obsolete as you climb the ladder. 
---
That was my original point, that even if there's no hard cut content still goes obsolete when there's more desirable content to do. You're not running Gnomeregan as level 60, you're not spending time in Westfall as 60. As long as there's new content that offers more desirable rewards old content falls to the wayside.
---
Just because they re-used old content in a patch it doesn't mean it doesn't go obsolete again. Like they could re-do STV to become an end-game level 60 zone after Naxx, but then it just means you're spending time in STV instead of Plaguelands. And any new content would mean you spent time with that instead of the re-done STV.
---
God, my friends/guild are all playing alliance and I’m reluctantly joining them. This made me hate myself.
---
On a slightly different note, can you gain control of a player of your own faction by mind controlling a mind controlled target?
---
It’s not Vanilla.
---
Yeah I watched a guy alt tabbing between arena in retail and leveling in the beta
---
Ironforge, as an Orc Rogue.
---
Don't forget STV! It's one if the best leveling zones available.
---
It makes the sense of progression worthless yet again, except if you're going for ultrra high key. Do mythic +, get better gear that allows you to do higher mythic +, rince and repeat ad vitam eternae. Why even bother?
---
I’m calling the police...
---
It's been very hard to get queue pops at 40 as well. People were sitting in queues for 4+ hours with nothing at 40. There just isn't enough players on the server.
---
Warlocks were feared in every stage of vanilla from what I remember.
---
Ironforge is the best and the rest aren’t even close. But since I play horde I’ll say undercity is next best.
---
Not sure about priest to be honest, never played one.
---
I did find: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/priest-leveling-classic-wow
---
From memory as well, you're wanding a lot which can get really boring real fast. Most priests go shadow for leveling to speed things along. With that said you can heal dungeons easily as dps spec priest/shaman/druid. If you are leveling a priest, your gear will still be effective for healing.
---
That's a HARD disagree from me. Flying ships don't nearly give the same cool feeling of embarking on journey across a fantasy world as actual ships do. I've played both Horde and Alliance and in terms of this aspect, Alliance wins easily.
---
Don’t tease me just please me
---
when you're playing prem vs prem especially in AB as a mage your only job really is to just slow them down PEAL them from gy or base to another base xroads etc and stop them from getting to other bases and just CC as much as you can especially at this level when you have 0 spell power casting full frostbolts and being useless is a no go :)\~ . you can only do so much at this level was just spam sheeping rank 1 healers to stop cast if you're referring to that.
---
Thunderbluff 
---
Ironforge
---
Stormwind
---
Orgrimmar
---
Undercity
---
Darnassus
---
Everything pre cata was gold, that's why we want it.
---
Soon as I join the group they start beggin for water, coulda dropped a few gold and just gone out and bought it. But now they got a mage so know that nobody brought it, it’s a good thing I’ve got two full bag spaced allotted

---
Remember him primarily being big in TBC. Can't recall any content of his that wasn't related to TBC.
---
I actually remember at this point I had a super spoiled teenager Alienware Area 51 Aurora and prior to that I used an hp from walmart that it was 50/50 if I loaded fast enough to walk off a zep or boat in time.
---
What are you on about
---
You could level as shadow and still heal dungeons leveling up.
---
My old guild is actually getting back together again but they want to play Horde on a PvP server. This is compounded by the fact Tauren cant be priests in Classic. Guess I'll just have to roll a Dwarf priest on a PvE server whenever fuckery on the PvP server becomes too much
---
Did he report him for killing him or for spamming chat? Pretty sure spamming chat with words the other faction can understand is against the rules.
---
Of course. It wasn't my intention to insult all fans of Classic, only the few overaggressive ones.
---
Maybe exactly day one will be larger than the first release but no the game won't be anywhere near as popular. The game was highly anticipated when it was brand new. There was millions of people joining and they had to constantly add new servers. That's actually unlikely to be the case this time around.
---
I can somewhat agree to your point. But only if the balance changes over time :). A static imbalance is sad.
---
You cant clump PVP into a single category. You need to specify what kind of pvp. (bg pvp, wpvp, 1v1, WSG, etc...)
---
 Lot of people are missing the point that the stats page keeps track of boss kills, deaths and a lot of other things that are of interest to people. Can't avoid the trolls in the toxic subreddit that gotta pop up and go "hurr you need to stay in retail" to anything people say sadly. I been waiting impatiently for blizz to have its own classic servers for over a decade but sweet christ it can be hard to be associated with alot of the internet loonie white knights the thing attracts.
---
They have used the nerfed version of AV,it doesn't last that long
---
Better feed that owl, brother.
---
Will be dead during euro hours instead of the other way around.
---
Ah I see.  Thanks, was just wondering.
---
3 DAY AV BOIS
---
I am so fucking hyped I'm vibrating right now!
---
Not again the TOS, Blizzard recently came out to say that they will not monitor individual interactions like this.
---
Agreed... And TBC is my home too.
---
Stats would be fine but there's a risk that if they're built in, some crazy people ask for stat screenshots instead of achievements. Or that there's an addon that "converts" stats to "achievements" one can link.
---
Now, if they're not built in, the same can happen but is even more unlikely.
---
Tbh, I wouldn't mind if Blizz kept stats, but they won't, just to stay safe.
---
Fuck Gnomes. I'm in the same position as the OP and literally the one thing that is making me doubt if rolling Alliance is a good idea, is the existence of Gnomes.
---
Well being an entrepreneur gives you some benefits and freedom :D
---
And if you already have an epic mount and you don’t need the R12/R13 gear, then what’s the point of farming honor as fast as possible? Either for people who already reached R13 once or who are better geared through BWL, or who are explicitly not intending to do the honor grind.
---
Because that’s just Phase 3. What about after you don’t want the gear?
---
It's my pleasure! I'm just glad to spread my love with people who would get it :)
---
&gt; he was reported for stream sniping.
---
How can you prove that lmao
---
Thanks! I hope the same lol
---
Definitely a joke. They have already said that world first in classic isn't interesting because it's a solved problem. Scrype thinks world first in classic is a joke and probably laughs at those private server guilds.
---
what do you mean? ranking will be just as easy without bgs since the honor cap will be lower. you have no idea how the ranking system works
---
El Oh EL
---
"I want old AV....except change it"
---
Sorry buddy, nerfed av it is - we'll all be able to pla- watch it this weekend :)
---
What do people like about female trolls? I tried one in the stress test and my goodness the running animation is the goofiest shit I've ever seen. The hairstyles are god awful too. Undead females are pretty cool tho yeah.
---
To add to this, Warlocks generate a TON of threat, and have no way of dumping threat - so potions of invulnerability are your friend.  
---
Because of this, Horde warlocks always have it tough in PvE as they don't get blessing of salvation, but one of the better things about end game gear is warriors start to do a lot more threat - so end game warlocks start having to worry about threat a lot less - combined with good gear they can start to compete with mages on the dps meters.

I don't know how I feel about using 3rd party means to go out of my way to maliciously ruin the experience for another player just because he's streaming
---
- More enjoyable to level? Hit and miss. If you are just straight up questing, yes. Having a pet allows you to speed through things quicker. (And mount at 40 for basically FREE!) But Mage can AOE grind. (And portals). AOE grinding as a mage can speed things along, as you can grind in areas which will not be as populated as questing zones.
---
- Anoying to hold shards? Quite, but some guilds prioritize ony bags to warlock for shards. As well as there's a soulshard bag which will be pretty easy to get (tailoring made)
---
- 2 for endgame PVE raiding - SM/Ruin and DS/Ruin (Shadow Mastery or Demonic Sac). If you are the token imp bot for your raid group, you will be running shadow mastery over demonic sac. For leveling, there's a bunch of random builds that work!
---
- Raiding, you aren't using fear unless told to, banishes in MC can be very important but that's why guilds bring a few warlocks, but most bosses, mashing the shadowbolt button.
---
Not on his first videos.
---
Also, my video has me in crappy gear and I'm doing pretty damn okay. It's not mage level of zero gear dependency, but you can seduce-nuke just fine and have lots of CC so you don't need as much gear to kill people.
---
Most people are out for a very good reason: way too many thinking a beta is early access.
---
Beta is NOT to "experience" Classic, it's for reporting bugs and help fixing them.

If you roll with succ, dont use soul link. She will die extremely fast, even more so if she becomes the primary focus. Soul link is great with void or felhound.
---
Imo, succ is actually viable dungeon dps spec. She cc, then you clear trash fast with her improved lash. 
---
Endgame pvp you're better off with soul link in BG and dog cause silence, maybe void if you're heavily focused. 10% phys reduc and sac shield very good. Or conflag and seduce spec. It's really ez world PvP and fun nuke. Seduce, elements, soul fire, drop immo and let succubus whip em good, conflag, searing pain/shadowburn for finish, gg.
---
THEY ARE! I've always felt that way at least. Zeppelins don't fit a fantasy universe nearly as well. Getting on an actual ship feels much more immersive to me.
---
That's a great point. That sounds like the most fun route for me to take. Thanks! I do worry a bit, however, that people are going to keep the mindset of minmaxing for dungeons, making it harder to find a group. Hopefully I can find a good guild or other players who just there to have fun. I'll worry about tuning a good healer spec when I hit 60.
---
All beta characters are throwaway characters.
---
That's like watching porn and not jerking off
---
I just want to open with reiterating that I'm not arguing with you. I really liked TBC and would love to bring that content back if there was a way to insure that pre-TBC content won't be deemed irrelevant, either by adding TBC servers or some other ingenious idea that no one has thought up yet. But here we go:
---
&gt; See: "niche builds... vanilla had inconsistent itemization." Raiding rendered most pre-raid gear irrelevant, except in the cases where itemization almost didn't exist, like feral druid gear for most of vanilla or non-cloth caster gear.
---
You're right that Vanilla had a lot of irrelevant specs. There was no doubt less options per class, and even less options per slot. A few people can see this as a positive, as it made your class far more unique if you had a role that no one else could fill, but it made forming raids much harder and it gave players far less freedom so I'd consider it a net negative.
---
&gt; New raids usually rendered most earlier raid gear irrelevant. There were a few cases where the itemization was just bad and that might make something earlier relevant for longer than Blizzard intended, but by and large whatever came in the latest patch was what was relevant and if you couldn't get it... good luck against those who could.
---
Except that "irrelevant" gear was needed to progress in raids. BWL gear didn't make MC gear irrelevant because you needed MC tiered gear to raid BWL effectively. Professions required mats that only dropped from previous raid tiers and previous dungeons, and those mats would not be required to level professions to max in TBC, making those mats and those raids and those dungeons totally irrelevant.  
---
&gt;They weren't useful until close to max in Vanilla either. For the first few weeks maybe it was different, or maybe you got really lucky making something useful for a twink while you were leveling a profession, otherwise the only "useful" recipes you got before Artisan were novelty consumables with unique effects... effects that still weren't duplicated when TBC rolled around.
---
&gt; The advice was always "skip crafting professions until 60." I admit I didn't skip them, but they only slowed me down.  
---
I'd say their usefulness was mixed depending on the profession. Keeping up with Engineering for instance would give you valuable burst and control in the forms of target dummies and dynamite. Those aspects were as relevant as ever because leveling in TBC and Vanilla was from what I remember completely unchanged, but exactly where you mention the professions started to become relevant is where they can be completely *ignored* in TBC. Late game, highly valued recipes that were dropped from dungeons and raids are now absolutely worthless. In a general sense, professions wound up in the exact same spot they were in before - they were required for end game content. Where my gripes stem from is that all of the end game recipes and crafts in Vanilla were - of course - made irrelevant.  
---
&gt; Only a few mattered at 60 in the first place, and some of the most interesting reps only mattered because of unique rewards that, again, still weren't duplicated when TBC came out, like those rare mount reputations. Beyond that, raid patches almost always rendered earlier reputations irrelevant. You leveled a reputation for a single raid, and when you were done with that raid the reputation ceased to be useful. 
---
Again, this is just an issue of TBC just replacing one end game suite of content with another instead of adding on to it. All those (few) reputations that were worth grinding in Vanilla are a waste of time, which makes them, again, irrelevant.  
---
&gt; With rare exceptions, nothing before 60 mattered in the Vanilla end game either.  
---
Lots of attunement quests start in the 50s. There's a few trinkets you can get around level 40 that are relevant in end game (Carrot on a Stick hype). High level zones had gathering nodes and enemies that dropped mats relevant for end game.
---
Then TBC launches. Those attunement quests? Waste of time, just get to 58. Those trinkets? Vendor em. Those gathering nodes and mats? They won't help you get to TBC profession skills. **Irrelevant.**  
---
&gt; All that kept zones relevant for 60s in vanilla was raids, high level instances, and the occasional mat farm in high level zones.
---
And TBC made all that kept zones relevant for 60s in vanilla irrelevant.  
---
tl;dr: TBC is a good game. Arena was a welcome addition. Classes were far more balanced. But it irrevocably altered the 50-58 experience for WoW, and completely replaced the 58-60 experience in Vanilla with just more leveling. Entire dungeons basically ceased to exist since they weren't an effective way to level, some of which are now claimed to be the best dungeons WoW has had (BRD, DM). So I don't want TBC to replace Vanilla *again.* 
---
PS: Cloak of Shadows was an abomination.
---
Downloaded and rated, thanks for a clean, lightweight app, OP.
---
Walking into a cave you won't see 87 mining nodes in it all up and ready to be mined.
---
it's definitely something to consider. There is still the added benefit of having the corruption on the target .4 seconds sooner and not losing that .1 sec on cast time.
---
That latter is a bannable offence. The former is a legit contract and has been known to happen in vanilla.

Use to pvp to that song on loop for hours
---
Cheers! Health comes first also here and the whole preparation process will be built around it. :) 
---
It'll be interesting to see how hopping into nolife-simulation for a bit over week will affect me, a "normal person".
---
Then my memory might have been a bit hazy there. Maybe it's because on Alliance side you have an actual story reason for doing that quest chain, so I was more invested than with the Horde part.
---
I'm doing that as well.
---
1~2 weeks without going outside is not that unhealthy
---
You should also consider druids for tank healing.   IIRC they have the most efficient direct single target heal in the game (aside from paladins with high crit).
---
Human get's a +spirit racial and gnomes get a +int racial. I don't think you could go wrong with either.

Worth it? Well if you think fun is the main objective then yes.

Well, without BGs most people will not actively pvp. And with less people getting 15hk every week the number of Rank14 every week will be lower, if any will be available at all.
---
Seems like you don't know how the ranking system works.
---
I plan to book week after launch, if anything. Launch days can be fun in their own way but are often a fiasco. I.e., servers down for hours.

Gold DKP for MC. Since Rag magic damage was off I never saw a single fail on MC pugs on private servers and it was simply a matter of grinding the gold or running +5 MC gold dkp runs until you could buy a decent epic drop or farm herbs for a week and trade them at AH for gold and then get an epic in MC. Best system ever and it will be live if Classic manages to keep a stable server pop of at least 3k. With gold DKP runs there is no need for inspection, damage meters or lengthy discussions about loot. Nobody joins who has zero gold and thus you filter out all of the scammers and afk players before they enter the door. Similar to how a free market works IRL. You also have a main tank with super gear and 2 to 3 officers ( off tank + healer ) in epics who take a 15 % cut of the total pool of gold and the rest is given out to players who don't need on loot.
---
Exactly my plans! 
---
I've lived sort of healthy life (have backround in competitive sports) but it's been a bit worse for the past few years. I'm going to look everything possible up and try to maximize every small detail, which will help me to get the leveling done as fast as possible = staying focused all the time.

14 year old dried semen- Priceless
---
It wasn't fun or worth it as far as gaining honor. Anyone who was ranking would leave that game relatively early on and queue for the other battlegrounds until it was over.
---
The only way to break a turtle in those old AV games is if half of one team leaves so that the other team can make progress while the game is 40v20.
---
&gt;Does anyone have any thoughts?
---
My thought is that WoW is fifteen years old and that expecting people to "stop and smell the roses" is absurd because they've already done that once, twice, three times, five times, ten times, who knows how many times - this content was around for a long friggin time before Cata hit.
---
Thank you very much! I tried my best to make it as epic as possible!
---
Pre naxx bis for dps classes are ashjre'thul for hunters, ancient qiraji ripper for melee, and sharpened silithid femur + royal scepter of vek'lor for casters.
---
The rank 14 weapons are better than all of those, especially for orc warriors since the rank 14 weapons are available as axes.
---
its 1.12 av
---
Then you own that and play a badass manlet!... or just remake the character. Random would actually be better imo, would add a sense of realism to the game. If you gave people the option to change the character's height manually, most would make their characters super tall.
---
Skipping pulls and tiptoeing around groups in lower level dungeons always seemed weird to me. It's all XP, isn't that why we are here?
---
This is why I am leveling all classes up to 20 before going any further.  There are so many people that are leveling to 40 and complaining they can't get higher.  Umm do your job and test.
---
So i have like 2 questions:
---
I think i wanna roll as an Rogue this time.
---
I´m mainly interested in PVP.
---
1: Race
---
* As i´m going to roll Horde there's UD or ORC.
---
2: Profession
---
* I know ENG &gt; rest but how good is leatherworking if we look at it from a pve focused side.
---
EDIT:
---
My brother wanna play a Hunter mainly for PVE, also Horde, what Race and Profession would be the way to go?
---
U smoke bro?
---
Depends.    
---
There are usually only 3-4 hunters in a 40 man raid, so generally speaking they are not a highly sought after class like mage or warrior where there are usually 7+ of those.    
---
That being said, hunters are still absolutely vital beyond MC as they are the only class that can dispel enrage and successfully kite the required mobs in BWL.  
---
Hunters are competitive on the DPS meters through MC and BWL, they only start to fall off in AQ40 and Naxx, but for the reasons I stated above, you can continue to progress into AQ40 and Naxx with the same group. Especially if you transition into a more buff/support style hunter. Hunters are some of the best nightfall wielders as they can spam wing clip and will have some of the highest uptime of the nightfall debuff, coupled with some AP buffs for your warriors from a wolf and Hunters quickly become super utility in a DPS body.  
---
You will never be a dwarf priest in the sense of being invited to raids despite your gear just for your fear ward, but you do not go extinct in the end game.  
---
Hunters have the hardest damage rotation in the game, and the difference between a good and bad hunter are huge, whereas mages are literally spamming frostbolt in MC and BWL, so a good Hunter who levels quickly, spends the time learning their class and performs well will shouldn't have trouble finding a raid group - but a bad hunter will.    
---
Also, this time around I expect a lot less people will be playing Hunter simply because they don't have the end game dps of a god like warriors and rogues do - so it shouldn't be as hard as before.  
---
Side note, there is very very little competition for your gear, so Hunters gear up relatively quickly unlike all the melee dps who are fighting over the same 1 handed swords.
---
Sounds like they didn’t want to go through the trouble of re-creating the original AV and just used the 1.12 version.
---
The page for Arctic Reach is where you find the radius modifiers to cone of cold and frost nova: https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=16757/arctic-reach
---
Well I'm pretty sure there is something true about "sitting kills" (it's a phrase at least in Finland, not sure about the rest of the world). Tho I think you must have some blood circulation problems already to be in a "risk group".
---
its 1.12
---
they removed all of the cool stuff from av in 1.12
---
There will be many minor differences that all comes down to one big difference - Classic will be way easier in many aspects than private servers. You can think of private servers as hardcore mode for classic
---
Limit transferred from Horde to Alliance and back, but Method changed with multiple characters the server to buy out resources from the auction house because there wasnt enough on tarren mill.I also linked a video where Josh explains the preparation they did for BoD.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7O7VueV6RQ&amp;t=
---
*And btw this comment from Sco was a joke*
---
&gt; that people are going to keep the mindset of minmaxing for dungeons, making it harder to find a group.
---
Min Maxing for dungeons is going to be hard, as depending on where you are in the "pack" (by that I mean the majority of the population), the chance of getting the "perfect" group member is going to be really hard. So taking whoever you can will be best.
---
When looking for group, you can just whisper people and just give them your class, that's what I did most recently on private servers. Nobody cared what my spec was, as you're leveling you have to play whatever doesn't make you want to quit! 
---
Even leveling as a "pure" healing spec, you won't have all the tools until late game (55+) where you might have a minor difference in effectiveness. Personally as a druid, I never respecced from druid until 58, and that was only IF I was doing a BRD full run with every quest under the sun, because it was painful otherwise. And even if I respecced, most of the difference came down to, do I have enough "healer" gear (+int/spirit gear)
---
But absolutely, try to find a group/guild beforehand, it will really help out a LOT. Especially warriors, they are going to want to find a healer, or healing type to level with. Warriors have it ROUGH leveling.
---
Yeah but i'm kinda like... when people is talking about Sylvanas in like ''Oh she's not evil''... WHAT? 
---
What are they even on about, of course the forsaken are ''evil''. They're dead! Angry, hateful, and in some cases insane dead people. for christ sake they have cannibalize as a racial.
---
They even had a DEMON as second in command. (I'm so happy he is coming back by the way.)
---
Evil is in the eyes of the holder, the forsaken have an alliance of convenience with the Horde. They have fought and claimed their spot in the Horde and gives an vital forward position in Azeroth.
---
Nice try horde shill!
---
Server owners will not be able to help his friends
---
I'm also hoping to see it pre-nerfed for starters. Really eager to see if it really was impossible or if players today are skilled enough.
---
Catch me at IF AH bridge
---
This is awesome! I really miss proper talent trees, will be making use of this app.
---
I used to run stockades on my rogue and just open the chests usually 3 a dungeon and each has 1 or 2 greens in it and just sell them on the AH
---
60"
---
while leveling, every healer rolls on dps gear since noone levels in a healspec. no need to announce anything, its common sense.
---
I just want Blood Elves.
---
Not to mention its tied to your steamid, so the only way to reroll is to create a new steam account (or to do some shit with family share)
---
Pretty hardcore lol, especially considering you might just get a dude with an enormous head that is more prone to getting headshot
---
Before xrealm BGs, AV was the place you'd see all the big names of your server. It was a persistent battle map with people cycling in and out throughout the day. It was vastly different than other BGs, because AB/WSG would end in a reasonable amount of time, whereas AV was more of a constant battle without ending very often. It was a different feel and was more about controlling the choke points than actually winning the BG. Its hard to describe.
---
Who’s asking?
---
plus if Paladin, the west side gets really fun.
---
So was Cersei which makes it even more plausible.
---
APES is going to shit all over them with classic world first.
---
They have the dedication to roll to whatever server method will be on, just for the satisfaction and competitiveness of beating the trash out of them with world bosses. 
---
They may not even have to with the streamer fanboy follower base they have. They will have targets on the back of their head. Unless they roll PvE that’s most likely the only way they will get any first, and world first on a PvE server is laughable.
---
Whatever.  If they're on my server I'll sell them a bunch of mats at crazy inflated prices.
---
All personal preference man, that's a hard one to help with. I was a rogue throughout all of vanilla but I think this time I'm gonna roll a paladin just for some difference in experience.
---
This isn't Beta PVP, its PServer. The rogue is level 60 with huge enchants lol
---
edited because resolution too high for real vanilla =D.

---
But that's not the problem that was presented. I completely agree that there are ways they can do it more smoothly, but the problem presented was that old gear and zones becomes useless. And no matter how harshly or smoothly you transition that will always happen.
---
Maybe people will care less if it's smoother, but then I'd argue they were just being very short-sighted.
---
Night elves start on Kalimdor would be my guess.

My journey will be more the whole preparation for this - enjoying the summer the best I can, getting in to best possible shape and turning my life a bit more healthier towards this goal. Going really hardcore has always been a dream of mine, I just have never had realistic chances to do it. Now I can try how it feels for a shortish period of time and at least not I'm really excited about all this!
---
Anyways I think everyone should enjoy Classic just the way they enjoy it best. One of the reasons it's so good game is that people can enjoy playing it so many different ways!
---
Eh I’ve seen every dungeon vanilla has to offer, as have most people interested.  Nothing on streams is new. actually playing out weighs anything the beta can bring in terms of being a viewer
---
attunements is the biggest loss the game has suffered, if you dont have to do content you wont.

Those were people from outside WoW. And those games were WoW clones. Ofc they ALL failed. And WoW was still the most popular MMO in the world.
---
Now, we talk about Classic. If anything BfA is a WoW CLONE, and Classic is WoW.
---
And we aren't talking about WoW dying. We talk about RETAIL WOW dying, which is imminent.
---
Classic WoW cannot kill WoW...because Classic WoW IS WoW.
---
But it will kill Retail WoW, because Retail WoW is ANYTHING but WoW.
---
It varies a lot on comp and level of tryhard so that's why they are conflicting
---
Thanks for the advice.
---
Man, I'm still doubting between Hunter, Warrior, Paladin &amp; Priest, the classes I have the least Vanilla experience with (mained a Mage back in the day, and had high level Rogue &amp; Warlock as well)
---
\-I'm most likely going to roll hunter because of the fast leveling. I have a wife and kid, so It'll probably be my best shot at seeing any endgame content. I'll also wont make it to Naxx anyway so the DPS dropping off isn't really an issue for me
---
\-Priest is a contender too. I never really played a healer so it would be a nice change of pace. I'll always be invited to groups which is nice. Then again it's another cloth class, which I already have plenty of experience with.
---
\-Warriors always looked so awesome to me, but I always got bored leveling them and I guess that won't really change in Classic. Especially with me having less time now probably will mean leveling one will be a lost cause
---
\-Paladins also get cool armor but also aren't the fastest levelers. The free mount at 40 is pretty handy, but I remember their playstyle as being a bit too passive for my taste.
---
\-I always thought Shamans were cool too, but the Alliance is where the heart is, so that'll probably never happen.
---
Will you be leveling on EU or NA? Would love to get in touch with other people doing same kind of stuff during the launch!
---
bloodelfs
---
What I take from his post is him saying that we will see some threads saying “see, we still get hour long AVs with 1.12, you people who cried for old AV are being overdramatic.”
---
What we are going to see in the beta is probably not indicative of behavior in the launch version. Even if beta AV takes 5+ hours the live version might still be sub 30minutes, because players are driven by different incentives.
---
That is my take on it.
---
20x more kid....
---
So did the post not go the way you wanted yesterday?
---
John Travolta is a toupee wearing Scientologist homosexual closet case who jerks off his male masseuses.
---
Maybe this will make people try to use the mechanics of AV instead of just rolling through everything.
---
The only thing classic is lacking is Arenas. Arenas is the reason why people got so good at PvP. Without it, everyone would still be using mouse clicks to cast their spells. I would add it to classic, but make it so that it doesnt give any gear. Just keep a public ladder on the armory and "braging" rewards like titles and special mount. Do a ladder reset every 3-4 months. Since the rewards would be just for shows, this would hopefully not discourage the class/specs that are low tier from enjoying PvP in general. Also people think about balance mostly from 2v2 point of view, but 3v3 is where its at. This would bring a competitive pvp scene to classic without changing the honor ranking system and PvP/PvE balance, #nochange.
---
Beside the addition of arenas, i think switching to 25 mans was a good move. And the new talents were great cause it was a natural progression of classic's, and it made a lot of hybrid specs more viable in both PvP and PvE.
---
No shoulders mentioned on Horde - have my downvote
---
Thirth
---
That's very reassuring. I'm probably looking too much into it thanks to the current state of the game. I can't wait to experience classic again. I had no clue what I was doing back then and I was able to get by just fine, so it shouldn't be an issue.
---
And that does sound like a lot of fun to find a warrior or something along those lines. My favorite part of healing in retail is how appreciative people are. Just gives a good feeling.

NA.
---
Still haven't decided if I'll roll on the "streamer server" or not
---
True, there will be some that police all of them, others won’t care if your using Siphon life
---
1) Orc for stun resist, UD for fear/charm break. Bit of a tossup, some rogue can chime in on this one.
---
2) Engineering is key, as for secondary, leatherworking isn't the most amazing, even for money making. There's nothing really BOP you need to get. As secondary you can do alchemy for always being able to make your own things, you can do enchanting for always able to disenchant things.
---
[This link says Nope](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=291753/wow-classic-summit-community-information-round-up#wowchakra-spanish) but I can't confirm that myself, it's just from a community interview.
---
&gt; Retail and Classic can not be used at the same time by the same account.
---
&gt;Mentioning streamers
---
Please stop doing this. Streamers are a minuscule amount of people who literally do not matter in the grand scheme of things. Plenty of non streamers are playing beta, and are exploring, reporting bugs, doing exactly what you're afraid isn't happening.
---
Stop focusing on streamers.
---
I'm considering this (as well as lock or priest).
---
One consideration for me is that I really like running 5-mans, and there's almost always a group that is ready to go as soon as they find a tank.
---
&gt;Vanilla was a bit weird the game blew up and was full of casuals like people would find out you play wow and be like WUT LVL ARE U?  Dude I'm 60 what are you talking about and they'd be like o I'm 32. 
---
This is so accurate lol
---
And no double spawns or fast spawns. In the first few zones on a private server some patches of enemies have double the amount than what is normal for the area. Also they spawn very fast, in vanilla a lot of mobs spawn in different intervals, for instance in Dun Morogh the boars spawn every 5 minutes and the bears spawn every 25 minutes. Stuff like this will significantly slow down everyone's leveling speed than what is seen on private servers.
---
Another way to frame that is that wow's sub count stopped growing during Wrath...
---
You succeeded, the detail on the hilt and guard is fantastic.
---
It isn't a job and Blizzard has requested nothing of us. Rather, if they want certain bahaviour they enforce it - such as by creating a server where you can only test AV with premade characters.
---
&gt; The rank 14 weapons are better than all of those
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPD5q6DC43M

also, if you are raiding horde in classic for speed you're doing it wrong.

---
Yeah leveling my druid, I am going to be running for a warrior for the first 20 levels, makes it much faster for both of us, but after that we shall see if they can keep up! (Catform is rather speedy)
---
Its way more than that boo boo, 6 mins is a falacy
---
meh. you're now pretending *i'm* ignoring the definition of complex when this entire comment chain has been me explaining to you how *you're* not arguing what complex is. you've been arguing meaningful impact, level of engagement, decision making, etc... everything but the actual complexity of the systems. it's an obvious (and weak) bad faith argument. it's clear you're not trying to understand anything, you're just trying to win an internet argument. and i've lost what little interest i had left in discussing it with you 
---
i'd recommend [reading above](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bzineq/infographic_on_differences_between_classic_wow/eqt19l9) where another user understood how others are arguing the conotation of the word complex while i've been arguing denotation. maybe it'll help? but you and me are done here
---
Perfect, that’s what I was looking for. Weird that it didn’t come up when I searched for that. Thanks man.
---
" and Retail players arguing that Classic is too easy and a waste of time for top Retail guilds. " it actually is too easy, there are barely any mechanics, the game is about coordination and mostly the grind. i cleared mythic uldir and played privates clearing for years. vanilla raiding is a joke, the thing i like is the character investment and the grindy nature, but the raiding itself is easier and more boring than retail one

the first guild that gets 40 level 60s will get the world first.

---
You gotta go to every zone pretty much and do a few available quests in each or you'll end up grinding probably 15 levels from 1-60
---
It was pretttyy bad.
---
I’ve read that they aren’t a top pick for dungeons because no rez. I plan on doing dungeons and raids. 
---
Would they even be picked for raiding? I keep seeing negative things about Druid. Though they look fun!
---
Weird, so two people couldn't use them at the same time?
---
Or could you? Kind of cool if that's the case.
---
I liked it. It’s not as good as Lord of the Rings or GoT... better than the last few episodes of GoT now that I think about it.
---
Another complaint about PVP, don't join battlegrounds then, go quest, literally go do anything else other than PVP. There's a lot of people who want to do just that, if you are not interested in doing it, don't do it.
---
Extremely good. Shadow weaving black out imp fear, imp mind last, shadow affinity and silence all help a lot.
---
I don’t think you can remove things. Some things I loved other people hate. Like I love arena but some argue that arenas ruined the rest of pvp because now class/gear are balanced around arena instead of bgs or wpvp.
---
I guess you missed Malowns proc? Demonshear debuff is very low prio, as is most weapon proc debuffs.
---
Being at or above 305 weapon skill is incredibly important, from the testing the warrior discord has done in the beta so far.
---
Ah I'll be on EU. Do you know how many servers they'll make?
---
But if you are doing stuff like this I'd say streamer server is a bad idea. Especially if you are "leading" them in levels, you might get harrased. Or probably not
---
my god... is it foldable?
---
Undercity all the way. Everything felt accessible &amp; I really liked the tone of the surrounding area. Maybe I'm a closet edgelord?
---
Why does everybody act like druids won’t be taken into raids? It’s pissing me off.
---
Orc for that stun resist! 
---
Don't have much for professions, sorry

It's rare to not get ganked by a 60 UD rogue in redridge.
---
It was quite successful in China and a fun remix of WC1. I liked it. I don't love it, but I liked it.
---
No, you're wrong.
---
They're releasing 1.12 WoW, with some content time-gated.  They're not mixing and maxing iterations.
---
Lucking out and getting the Savory Deviant Delight recipe, and then spending time fishing outside of WC, was how I could afford my 40 and 60 mounts.
---
The implication is that the seed is strong. Bobby B wouldn't have a blonde haired little brat.

  [Maydie] Grand Marshal 60 Warrior Must See!
---
You are also missing all the myndflame videos!!!!
---
You can, I've got a horde on one and alliance on another and both can be logged in at the same time.
---
It doesn't matter, that's the beauty. All I was trying to say to you, was that it's silly to even lean one way or another, to try to predict it or say with any sort of conviction who is better at a 15 year old game. It's applying the tribalism mentality (retail vs. pserver) to something without meaning (classic realm firsts) for the sake of creating sides and dividing people.
---
Not really for honor game, but it was the single most fun experience that I've ever had in WoW. It was the pinnacle of PvP in my opinion. It took the structure of BGs and the scale of World PvP. It felt like an actual war and making any progress to capture points felt like a huge accomplishment.
---
That's not pvp lol
---
They can't even fight back
---
Hunter will def be the quickest to level but don't think it'll be terribly quicker than something like a priest. Priests also level fairly quickly and like you said, everyone loves a healer!
---
Warriors and Paladins both with level fairly slow and paladins will be boring to level but both are always wanted at 60, warrior for tank and paladin for healer. 
---
It'll come down to what you wanna do when you get to cap.
---
Even when drakedog did it way back when, it came down to them being super undergeared, and CoS being broken. By that I mean you could have negative resists and take extra damage. Even with that, not going to do it all the time.
---
They’ve said it’s just another server on your account. I would imagine once you are logged into Classic, logging into a second instance of the game client will log you out.
---
I’m pretty sure that last point is referring to items added much later, like Diana’s Pearl Necklace and Spellbinder Turban, not things prior to 1.10 like Ring of Spell Power or these class quests.
---
Streamer content is a little different than people taking streamer content and making 5,000 youtube highlight videos.
---
These highlight videos will take over a subreddit because anyone can make them and monetize them, even though they aren't creating the content.
---
I hate them :(
---
Leaning towards Horde so I can chill on top of the bank roof in old org.
---
Sounds about right- when people ask I usually hit them with, if you haven't played vanilla or aren't familiar with it - the average /played to 60 is 9-14 days.
---
So let's say you are quick and do it in 10 - that's level 60 in 20 real life days if you play 12 hours a day :)
---
It really is. The warmth of the lava, the fact that you’re safe deep inside of a mountain. The snowy surroundings outside of the sole entrance (aside from Deeprun). Definitely the most cozy city. Stormwind is also cozy but maybe that’s just because I played alliance growing up.
---
Been playing horde on a non-beta server, and I’m definitely warming up to Orgrimmar and Undercity. I can’t choose which one feels more “safe” yet. I think right now I’d say Org. 
---
Still can’t decide if I want to play horde or alliance...
---
Does that mean I can effectively grief players by killing their mobs while not in their party?
---
Again read item 1.    
---
      
---
You get stockades quest https://classicdb.ch/?quest=386
---
You get Darkshore Quest https://classicdb.ch/?quest=951    
---
Also, there are a a crazy amount of greens, just get one off the AH at 25-27 to carry you through. Not to mention you get greens from pick pocketing, and can solo stealth chests runs.
---
I'd recommend you watch some of the people leveling rogues during the Beta, MrShiny64 has a great up and coming stream.
---
Excuse me SIR, melee hunter was a spec in vanilla to proc nightfall.
---
We've already seen streamer clips of crying about pulling too much stuff in Thunder Ridge.

---
To be fair. MDI went from a one weekend event to being a like 2 month long slogfest. If you look at view counts over the 2 months they are actually pretty great. Like anything, watching the same thing for months gets old.
---
No - its for the AV testing this weekend.
---
Did you speak the first ideal yet?
---
Sick. Just making sure I wasn't entirely crazy.

Oh of course, I just figured his goal was to minimize travel between zones. The chain I laid out just stays up in that northern part, and you can extend into the plaguelands and really never leave Lordaeron.
---
No lol good grief.  This is why the server just shutdown because they're adding this for the upcoming weekend.
---
So let’s do it like a Druid in the general channel
---
Most EU players are looking to play in NA region for classic, because there isn't much hype in EU for it.
---
I leveled a 39 shaman twink, and it was basically the same thing.
---
Grab a pendulum of doom, Ravager, etc and you'll have a very similar experience for 1/20th of the time investment.
---
Is a human mage or dwarf priest more fun/viable in vanilla PvE? I played a lot of boomkin and resto in wrath,  mostly playing healer in dungeons and questing, but in cata I leveled a mage and had some fun with the utility and dps. Haven't had much wow experience since. I plan on doing mostly PvE and raiding with only light world PvP, and I'm not really feeling a druid in classic. It was fun being useful as a healer when dungeoning, but mage's utility made me feel useful and it was cool to summon portals and food. But will the priest or mage population be saturated? What do you think would get me into raids the most, and what do you think is the more useful class when  leveling and messing around? Currently leaning mage due to portals.
---
Yeah, trispec is good for PVP healing, especially for trolls. It's not the way to go for soloqueue facemelter.

If I can find a decent chill guild that raids fit my work/life schedule, I will raid. Not to stressed about it if I can't though.

“Currently, based on both your feedback and our own deliberations, we’re now planning to increase it to six phases. Our focus is still primarily on player power-progression, but we’re also aiming to capture what it felt like to play in a realm community in original WoW. To do that, we’re planning to mirror the approach taken by original WoW, with patches paired together. We’ll launch Classic with content from original WoW through patch 1.2.x, then the second update will include content that was in original WoW 1.3 and 1.4, the third Classic update will have 1.5 and 1.6 content, and so on.”

Blows my mind. You watch Legion MDI in 2017, you saw 16 teams (IIRC) with wildly different comps. You watch BFA MDI in 2019, you saw almost every single team running the same comp. Ion Hazzikostas dropped the ball HARD. Pruning and homogenization led to a scenario where every class is so similar and lacking in unique utility that people will always choose the mathematically best class rather than bringing unique comps that have strengths and weaknesses based on the affix/dungeon. How did they go from Legion, the best expansion since WOTLK, and then go to BFA, the 2nd worst WoW expansion of all time? 
---
Also, the dungeons in BFA don't look half as cool as the Legion dungeons. Pirates, water elementals, spooky sludge. Compare that to Karazhan, Burning Legion, and Tortured Undead. 
---
It's actually upsetting thinking about BFA.

Alright, here's the alliance versions if you want to do a quick comparision yourself. Feel free to tell me how the rank 14 weapons are not better if you'd like. Used gun instead of crossbow since dwarves get +5 gun skill, as well.

Edit: actually just realized ashre'thul is a lot slower so it'll be better, but still, that's just hunters.

I feel you that makes sense. Not too concerned about dps though as I’m sure I would get picked up as a lock mostly due to utility. Mainly talking gear for PVP.

Nah. Method has the resources to pull in anyone and learn anything any of those people know. It's also the Method members jobs to play the game and they will dedicate 100% of their time to going for the win. I can't really imagine a 40 raid roster of plebs being able to dedicate the time and focus to level to 60 and be raid ready in half a week.

If you're high enough level to deal AtLeastSignificant (see what I did there :)?) damage to the mob you could lower their kill xp yes (they still got full loot and stuff).
---
I don't quite remember how it worked, but I wanna say the xp was reduced equal to your percentage of damage done, although admittingly I don't remember if that was how it actually worked or it was just my assumption at the time, not that it's super important, the important part is the more damage the high level character did, the less xp you got, assuming the mob was grey to the high level character.
---
 On private servers, demoralizing shout can be spammed to give static aoe aggro to warriors. In classic, demoralizing shout provides negligible threat the first time it applies the debuff, and zero threat thereafter.  This makes private server warriors think warriors are the best AOE tanks when it is actually quite challenging on classic.

If you are an elite player on a Classic server with a stable pop of 3k ( i.e. no massive emigration ) the last thing you need is to show off in an Armory or a gear score addon. This is one of the best features in Vanilla. When you can recognize most of the attendances even in a random MC pug. Then you have a true server feel and you have also mentally pwned the instance ( or whatever obstacle ) before you enter it.  As a master of Vanilla, leave the gear score, the armory and the micro management of other peoples class, to the BFA version of WoW and also instantly kick whoever spams damage meters or constantly gets killed. This is how the game was won over in the earliest days before people started farming + scamming like mad and before all of the altoholics entered the scene. Lets relive the purest feel of Vanilla.
---
12hrs/day would be great but I know that isn't possible so I had to do a reality check what would be expected
---
Perhaps we should speak with Marshal Windsor. I believe he was looking into the situation... Where is he by the way?
---
It didn't just ruin wpvp, it kind of ruined the open world as a whole. There wasn't really a need to explore and look around anymore since I could just fly to my destination, drop down, do my quest, then leave the way I came.
---
Everyone always needs a healer and priests are arguably the best healers in classic. 
---
Both classes level just fine.
---
Being a mage is super convenient to have because of portals and foot/water but I would go out on a limb and say that there will be more mages than holy priests because dps is always the most popular, specially when it's one of the best dpsers in the game.
---
Sorry didn't see the edit for the hunter part!
---
If he wanted to play hunter, highly recommend he pick up leatherworking. That way he has access to ammo pouches (yes they are a thing, and yes they are important).
---
So for the rogue, you can go eng/mining, and the hunter can go lw/skin (or something around those lines. If you want dual crafting on both, eng/alch and lw/enchanting.
---
Like I said, leatherworking is great, but there's nothing really BOP you are locked to.
---
It was fun for me. I didn't think about maximum efficieny, but enjoyed every part of this game.
---
Defending endless waves of enemy factions and realising the night shift was at least able to hold our ground ;D
---
Summoning elite bosses and mobs were mandatory to advance into the enemy base. At least in the AV i knew from vanilla. Dunno when this changed exactly into the fast cap meta
---
Very nice!
---
I totally agree! 
---
There was another spot ontop of the cover over the middle of it too but that was harder to pull off
---
This one hasn't been answered yet. Hopefully they all come out in phase 1. In actual Vanilla, they were spread out, so Shaman had theirs very early on while Druids didn't get theirs until 1.10.

Some bosses have more higher armor and damage. They tune it to be more difficult. Classic will be easier.

&gt;Stealth allows you to travel without interaction with the world.. It forestalls PvP, it changes questing interactions, it causes you to miss encounters or chance occurrences you could have had in the world. It changes the economics of the game by trivializing gathering. It makes the world feel less real and subtly creates he impression that the world is an annoyance to bypass on your way to a destination, not a place where your character lives.
---
Except stealth is limited to two classes and comes with a movement speed penality and can be detected. 
---
Imagine if this was is some patch notes:
---
Stealth is now available to all classes. movement speed while stealthed increased from 50% to 360%. Only usable outdoors.
---
Cus blood elves.
---
They were cheap actually. I bought this, still have it somewhere, for an equivalence of $50
---
Okay now assume those folks who were pushing up honor rankings all made it to their desired rank. What do they do now? How do they play the game? Keep PvPing? Keep spamming consumables even though there’s no need to win?
---
The 5 new abilities for each class made them feel more unique as opposed to WotLK/cata where classes started to feel homogenized by new abilities.  Heroism and misdirect were iconic, and just made the classes feel like they provided something no one else could.
---
On the other hand, I despise dailies/flying mounts and would hard pass on those if the option was on the table.  The closer we get to Cata, the more I’m open to some changes because eventually there’s a jumping off point for me.
---
Reminds me of a wc2 map. Which fits as wildhammer dwarves with griffons and the dragons were a theme in some maps.

This map brings the fight to its roots of horde vs alliance rather than horde vs ogres vs alliance vs twightlight hammer

It sounds amazing. On a good week, I'll have three nights to play, maximum of 6-ish hours a night. (Most weeks WON'T be good weeks, in which case I might get in 1-2 hours a night for only two nights.) I'm one of those "the journey is the destination" people, so this will be phenomenal for me.
---
I have. The beta community has been amazing, but there aren't many private server players on it so that could be why.
---
&gt; Nothing in Vanilla mattered at that point. None of the dungeons in Vanilla mattered, from BRD to Naxx. Professions became useless until Outland. Vanilla reputations didn't matter. Most importantly, the leveling stopped mattering too.  
---
&gt; Nothing between levels 1-57 matters in the end game,  whereas in Vanilla you can start getting your Pre-raid BiS gear starting in the late 40s iirc  
---
The problem with that reasoning is that most of it is true about Vanilla too. 
---
Most of the dungeons in Vanilla didn't "matter", they were just leveling/lore content. Most of Vanilla reputations didn't matter either, and were vastly cosmetic. Most professions were hardly of any use in Vanilla until max level too. BS, Tailoring and Leatherworking were even quite useless at max level, outside of one or two craftable items per class.
---
Almost nothing "matters" in Vanilla until lvl 60 either to be honest. As for farming pre-raid BiS in the late 40s ... let's be honest. It's just that Blizzard itemization in early Vanilla was so poor they created without knowing it a couple items that were completely OP and out of their place in pre 60 content, that wasn't purposeful in any sense. And people back then didn't even know what "BiS" stands for.
---
&gt; Most importantly, the leveling stopped mattering too 
---
That's not true. Leveling was a big part of the game until late WotLK, and some people were still playing the game solely for that back then.
---
 However, you seem to think after BC, nobody came to the old world, which was left empty. That's not true. You still had to come back to the old world for Karazhan, Hyjal (caverns of time with other heroics) and for all the world events, a part of which became partially associated with old content (SM for hallow's end, BRD for the brewer feast or whatever it is called). And people still cleaned Naxx in BC to get Atiesh for fun anyway. 
---
Content becoming obsolete will always be a problem, no matter the game. You can't escape that.
---
Only 59 guilds cleared Naxx in Vanilla.  That’s way less than 2%.
---
I don't think Alliance will have shorter pvp queues in classic, particularly if PvE and PvP servers share battlegroups like retail did.
---
My favorite part of AV was getting another Mage or 2 to group up with me and time suicide AoE rushes into the opposing team.  Blastwave + PoM Flamestrike + AE until dead or OOM.  Usually wasnt too effective on my own, but even with one other Mage timing it with me, it actually made a difference!
---
I love it, but it's not quite right.

The hilt and runes are wrong.

Private servers don't have layering or phasing. 
---
Classic WoW wont have every single person on the server in the same layer.
---
Method is gigantic now and has people everywhere, that being said EU should have their own streamer locked realms as well, and that's where you would put them.
---
There are also 10x the amount of hardcore raiders who actually use flasks on pservers so the price will probably be between 50-80g like it was on dorthnale. For example my guild wasn't even one of the top 20 guilds on the server and 90% of our casters used flask at all times during raid. On classic servers that will be a thing for a handful of guilds per server.

Haha you seem to think people solo these elites rather than group to kill them. You kill Nekrosh in late 20s and Morladim around level 30 **with a group**. Even the quest for Nekrosh is only a level 32 quest and you say wait until level 35... I detect a retail baby, trying to pretend to firsthand experience based on what he sees in streams and can look up in a database. 
---
Looking up above you even say 
---
&gt; They are also seriously lacking in cooldowns making harder quests etc hard.
---
As if retaliation isn't the single most OP *cooldown* for soloing quests. Warriors can solo Stalvan while the quest is still red using that -- good luck replicating that feat with the mighty evasion and sprint cooldowns lol.
---
Imma let you starve.
---
The crossbow of smiting is better because it's slower, a faster weapon for hunters results in a more clunky rotation because of potentially clipped shot. Also 24 points of higher max damage for more flashy crits :V
---
The swords are roughly the same, you can put the Chromatically Tempered in the mix. 1.12 so istants are normalized and speed doesn't really matter.
---
The rank14 caster weapon has 1more int, however the pve caster offhand has 1%hit and 1%crit more than the rank14. Also the Staff of the Shadow Flame belongs in the mix. You're trading 8 spell power for 1% spell crit. Assuming you're decked out in equivalent gear the spell crit is better. IMHO AQ40 combo (92SP, 2%crit, 1%hit, 16int) &gt; BWL staff (84sp, 2% crit, 29int)  &gt; Rank14 (92sp, 1% crit, 25int). Rank 14 staff (71sp 41int) is a bit lackluster.
---
The healing mace + libram (165 healing, 22int, 14spi 6mp5) , however is head and shoulders better than anything before C'thun, except maybe for the regalia staff which is still inferior.
---
As I said, "BWL stuff is on par with rank 14"
---
Thanks! 😁👍

Female character trolls and taurens are the only horde I won't kill on sight. They are the only semi legit picks. Every other horde option has "edgelord" written all over it, even before that was a thing.

Not until TBC anyway.
---
That is the problem, it shouldn't have been changed to facilitate honor gains. There were two other BGs at the time that had fairly quick matches. The problem with AV was its reward structure. If they changed it up to reward players for participating in long AV matches players wouldn't have a problem with it.
---
Older MMOs had BGs that lasted forever and players had no problems with it. AV shouldn't have been viewed as a BG match, but more of a separate instance where players can quickly jump into some pvp action.

Cool? A guild whose opinion doesn't matter (like all guilds that aren't your guild) changed their opinion for the sake of internet relevancy.  The veteran OG PVPers of vanilla will gladly welcome the additional corpses in the fields betweem SS and TM.  Now if they really have guts they will roll PvP so we can give them a proper lesson in the real challenge of Molten Core... Getting into the portal without dieing a half dozen times.

He denies it publicly because he's afraid of his cult.
---
Needing some more opinions!
---
I am heavily considering Warrior or Druid.  I am 100% going to be Horde.  Here are some of my points:
---
* I played Vanilla at the beginning and through the end of TBC.  Played a mage.
---
* I really like to PvP and will probably do more PvP than PvE.  
---
* I will do a lot of BG's, as I did in Vanilla, but I absolutely loved World PvP and plan to do a lot of it.  I liked ganking, raiding cities, assassinating people in cities, and holding people hostage getting to their raids.
---
* I am playing with a group of 10+ friends and plan to be with them most every time I'm playing.
---
**My Perceived Reasons for Druid Over Warrior (Open to feedback)**
---
* Since I want to World PvP, the Druid would probably be better suited since it is better at adapting to many situations. Can also be stealth.
---
* Druids are rarer than Warriors, so gear would potentially be easier to get, raid invites would be easier, and I could fit multiple roles in dungeons.
---
* In Vanilla, I remember druids mostly being healers.  However, I also remember seeing Boomkin DPS and Feral DPS.  DPS'ers also like their buffs.
---
* Druids level easier than warriors.
---
**My Perceived Reasons for Warrior over Druid (open to feedback)**
---
* Friends (and potential guild we are creating) need a tank.  I'm completely fine with (and want) to be the MT and/or OT.
---
* Warriors can hit like trucks in PvP once fully geared.
---
* To be a Druid I have to be a Tauren, and I'm not a huge fan of the Tauren model.
---
* The Warrior PvP gear is better suited for Warriors while the Druid set is a little scattered.
---
**Questions I Have For Those Who Are Experienced with Warriors/Druids:**
---
* I don't really recall Druids ever being tanks in 40 man raids.  Maybe off tanks.  Am I way off? Are they capable of tanking SOME bosses?
---
* Did Druids ever do halfway decent DPS?  Weren't their crit or magic buffs greatly appreciated though?
---
* If you played a Druid -- I remember people would basically have 4 sets of gear depending on their role (heal, tank, feral, boomkin).  Did anyone do this?
---
* How linear is warrior combat?  I feel like it's constantly charging/intercepting and trying to keep people close to you.
---
* I remember geared druids in bear form were borderline unkillable in PvP duels (they couldn't kill you either though). Am I remembering this correctly?
---

&gt;	There's no reason the game needs to be an "accurate representation" of the game you played.

Blizzard literally said that their design choices of classic were based on the game being a true authentic vanilla experience. The complete opposite of what you’re saying.

---
How long do you think classic will offer content to them?
---
0% of them is due to classic being undertuned by design and 100% of them are due to private servers being incorrect.
---
So basically... she was right, and succumbed to a similar but equally useless time void.
---
Dragonstalker was gunning for my worst 3 list.
---
Only a small percent of any games player base watchers streamers for it.
---
Who cares? Plenty of religious people have to hide their sexuality to avoid persecution
---
I agree. When BGs come out I will probably stop playing classic. Stupid decision to ever make BGs required to rank up.
---
I have no idea what you are trying to say.  You seem to be all over the place.
---
Don't forget cone of cold
---
 Not sure if I should play Warrior or Shaman,
---
On one hand I really like enhancement Shaman, running around slapping people up in PVP with wind fury on a 2 hander while throwing in frost shock mid fight. 
---
But people have consistently said Enhancement and elemental have little place in max level PVE content and I’ll probably have to go resto.
---
On the other hand Warriors have that get up in people’s face and produce giant critical hits, one shotting people.
---
But they apparently level super slow, are weaker when leveling and have no heals.
---
So if they run rampart and just destroy everything is worse that them being organized by a single evil entity?
---
According to WC3 lore, there absolutely doesn't have to "always be a lich king". 
---
Also, Bolvar becoming a Lich King should not solve anything, because he should become bad or "corrupt", similar to how Arthas did under the influence of the Lich King.
---
WotLK lore didn't make much sense.
---
What do we do now?
---
Hello Kitty Island Adventure?
---
Nah I don't know about that. Those both are kinda goofy looking imo. But then again, Alliance can't talk much on this kind of topic considering that Gnomes (both male and female) are the absolute worst abominations in the entire game. I'm leaning more towards going Alliance in Classic but the idea of being able to stomp Gnomes is a pretty alluring argument for picking Horde honestly.
---
Classic would have been right up our alley, and a fifth would always be heartily welcomed. But sadly, it won't be possible, so a full revival of the tale is the best I can do!
---
See post above. Hunter dead zone is actually 5-11 even in private servers because you also need to add in the combat reach range to the minimum 8 yards to hit with a bow.

So even if i decide to go pve rogue i shouldn't get lw/skin?
---
I dont get the part about the BOP tho.
---
I’ve got a few of the myndflame videos in the bonus section :)
---
&gt;it was the first MMO that encouraged solo play. However, it still forced players to group
---
Wat?
---
&gt;You could be a mage with a mix of crafted, dungeon, and raid gear and still be highly effective
---
I mean that's how BFA is right now. I have alchemy trinket, m+ gear along with raid gear.
---
&gt;It wasn't all about just progressing through tiers of gear.
---
Yes it was, you did MC so you could do BWL so you could do AQ so you could do Naxx. That's pretty linear.
---
&gt;In Vanilla WoW there were just so many more ways to gear and progress your character.
---
But what different ways are there? How many more ways are their to gear in Vanilla that you cant do in retail?
---
&gt;New patches didn't just invalidate your items.
---
Yea not like AV patch didn't come out of no where giving out epic trinkets and weapons just from doing quest. Everyone was using the polearm/unstoppableforce/immovable object.
---
Classic WoW won’t have phasing after phase 2 either.
---
Yeah I am mad. I have played since early Vanilla, been subscribed probably 80% of the time since, and have well over a year (coming up on 2 years) playtime. Yet, no invite to beta. /cry
---
Oh boy - perhaps without doing a single quest ever... you will need gold. A lot of gold. A dagobert-load of gold.
---
30 songs...
---
Only ~1,800 more to go!
---
I disagree, but that certainly made me laugh.
---

---
Of course, I think it's best for everyone if we have time between phases. Even the guilds that will clear everything day one will take a months to get gear for everyone and time to play with the current highest tier of gear should be fun. 
---
Contrary to retail new raids coming out don't invalidate previous raids since even if you killed C'thun you will go and clear MC and BWL every week.
---
It's perfectly okay for the casual guilds to be doing BWL while the hardcore guilds do AQ and eventually get to do AQ themselves.
---
Now Naxx is a bit different because, casual guilds will never clear it. Not because it's super hard, but because it's an insane time investment. 
---
I think the original timeline was perfectly fine and since we already know every encounter we have millions of guides addons etc. the average player is far better or rather knows far more about the game so if anything they might speed things up a bit.
---
That said, I wish they did give us a longer timeline to enjoy each phase a bit more and even though I plan on hardcore raiding and clearing content as soon as it comes out and if I have to do the same raid for half a year so be it I don't mind, but some people might get a little bored if we have the same raid for too long and people have to understand that if they play 20 minutes a day it's completely unrealistic to extend the phases for so long that they get to clear the raids by the time a new one comes out.
---
I CARE
---
You think starting zone mob tagging will still be a problem after phase 2? Because that’s what he was talking about.
---
It didn't help that some of the raid achievements for the various "Glory of" meta achievements ran almost counter to what a normal clear would entail, so going for those specific achievements sometimes meant spending an entire night wiping to bosses that had long before been placed in farm status, absolutely wrecking morale.
---
Hakurai just released a video showing the biggest differences. Check out his YouTube video.
---
I personally plan in the days after. Launch day you'll lose half the day waiting for release, and other half to congestion.
---
The massive revenue you talk about is abstract because the amount generated from this "free" advertisement is a guestimate.  The actual value cannot be calculated.  Working in the abstract is nothing something that stocks do.
---
I mean, you can hope for something that absolutely won't happen, I suppose. But that's a silly thing to hope for.
---
1.12 is 1.12, as was mentioned, and that doesn't just apply to class balance, but raid balance as well.
---
And when the math was done, it was done under the best possible circumstances, on paper and not accounting for player skill. The assumption was perfect execution. So skill was not a factor. It was simply mathematically impossible pre-nerf.
---
I've played since friend and family closed beta, been playing ever since. No invite. Come at me.
---
This guy flexing his big beta(alpha?) cock up in here.
---
Vanilla had leeway too.
---
What do you mean "What Changed" ? Clearly they are doing it for the money and only for the money. They underestimated the popularity and success that would follow classic and after seeing multiple streamers go from 1k subs to nearly 10k in 1 month streaming beta it became obvious to them they were missing a huge monetary opportunity by not committing to classic streaming.
---
For pvp its probably true, only dwarves have good pvp racials on alliance. 
---
However pally is a bit better than shaman as a support in pvp, so its not as clear cut as some make it out to be.
---
I'm saying there will be a lot more NA players by % than EU and Chinese.
---
Disagree. The gear design was awful, zones were unpleasant to level in (apart from maybe Zang or Nagrand) and the "in the space" theme was bad for WoW and don't get me started on the Draenei design, which was just slap in a face to anyone who played Warcraft 3.
---
There are no BOP gear pieces you will need leatherworking for. So you can find someone with leatherworking and just hand them mats to make you anything you require, so there are better things you can grab!
---
ClAsSiC iS hArD mAn WtF aRe YoU tAlKiNg AbOuT
---
I honestly should. &lt;3
---
Being 1.12 it's not gonna be the most busted version of it, but it's actually not that far from it.
---
So yeah 20% of the time you'll be a monster, just like old times.
---
if you have a background in competitive sports, check out the Power Athlete program *Field Strong*. Highly recommend.
---
Each layer is a standard servers population.
---
lol
---
Same here. I hate it. So, i just use the guest wifi rather than plug into corporate drops. lol
---
What is field of strife?
---
Coming from SWG before WoW my whole background was RP-PvP and part of that was making our own fun in-game. It would be great if WoW Classic had these types of servers at launch!
---
&gt; On the other hand Warriors have that get up in people’s face and produce giant critical hits, one shotting people. But they apparently level super slow, are weaker when leveling and have no heals.
---
Yep it's painful, but the nice part about classic is there's going to be SO many people around to group with. As well make friends. I will be leveling as a druid, I will be leveling the first 20 levels with a warrior, to help them along, and to speed up my leveling out of the pain part. But even then, if you are leveling in an area, people are more likely to invite anyone in the area to group to get done faster, and stay grouped after!
---
Please turn off general chat for that youngin'. 
---
I have a kid older than yours, and I sure as hell wouldn't let them play an MMO at 6. Not unless I want them talking about Trump or saying twitch emotes all the time.
---
Some mobs still chain - like in those small camps with gnolls - the radius in which you pull the mob is lower on the beta though. 
---
Fanning is still a thing in both classic and pservers
---
Sunken Temple class quests have nothing to do with the mount class quests.
---
Yes!  Its been too long since I played, I guess.  I loved PvP way back then!
---
Now we play the game
---
Cut
---
I have friends who are a lot younger then me and are extremely excited to try out an MMORPG.
---
Kids might tend to play what other people hype up and if they see how popular classic is some might try it out.
---
If you ask around on private servers there are tons and tons of people who are younger than 20 so they couldn't have possible played Vanilla and still enjoy the MMORPG experience.
---
Nah you gotta be a good healyboi in the raids first like the man said.
---
Raiding as enhance you'll be on Nightfall and Windfury duty all day, only Hand of Rag when debuff slots are in abundance. Not for the weak willed.
---
And we're about to see a Deathknight Spree
---
Dat passive 25% stun resist tho
---
The gear upgrades in BFA are much less impactful outside of mythic raiding. Also, there exists a gear divide between PvP and PvE gear.
---
Also, what MMO had the solo questing system of Classic WoW?
---
Jesus, the lack of new content is turning streamers into South Park writers... Those guys have done everything. Thanks for the heads up
---
no npcs. if you count in the max lvls and the gear it will be a 20 min rush bulshit.
---
Should be a troll to counter fury/rogues, since blackout and similar talents provide off of shadowguard, so you can just passively stun melee characters. Hex of Weakness also severely hampers most classes with the healing debuff
---
Whilst devouring plague has far too long of a CD to be useful
---
This, Esfand is "Method" in that he's part of the streaming (like Kripparian being "on" TSM) team but he's doing his own guild.
---
That's just wrong... Drakedog's early videos were all about nuking undergeared or plainly clueless opponents — keyboard turning holy paladins, characters that aren't even level 60.
---
Destruction is extremely underwhelming before you get gear.
---
To a lesser extent but yes. It all depends on how successful the game is. My belief is that it will be really successful.
---
[Well it bothers me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPxPxEA8kJ8) And no.
---
The true moral of the story is: play with guildies who think the same way. Try hard attitude has the potential to ruin classic culture
---
Famouslastwords lol
---
I hope you're right though. Just need to stock up on bottled water and diapers!
---
This estimate lines up perfectly with what I was expecting! Good stuff!
---
Its what im so excited for as well. I am taking 3 days off work &amp; family duties to try my hand at no lifing for a minute. I hope to get into the 30s and then being super slow after that.
---
Classic has a better overall from start to finish player life cycle, but TBC has a better end game experience. Heroic dungeons and  25man raids. Also the pvpers have arena.
---
They are both two different experiences in my opinion and people will play each version for different reasons. I hope that classic realms will remain along side TBC or other xpac realms if we get that far.
---
Indeed they aren't a top pick for dungeons because they don't have a reliable res.  They work best in dungeons with a shaman, priest, or paladin dpsing.
---
On the other hand, while leveling you can level feral and tank just fine and the res doesn't matter.
---
Yes druids are picked up for raids.  Particularly one specced to heal.  Generally filling a raid of healers is a harder task than getting a MT and OT or DPS, and druids battle res is unique utility they bring.
---
The most hardcore guilds may limit druids to 2 or 3 slots though.
---
The boat is in the wrong spot
---
&gt;better than the last few episodes of GoT now that I think about it.
---
God I hate they idiotically hyperbolic nature of this site sometimes...
---
Sham and pally will be very popular for your own faction, but on the low end for both combined. Druid is the least played.
---
I can't decide but I do know that I want to blow shit up in PvP and still be relevant in raids. Mostly likely a caster as melee isn't my cup of tea.
---
For classic I want to experience all the PvE content. I've mained a disc priest since BC, and pretty much only PvP'd. I reached duelist a lot and gladiator a couple times and basically live in BGs. PvP is my core but I want to be good in raids.
---
Is there an elemental spec that can still heal enough in raids? Or should I just go mage like everyone else?
---
These comments seem to be mostly from people who don’t understand, or understand but don’t like, the concept of hybrid classes.
---
TBC was the rise of “class balance” and “all specs should be equally viable” and that appealed to a lot of players. It definitely didn’t appeal to me.
---
I don't remember ever doing scholo below 60, though. At the same time, it doesn't take long to do a few extra pulls, you've got a shot at some other drops that can at least turn into some pocket change, and it sometimes takes one person doing something stupid and pulling one of those skipped groups to blow the group up halfway through a run - and that's killing way more time than doing the whole instance, and finishing it, the first time.
---
Mists removed the minimum range in patch 5.0.4.
---
Mists of Pandaria Patch 5.0.4 (2012-08-28):
---
Minimum range removed.
---
Main hand slot is being changed to equip ranged weapons for hunters. Melee weapons can still be placed in this slot, however, they'll have no abilities that use them.
---
Hunters now benefit from Expertise as their ranged attacks can be dodged.
---
Any type of pet can now choose any specialization (Ferocity, Tenacity, or Cunning).
---
pvp is not supposed to be only world pvp tho, with tbc came arenas, one of the if not the most played pvp mode.
---
four^nd
---
Pallys and shamans are among the most popular classes for their own factions.
---
Just burn them off with rank 1 cleanse. You'll gradually close the distance. 
---
Don't get me wrong, godmode mages are still the S tier of classic PvP. There isn't that many though. 
---
Plus the mana battle in classic was real. Watch the duel tourney they had on beta for level 30's and you'll see how legit it is
---
I'm that guy that passes on rare mounts
---
You are immediately ready to start collecting all pieces of pre-raid BiS.
---
Shamans arent. Druids are always the least played. Warlock should be middletier on the popularity
---
you should add the Boomkin class eliminator onefrom when they did the epic flight form.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kfr3602ANI
---
Only if you are a noob and don't know the way around ST. It is a long well designed dungeon!
---
Maybe the issue is related to the hack they did to make spell batching work? Like maybe it also batches melee attacks as well? Just a thought.
---
Right but this is months down the line. Many months.
---
Do any of you remember a video named "A Horde too Far"? It was an in-game video where a Tauren and a an Undead traveled across Kalimdor. Lots of nostalgic music like Linkin Park etc.
---
I haven't been able to find it online for the past 10 years, but maybe it will resurface now.
---
yes but people will still be able to get rank 14, only on pve servers will that be a problem
---
Paladins and Warlock still get their lvl50 class quest
---
Anyone with any WoW game sense should be able to easily make 1-60 in 10 days /played.... we’re forgetting most people literally clicked their spells during vanilla and didn’t even have quest trackers. We used thottbot and wowhead to find quest locations. They didn’t revamp many of the old questing zones until like WOTLK or Cata so many of us have those areas ingrained in our minds
---
True. At lease 3 I believe and it could be more.
---
The best overall pvp spec for priests is actually trispec [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGRhZbLtZVMgdcz](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGRhZbLtZVMgdcz) only problem with this is that you need gear for it before it works. I wouldnt play this before I had 6k mana minimum while still having high HP and some spellpower. Untill then you go Power infusion, great for PVP and you can raid with it too without respeccing [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMusAioobxtcc](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMusAioobxtcc)
---
TL;DR Spec power infusion when you hit 60 and when you have raided abit and collected some decent gear (tier 1/2 + benediction) you can go tri-spec.
---
Seems the Field of Strife is the normal Stress-Test Realm, since a few Streamers have Chars on it.
---
Yes, roughly the same, with rank 14 weapons still having higher dps. Chromatically tempered sword is almost as good as ancient qiraji ripper, which is almost as good as the rank 14 weapons.
---
Rogues still want a fast off hand to proc poisons more often, and there is a 1.8 speed rank 14 weapon, while the best alternative outside of that is probably maladath, which is significantly worse.
---
Staff of the shadow flame is not as good as the rank 14 weapon + an AV off hand/jin'do's bag of whammies, if ZG is out.
---
The off hand from emperors is better though, yes, but I never said it wasn't.
---
Are the pets able to hold agro though ? They're melee, so they will have the same problems as a warrior.
---
If they can't then kiting is going to be suboptimal.
---
&gt; The gear upgrades in BFA are much less impactful outside of mythic raiding.
---
I can get BiS gear from doing dungeon, quest, or pvp. When was the last time you played retail?
---
&gt;Also, there exists a gear divide between PvP and PvE gear.
---
ok you havnt played retail in awhile and it shows. There is no pvp or pve gear. All gear is used everywhere.
---
49 inch 31:9 😍
---
Nah, they actually wont. Theyre on the low end of popularity: on private servers, beta, and all the polls. Warriors, shamans/pallys and mages are the top. Priests and druids low. Others mid.
---
And still the least populated compared to the rest of the classes.
---
In my country they were £40 for the basic keyboard without the WoW addon and then £25 for the wow addon.
---
At the time i could barely afford the £9 a month for WoW so £65 for a keyboard was miles away. Wish it was cheaper here.
---
Two jump keys just Incase one breaks from over use on top of horde ah.
---
*Ancient Black Lotus Cry*
---
&gt; I don't really recall Druids ever being tanks in 40 man raids. Maybe off tanks. Am I way off? Are they capable of tanking SOME bosses?
---
Offtank primarily, and yes. I was able to OT Patchwerk in 40 man naxx. The damage that the warriors were taking was too much, so I was offered up as "MEAT SPONGE". (Armor capped druid FTW)
---
&gt; To be a Druid I have to be a Tauren, and I'm not a huge fan of the Tauren model.
---
You're not in caster form for long enough typically, unless you are playing a healer, you're not in caster form for long.
---
&gt; Did Druids ever do halfway decent DPS? Weren't their crit or magic buffs greatly appreciated though?
---
Faerie Fire is amazing, but any druid can drop it. Leader of the pack (+3% crit) wasn't super high priority. As for halfway decent DPS yes, but it's very intense in terms of rotation due to power shifting constantly.
---
&gt; If you played a Druid -- I remember people would basically have 4 sets of gear depending on their role (heal, tank, feral, boomkin). Did anyone do this?
---
Yes, don't forget resist gear. (It SUCKED, and don't take rez sickness... unless you want to be broke forever)
---
&gt; I remember geared druids in bear form were borderline unkillable in PvP duels (they couldn't kill you either though). Am I remembering this correctly?
---
Druids in 1v1 are incredibly hard to kill. But they can kill you, it's a battle of attrition. It just takes a WHILE.
---
&gt; Since I want to World PvP, the Druid would probably be better suited since it is better at adapting to many situations. Can also be stealth.
---
100%. Stealth is a MASSIVE advantage, add on top of that, travel form, heals you are nightmare fuel in WPvP.
---
&gt; In Vanilla, I remember druids mostly being healers. However, I also remember seeing Boomkin DPS and Feral DPS. DPS'ers also like their buffs.
---
Yes boomkins can be invited, people just have a massive rod up their butts about "non-meta" builds. There were times when I would be sitting in moonkin form while "healing" strat, as our group was literally 2 mages and a warlock. (would shift out, stack hots on tank then shift back so they could get +3% crit aura)
---
You forgot the best selling point of being a horde druid:
---
**TELEPORT MOONGLADE**. If you are raiding and doing endgame content regularly, you are setting your hearth to kargath. With that being done, instead of paying a mage every single time to get a port back to org, enter teleport: NOWHERE! (Moonglade). There's a flight master in southern moonglade that can send you to Org.
---
Ok? Not sure how that’s relevant?
---
I still can't normally listen to PIMP by 50 without thinking of MAGE. I was like 10 when he was at his peak (2007-2008) and I had his songs on replay all day every day. I still know the lyrics from many of his songs by heart even though it's hard to listen to his stuff now that I'm older.
---
To answer more of your questions regarding populations - the truth is we don’t know. Currently on the stress tests I believe each layer held about 3k people. Which means assuming more than one layer per continent already puts us at 12k populations - which after playing some of the more popular blizz like servers - is pretty crazy packed after layering gets removed. 
---
We’ll have to see how they fine tune it.
---
Some guilds were so good in this game, they got the world firsts 15 years ago before classic was even released..crazy
---
This and Assassinate by Nyhm were my favorites
---
Field of Strife - they announced that as, correct me if I misremember, an AV test
---
He has stonescale just not in all the places you can get them
---
You are largely responsible for causing me to preemptively relapse into full blown addiction to a game I haven't played in 5 years, and this happened MONTHS before the release.
---
I just wanted to thank you. Thanks for the quality content you've been giving the community to chew on as of late. The guests and features clearly have taken a lot of time and effort to orchestrate and on behalf of the community, we appreciate you.
---
Well yes, obviously. That’s why I said for their own factions. Thank you for the downvote.
---
My first move at raid time was to open trade and hand as many stacks of water as they wanted off to the healers. 
---
Can't dps if your dead....
---
Sorry for your loss. Try to remember her as the person who she was when you both played, when beebee was created. Remember the good times. As it is often easier to only remember the bad things...
---
I personally think it is a great idea of you to recreate a memory of her in that way. As you take that character on new adventures, you know she will be tagging along with you in some way.
---
Might sound stupid, but I created a Druid when my cat passed away just for the sole purpose to process my loss and in some way still feel connected to her.
---
I'm curious about this too, but with regards to spells.
---
Like for the bonus damage from Arcane Power, does the buff need to be active when you finish the cast? When the bolt hits? When you start the cast?
---
&gt;	I just KNEW that Blizzard is not releasing Classic because they have big hearts and love the players...they did it because it was TIME to REDO all the mistakes that they did in the last 15 years with WoW, and in this process to prove, again, that they can revolutionize the MMO gaming in 2019 like they did in 2004.
---
I assume you meant to say UNDO instead of REDO, although the people running the show on Classic are the same people who gave us BfA, so maybe you were right the first time... 
---
Either way, there’s only so many ways this can go in regards to undoing their previous mistakes:
---
1.	They release Classic and that’s it, once the final phase is released and we get Naxx, they cease development, we get a perpetual Vanilla server with zero new content beyond what was originally released. People eventually get bored and quit altogether or they jump back to whatever state retail WoW is in. This is probably where a potential actual (new engine, no carryover from current retail) WoW2 would best fit, it would give them time to release that by the time people are done with Classic. In any case, there needs to be something to come back to because realistically how long will people continue playing a game with absolutely zero new content once they’ve cleared Naxx and have full BiS?
---
2.	They go the Runescape method and create a new timeline after Classic which is unlikely to follow any previous history, meaning no TBC, WOTLK, essentially Vanilla +. Here’s probably the best place for them to correct any previous mistakes, especially if they allow the community to vote like in OSRS - in that scenario, theoretically the community *could* vote to keep the lore of TBC, WoTLK, etc. but avoid adding in some of the systems and changes that came with them like LFR, etc. You’re still splitting the community between retail and Classic+ though, but if they knock it out of the park then you’ll see more and more retail players switching over... if that’s the case, “Old School WoW” *is* WoW2 and I think it means the end of retail. 
---
3.	They release TBC Classic, WOTLK Classic, etc. as separate clients/servers with the option of copying your character each time they open a new expansion, allowing people to choose which expansion they stay in. Similar to 1 in that the only content released is what was in the original expansion, released in phases, and once you reach the endgame you run out of content. I find this scenario very unlikely as it further fragments an already fragmented player base, even though the pserver scene has proven there is demand for just about any expansion up to and including MoP it just doesn’t seem feasible. 
---
I personally find scenario 2 to be the most likely if the goal is to maintain current players while attracting new players and getting back old ones. As stated above, if it got popular enough it could even just straight up replace retail as we know it today - at the end of whatever expansion they decide to end the current retail timeline, they could have the old gods/Sargeras cause the end of the world, and the only way to fix it is to go all the way back to the events of Vanilla, TBC, or WoTLK, whatever, BOOM merged timelines, no more maintaining both Classic and retail, and now an excuse to go in an actual new direction so we don’t cause the end of the world again. I think in my ideal world, we’d get Classic versions of TBC and WotLK and the end of that would be concurrent with the end of retail at which point they are merged into WoW2/Classic+ and then start going into completely new territory. They could choose to keep or ignore whatever lore, characters, races, classes, etc. came before but in new or different ways, there’s so much potential...
---
I guess a big part of it will come down to how many people want new vs how many people want perpetual vanilla, I’m honestly surprised at the number of people asking for classic to be a “living museum” - I can understand the #nochange crowd but I don’t get the idea of just ending at Naxx.
---
Most logical response to 2 jump keys thus far.
---
Oh man this is a great question. I want to say Darnassus because I love absolutely love the look of it - but, it also feels terrible to traverse it in my opinion. 
---
I’ll say Ironforge. It has such an amazing atmosphere. I feel completely immersed within the fantasy every time I step foot in it.
---
lol, I spent half my time bullshitting in raids... with one of the main healers... like, our guild was chill so it wasn't a huge deal, and we never got past MC, but I had fun and always had an invite to raids. I also understood this was why I was never gonna see the end of BWL, but that wasn't a priority for me
---
Ngl, I still spent a lot of time inspecting/drooling over that sweet, sweet bloodfang gear
---
I mean, every pserver is different and I think they often scale based on pop so results will vary. Regardless though, even if the cooldown was an hour instead of 6 minutes, it would stand to reason that prices would jump drastically given the limited amount of nodes and importance of flasks.
---
1.5 months at 46 hours a week the grind is real
---
Im not saying Classic wont be successful, its gonna probably break Twitch honest based on past events, but I just don't think starting zones will have an issue. These stress test they been doing have really been making those starting zones clean.
---
I just hope it works. I know in the gnome starting area theres an item you need to loot off the ground and it has like a 30 second respawn. I had to skip it on private servers.
---
&gt; I see everyone glossing over Balance - is it really that bad? I'm thinking of focusing on I heard it has severe mana issues, but idk.
---
Moonkins are known as "OOMKIN". The gear to support the absurd mana cost of balance spells, while holding +spell damage enough to make the damage decent, comes later on in the timeline (AQ era). But even then, by then the difficulty starts ramping up, so it's much harder to compete.
---
If you want to heal and rdps, might want to look more towards ele shaman!
---
I originally played on a PvP server back in the day, and one big difference involving griefing was that if you asked for help you got it. Higher level players weren't queued for 5+ instances or focusing on dailies etc. They may have been in LFG chat or farming, but when given the chance they typically had time to help. 
---
I remember my guild typically starting out by raiding Xroads to mislead the Horde and then heading to STV via Ratchet and then hijacking the zeppelin at Grom Gol. We'd essentially try to hit as many major hubs as we could in one night before eventually the Horde would catch up to us or we got tired and went to bed. But we'd always start a full scale war. 
---
It wasn't like how it is now where one or two max level players can essentially grief the same spot uninterrupted for hours because every one else has something they *have* to do.
---
Not anymore, if the polls or the pservers are any indication. Warriors, shamans/pallys and mages take top 3.
---
more myndflame - slim jims

---
It's 200% sarcasm, how can you not see that??????
---
People talk of it fondly, but at the time people complained that it never ended and wanted guards damage and HP reduced, especially at the bridge going north into the Alliance base.
---
So people don't follow a sports team? get over yourself.

See my other comment about "nothing matters until 60" because I consider that pretty much BS. Whether or not a developer intended something to be in the game doesn't change the game itself, eg: Wave Dashing, Rocket Jumping, Bunny Hopping. Regardless of intent, you can start approaching end game content with purpose starting as early as the late 40s in Vanilla. I'm not saying you can't do this in TBC starting at around 65, but what I'm instead saying is TBC 100% changes that 40-60 experience and turns it into just getting to level 58 as fast as possible.
---
But you're right about content becoming obsolete. It's my issue with having Vanilla transform into TBC/WOTLK post-launch. Not having those expansions down the road means Classic can continue and remain an easy-going experience. If I haven't even seen Naxx for years after Classic is released, I'll still have time to visit it as long as people are still playing the game, and the gear from it will still be relevant. If extra content is added but the game remains at the same level cap, then all of that content will remain relevant if it needs to be cleared to get to the next. I don't need to clear MC to get to BWL to get to AQ to get to Naxx in TBC, I just need to get to 70 and do the TBC raid tiers. I don't like content becoming obsolete or irrelevant because it effectively means all my time put into it is wasted. If classic can stay Vanilla then every aspect of end game content that you explore and put time towards will continue to remain relevant for the entirety of that game's lifespan.

bullshit
---
Gear score - Armory - Spam of damage meters by non officers - Micromanagement of other classes than your own ( or other characters than your own ) = These are all basically the same thing. It equates to insecurity, stress and/or not enough IRL time to put into the game of Vanilla WoW.
---
It seems that I was all over because it's all the same cancer.
---
A true elite player of Vanilla WoW would not spam damage meters or show off his gear. 
---
Most people would know him(her) simply by the in game NAME and nothing else would be needed.
---
No armory, no REAL ID cancer function and sometimes no gear.
---
Elite players in early Vanilla used to run in almost naked into premades and still pwn the shit out of whoever was terrified ( or gave up ) on the other side and then most would log off in a dress
---
because it was lame to show off exactly what enchants etc. to the other faction when the cancer of the Armory was forced upon everyone. I have no issues with 3rd party addons but don't force everyone who wants a semblance of privacy log off naked. Inspection was meaningless for elite players. Everyone knew approximately what Tier they had simply by the GUILD NAME, pvp effort or relentless killing in the open World. Unfortunately there is no addon to delete gear score and bring back a server feeling with real in game relationships where you knew almost everyone.
---
Nymh didn't do Ulduar, it was Cranius and Summergale.
---
&gt; I can't decide but I do know that I want to blow shit up in PvP and still be relevant in raids. Mostly likely a caster as melee isn't my cup of tea.
---
Caster is probably, much easier to get a raid spot, while exploding people.
---
Ele shamans are a thing in classic, you can still heal while being elemental with heal gear on. A ton of shaman gear in general, have bonuses for elemental shamans which is funny.
---
Millions of subs, around 10k beta players.
---
Some good odds.
---
chill fam
---
All these gold values will be determined by each individual server so not really sure why you shared them. Also if you're not farming DF in azshara you're doing it wrong
---
I like the 22-24" range. I feel it is the best size for your standard computer desk set-up. The 28-32+ seems too big to take in everything at once.
---
It really depends on your set-up really.
---
Regardless, I'm going to be listening to it on my drive home from work.
---
Tell her that 75¢ will be used for the rent/expenses for the home she'll end up in.
---
&gt;Just because people can camp entrances doesn't make it griefing
---
I'm not saying you sholdn't do it (to each his own) but that's literally the definition of griefing. Camping by definition is griefing.
---
yep. But I guess it is just the Stress-Test Realm.

You can dance if you wanna

&gt;A paladin is a slow leveling class. --- Class leveling time multipliers currently are: ... paladin (1.25x) as second slowest.
---
Paladin leveling is boring, NOT slow.
---
Was that a blood elf? Dis gus ting!
---
Thanks for the tip, highly appriciated! Have to look it up :)
---
As a Scot, its definitely deadpan humour. It was pretty obvious to me but I get how other cultures might struggle to pick it up.
---
lol i totally forgot about this. can anyone on beta confirm its still there?
---
Less common yes, but there's still at least one in every zone.  As for a lot of zones having end game dungeons/raids... we've got: 
---
BRS/MC/BWL (Blackrock Mountain)
---
DM (Feralas)
---
Strat/Scholo/Naxx (EPL)
---
Ony (Dustwallow)
---
ZG (STV)
---
AQ (Silithus)
---
6 zones, half of which are level 50+.  That brings us down to 3 "low-level" zones, Feralas, STV, and Dustwallow, that you might be walking around as a 60 on your way to endgame content, and I'm being generous including DM.
---
they really are willing to create special servers to test things over letting people into beta to actually test things
---
I still can't help but feel the vast majority of people who will make a mistake like this, in a game this old, are the ones who will never set foot in this forum
---
Pat was my idol in vanilla and I actually got to contact him via MySpace and I got his phone number. He even played on my account a little bit lol
---
It gets worse as you level up, in the early game it's quite forgiving
---
Darnassus &lt;3 So mystical and calm and cool. Love all Night Elf stuff but I'm glad to be getting Darnassus back.
---
Do you guys think Method is secretly practicing leveling routes/boss strats etc. on their own self hosted 1.12 pserver?
---
Alamo.
---
That 2% figure refers to Naxx 40m from what I remember, and i think that was global.  If i remember correctly only 11 guilds in the US completed Naxx???  That being said raiding in Vanilla really was exclusive because the commitment and dedication was so much higher.  You didn't just click a button, zone in and get showered with free loot...
---
Raids were dropped to 25m and 10m in TBC for a reason.  They developed flex raiding and 20m mythic for a reason.
---
I think you guys are grossly underestimating the sheer frustration of the logistics of fielding 40 man raid teams, which realistically means a roster of 50+.  There are some really dumb people in this sub, imagine trying to corral 40 of you to be somewhere at a specific time and place to do a specific thing for a expended period of time.  Now add in attunements, which aren't so bad on their own but can become a pain in the ass when it comes to guild and raid team recruiting, esp as you progress further up the tiers.  Now add in resistance gear sets.  Consumables.  Enchants.  People actually getting good pre-raid gear.  People that actually know how to play.  People that actually go out of their way to be team players and bring their A-Game.  Lets no forget 40 man raid bosses only drop a couple pieces of gear.  Yea, 2 pieces.  That's a lot of trouble for people to go through, a lot of time and effort to invest in, for very little reward.  And that's just you dumb dps'ers. Imagine the bullshit the guild and raid leaders have to deal with.
---
The path to raiding in Vanilla was a painful one that most people did not engage in.  Raiding became more and more popular and accessible as each expansion came.  TBC being the best of all IMO.  It took everything Vanilla was built upon and improved it.
---
Dwarves get the ole triple ambush cold blood eviscerate
---
Yeap, on top of proffessions etc
---
ps there isnt a FP in every zone :D
---
Back in vanilla, people played fine on tiny screens.  I think I had a 15 inch 4:3 monitor.  You'll be more than okay with a 21 inch.
---
How is ele shaman mobility? Are they slippery / hard to kill?
---
Yeah, good point. 
---
I have to agree that classic should be played in a way someone enjoys it however weird that is for me.
---
To me buying gear seems like robbing yourself of the experience of earning it. Even if it takes a year killing Ragnaros with your friends is worth much more than buying a boost and just see other people do it for you.
---
I'm pretty sure if someone looks for it there are guilds that raid on a schedule that fits you or a guild that does really short or irregular raids.
---
Another option is to make friends people that do raid regularly and get into their guild I'm sure there will be more casual guilds where everyone is welcome and they can take them along for the lower tier raids.
---
Tier 0 is the blue dungeon set, Tier 0.5 is the epic upgrades.
---
I like that there are no ads and no in app purchases. Keep up the good work.
---
Horde side for functionality Thunderbluff is king the Auctioneers and the bank are so close to eachother it is wonderful.
---
Alliance side has to be Stormwind based entirely on the music.
---
Are these dungeons foreign to a lot of players? I don’t think people are coming to classic for a brand new experience. they know exactly what they’re going to get. and yes, the streamer invites are 100% for hype, and it’s clearly working
---
I was but I was solo.  I hit rank 12, was .4% away from 13 when blizz changed the honor system.  I would have hit GM is like two more weeks if TBC didnt come out.
---
Wasn't really possible that early.  The guards and archers can murder average geared 60's, the named elites are a real force.
---
So the reason most book time off is to play hardcore for 16+ hours in an attempt to get ahead of the massive cluster of casual players who only play 4-8 hours a day
---
If you take say 3 days off to play your basically just gonna end up back in the zerg pack. 
---
My advice is wait a week if you dont intend to play hardcore and just play behind the zerg pack at your leisure
---
&gt; Regarding the Orcs, "willingly" is a bit of a strong word. They were a simple nomadic people conned into enslavement by Gul'dan and Mannoroth. It's like saying the Native Americans "willingly" sold all their goods and lands to the Europeans and then "willingly" settled on barren reservations after centuries of diaspora. Consent by fraud is not consent, nor is a technologically limited people equivalent in bargaining power to a technocratic and militarized people.
---
Yeah except the fraud in this case is: "Hey eradicate these people mercilessly because your ancestors said so." You can say whatever you like about how clever Kil'jaeden was for exploiting this aspect of orc culture, but did it really not occur to anybody to check? Like, presumably there were shaman besides Ner'zhul who could ask directly. In any case, many orcs did a whole bunch of repugnant shit long before any demon blood was involved and I think we can all agree that "just following orders" isn't an excuse from moral conduct. 
---
Also I feel like you don't name your clan Warsong, Laughing Skull, or Bonechewer if you're a group of simple peace-loving nomads. Obviously the orcs are a diverse species and they can have different ideas about how to conduct themselves, but pretending that all of them were just in the wrong place at the wrong time is disingenuous. 
---
&gt; The Forsaken-engineered Plague is not designed to target humans.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=407/fields-of-grief
---
&gt; and if the humans of Lordaeron didn't keep trying to burn them all "alive", they'd hardly be concerned with fighting. They're defending themselves from two groups of former allies.
---
The former of which Sylvanas betrayed. You can make the argument that the Forsaken have as much claim to Lordaeron as its living citizens (you'd be wrong imo), but there's no moral high ground here. Garithos intended to use the Forsaken as a weapon to retake Lordaeron and then banish them but Sylvanas was plotting literally the exact same thing.
---
The Horde are cool because they face a lot of trials but take it in stride. White washing their history and framing them as perpetual victims neuters their development and makes them appear incompetent at best and malicious at worst.
---
If I've heard correctly, having two characters isn't really a thing or feasible. I still have some thinking to do then. Ill be looking at population stats of private servers in the meantime. Thank you stranger
---
This doesn't change your argument, because missing out on gear in a run sucks, *but*: I remember the disappointment of not getting an item I was coveting due to losing a need roll, or seeing other people feel that way, but I never remember arguments. It seems like people all over this sub refer to drama I never remember seeing, just curious if my experience was unique...
---
I only remember arthas realm forums stuff.
---
That is an exceptionally large amount of alcohol. About average for a Wisconsinite tho!
---
Ummm Naxx and its tier set were identical to Classic with the exception of raid size. You like classic? You dont like classic? Am confused.
---
Imagine not being 60 until October!

Can be pretty slippery, ghost wolf + earthbind totem makes it easy to kite, along with frostshock!
---
Add heals, and various other totems and they can be pretty brutal in face to face combat.
---
4 hours a day... and you say you’re casual?
---
My dude, that’s more than 90% of people can/will be playing.
---
Hyjal wasn't a raid.   It was an exploit.
---
Why on earth would they care about player behavior being the same as at launch? They're testing NPC mechanics, values, the actual gameplay. It's not as if they're gonna change the rules of the battleground to something it never was in 1.12 due to how players choose to use those values, npcs and mechanics.
---
If She keeps playing with my childhood belongings she’s gonna be in a mental home. Lmao
---
Very much so! Also you could grind rep
---
It's going to depend on your desk and seating setup but really it's not going to make any difference. You'd be able to play the game absolutely fine at the highest levels at 1080p on a 13inch laptop screen if you really had to.
---
The design is fine, the awful purple is not
---
I'm talking about gathering supplies to turn in, taking control of the mines, and maybe even summoning the giants.
---
completely disagree, honestly have been a ''high end'' pserver raider for a few years, and have been raiding high end in retail for past 6 years, the difficulty difference from retail to classic is nearly uncomparable, it all comes down to time investment, and these high end retail guilds spend 3x the time the pserver guilds do+ they are much better players mechanically.
---
Okay.
---
Same thing with considering "elitism" a bad thing. It's people that glorify being lazy and bad and are convinced not even trying at all and being shitty at what you do is what people should aim for.
---
Look at those stupid elitists trying to be good at the game, while I'm so great because the highest difficulty I clear is LFR.
---
Love it. Thank you for the reply and the context.
---
When I looked up the PvP set, it seemed a little more focused on spell power than tanky/feral.  Is that about right? For PvP gear, I guess I would also just need to find a niche set of gear for whatever I wanted to focus?
---
I'd love a classic experience with dungeon content akin to M+ vault of the wardens or  Blackrook.
---
It doesn't have anything to do with farming BiS gear first, Alliance was barely queuing for WSG at 30 and that only required 10.  Alliance in the beta is flat out not queuing for BGs, and for the Horde its pretty frustrating.
---
pservers are toxic because the player base is very niche, and lets be honest is simultaneously on a high horse with a stick up their ass. classic will bring everyone in, so there will be toxicity but it will be diluted
---
well let me try again, TBC good, Arena good, Flying good.
---
As I said on the video, I’ve been a rather filthy casual always. :( I want to have even a taste of the glorious non-casual life
---
Not really worth to pickpocket until you get to SM, if you need extra gold for mount.  Then level to 60 and do brd pickpocket runs with the correct spec, to minimize downtime.  This would burn me out personally but if speed is your goal, this is what i would recommend.
---
FFS it's annoying when some ppl create almost the same threats every 5-6 hours

my bad pc wasn't able to run AV :( in the big fights i had to take places that were almost alone and stay away of most battles :( but this time will be different!
---
Unless you're going to be a part of the highest tier progression or serious min/max guilds, race doesn't matter.  Priest is the only exception that this is argued about because of the extra racial class traits, but you shouldn't pick a race that you won't enjoy just to be 'better' in the communities eyes.  Pick what race you enjoy, because you can clear content without fear ward as you said with the Horde.
---
Wanna give priest a go. Dwarf or Troll? Not sure how faction affects things tbh
---
Gnomes are awesome man. A male bald gnome with a mustache is a strong choice for alliance, imo the best look. Would play if human racials wasn't op. Alas you can take solace in hearing their death sound accompanied by their fantastic death animation.
---
well mdi is shit cause current dungeons are generally bad compared to legion dungeons for m+ atleast.
---
I am torn between playing a healer or a warrior (tank) and could use some input.  I’ll be leveling mostly with a group of friends with no end game experience in wow. I have a lot of TBC and WOTLK experience as dps and healer but didn’t know if a tank or healer would be better to run in a group of friends with little experience. Thoughts?
---
Just play as a NE. If you spec right and show you are reliable and not a complete mong you will do just fine.
---
Filthy Casual
---
With the running and stopping to keep leeway from triggering in vanilla, it was something that I did personally on my druid and hunter when kiting some mobs and players. It was pretty common then. ( We just called it stutter stepping )
---
Well nothing like that is going to be changed 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
You have a choice to make
---
Classic has to have a debuff limit because vanilla did. I'm saying this as I plan on rolling a warlock but I wouldn't want to touch class balance at all.
---
Ironforge for sure, I watched a blizz documentary where they said it was supposed to be about 3 times bigger than it is today. It was also supposed to have multiple levels. Wish we could see what that would look like.

There are keywords that the automods look for due to the fact there are a lot of posts that break the rules.

I would recommend taking a look at the 7 rules on the side panel and seeing if maybe this is due to breaking one of them?
---
Play night elf. Healers will always be in demand, no need to stress over it.
---
Will you even get to the point where racials matter? I think not.
---
I dont know if there was anything I didn't like about BC. I'll edit if I think of something.

Because I think that level 30 duel tournament showed that was a load of bs. I doubt it'll be a big deal in PvE either.

Heigan dange isn't THAT hard. It's quite easy once you understand the rythm.

However, if you make a mistake, you die.

As I said, easy but punishing.
---
We're arguing semantics at this point. What people generally mean by complexity is something more than simply "higher number of interconnected parts". Even here, in this thread, many call old talent trees complex because they see them as some sort of pinnacle of customization wherein they can experiment to their hearts desire.
---
It should cancel the cast, yeah.
---
Un'Goro was one of my favorite zones. I spent months there with my hunter. Skinning/Herbalism. Made a ton of gold.
---
I literally got 3 answers saying "yes", "no", and, "small amount"
---
Their raid streams have been really popular though, I think they will be bored to tears by the raids themselves but probably enjoy gearing and the overall game a lot more
---
Things that make you go ughhhh
---
I remember when the zeppelin video was released where somebody hacked the destinations and changed them.
---
Priest, what can people tell me about the priest class? Why would it be a good or bad choice? And what are they like as a class at level 60?
---
Thanks
---
One is fun, one is not. There, I could have saved whoever made this like hours of time.
---
So who did Arthas shag?
---
What? You're telling me some people don't play fantasy games to power trip being a small pudgy child with an adult face? Crazy.
---
They've tried testing BGs organically but the player pool simply isn't large enough to get as many as they'd probably like, to include some player behavior aspects (alliance isn't queuing).  An organic AV with the current pop would never happen, so forcing us into it is probably their best option
---
Yes it is more spellpower, but the set bonus puts it over the top. Also ferals love the hybrid stats. (Even look at AQ set, it's hybrid stats) as we get benefit from all of it.
---
Ferals are very hybrid focused, constantly shifting and using all of their spells to their advantage, as such will be using all of it. As well as the pvp set gives you +15% move speed to travel form (and other forms), which means you're travel form (even while carrying the flag) is 55%.
---
Yeah I agree, TBC was good and arena is good. Doesn’t mean it’s flawless. Seems like you posted without reading
---
I mean yeah fear ward is great. If you don’t want to play dwarf don’t play dwarf. You should play what you want. Fears in raids can be dealt with and managed, sure FW would help. But at the end of the day you should be happy with what you are playing even if it’s just the looks. Plenty of people played non-dwarf priests in vanilla.
---
Yeah man, not my thing but you do you. I will be interested to see how you're doing once classic launches. Best of luck.
---
If u want to play a old school really good mmo.. u should return.
---
I mean its 12.99 for a month of trial.
---
AV rep was pretty nice. If you didn't raid, it was the best way to get an epic weapon. Also, the blue polearm from AV was useful for a long time for me.
---
Probably not the most efficient farming method, but I enjoyed just doing all the different objectives and it was rewarding.
---
method wont be doing MC race.
---
Sounds like the tutorial to Dark Souls.
---
&gt; Staff of the shadow flame is not as good 
---
no, it's better.
---
Thank you for sharing your story. It’s not dumb making a character over your cat. Animals are also huge parts of our lives and loss is hard. It’s what makes us human.
---
"Better cities" Oldschool Orgrimmar would like to have a word with you.
---
Proud of you, bud.
---
No changes. Also, just play nelf and frack the racials. Vanilla was never about minmaxing anywhere near to as much as this subreddit makes it out to be. If you are not going for server firsts it doesn't matter what race you play. So go ahead and have fun and you will be able to raid just fine.
---
I disagree with this. When dungeons open up to 10/15 man you need to be the right spec and this will need to happen long before you step a foot into MC. While you level if you choose to handicap yourself for the sake of fun and experimenting then that's on you but don't handicap your group because you choose to play that way. Vanilla had a lot to do with player reputation so keep that in mind when your running with groups at 60.
---
Give it a try ! believe me, most ppl wont even race to 60 because it takes a huge amount of time,
---
another point is raiding, there will be a huge number of GUilds that want to raid. U deffo will get a spot:)
---
Greetings

The Ooga gang is awesome on so many levels. Can't wait for classic!!
---
I recently started watching a few 3s streams when cdew was streaming the other day. I haven't pvped properly since wrath but the time to kill in PvP arenas  seems so much longer now. I remember in TBC the burst could be in 3-4 seconds if you were against something like rogue, mage, priest
---
I am in the same boat... wanting to PvP as elemental and still be able to heal in raids.
---
That is literally the only thing Blizzard does enforce on RP realms. All the rules requiring respecting RP were removed since they were a nightmare to enforce.
---
Its very strong in early phases of vanilla for druids
---
Feral is the best 3rd tank in the game. They help you be able to focus all of your plate between the main tank and off tank vs having to have a 3rd warrior that you have to awkwardly shuffle into the gearing mix. My guild &lt;Participation Totems&gt; will be running a feral druid for this exact reason. Not only that but the feral druid tank will be in our Main tank group so it benefits from the Enhancement shaman that will be totem twisting as well as the warlock with bloodpack. Giving the main and off tanks 3% crit is a very large TPS increase and when myself and my off tank swap to DW/Defiance spec we will be needing as much crit as possible. Druid tanks are yuge in the wow meta right now because of their High HP and tons of armor they make for incredible tanks all the way through the game. Not to mention their high TPS numbers. Hope this shines some light on the viability on druid tanks, and gives you the confidence you need to stick it out and get into a guild.

As far as high fantasy media goes I would put it in third behind these other franchises. There really isn’t enough good fantasy adventure out there
---
Wow that’s beautiful man
---
Depends on several factors, the biggest one being can you find goals to entertain yourself? Games like WoW or Minecraft are fun time wasters, but really shine if you're the kind of player that can come up with your own goal. 
---
For some people, that's making a geared out twink, for others getting rare fish, for some people it's end game raiding and others it's role playing. 
---
As classic won't have all the content the expansions introduced, a lot of the game will be you finding ways to enjoy it. Does that sound fun? Do you have friends invested in playing it as well? Then go for it!
---
Pathetic.
---
I have my CE box on my shelf and my Vanilla strategy guide on my desk next to me.
---
MC is not the hard part. Getting 40 people to 55 the fastest is the hard part.
---
But with methods level of preparation I'm sure they will have their rotue to 60 perfected.
---
Haha. It's easy enough to insulate them from chat.
---
Nymph used to stream a few years ago. I remember playing with him in another game. He was still rapping but not really about WoW. He seems like a wholesome guy.
---
You could save up all your mats. But how are you making gold to 60?
---
Make gold with mining/skinning. Drop skinning once you have the lvl 40 mount. Get BS. Level it to 300 and craft yourself gear.farm the mats for leveling engineering, save them up. Drop mining and level engineering to 300. 
---
Now you buy mats and craft gear for profit and buy the mats you need for the stuff you want.
---
But get yourself a decent amount of gold first, thos always costs more then you think!
---
9 days for a warrior? Fuckin challenge accepted
---
3rd best? Are paladins better than ferals in vanilla? I don't know the meta that well
---
Blonde is recessive though
---
I think you should give it a chance, picking a separate faction will help with the repetition a lot. I would also say TBC was still like 13 years ago so it'll probably still feel fresh.
---
Also in regard to the community experience, there will be folks who race to 60 and are at the end game within a few weeks. But I would say the vast majority of players are now adults with jobs, families, and responsibilities. For the first while I think there will be players across all levels depending on how often they can play. 
---
I would give'r a shot even just for a week or two  and if you find yourself bored then at least you can say you tried it as opposed to missing out and wondering if...
---
it's not like you only take one priest to a raid.  there will be plenty of meta slave dwarves to fill spots with.  you'll be the one laughing when you get to starshards an arcane vulnerable drake in BWL
---
The new content, if any were to be made, should definitely keep all the same levels, skills, and all that jazz. Added content doesn't have to be an expansion. I personally would like to see it too.

According to most graphs I've seen like [this one](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/t_original/1241945255815773287.png), it peaked near the end of Wotlk, so that's not really true.
---
Wotlk built on TBC and grew the sub count, then Cata completely tanked it.
---
The game died in Cata. Cata was really, really bad.
---
thinking people who play 14 hours a day on pservers are anywhere near the lvl of spergness of high tier wow retail players LuL.
---
It's where I really got my raiding in, I did a little bit in Vanilla but that was with a guild that only got through MC/AQ20/ZG.
---
I honestly didn't even know they were fishable from that location o the map. I always got mine outside of WC
---
No it isn't...
---
I think the whole Defias Brotherhood - Onyxia story line could be much more interesting so they could bring a less mainstream but still well known story line.
---
Maybe Farthas after that.
---
&gt; yes but people will still be able to get rank 14
---
you need 500 people with 15hk for the week to allow 1 guy to get the 13k rank points required to rank up more than rank 12. With BG this translates to 500 people queuing up for 1BG every week. Without you are relying on random people to randomly pvp around the world. Which means Rank14 will be highly unreliable before BGs are out.
---
Azshara is my go-to for Dreamfoil and Mountain Silversage. And like my time in Vanilla, I will continue to murder any Horde that I see farming in my territory.
---
Hey mate, I'll be doing the same sort of thing. And we got a similar background, which is nice. I'm self employed, so I've planned at least three months of absence in order to no-life. 
---
I'll be rolling a Dwarf Warrior (Tank), so let me know if you're interested in partnering up sometime. 
---
I'm from England.
---
TBC baby here; how were you able to tell?
---
But Bolvar has brown hair.
---
I think it was Arthas.
---
They like making fun of RPers for views and pseudoRPing to troll.
---
as others have pointed out, the horse is already dead bud
---
Oh I remember this post from last time you posted it here, nice. You should get good and world pvp people your own level like a big boi, maybe then you would have some views and actually be accomplishing something
---
Total war: Three kingdoms?
---
I use a Samsung 49" 4K TV for 60 fps gaming. No freesync but I'd rather have the screen size for immersion.
---
Crank that Druid boy goes hard
---
Im a bit scared when it comes to openPvP. During leveling phase and 60. Am I an easy target?
---
Gold "are" lul
---
I think you should definitely try it when it launches, you only have to sub for one month which cost barely more than a cinema ticket nowadays. You can try it and if you do not like it then you can just stop playing whenever you feel like. I think the launch experience will be really unique for those like you and me who started playing just before tbc came out.
---
Oh i thought you were talking in general. I see now
---
He's being sarcastic.
---
It's on the herb list, usually do it for myself due to low amount of dreamfoil.
---
Looking forward to the white lion from the barrens.
---
I feel like Bobby B is only on r/freefolk
---
Obv go for the ones with the biggest axe
---
Thanks for the insight
---
Yeah I remember when hunter pets were also kind of a way to show off. 
---
When I finally got Bangalash I was getting some gz from other hunter friends. However, I don't think as many people will say stuff like this now lol Makes me wonder how social the community will be..
---
I also remember not seeing many other hunter tame the tigers in Winterspring, and getting compliments. Maybe because there weren't as many resources?
---
Just lvl 24, long way to go! Life to WIN💪🏽
---
I've played far too much Warcraft 3 to feel that Zepplins doesn't fit in.
---
In my eyes, ships feels completely unnatural to the World of Warcraft.
---
Like, you neeeever really use transport ships in warcraft 3 normally, just a few times you see them in campaigns and they look off like fuck. And Alliance/Goblin ships just looks weird in vanilla. If they were a bit more special like the turtle ship in Northrend or like the later Orc/Undead/Alliance ships then sure. But as the ''standard'' vanilla ship... meeeeh (I'll concede that Night elf ships look cool)
---
A priest is still a priest in raids. We had one she showed up and healed her little heart out even though she was Nelf she was till a priest and brought heals. You really only need 2 dwarf priests in a raid. which is enough to maintain the fearward on the main tank. But Dwarfs are excellent choices for a priest. And having played one i would 10/10 recommend going female dwarf priest and rocking the double pony tail. That bitch is flapping in the wind like crazy when you heal and it is wonderful.
---
Much better raids, more interesting classes, arenas, and rest of it is as good if not better than vanilla. One problem though is that azeroth is still better than outland imo, luckily you still spend a lot of time in azeroth in tbc. Also, flying is pretty bad but also only in outland so not that big of a deal
---
He's not wrong, though. Most of the last season was pretty much nonsense. They cut so many corners just to wrap it up in 6 episodes. I loved seasons 1-7 but I think I agree, the Warcraft movie was better than season 8.
---
Nah you're not an easy target. Hunters have an awesome tool box that you'll love playing because you can always learn new tricks. 
---
Every class honestly is like this in some way or another, that is, that you can keep getting better.
---
That's not the goal at all. Classic isn't vanilla. There's already way too many changes and differences.
---
No bro you’re king of the jungle while leveling. You literally send your pet in and people die. Make sure to kite, never be in range of spells or intercepts. 
---
At 60 things equalize a bit more. Mages are a threat, especially.
---
Well, there you go.. then 90% of players are casuals according to you. Thats actually a good estimate btw.
---
But it doesnt change the fact that, in my opinion, a hardcore player is someone that is gonna be playing like 12 hours a day... have you ever even watched twitch streams? haha 
---
Asmongold? Sodapoppin? Esfand? How manny hours do you think these guys are putting into the game? lol
---
Not to mention there are a ton of nolife players that doesnt even stream, they just play the game all day.
---
You should watch Southpark's Season 10 Ep 08.. then you gonna understand what Im talking about haha :)
---
a 120 inch projection from a beamer is about the minimum.
---
Was Bobby B ever on this sub?
---
You'll never truly know, nor will we, until you just give it a shot and try it.  I've hated every iteration of current WoW more and more after TBC (didn't even like TBC that much because of flying mounts).
---
And to comment on the race to 60, there's going to be all types.  Yes, there will be the veterans and myself included that are going to b-line for 60 and raiding, but there's going to be a mix of so many people that either don't have as much time as they did 15 years ago or they're new to classic and will be a least a bit slower than everyone else.  Then you have all the casual players that will just enjoy the ride.
---
In short, you'll be fine even at a slow pace.  Don't worry about racing or world firsts, just do what you enjoy and play what you have fun with.
---
I can tell you just haven't been in a serious pserver guild, there's no way you'd talk like that if so. Have you ever gotten a server first boss kill in a relevant private server even?
---
&gt;  it all comes down to time investment
---
Yes indeed, and if you had been in an actual relevant private server guild you'd know there are a lot of jobless people waiting to poopsock the shit out of classic, something method can hardly compete with full time.
---
Very early September it seems go shamanders.
---
Cool.  Do people care though.
---
Azshara has one annoying thing - people herb, but usually leave golden sansam, so after that 90% dots is sansam -\_- It ok zone, just that I don't visit it very often. Getting all dreamfoil I need from WPL and EPL alongside other valuable herbs.
---
Thanks so much for the kind words, I’m glad you’re enjoying the show. We’ll see how everyone’s relapses go upon release, hopefully it’s manageable! :P
---
Will check this out after work.
---
When going for high warlord we'd farm av till ab or wsg would pop. It was a nice filler while we waited, and was a nice place to farm honor kills.
---
Exactly this ^
---
No idea what that other guy is smoking
---
Recycling naxx was a little lazy I think is the argument.
---
most people go there. Very little goes on the shores of STV. Still depends on given population :)
---
In the outside world I am a simple geologist, but in here  I am Falcorn: defender of the alliance. I have braved the fargo deepmine, defeated the bloodfish at jarades landing..
---
Yeah I thought he wasn't getting crushed, oh well!
---
Was worth the trouble though, if i was right it would've been one hell of a bug.
---
That aside, I still think the damage he was taking was a bit low for such a level discrepancy, though that's purely speculation at this point.
---
Man if simple things like this bother you, you really need to rethink your life
---
My monitor is a 32" gaming monitor. Good size for the 2k resolution and DPI is about equivalent to a 24 inch 1080p monitor. People wear by 27" for 2k but I disagree and hate scaling text in windows.
---
It's really based on preference.
---
At this point I’m so sick of Asmongold’s face I could come across an article where he cured cancer and still downvote it as a reflex.
---
Yeah ferals are very viable and wonderful tanks. They are just able to take so much punishment at higher gear levels. Just know it is a thankless job and you will have very certain pieces of gear you will be prioritized on as a feral. But it will feel bad about getting passed over on a lot of other stuff. Because generally you tend to share the same Bis items as other dps or rogue items. So guilds don't prioritize that to the druid sadly. My guild will be but most not he case. Also Rank 13 gear is some of your best items in the game.
---
Now I think about it, I don't think I bought anything from Blizzard except one Hearthstone adventure since they deleted the old forums..........
---
I can assure you every member of Method will be level 60 much faster than the average player. 
---
People need to stop thinking leveling in vanilla was the hardest and most time consuming thing imaginable.
---

Join if you have yet too Akama Freinds.
---
I bet you Blizzard keep "Arthas is Anduin's father" card in their sleeves thinking its gonna be great writing moment, plot twist and shit.
---
I just hope i will find a nice guild with open individuals
---
No. I'd rather let a few people abuse 2x spawns than sit in a ~16,500 server queue.
---
Depends what you mean by world pvp.
---
The graph you linked shows almost no growth during Wotlk? Especially in contrast to 2M+ slope of vanilla and tbc.
---
Agreed on cata though!
---
Bump got skipped
---
Frankenstein chronicles, Sean Bean dies but then is resurrected and remains lead actor. They killed him and found a way to keep him... simply genius.
---
Layering should honestly just be disabled in 50+ zones where all the exploitable stuff is.
---
Well you said it yourself. There is an entire epic leather crafted set as well. Not only does that have high armor and stam. It also has dodge. Instead you compared the epic plate crafted gear to some shitty no stam leather gear nobody use? Why?
---
On top of that you have a ton of high stam, high armor, fire res leather from various dungeons you can use of which most is better than the warrior gear for one simple reason. Druids mitigation comes almost exlusively from Stam and Armor which are found in plenty on the FR gear. Warriors need defense and avoidance stats as well, which are not found on the FR gear.
---
And Core Leather deep into MC? Dont be an idiot. Corehounds patrol the entire dungeon and you dont even need that many. A single trash farm run in MC yield enough leather to fully gear a Druid tank. And how is that any different from the plate gear needing Fiery/Lava Cores which also drop in the raid?
---
Besides that gear requires rep from Thorium Brotherhood which likely wont even be in the game until later phases. Prebis fire res gear is simply much better than the plate gear. Thats a fact.
---
Check out the fire res tab on this sheet for a list of all leather FR gear:
---
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HPdLlYapExIY7QuzTtBN3neO8YDaQBslUKKR1giaEQE/pubhtml#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HPdLlYapExIY7QuzTtBN3neO8YDaQBslUKKR1giaEQE/pubhtml#)
---
And yes, you cannot mitigate fire damage with armor, but the mobs that deal fire damage also deal physical damage on their swings. Including Ragnaros. It seems really odd to me why you would so conveniently ignore all these items available for Druids? Just makes you seem a bit dishonest you know.
---
1vX pvp out in the world random encounters
---
&gt; I loved seasons 1-7 but I think I agree, the Warcraft movie was better than season 8.
---
You had no problems with season 7? That's where your point of it being ''nonsense'' falls apart. Season 7 was just as flawed, if not even more flawed when compared to season 8. 
---
Obviously I see the faults with season 8 too, the writing was rushed, the dialogue was clunky, some character decisions felt out of place because of the rushed pace. 
---
But it's not even nearly as bad as the Warcraft movie which had odd visuals, mediocre acting, disjointed plot etc. GoT season 8 failed in the writing department but succeeded in every other, the visuals were better than ever, the acting was fantastic, the music amazing, the set design etc was all top notch. 
---
Even the main events that happened were great (most of them came straight from GRRM himself) but just the way we got to them was very rushed and poorly written and made them feel jarring as a result.
---
So exactly what he said.
---
Some streamers literally just "react" to other people's content and just leech off of it. I mean this doesn't take much effort but it's better than that.
---
That was my thought, it was only supposed to be the starting zones, within a week the pack is going to be super spread out with the front runners are going to be experiencing ghost towns.
---
I am wondering about the In Dreams questline. I dont think that was in at release, and the melee neck is looking really nice for the rogue I'm going to play.
---
sry I couldn't understand shit you were saying but good luck ofc, vanilla is lyfe
---
LIVE TO WIN!
---
Wow you had a 15" MONITOR!? I had 11".... was a druid healer.... it sucked.
---
Gnome is a bit better for pvp with a more useful active. For PvE it's a very very small difference, neither int or spirit are that important for raiding dps.
---
If you feel like writing a lot of lines you could use https://www.vanilla-questing.me/  as well    
---
structure of the route is:    
---
      {
---
         "zone": "elwynn",
---
         "experience": 5.36,
---
         "waypoints": [
---
            {
---
               "coords": { "x": 49, "y": 42 },
---
               "align": "top",
---
               "header": "marshal mcbride",
---
               "starts": ["report to goldshire"],
---
               "type": "quest"
---
            },
---
Here you would have Teldrassil as zone   
---
The experience line is a bit complicated   
---
Coords are the place of the dot you put on the map   
---
align is how you align the number in the sequence of stuff to do      
---
header is the description of what you are going to say   
---
starts/ends/objectives to color code instruction regarding quest    
---
special for instruction 
---
well I would let you learn about it better if you were interested
---
I thought clothies will be an easy Target...
---
I'm very confused. I was part of a server first KT kill and 100% did not have that amount of consumables, and there's no way other people in the raid were doing that either. Are you sure they were balancing based on that? I have no idea what patch we got the kill in, but I'd have to think it was earlier than later.
---
It was an AFK/fishing fest that no one played, which is why it changed.
---
Okay, that's funny.
---
we can.  there is plenty of alpha coverage on youtube and if you dig a bit deeper you can even find the files to set up your own alpha server and run around in old orgrimmar  and iron forge (although it will be empty, no npcs.  but all the building will be there.  UC is also a lot larger in alpha
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOTtEpXf4b0
---
I don't think the pack will be spread enough after a week and the servers are going to be abnormaly large because blizzard wants to account for tourists, so I don't think removing layering this early is a good idea.
---
This is your chance to start fresh with everyone else. Do not worry about falling behind. The average player is not going to speed level to 60, even at a casual pace, you will still have many player encounters throughout the world.
---
The leveling experience is going to be relatively the same, in the sense that, quests etc will not change. But some advice i would give is try to explore experiences past the level 60 cap. Find a guild and get into some raiding. Molten Core, and Blackwing Lair are two raids with great gear that are definitely achievable by a casual player.
---
I personally enjoyed the endgame content a lot more than leveling.
---
Hi, /u/funseeker909
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bzwjf7/do_i_need_to_focus_on_set_build_guides_so_much/). 
---
You will, just prove you are a knowledgeable tank and you'll find a guild. Not that you know what the strats and such are but just the fact that you know how to tank. If you prove that a guild will show you the ropes. And fuck any guild that isn't willing to bring a feral now adays through the last 3-5 years of private servers there has been plenty of testing and proven that Feral tanks are wonderful additions to the raid team.
---
Hunters don’t scale well into the late game. Mages do. At 60 they have all the tools they need to get to you, neutralize you, and play in your dead zone to were you can’t do much to fight them. Especially cause you’ll be running MM for raids. 
---
Shadowpriests and Warlocks are also very difficult.
---
84 spell damage 2% crit is not better than 106 spell damage 1% crit/90 spell damage 1% crit 1% hit, no.
---
plz delete this, lol, the less that know the better
---
You're right. Maybe 1-2% ever stepped foot in Naxx then.
---
If you don't play often you will be maxing out on rested bonus exp so it won't take 7.5 months.
---
What could also be cool is if you had a page where players could post builds where they could upvote them and have discussions focused around specific builds.
---
Regardless, this is excellent. Thanks for doing this.
---
Had to max them at 58 because 60s would wreck the whole BG in a minutes?
---
I hope the testers show them how crappy the 1.12 version is.
---
Ya I like the impressive display of pure talent shown in this video. I'd take more notes but my pad is full.
---
Doing the Lord's work.
---
Hunters are the masters of world pvp. You’re going to have the fastest leveling experience, great farming potential, you’re necessary in raids for certain skills and it’s a solid class all around. 
---
Now your gear won’t scale as well late game but your class has a high skill ceiling and unless you’re in that top 1% of player I doubt you’ll notice the difference. 
---
Play the class you think you’ll enjoy the most. Hunters certainly are a lot of fun.
---
It takes a lot longer to gear up in classic raids. You get 4 drops per boss and you have 40 people. And you could get warlock gear 10 weeks in a row.
---
I mean, it's up to you and what size fits your space/view better, but I prefer a 27" monitor to anything else. 24" is fine as well. 21" would be WAY too small for me.
---
It was awesome and lots of fun. Unfortunately they're giving us the honor grind version instead.
---
The only two films I know of where he doesn’t die at all are National Treasure and Troy.
---
I feel like the rose colored glasses are strong on AV. Most of the time people were AFK in a cave or fishing. It changed for a reason, and was better for it.
---
Wow a perfect score. I’m gonna have to invest in sisters
---
A single crit against another player can change the outcome drastically. The game is much slower so youre able to see each and every hit you do.
---
There was a beautiful day last week some time where Bobby B was showing up in a few other subs, this was one of them.
---
i think there's room to avoid both.
---
I played a Warlock in classic and i absolutely loved it. Theres lots of skills for all classes but you will learn as you go dont let it put you off :)
---
Thanks. Played one before in other expansions and in classic to 40sth. Just can’t remember details. I’m looking forward to it!
---
Firstly i wanted to play an enhancement shaman but from all ive read in this subreddit, i think i will abandon it. What do you think?
---
They wouldn't bother with content phases if that were the case.
---
I recently leveled a hunter 1-20 on a pserver and my god are levels 5-10 awful.
---
After that it's awesome, but not having a pet and doing garbo melee dps really sucks after your first 3-4 shots before the mob closes to melee. 
---
Godspeed.
---
I find your reasons confusing. They know these "barriers". 
---
They will have the hunters (the exact needed amount), which happen to be the fastest levelling class.
---
They will have the reputation farm team assigned, no more no less than what is exactly required, which happen to be one of the fastest levelling classes.
---
They will have entire teams focused on ensuring the exact needed tanks are 60 and geared. This is easily achievable by day 6 and honestly an absolute joke versus the retail efforts they currently endure for BFA.
---
These are some of the best retail players in the world, all 40+ of which will have the entirety of the week off to rush to 60, with a surplus of support roles that will specifically be farming alchemy, enchants, blacksmithing, leather working so they have every single imaginable bis item (that aren't even really required)... Before day 6
---
Ahh yes the easy “Create iPhone app” step
---
Never will understand not wanting Shaman and Paly for both factions. Arbitrarily limiting each faction to not have access to one of those classes was so dumb. A mistake Blizzard clearly recognized and fixed in TBC.
---
Like what's one good reason outside of "bEcAuSe ClAsSiC" that it was a net positive to have those classes faction specific?
---
NO CHANGES!
---
If you put in the effort to learn you'll be rewarded.
---
&gt; Also remember, there is no LFG tool to queue up as healer or DPS. Groups are made from folk asking for others to run instances.
---
Unless you download an addon. Then you can LFG from your alt in any zone all day long.
---
What I've heard from watching streams is that Alliance basically boycotted WSG because they kept losing...
---
I wanna shout out Foxhole mmo  for anyone excited by his description.
---
One side is also much more popular with streamers/players who play a lot too (which ironically seems to be a bias inherited from retail?). I'm Alliance on the beta PvP realm and there's honestly not that many level 40s logged in a lot of the time.
---
Doing god's work.  This is where it gets real though, right?  Where you have to go into RFK over and over or sit around Redridge and camp that one level 20 for weeks on end.
---
Good to know. I should mention, I actually enjoy socializing in game and finding groups - I mostly just dont always have friends IRL i play with.
---
Turn it into a sweat box with space heaters. Rip your electric bill.
---
I really liked the raid content, and the lore it was connected to. Highlighting really prominent characters/stories from WC3 (Kael'thas, Illidan, Lady Vashj, the whole Mt. Hyjal experience) made me feel like a part of the setting that I fell in love with. Plus, I just love Karazhan.
---
I'm debating between warrior or rogue. I need some pros and cons, like which one levels faster, which is less gear dependent or which one is better in pvp and/or pve. And better can mean everything, like more mechanical, more wanted in group, better in solo, better to (gold) farm with etc...
---
How is saying the Warcraft movie is better than a few GoT episodes idiotically hyperbolic?
---
Then Nearthas.
---
Thanks for all of your hard work! I love the podcast
---
Or maybe having level 60s would show them how fast and easy the 1.12 version is and they're tired of hearing about it.
---
Yea but rage &gt; threat, I mean, rage enables you to use an ability that does few times more threat than an autoattack (/HS/Maul), *and* autoattack (/HS/Maul) will come anyway, parry or not, just some ms later than if parry.
---
So I still think parry is quite meh for threat. Although in theory, to parry the first attack (when you should have enough rage from other sources anyway) is marginally better than to get hit.
---
Most of those chill raid group guilds broke up before making it through BWL or at best they made it to huhuran in AQ and fell apart because its around that point that you can't just have 15-20 people carry the other 20-25 anymore.
---
Dwarf priest isn't as valuable as everybody says. Back in Vanilla nobody had much of a clue what they were doing at character creation, meaning people would roll nelf or human priests because they were the most popular races.
---
Now everybody knows how good dwarf is they will be massively overpopulated. Nobody is going to get a guild invite just for being a dwarf because every Alliance guild will already have at least three dwarf priests. Maybe it's a tiny bit more effective to have a fourth dwarf over a nelf, but diminishing returns will set in.
---
I'm not familiar with the classic mechanics, but could a nelf pop an invisibility potion, drop combat and shadow eld to rest after a wipe?
---
Is that with or without the addon that tells you exactly which quests to do?
---
Forgot mount training being at 40 and 60 instead of 20 and 40 and the fact that base run speed is i think 15% slower than current.
---
I don't doubt that at all.   However, you can only get the 1-60 time so low.   If you don't have the route and all the little things that are involved in making said route fast down to utter rote memory, you won't make those same low /played times.  No one has said it is hard.  It is, however, time consuming and that time can only be reduced so far...which you have to know and understand how to do.
---
Right,  but lokamir is a comparatively small upgrade over Benediction.  Any guild that gives it to a healing priest over other classes is not using their resources most efficiently.
---
I'm about 1/2 way through 24 right now and I can only kill Bellygrub for xp. I am going to try to brave RFK at 25.
---
&gt; BfA is a WoW CLONE, and Classic is WoW
---
Lol, don't think I've ever seen this said. Funny way of putting it...
---
Yeah but he's a ***quip boy*** so he is wrong
---
This was the result for a lot of Friends and Family invitees from blizzard.  
---
Apparently the initial list they used for the accounts to flag was from a little while ago, so people who had recently updated their list of friends and family didn't get the right people in.  
---
Employees complained, so they sent an internal memo saying "Okay, this is your last chance. update by today and we're running the flags again"  Then they did.  If you were on the initial list and then your employee didn't change their list/ignored the memo, you got a double dip.
---
He’s still going lol!
---
I'd knock shard farming off the list of cons. It's really not an issue and once you get a felcloth bag you've got plenty of space. 
---
They also have a build that works PvP/PvE (maybe not optimal, but it's pretty good).
---
Lee
---
Way
---
In addition, the separation is to prevent a race condition on the attack logic.
---
The devs have talked about this serveral times, and I think Kevin Jordan did on the 'countdown to classic hunter' episode.
---
God bless.
---
Ok? It still grew, and peaked. That was my point.
---
Growth &gt; no growth?
---
2k is 1080p, though
---
E: DCI 2k is 2048x1080.  DCI 4k is 4096x2160.  UHD is 3840x2160, which is close enough to just call it 4k.  FHD is 1920x1080, which is close enough to just call it 2k.  1440p is 2560x1440, 2.5k at best.
---
But having a way to track boss kills means you can go LINK ACHI GEARSCORE!
---
Because if the game tracks bosskills you can make an addon that turns them into achievements, sort of.
---
&gt;You had no problems with season 7? That's where your point of it being ''nonsense'' falls apart. Season 7 was just as flawed, if not even more flawed when compared to season 8.
---
I didn't say I saw no problems with season 7, it certainly wasn't quite as good as the previous seasons but still pretty solid and better than the Warcraft movie.
---
Where season 7 was a dip in quality, 8 was a complete nosedive. While the visuals and acting were indeed as great as they ever were (for the most part, there were some serious flaws like the battle of Winterfell being basically impossible to see), the plot and inconsistencies and just how obvious it was that they were cutting corners and changing plans just to get it done faster was so bad that it's enough to drag it below the Warcraft movie for me. And I disagree about the "odd visuals" of the Warcraft movie, I thought they were pretty solid and had a very Warcraft feel to them.
---
You bless the rains down in thunder bluff?
---
Completely agree with this. At it's best, there would be a "main front" of almost trench warfare, where each side is just fighting for inches; then strike teams would be sneaking around behind the lines to stealth cap a graveyard to tip the balance; dedicated defense groups protecting objectives. It felt like the epic, long, constant fights at Tarren Mill and Soutshore - except you could win! You may not see it, you may not be there for it, but it was possible! And when you made that breakthrough - whether it was bubbling the warlock so he could fearbomb so you could take the bridge, or stunlocking the graveyard guard so your buddy could cap it, or just outdueling some rando dude on the open field, it felt awesome.
---
Same here. I hope the testers, being comprised of many experienced players, can still zerg down the BG and show Blizz just how bad it is.
---
No, it's a simple fact of not having the routes and all the necessary practiced and memorized.   Someone that's been doing it for 15 years and has the world record routes memorized AND knows all the little details that actually make those routes work in the advertised time will level faster than someone that has not.
---
You can be the best racecar driver in the world, but if you've never driven a certain road course before, you're not going to make world record times on it.  Yes you'll be better than average, but it takes skill, knowledge, and practice....which requires repetition.
---
The level 30 duel tournament was between people that had already leveled to 30 and gathered gear.  It showcased mechanical skill and class knowledge.  Speed leveling doesn't require a huge amount of mechanical skill, so Method's main advantage is gone.  Speed leveling DOES require a huge amount of knowledge on quest pathing and what to do going quest to quest as you're doing that path.  THis is something others have 15 years of practice with and Method has 2 months to learn as well as they have.

I’m in the same boat. Recently resubbed at the chance play the classic beta but I didn’t get in. Letting my sub fall off until classic because retail feels like a dead world that possess no life. No characters. No people. Leveling feels pointless. I’m excited for classic based solely on the fact that the classes aren’t one man armies and clearing content in a timely manner requires teamwork
---
Oops, I mean need. Need need need, then log with ninja speed!

CAPS LOCK IS TO BE TAKEN LITERALLY AND IS NOT AN OVER EXAGGERATION OF A SARCASTIC POINT.
---
as a lvl 60 of any class  you could just ride in on a lvl 60 mount, the guards are too slow to catch you and you usually could hide in some building before players realized what happened.  (unless it was prime time)
---
I remember having to kick a hunter from a 5-man who kept doing melee. We told him not to since it does no damage but he said he can play however he wants... so we said good luck playing by yourself.
---
But it wasn't changed to facilitate honor gains? AV was changed because it wasn't fun. There was no way to break a turtle thanks to the extremely strong NPCs guarding the bottlenecks. You had to sit and wait for the other team to give up and leave. There was no strategy or gameplay involved.
---
You might think long games are fun or cool if you see it happen once or twice. But not if you actually PvP. They were awful for the people who actually played battlegrounds.
---
Crit % is amazing, even if it’s only 1%.. although I don’t know how important crit is as a healer, my experience is mostly caster dps and melee dps.
---
I know that any +healing even it it’s only +15, will be better than just int on an item.. maybe a skilled healer will respond.
---
Good luck!

Hello, i have now implemented this function. NPCs and Drops are new tabs in raid/dungeon zones.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?zone=2159#drop](https://classicdb.ch/?zone=2159#drop)
---
Hope you get any help from it!
---
Exactly. Once people are working on gaining rank the AV matches will all be short and boring because of the version they chose to implement.
---
11”?! Were you playing on the front of a microwave?!
---
Because GoT wasn't only good because of its writing, and while it lost that (very important) aspect in the last two seasons, it still kept everything else such as acting, visuals, music etc. The Warcraft movie wasn't particularly good at anything really, it was mediocre at best in all aspects. So I find it ridiculous when people express their disappointment at GoT being underwhelming in terms of writing by comparing it to a movie that didn't impress in any way really.
---
It's not nearly as bad as anyone says. In vanilla I'd just fill up 2-3 bags of shards in a dungeon and then throw them in my bank and farming multiple mobs at once is easy at 60. You can fill up a bag in 5-10 minutes.
---
Never seen this before. Amazing.
---
biggest difference:
---
on pservers , most people have multiple accounts, to make it easy to trade stuff with your own bank alt.   (or teleport yourself with a mage alt etc)    
---
on classic, with monlthy fees, most people will stick to one account.
---
Let's be honest, the last 3 seasons of got were a huge let down
---
The queue time depends on the number of players. Fewer alliance players on a server will lead to faster alliance queues.
---
Awesome! Your plan sounds even better, I can’t be absent for that long. :D Too bad I think I’ll be going horde but let’s stay in touch! I’ll hit you up with DM later

That’s really for topping meters in farm content, it’s really moot if there are any full wipes on progression (teaching people vael and whelps in bwl anyone?) Naxx is typically where is view try hard consumables and buffs as almost necessary on progression.
---
&gt; 106 spell damage 1% crit/90 spell damage 1% crit 1% hit
---
but you aren't getting 106 spell damage 1% crit/90 spell damage 1% crit 1% hit from Rank 14 either, so moot point.
---
Not going to happen with this version of AV on a live server, unfortunately.
---
The economy will hardly be ruined.
---
Spoilers, damn it.

Np, as the very short warning in the beginning said, I might sound funny. Tho I’ll be working on it for coming videos!

So the thing about an enhancement shaman is you have to have a guild willing to sacrifice dps for you. We are validating one in our guild based souly on the fact that he dude we have doing it for us is one of the Boys. And the fact that he will be 100% totem twisting for our tanks and swinging nightfall for the caster dps. But his  play is going to be super boring. Because the rotation will be Totem, totem wait 9 seconds totem, totem wait 9. Rinse and repeat. He will be giving Hand of Rag for doing it for us but it wont be a very fun raiding experience for him. I would say if you made an alt as an enhancement shaman and healed in some raids to get some gear you would be fine or just did AV when it comes out and pvp with the AV mace and go for R13/14 you can have plenty of gear to fucking annihilate people in world pvp. But as a serious main probably not the best of options.

---
It's actually extra bizarre now, because yesterday I had the day off and went down a 10 hour rabbit hole of vanilla private server tanking videos (Skarm Tank is his YT channel), and this is a guy who raids in multiple Naxx clearing guilds as both a prot warrior and a feral druid tank, and the amount of times he *isn't* fully world buffed is much higher than the number of times he is, *and* he's on a damn feral druid, which a lot of people say aren't viable tanks in vanilla.
---
Basically everyone who says something declarative like "every raid is gonna have to be full world buffed, even shitters" is just dead fucking wrong, and are applying their personal mindset to the playerbase as a whole.
---
I totally remember doing this back in the day haha. It helped to cut down on time from jumping off the zeppelin and summoning your mount.
---
Oh i see
---
When spawn timers on black lotus go from 5-10mins potentially back to their 12hr release state, I don't think relative value must necessarily hold. I see where you're going with this logic, but I don't think it is complete.
---
I’m sorry
---
We have that. It's called sharding.
---
Season 7 was the nosedive. It had bad writing, rushed pacing and what's more - the main plotpoints didn't even make sense. The characters spend half a season on planning and executing a suicide mission (or it should've been at least) that didn't even impact the story in any real way in the end.
---
Season 8 is on the same level in terms of writing and pacing but at least the main plotpoints are interesting and have an impact. The way we got to them was pretty awful but the events themselves were impactful and emotional.
---
Warcraft movie did well with some visuals on their own, like the Orcs, but it completely failed when mixing them together with humans and any more action-oriented scene ended up looking pretty terrible. Plus the story and the writing certainly wasn't any better than GoT season 7&amp;8. GoT just used to be so much better than that so it dropping to this sort of lame movie tier feels more disappointing.
---
I think it’s 6%
---
maybe you should leave this sub
---
Hunters will drop off more, if you're interested in continuing the PvE raid experience mage will do more and scale better over time. 
---
Hunters are great as a fresh 60, barring great gear / exceptional play they won't ever be near the top of the dps meters. 
---
Mage will be saturated, and they do compete for gear, but they're a staple in raids for a reason :)
---
&gt;Just how good is a 2% increase to something?
---
It might not be "good", but if it's the best item for this slot *in the whole game*, you begin to care :)
---
On the other hand, every % of hit brings you closer to hitcap, i.e. the point when you never miss - and it sucks to miss.
---
"I rather have a worse economy than not playing at all."
---
Tauren look cooler so Horde.
---
Haha I’m just joking man.
---
Yea, everything sounds like an argument online.  I don't want to argue whether TBC or Vanilla was better, they've both got upsides and what people like is up to them.
---
&gt; Except that "irrelevant" gear was needed to progress in raids.
---
Progression is just that, progression.  You use gear to progress through a raid and when you've got everything you want from a raid, the gear you used to progress through it is irrelevant.  It's just a proxy leveling system, with some awkwardness because vanilla itemization left a lot of holes.
---
&gt; Keeping up with Engineering...
---
The key issue was gold.  If you had a lot of gold from a main character what you did with professions on alts could be very helpful, especially for gear dependent classes.  If you were poor or leveling your first character though, you were always better off picking gathering professions and saving for a mount at 40.
---
&gt; Where my gripes stem from is that all of the end game recipes and crafts in Vanilla were - of course - made irrelevant.
---
This would have been true had they just kept releasing level 60 content.  "End game" is a shifting goalpost, every new raid tier brought a new end and frequently new recipes.  You might use old recipes for progression gear but once you had progressed... well I guess if they were BoE you could sell them, but at some point the BoEs people want change too, or it becomes too much of a hassle to farm the mats you need to craft them.
---
&gt; Again, this is just an issue of TBC just replacing one end game suite of content with another instead of adding on to it.
---
I think I see what you mean.  I consider the moving goalpost that new raids create as making earlier raids irrelevant, you think needing to progress through older raids keeps them relevant.  That only works until raids are on farm.  People with raiding guilds were skipping raid tiers once they met resist thresholds because their guilds didn't need full raid groups to finish the raids, especially once they were progressing through later raids.  Come to think of it I think master looters could give loot to dead players so even meeting the resist tiers isn't always important if you're being carried.
---
&gt; Lots of attunement quests start in the 50s.
---
Yea you could start some important questlines before 60, but it didn't matter if you waited until 60 and the most important part of those questlines is what they let you do at 60.
---
&gt; (Carrot on a Stick hype)
---
"Rare exceptions."  That said I don't think CoaS was BiS for any raid, despite its general utility.  AQ is the only raid I can think of that even let you mount up.  What was TBC's equivalent to CoaS?
---
&gt; High level zones
---
Yea, high level zones.  Like someone else said you weren't farming Barrens for raid mats, you were farming endgame mats in the endgame zones.
---
&gt; TBC made all that kept zones relevant for 60s in vanilla irrelevant.
---
Undoubtedly.  My point is that higher level zones always rendered lower level zones irrelevant.  Vanilla zones did it to lower level vanilla zones, then TBC came and did it to the previously relevant vanilla zones.  That pattern has been going since the beginning.  To say "TBC killed Vanilla" is to ignore that end-game Vanilla had already killed pre-endgame Vanilla.
---
"Titan" series of addons (Titan Panel) are now generally known as "LibDataBroker", "LDB" or "Broker" addons.
---
Back then it was "Titan Panel" and it's plugins that you could enable/disable on a whim.
---
Now you can choose a display addon (Bazooka, Chocolate Bar etc.) and whatever plugins you want/need: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/search?search=Broker (obviously these are made for Live but most of them should work for Classic, too, as nothing much has changed in recent years in regards of the functionality of these addons).
---
These days a lot more addons provide displays or launchers trough LDB.

The pserver brand I have been playing on for the past years banned all chinese VPNs, and we never had any problems with foreign languages. This server is EU based and originally had many players from countries that traditionally are not the best in english, but it was fine. (being the smaller of the two also helped, as all the attention whores and gold farmers naturally drift towards the largest server, for obvious reasons)
---
&gt;* check for people to rez around elite ogres or near yeti cave
---
This is so wholesome
---
I was mainly pointing out, that it was easier to get resistance gear as a warrior. Dark iron is pretty plentiful to get, and crafting that gear will be done quickly and prioritized for them.
---
Core leather is better put into other parts. The core leather isn't the stopping block what about all the fiery cores/lava cores? They are trash drops, but you can farm dark iron in BRD, or in the open world, it's EVERYWHERE. People end up vendoring it as it is so common, and usually gets in the way of mithril nodes.
---
As for the dodge fire resist piece, the helm - Molten Helm is the only piece for druid with fire resist and defensive stats. And it's standard armor, not increased on any of the leather pieces, not that high.
---
The faction was put in during 1.6, with 1.7 adding boots. (BWL was 1.6 for the record so it's up in the air if it will be locked behind BWL unlock) Same rep for the druid pieces.
---
We're also leaving out cooldowns, shield wall and last stand for example, can save when there's a spike of damage.
---
Just only cast affliction spells. 4Head

It'll probably be the level 58 blue pvp set and associated accessories.

Being able to browse reddit from a SCIF is dope. But /r/wow is blocked. Not /r/classicwow. Boggles the mind.
---
To me, WoW never felt more like a real place than during those long AVs.
---
My first thoughts are Shaman. No matter what my friends play, I can heal or DPS &amp; even tank (I secretly wanna tank, sounds challenging).
---
My second option is Druid Tank, because it sounds like not many people are gonna do that.
---
Plot Twist: My friend wants to play a Warlock, &amp; forgot that Trolls are not capable of being that class, which means he may roll Undead. If that happens, my plans are kind of out the window. Sure, I can wait until \~15 to really start playing together, but aesthetics you know?
---
So if he goes undead, I may drop a Smite Priest. Healing is fun.
---
If we really need a tank, I may roll undead female warrior for the front flips, but warrior is overplayed.
---
Plot Twist: Somebody posted a pic of their Tauren Hunter using that polar bear from Dun Morogh. I've never played hunter passed 15, so that sounds intriguing. It also sounds like a blast to pick a pet from across the world.
---
But the *opensource opportunities!*
---
Yeah I think it would only make sense to move them earlier since they’re going off 1.12 and some classes had theirs long before others as they did passes over each class patch by patch.
---
In that case it would probably be even more expensive considering the populations of the biggest pservers.
---
There are going to be some people who will be cruising for the endgame quickly, while the majority of people, aren't going to be even in their 20's first week. (Due to RL obligations).
---
They shouldn't NEED sharing for the 50+ zones for a long time, if ever by the time people start hitting those.
---
There was no attack. 20IQ orc was trying to clean his ear wax and did an oopsie.
---
Aren't they having a hard time filling ab ques? AV is gonna look like a ghost town after an hour once people get bored and leave.
---
There's so many fun things they could do in terms of testing. Have premade characters for people to play for ab, wsg, av, no idea why the beta is so limited to the public still.
---
Humans have great racials.  Sword/Mace +skill is great.  And Diplomacy (10% more rep gain) is a also pretty good.  The 1% dodge as NE isn't that great for warriors.  Dodges don't generate rage.  But Shadowmeld is awesome, especially for PvP.  I played a NE warrior in vanilla and loved it.  Although being older now its hard for me to want to do that again because aside from shadowmeld NE racials aren't very good.

Alright.  I am not a streamer, nor do I have Beta access.  I'm okay with that.  However, this is a request to those who do have Beta access, if you're a streamer or just a regular player.
---
Please, please test AV as if it were live.  Please test it as if this were a retail environment.  If you're a streamer, please ask your followers to do the same.
---
The crux of the matter is this: we know that right now, you're here to have fun, but this is about a core issue for Classic.  Right now, Classic is based on the 1.11 AV, where NPCs were stripped away, where much of what AV was removed.
---
*Can* you create a long AV game?  Yes, yes you can.  Is it the AV that follows in the spirit of Vanilla?  That, I ask you, I beg of anyone with beta access, to test.  Not for me to get what I want, but because right now, in *this* moment, streamers, you can showcase an issue that Blizz has not acknowledged.
---
That when 1.11 AV is in the game, the goal of the majority will be 'path of least resistance.'  Path of least resistance...
---
That's ending the game, in 1.11.  Getting your honor, getting your rep, and getting out.
---
Priot to 1.11, the goal of AV was AV itself.
---
To anyone who reads this: thank you.  If you disagree and want 1.11 AV, I respect your opinion.  I disagree with you, but all I am asking is to show 1.11 AV for how it will be played when it goes live.
---
Thank you.
---
I haven't watched the WC movie yet but I see it's on demand. 
---
Is it worth watching, or a waste of time? I heard it's bad.
---
Grave moss is probably the best thing to passively farm as you're leveling up Alliance side. It's especially fantastic if you're into cross-faction trading as most of the spawns are all in Duskwood.
---
Northern Dustwallow March is one of the best spots for leveling fishing as it's got nobody, a straight coastline, no red mobs, Firefin Snapper (Fire resist pot for MC) and Oily Blackmouth (Free Action pot) and a lot of school spawns once that feature comes online.
---
Also keep your Swiftthistle, get the Thistle Tea recipe from the SI-7 HQ as soon as possible and fill the AH with it. Just buy all the cheap Swiftthistle in the off hours. Do the same with Free Action Potions or Elixir of the Mongoose, buy Oily Blackmouth etc. whenever it's cheap and make as many pots as humanly possible.
---
Remember : you either farm the AH or the AH farms you. There's no almost no real money in arbitraging items unless you're doing the long con and saving resist gear for AQ. Though buying cheap cards and selling the complete trinkets when Darkmoon Fair is on is good business. **Never** farm something that can be bought off the AH or /2 at a discount. It's inefficient. Real gold is in moving large amounts of consumables consistently. WoW is just like real life : doing actual work outside is thankless and pays like shit. The only thing you should ever farm as a healer is Demonic Runes (make a group and go into Northern Aszhara, Felwood is just a pain in the dick). If you actually enjoy brainlessly farming to relax, make an INT build and go farm lashers in DM East when it's released.
---
Do that and you'll have more than enough gold for mounts and BoEs at 60.
---
How this went over mostly everyone's head is beyond me...
---
Never seen it but I guess thats a third
---
Yeah ive got a week off to play it and no plans to power level at all.
---
I meant for the other levels, but yes at 50+ there's no need for sharding leveling will be done more or less completely alone.
---
If you mean while levelling really the only good one is hunter. I'd say at lvl 60 the good ones are Mage and Warlock. Every other class should easily be beaten by any 2 players that are in any way close gear/skill wise to 1 player.
---
not in vanilla
---
An argument or drama usually rises up when the healer begins to roll on DPS gear at lvl60 (It is fairly acceptable on lower levels) or when players begin to roll on items they would barely profit from while other players would profit greatly (Like hunters rolling on Int/Stam gear).
---
Otherwise, there is absolutely no point in crying after losing a fair roll when it was absolutely expected that other player would roll and potentially profit greatly from the item as well.
---
&gt; Nobody would believe you if you said this game would be hyped and awaited but here we are.   
---
I think the fact how much following expansions made content obsolete or trivial is the main factor why the rerelease is so hyped. WoW is one of the all time greats in gaming history. Its THE game of its genre. But unlike all the other great games it wasnt really playable. Imagine ocarina of time had not been playable for 15 years. People would throw absurd amounts of cash at anyone who was able to bring it back. Thats what currently is happening with WoW.
---
The fact that we need this reminds me too much that I'm old...
---
Theres literally a stickied post on top of the main page for class selection help my dude
---
I mean it's probably still \*is\* too easy for them. They probably just have enough guys who want to do and think it's going to be fun that they're going for it anyway?
---
Also, "Method" will be joining classic means that the umbrella organization "Method" will have a raiding guild in classic. It doesn't mean that their BFA raid team is going to troop up and live to win their way through the game.
---
There'll probably be some crossover though.
---
&gt; when a crit would get you finished much more quickly
---
Yeah. but 0.5% crit or whatever is not very much (and you would get agi from the belt too). Or however much AP that strength translates too. It does not translate to one or two more auto attacks worth of killing speed. What could change things is the armor value.
---
They're only slightly wrong :')
---
Why wouldn't people take it seriously? The only way for Method to stay relevant is to move to classic.
---
This is incomplete, dreamfoil can be found in azshara, burning steppes, un'goro aswell, they are the best zones for it, also mountain silversage can be found in those zones + winterspring. Gromsblood can be found in ashenvale aswell with the demons in the south east. There are a few other things missing too 🙃
---
Yeah, I PvPed till r12 in vanilla(and multiglad in TBC), I remember mana being an issue, not that I find level 30 twink meta to be representative to 
---
I also remember that cleanse got nerfed to cost base mana, even rank 1.
---
So spamming r1 cleanse against a frost mage goes to the mages favour, especially if when you start counting in winters chill.
---
Sean Bean is usually more of a die in the last 30 minutes kind of typecast anyways.
---
Sounds like when people said the rose colored glasses are strong on vanilla wow, yet here everyone is.
---
The entire point of layering was it's done at a world level, not a zone level. If you do it at a zone level then it's just exactly the same as the original tech... ie sharding.
---
TBC is a good expansion, but I'm not that attached to it. I think it should still be released post classic, because realistically what else is there other than letting the classic realms die? 
---
The idea that Blizzard will develop new content for classic is strange. This is not some time machine that they're using to go back to 2004, undo all their mistakes, and bring about the MMORPG utopia. If classic is a huge success and they want to develop something new based on its philosophy, that should be a new retail expansion, or a new game entirely.
---
They're not bored with BfA in the sense that they're bored with the raids, they're bored in the sense that the rest of the game is boring and they're raid-logging.
---
That's extremely compatible with playing classic when you're not logging in to raid.
---
And on top of that, people seem to forget about the insanely vast amount of lore that the Warcraft universe contains. Trying to fit all of the little details and pieces of lore into a 2 hour time frame is pretty damn hard, if not impossible. 
---
We could complain about plot holes and other issues with the movie. Or we could take it for what it is, a decent high fantasy movie, and hope that if they decide to make another one they take some more time doing it.
---
Crit is incredibly important on a paladin healer, since they get refunded the spells cost if they crit. Otherwise, I think Mp5 is the way to go for all other heals. +Healing is good in the sense that you need less spell casts for more healing, at least that's how I would think of it. 
---
However, I do not play healers in vanilla haha.
---
I just want more 60 content after Naxx... Karazhan(lvl 60 version) emerald dream, hyjal, etc..
---
Absolutely, low levels, sharding will be in for quite some time. And it's fine they can leave it in for months for all we care, won't impact the key part of the economy which is endgame. (And the healthy community seeing people in the end)
---
My understanding is that 99% is the maximum and you can never achieve a full 100%.
---
60 vs 60 chance to hit spell is 95%, so for pvp you will need +4% for maximum hit.
---
I am unsure how spell resistance gear plays into this.
---
There won't be a issue after even a month or two with mob tagging, once the initial wave is out in the world the amount of concurrent players within a server in a starting zone probably won't be that high. Let alone in phase 2 , potentially 3-4 months down the line from launch.. 
---
I think the game will be successful too but I don't think this will be an issue later on
---
Moo
---
Check the official forums. It's on there.
---
☑️ Show Helm
---
What movie did he die in the first 15 minutes of?
---
Wish i could give more than one upvote for this
---
You could just open the client.
---
6 hours a week? I got around the same on all classes.
---
I think its safe to say, "even your gold will need gold"!
---
Fair enough, I must have gotten way luckier than I would have thought at the time, dodging that... that or my memory is way worse than I think
---
Very cool. It'd be perfect if there were top 3 choices for everything with weighted values (like in [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HPdLlYapExIY7QuzTtBN3neO8YDaQBslUKKR1giaEQE/pubhtml#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HPdLlYapExIY7QuzTtBN3neO8YDaQBslUKKR1giaEQE/pubhtml#)) but the source doesn't list those so I'm guessing that'd be very time consuming to implement. A few examples:
---
* For healers it's pretty unrealistic to obtain atal'ai gloves or archivist's cape with a +healing roll, which is the one that makes these items worth while
---
* Mish'undare usually goes to mages
---
* and Corehound belt is very expensive to make
---
I liked how the pserver handled it I played on:  instead of a few fixed spawn points in Winterspring, Burning Steppes, EPL and Silithus that could be dominated by hardcore campers that set timers, they made it spawn randomly in like 200 different spots ( still only in the same 4 zones).  This way every casual herb farmer also had a good chance to find a lotus on a random herb run.
---
Yes retard. You said immolate was fine because you would see if melee were around or any casters casting. I gave you an example on how that is not always the case. Moonfire isnt melee and doesnt need to be casted sherlock.
---
Shy Rotam was the only pet option at 60 imo, love that model!
---
You can like vanilla more than retail and still criticize it, it wasn't a perfect game by any means. There is a reason AV changed though, it had real issues.
---
Grinding the Defias mobs in the Northwest by the windmills is good Linen Cloth grinding
---
Asmongold is a bit special though.
---
All of Method aren't pulling that sort of thing, though if they could get Asmon to bankroll them they probably could.
---
i don't get it why the petition HAS to be only about the "melee leeway" issue?
---
pets have the same bugs as in retail that btw havent been fixed for almost a year, mob pathing is absolutely shit and the list goes on...
---
why is the melee more important than others?!
---
Sales have been mediocre last time I checked.
---
Wow, in 2019 this keyboard looks like a piece of shit.
---
&gt; Oh, that quip. How about hard data next time, quip boy?
---
You’re insufferable
---
Where?
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB97KygvPFk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB97KygvPFk)
---
on the first of that name, it has dropped to 25-30g gold
---
Soo Alliance?
---
That quote is literally what the guy said though. 1.12 with staggered release to emulate patch cycles.
---
I lived in a rural area so I had SLOW dialup for all of Vanilla and TBC, so raiding wasn't an option. For me, Vanilla was about the leveling experience and other activities you could enjoy solo or with smaller groups of people. TBC expanded that for me, and allowed me to continue my characters journey but still felt very close to the same world I had spent so much time in. 
---
In an ideal world Blizzard could take like a Vanilla Classic Snapshot at the time of TBC Classic launch, and the people who want to play the TBC Classic will continue to progress their character, but if they ever go back to Vanilla Classic server then their character will still be identical to the one that was taken in the snapshot. Like a software branch basically. 
---
With that being said, I have no expectations for a Classic TBC release and am perfectly happy and satisfied with Vanilla Classic.
---
Any class within a group
---
Yeah it's literally 1 quest. Onyxia is pretty much on the level with Kara though.
---
I'm a 30 something with a job and this sounds like a great fit for me. I played druid, hunter, and mage in vanilla. Got through a good bit of Naxx on the hunter and made pvp rank 10 on the mage. I'll be playing rogue for classic. Please send me more info when you start getting things together.
---
Of course they are.
---
You might want to take a community college math class to be able to appreciate numbers like this throughout your life.
---
On my server it was "Two Wenches One Chalice"
---
It's still too easy to be a traditional raid race. MC is basically a speed levelling race. And the following raid tiers will pretty much be a speed run competition. 
---
It will be really interesting to see how early people can squeeze out the first Rag kill though.
---
Any source? 😊
---
Okay but can't you just layer the below 50 zones and create a layer solely for people in 50+ zones that players cannot leave? 
---
I seriously doubt it being a tech issue...
---
I miss the days where people played what felt right and weren’t worried about the most contrived shit possible. This is an rpg. You are supposed to be the odd race/class combo that feels right to you.
---
Female Dwarf anything.
---
It's still called Titan panel for me? That's what I search for every time I come back.
---
Don't know bro. I gave you my estimate numbers.
---
I need around 30 hours for an exam. If there are 25 exams, just do 25x30 and you get the time needed.
---
what's up buddy
---
Take the high road!!!!! (Everybody proceeds into the low road meat grinder)
---
If you're planning on raiding, 8 hours per week leveling probably means you miss MC and have a hell of a time BWL gearing. 
---
Just sayin.
---
Elite bosses! that is one thing i missed.
---
I remember i was still fairly new when I join my first AV.
---
Saw this big ass Tree monster and was so amazed by it. Unfortunately, I never got to see it again. How do you summon that big guy ?
---
While I enjoy earning my rewards as well, I fully understand some people just don’t care for that.
---
If a game allows infinite ammo via collecting a bunch of stuff but you can also type in a code, I personally would enjoy it more after I collected all the shinies. Others will just punch in the code and start blasting away, and be fine with it.
---
For raiding late nights or early mornings (basically anything not “prime time”), you can generally find a guild that fits that schedule. But finding one for inconsistent times is a bit harder. And if a goal is to actually get loot, pugging in 40man content is gonna be a rough way to do so. When ZG and AQ20 come out, pugging and getting gear will be much easier.
---
Until then, it’s just easier for some to drop the coin for a carry. Sometimes it’s not even a carry, but just less of a hassle. I have a guildie on retail that is perfectly content paying other guildies for a +10 for his alts each week, even though he has the gear to do it and performs well. He just pays to not have to pug it. I think it’s weird, personally. But his logic is sound.
---
It's usually around 11 min respawns when I farm them on shitty pservers
---
I love camping night elf males
---
Good points bro. But I don't like things as a hobby. I either go full-time or no-time. :) 
---
1 hour/day of WoW for me is more like a punishment. So I'd rather not play at all!
---
Hardcore sampling bias there. People who talk in trade are disproportionately the people who care about classic, and are disproportionately going to leave for classic.
---
The idea that you watching trade chat means that bfa will be a ghost town is kind of silly.
---
&gt; At the end of TBC I had almost 800k gold, 2 guild banks with mats worth another 200k+.
---
No you didnt.
---
But this leads perfectly into him starring as the new burned lich in the sequel...
---
I still get goosebumps at the end of that cinematic. 
---
“Tell them only that the Lich King is dead and that Bolvar Fordragon died with him. NOW GO, LEAVE THIS PLACE AND NEVER RETURN.”

Hmm.
---
Literally the best selling total war game of all time and also broke records on steam for most played strategy game (beating out civ), where did you hear it was doing bad? It sold over a million copies in a week
---
Man I want to roll female tauren for the obnoxious /lol and /cry
---
Lol it wouldn't make that much difference. Warlocks/rogues would get a small dps increase. Overall raid dps would go up only a bit, probably something like 5-10%. If you were wiping on bosses before, unlimited debuffs isn't going to save you. You have to remember we already have the 16 best debuffs up, so any new debuffs would be things less powerful than gift of arthas or Curse of Reck which are already very weak debuffs.
---
More complete garbage "low effort" removals...
---
OP made a interesting post compared to what else is here.
---
Imagine being so fucking delusional that you think the biggest nerds in the entire game. The nerds that have been running 8-12 splitruns in the past, playing 18+ hour days are not enough for the classic challenge.
---
It's one thing that you people can't smell the sarcasm in this, it's another that you think Method wouldn't just crush classic instances in greens and blues ...
---
Sure. A company that has teams in World of Warcraft, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, Heroes of the Storm, Rocket League, FIFA, H1Z1, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege and the FGC. Many of them successfull, multiple sponsors like corsair, will be doomed if they dont go for classic world firsts.
---
As a casual ill be 60 by the end of week 2.
---
Back then, the guards hit like vanilla BB guards do - for way too much damage, so yes, it was made much easier, especially since every class and their mother has a heal now.
---
You don't need to be 60. They need lvl 60 tanks I guess, but other than that I think it's doable even before 60. On the other hand, if they need a tank to get to 60, then everyone else should be able to do that as well if you're a guild like Method.
---
Is that what retail has devolved into? Farming mounts?
---
I'm glad I quit playing a month after BFA launched.
---
Go look at Lionheart Helm in classic. 
---
2% crit, 2% hit.
---
That helm was best in slot through Naxx for Fury warriors based on those two stats.
---
Cause they're strong and I probably couldn't get away if they held me down and undressed me??
---
Whaaat you don't like the Dragonstalker set?? I always thought it looked amazing on fem Orcs/Nelfs! Admittedly the helmet kind of sucks but you can hide it so not like I count that piece.
---
One of my best memories of leveling in vanilla as a priest was feeling in demand. I'd often get whispers from strangers asking if I wanted to heal a dungeon and I ended up making friends and joining a good guild this way.
---
For classic I'm tempted to play either as a priest, druid or shaman/paladin but as silly as it sounds I'm a bit worried I'll miss out on the random dungeon invites.
---
Do the other healing classes get these while leveling or is priest the go to when you're trying to form a dungeon party and need a healer?
---
You get a feeling how many stats are on an item and if the amount drastically change then obviously it's a big upgrade. As for +healing and stuff, I think 1%crit is about +12-14healing on shamoon.
---
With 4 Hunters, stuff is going to die fast enough you could just have a Hunter tank. Whichever has most threat.
---
“WHATEVER YOU DO DON’T MAKE A STATUE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY SHOWING EVERYONE WHAT HAPPENED HERE TODAY”
---
Yeah, just inside the Bulwark. I'm pretty sure everyone who leveled through Tirisfal hit that shiny red death button at least once.
---
So the client is open... you see 4 servers down, and you see no information about the server being down?
---
lol?
---
Based on all of the comments, the answer is:
---
Yes, you cannot.
---
I was/still am more impressed with pets at lower levels. Alliance who run and get the Rake in Mulgore. Horde who run and get an Owl from teldrassil.
---
Cdew streams both retail arena and classic beta quite often by Alt-Tabbing between the two. I doubt Blizzard gave him a separate account just for Beta to do that. So yes, I believe you play play both Classic and Retail simultaneously unless something changes or I'm missing information.
---
Thanks! Glad you like it!
---
But all the more impossible to farm.
---
Human Rogue will be common, they are the best Rogue race for PvE racials, and human Mage will be common because the only other choice is gnome and most people dislike gnomes.
---
That is delusional
---
It was never that good tbh.
---
It's very very inconsistent and elemental is better for PvP and both are trash in PvE.
---
I had a level 49 enhancement twink that was a lot of fun.
---
Unexperienced player taking it seriously and reading a guide and dedicating 10 hours a day for leveling will beat an experienced private server player who plays in their free time following optimal routes.
---
Given that Method can show up with 40ish people of the first kind who're willing to do the 10h thing, yeah they'll win that race. Unless there's a pserver based guild full of people who can somehow play video games for a living, they won't be able to keep up with the sheer force of poopsockery.
---
If you're expecting perfect lore accuracy and super high quality CGI you'll be disappointed. If you want to see big warcraft 1 esq battles and see a bunch of WoW Easter eggs you'll enjoy it.
---
TIL YOU DIE!
---
But who cares?
---
Thank you!  r/asoiafcirclejerk and those like them are acting like this was sudden but it was really a slow and noticeable thing since the end of season 4...  Literally anyone complaining about the Sand Snakes was pointing to the very thing that started going awry with the show, among other problems.
---
Ford had a plant in Orgrimmar for the longest time.
---
I feel that if RP-PvP isn't at launch it will permanently gimp the servers if they were added them at a later date.
---
RP-PvP is a server of culture and that culture is decided by the guilds and communities within it. If those communities do not get the chance to appear at launch they will be forced to settle in other locations.
---
If they settle elsewhere then that community will not have the opportunity to grow and be forged except by later parties which can lead the community to growing as they did during the original release.
---
I honestly thought you were referring to a Warrior as someone else's pet while leveling. Guess that's a good way to look at it.
---
MOM! More hot pockets!
---
Unbind shadowform from my priest so I don’t accident click it during raid healing
---
Who has the story of the Enh shaman who pretended to be a heal spec in every guild raid through ZG but dropped his cover during a duel with the GM or something?
---
I've been playing a vanilla pserver, with instant 60s and free blues at start. So everyone is geared ok, at least. In BGs, I can absolutely blow someone up in the right situations, and if I and another DPS focus someone, they are going the fuck down.
---
Now I have to watch the original video and see if there was ANY indication it was a joke.
---
DOOMED! Good day sir!
---
Looks like that guy just killed you
---
Ok buddy
---
I think what you failed to realize is we are talking about hardcore mode... not the base game itself. Besides the base game is perfectly fine already... Classic that is.  Who cares about BFA.
---
But hardcore mode is supposed to be the "heroic" version of leveling if "normal" is the regular one everyone is gonna go through. = its supposed to be harder. So make it so you cant cheat.
---
We can completely skip that "pure =/= equal" segment of your post since its flawed in every way, just because i want to disable a few things doesnt mean i want it to be 100% equal. Thats retarded, why would you even suggest such a thing?
---
"Strange straw man, no one is suggesting we be able to transfer items across servers."
---
wtf?  D3 doesnt have servers (atleast in the way WoW does), so imagine if you leveled up a hc character and got a very good item on it but its not for your class... put it in the stash and next time you level another you can utilize that item = making HC easier for you. (BUT WAIT YOU CANT BECAUSE ITS DISABLED!)
---
Exactly the same thing will be done in WoW HC if trading is not removed.
---
Its not about friends... its about the gamemode.
---
"In Diablo II and Diablo III, a player may choose upon the character creation to make it a Hardcore (HC) character, the true test of the player's skills. This is an irreversible decision."
---
I fail to see how it can be counted as "true test of skills" if you can send items between your characters... if your FRIENDS sponsor you with better items for an easier game.
---
Im not sure about you but when i play something hardcore that tests my skill... I DONT WANT HELP, because it undermines my own "skill" at the game.
---
Its not my fault if you want to be carried in hard games. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
There is a time and place for coop-games with friends and social interaction... i doubt HC-mode is the one to have it unless you opt-in for group-HC. (which could be a challenge of its own, and ladders)
---
ps. Clearly blizzard has never listened to players like me... if they had we wouldnt be so hyped about getting classic since retail would still be good and true to its origin.
---
I tried this on my own client repack and the speed is set to 2.00 across all classes. The only way we can test this is asking a beta person to grab it.
---
Who changes their underwear anymore?
---
+1! I would love to play on an RP-PvP server. My guild hopes there is one at launch, otherwise we'll have to settle for PvP

It’s not a tech issue. It’s just against how Blizz is wanting to handle it currently.
---
You must mean AB with a full premade
---
Well yeah, that does seem like a good idea, but you'd think they'd just call it multiple-zone sharding if that was the case. Maybe layering is just a big marketing department buzzword to shut people up about BFA sharding.  
---
It does seem weird that they would layer lvl 50-60 zones during the first few weeks when there's only going to be 30 people on the server that high but by all accounts that's what they intend on doing. Even without any deliberate hopping it will allow for the small number of lvl 60 to get many more resources than they otherwise would.
---
Absolutely no way is a single zone good for ten levels beyond level 20. Unless you’re factoring quite a bit of straight grinding of course.
---
I have and will be someone who raids all content and I'd never worry having a human or nelf priest in the group.
---
I don't know why your rolling a priest.
---
Shadow damage can manage to top me.
---
I'm like a ninja with invisibility.

Then I'll T. E. L. E. P. O. R. T.

As soon as I start a group they start begging for water.

They should have just dropped a few gold and gone out and bought it.

Give them elemental pets and now they're over powered.

Overpowered? Shut up, Shammy, you know all about it.

That may be what we're led to deduce I suppose.  Any other famous blondes close to the Wrynn family?

---
With.
---
Yea I just fixed it.
---
Wait...did they?? I’ve been out of the game a long time.
---
LMAO couldn’t think of one so had to google an article about the .000001% of people that have died. You have more chance of dying in a plane crash.
---
Yeah! I'm on thier, Iceblast - Chupathingy
---
It's pretty clear I'm referring to their WoW team since, you know, we're on a WoW subreddit. 
---
&gt;will be doomed if they dont go for classic world firsts.
---
If Method's WoW team doesn't move to Classic they will be doomed. No one is going to care about retail come August 27th. WoW has already massively declined and is below 2 million subs, and Classic will be the death knell without extreme changes.
---
It would probably be bis, or least very good, for many expansions if they didn't change crit/hit to ratings.
---
I can't wait for multi day ac battles
---
Lord of the rings. 
---
If you scale it to the length of a normal movie.
---
This is exactly why I bought the dungeon guide.
---
This is next level diversion trying to convince other guilds they are not going for it.
---
That seems slow. 11.5 days played to hit 60?
---
too bad the world firsts were 15 years ago
---
ill be in Mid
---
Fortunately Scholo was mostly corridors so it probably ran fairly decent back in the day. :D
---
now 8 of those drop by the time you hit level 20..
---
Most popular races for priest on my severs back then were nelf and ud. I played both as well as a troll and a dwarf that I wanted to love but never finished leveling. 
---
Nelf was the most fun especially in pvp and just random bg’s. Star-shards were ok and s.meld is clutch.
---
I honestly can't tell if you're this dense or if you just don't want to admit you might be wrong about something.
---
Just because you have the rank 14 main hand doesn't mean you have  to use the off hand too. Instead, you can use an AV off hand like [Tome of the Ice Lord](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19310) (available for all schools, just using frost as an example), which you 110% have access to if you're rank 14, or [Jin'do's Bag of Whammies](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19891), should ZG be out and you're missing hit, which warlocks tend to do.
---
well yeah that's kinda the point
---
I don't know...Jaina and maybe Arthas' sister. Not sure how that would work out. Magic I guess.
---
OwO
---
Spoilers for what?
---
Why is this your neckbeard ass insult?  You're the one throwing a temper tantrum.
---
That one hurt to think about. Not getting off the boat or zep in time. UGH
---
YAAAAY ECONOMY!
---
Don't think you know what a fallacy is.
---
I'd say it's a different kind of progression. Attunements, leveling gear rather than getting XP, leveling professions and working the economy; those are all very different progression systems than leveling. Those progression systems still existed post TBC, but they were the TBC variant. Leveling in Vanilla still existed in TBC, but there's a massive chunk of the game that was effectively removed. I don't think getting to 60 and doing end game content made what you did previously irrelevant, because it was the progression you *needed* to get through to get there.  
---
TBC removes that need, and makes those zones and those dungeons and those recipes and that gear not just "out of date" like maybe your regular mount is to your epic mount, but a complete waste of time. If most of that content was still necessary for TBCs end game it would feel rather arbitrary but I think it's better than doing away with the content entirely.  
---
Really I think where we disagree most is I don't consider progressing through content to be making that content irrelevant, I think completely sidestepping that content makes it irrelevant, which all expansions do to the previous game, and what all new raid tiers do to the previous raid tiers ever since welfare epics were introduced. Content you progress through also isn't irrelevant in end game because of alts and helping other guildmates through. If a friend asked me at 60 to run them through a WC to do a lot of quests, I might help them out. If a friend asked me at 70 to help run them through BRD, I'd tell them to go to Outland.
---
Edit: After some thought I think the alt point is the best point I can make. If I have a character in AQ gear, I may not have any need to go back to MC (besides profession mats), but if I have another character they need to progress through MC still. If TBC is out, as a player, I'll never need to touch MC again. Not for alts, not for mats, not for anything.
---
I was interested until the transmog
---
TIL THE LIGHT DIES IN YOUR EYES!
---
The perplexity clip is not leeway, its his Euro-&gt;US ping combined with the movement interpolation WoW uses.
---
The rogue is closer to him than the server is displaying.  This was obvious any time you raced towards something like an AB flag, people behind you would 'slide' forward at the flag when their movement was changed to the higher priority loop upon dismounting.
---
The tauren one is just simple deadzone juking gone wrong because hes not used to the tauren hitbox.  The hamstring lights up as range is acquired, and it is not 'leeway' range.  What you are seeing there is the difference between White and Yellow targeting rules.  These have other effects too, aside from slightly different ranges, they also have different Line of Sight rules.  (Eg, you can attack people through walls with some attacks and not others).
---
I never played on private servers. I would have looked into it if I had known there were vanilla servers available. 
---
I heard it was against the TOS and you could get banned/sued for going on a private server, so I never pursued it.
---
Do it. Cow is udderly delightful.
---
oh god yes, start in the morning, couple of breaks for food and other essentials, go to bed late at night. Maybe I have rose tinted glasses but it was loads of fun.
---
Obviously Method are amazing at what the do, but lets not kid ourselves that a big part of their world 1st record is day raiding when other guilds cant do do jobs etc.
---
You could just hang outside in the sun all day tossing a ball around or you could sit down at your computer doing something that matters
---
I'm sure people will be flocking to watch Method's world first kill of whatever retail raid boss people don't give a fuck about.
---
Well, there was "confident we can get world firsts in every single phase in classic, should be pretty easy for us", and there was "none of the private server guilds should pose much of a threat".
---
Apart from the deadpan, sarcastic tone of voice of course.
---
So stoked for barrens chat again!
---
He has shown Tiffin Wrynn his Might of Menethil.
---
'Til the light dies in your eyes
---
I don't disagree.
---
I'd really enjoy a vanilla WoW with better balanced classes/specs, but if we had to choose one version only, it has to be vanilla, not vanilla 2.0.
---
Kara was originally planned to be in Vanilla. Think of how Silithus got overhauled for AQ.
---
what an odd thing to say
---
Why?I'm excited for Classic, but it's not my most anticipated game.
---
So I'm either a super fanboy or I can leave the sub?
---
My wife (then girlfriend) got me one for my birthday with the BC add-on board and I used untill it actually stopped working.
---
It wasn't terrible nor great but it worked and was very sentimental. 
---
She approved of me playing even though she didn't and it was a total suprise so she knew for what I was into, hence now wife.
---
Taco Bell, Pornhub, Sleep. You'll be good my guy!
---
&gt; Farming mounts?
---
Yeah cause that wasnt a thing in vanilla at all... 
---
But yeah, collecting stuff is a pretty big thing for a lot of WoW players, and has been for a long time. If you only quit in BfA you should know that already.
---
There are a lot of people who have different preferences from you. Retail WoW is not going to go away because of Classic
---
Hi wanted to ask. I played maplestory that is a grindy mmo that you killed mobs endlessly. What class would be best sooted for this in classic. I think they are some repetable farm instances for gold. 
---
Also in wotlk when i played healers were hard to kill solo. In classic i heard that its easy to burst someone. How important is gear in wpvp and bg's (if you get bursted anyway)?
---
exactly that.yes!
---
Interesting but this discussion really belongs over at r/classicwowplus
---
holy shit the amount of people complaining about not being in the beta on the blizz forums xD
---
who gives a shit about playing in the beta? :/ your character gets wiped anyways when the game gets released. ffs dude. play something else for 2 months you aren't gonna die.
---
I think it's actually a really cool idea personally. Now I'm going to go blasting through the game world and see what zones sound cool.
---
Ah, to be back in high school. Wrap up the day early because you took 7th hour study-hall. Run home. Play WoW until 2, 3, 4, 5AM. Then be back at school by 8AM psychically tired with none of the mental depression you get from sleep deprivation as an adult.
---
My favorite was the time I fought alongside some brave warriors for 6 hours, left for work, worked an 8 hour shift, came home and slept, woke up queued back in and... the same brave warriors were there.  Turns out most of us had, within +/- an hour or two done the same schedule.
---
How much money does Method make? And where is the money in being a top guild? Just curious.
---
...WHAT? Why? WHY?
---
Higher res textures, no.
---
Higher poly models, no.
---
Longer view distances, sort of. Longer than the vanilla default slider allowed but not longer than was available with console commands.
---
Shadows, yes.
---
Water, yes.
---
Variety and quality of anti aliasing solutions, yes.
---
Ambient occlusion, yes.
---
In all yes cases the OG versions are still available.
---
You know, I brought up the idea of the last week of the beta, Blizzard implementing an instant level 60, some gold, 60% mount speed, basic blue mount speed, no instances but be able to test out level 60s, how they'll play out at that level, what to expect of a class you want to play end game, test out BGs and just some other things for bugs etc etc. Obviously not a perfect system, but something similar to what they are doing with the AV weekend. I brought up this idea to a few people in some groups recently, and everybody thought it was a dumb idea. They thought it was terrible to give out instant 60s (in a beta where there will be no progress saved and everything will be erased, keep in mind).
---
I saw this and saw some people talking about it in guild and in world chat, and people loved the idea for a weekend to just test out Alterac Valley as an instance. So people are okay with an instant 58 with basic blue gear and some gold to test out AV... But aren't okay with instant 60s with some gold and basic blue gear to test out AV, along with some other things for bugs.
---
Is that Ron Jeremy?
---
Anyone got any Elixir of the Mongoose left to spare?
---
The only joke will be Method's twitch numbers when Classic comes out then. Do they really think anyone will care about them clearing the new retail raid? They are already losing to a beta for fucks sake. They definitely remind me of hardcore Everquest guilds right before WoW launched.
---
Live to win, 
---
take it all
---
I'm planning on doing ALL the quests and actually reading what the questgivers have to say. Probably gonna be doing a lot of dungeons and helping my friends as well. Will take time to defend Hillsbrad Foothills from the Alliance too. Grinding rep too although there will be no achievements to show.
---
Well I hit near Max ilvl on my main and M+ is only fun for me on my main. I don't grind arenas only got to 1400 so that's what I do. I do have 15 character's to get from 110 to 120 and 3 allied races to get to 120 but ;-; that comes later I guess
---
Lucky bastard!
---
You won't need to spec holy to heal dungeons :) 
---
You can swap to your "raid" spec around level 58 and grind dungeons to 60 while grabbing pre-raid BiS gear. 
---
Level Shadow, if you don't it's going to be **really** slow.
---
Briefly I was a class officer in my Vanilla guild, and this was the exact advice I gave a priest after an officer told him to spec holy.  We were a fairly relaxed guild pushing BWL around the release of AQ40, and I really didn't give a shit what spec my priests were.  We weren't cutting edge, and it didn't hinder us having one priest healing with the wrong spec.
---
As you can expect, I had a few differences of opinions with leadership of my guild.
---
It wasn’t a thing in vanilla though... That’d be a waste of gold and bag space.
---
Gotcha. Thanks a bunch
---
Fred is just gonna shoot a bunch of meth and stay up for days straight* to get world first, so even Fred shouldn’t care.
---
Edit: autocorrect
---
You deleted some of your responses but I felt the need to reply anyway: 
---
Lol woof.  You are the one throwing a temper tantrum.  You could provide a real source for the question or ust keep your mouth shut.  Your response was neither helpful nor truthful, and just plain condescending.
---
Correct, you go by wyvern
---
How do you know they’re below 2 million subs?  I thought Blizzard didn’t release subscription data anymore.
---
Cooking 170 (boar only recipes) I’m ded
---
It's okay for classic to be unfair d:
---
I'm sure a vanilla expert will jump in but I believe the zone was not finished for Vanilla since it's really just where Karazhan is located. Karazhan was a possible inclusion for Vanilla but was pushed off to The Burning Crusade
---
Tiffin Wrynn Apparently
---
But why? What was wrong with flying? I thought it was a great addition
---
Some of these comments say yes the others say no so I'm not sure what's right as of right now. Maybe we just don't know
---
the upgrade from bene is equivalent to upgrading from aurastone for shamans. its not a small upgrade.
---
Dude yeah there is a statue in the middle of old Dal that you can click on
---
The retail world first race will always pull big numbers on Twitch as long as it doesn't coincide with a classic raid release.
---
Classic has better graphics than vanilla wow.
---
I fucked up and started mixing with a Dutch way of saying thirth
---
Nice crack lighter
---
Yeah well you know Fred
---
Because accounts will cost money ,fresh servers will be less frequent, and exsisting realms are not in danger of being terminated 
---
People will start focusing on the long game instead of living for the moment
---
I can’t be the only one thinking this is a giant waste of time? How could this possibly be fun?
---
Its worth nothing that 'stutter stepping' was A) common and B) not related to 'melee leeway'.
---
This has to do with how movement updates are sent.  For example, if you stuterstep out of a zone border, you can TravelForm/MountUp earlier than someone who does not stutter step.
---
This is because your new position has not been replicated back from the server yet, it is being interpolated (Ie, you are not where you think you are, and people are not where they are on your screen).  
---
In order to trigger the faster updating movement, you have to have movement that changes (accelerates) in some direction more frequently than the regular position updates (400ms or 500ms depending on source).
---
This is why you had, wiggle rogues, and such.  Backpeddling must not trigger the same level of interpolation as  the movement is slower.  **If this is the case, walking should confer the same advantages.**
---
I know things like clearcasting arent consumed until the cast hits the target. Maybe other effects do the same thing with all spells.
---
Never heard of that winterspring frostsaber mount thing? Or how alliance would grind Darnassus rep to get the moonsabers on other races? Or how hordies would grind darkspear rep to get a raptor? 
---
Same thing has continued in the following expansions in different forms as more mounts got added to the game. And now there's a ton of mounts available, many locked behind pretty huge grinds.
---
"How do you kill that which has no life?"
---
My favorite quote ever.
---
Remindme! 18 months
---
The purple lvl 56 or 58 BoE ring dropped from the ogres there. I had it equipped already and saw it drop... but couldn’t loot it as it’s unique. I walked away from a fortune.
---
Even if it's cucumbersome one of my fondest wow memories is being amazed by Undercity sprawling undead extravaganza. So yeah Undercity &gt; Thunder Bluff &gt; Orgrimmar &gt; Anything alliance has to offer because I'm biased as fuck.

---
&gt; I honestly can't tell if you're this dense
---
You seem pretty dense if I have to be honest.
---
My point is: BWL weapons are ON PAR with Rank 14. Not better. ON PAR. Which means that even if (and that's not true for every class) Rank14 are better they aren't much better. How much more dps do you think rank14 weapon + Jindo's bag are over a Staff of the Shadow Flame?
---
Also: BWL and AV are phase 3, ZG is phase 4, and even if Ranks are phase 2 assuming 3 months each phase it will be impossible to reach rank 14 before phase 3, and even if phases are longer the way ranking up works will make really hard for more than 1-2 people every server to get rank14.
---
So, even assuming someone will actually go through this utter pain in the ass, it'll be utterly irrelevant.
---
but that would mean making changes to move their quest's out of phase ;)

This is funny.  Your quote is *exactly what I said.*  It's being released on the 1.12 patch, with content (Battlegrounds, Dungeons, Raids, etc.) being progressively released to mimic the original timeline.
---
Or in other words...the 1.12 patch, with content gated.
---
In a sub about a classic version of a game from 15 years ago.  I don't think OLD means within the last few months.
---
It's a current project being done leading all the way up to the launch of classic.
---
Maybe it's not a lie but it's terribly misleading to call it OLD when the project is current and ongoing.
---
I know it might be weird for people (?) But on the side tab with overwatch/wow/Diablo/wc3 they should have a different icon for wow classic so it's easier to see the difference come launch. But I'm sure it's so small it doesn't even matter being on it's own game tab.
---
You can do it on the boat by half hanging off the boat by the stairs too, alliance homies!
---
Priests have a couple of specific abilities that are dependent on their race, so faction matters there if you're looking for something specific or min-maxing.
---
Says 5 days nonstop playing as a mage will ding 60.
---
I had Mazzranache (the pink strider) from Mulgore, named Barberella, on my Dwarf Hunter, picked her up at 20 (quite tricky on a PvP server, waited for it just after a reset) and kept her all the way to the top. Together with Bestial Rage it was the best pet ever, a red-raging pink whirlwind of death.
---
I'll be sure to drop a screen or two sometime.
---
My face is recessive.
---
Don't listen to that drunken snurf
---
*in my opinion* it's the thing that takes away the most of what the game is about.
---
Only going by vague memory of original vanilla.
---
Searing pain is a quick cast. Could spec shadow burn if you're super worried. Wand works well, I usually send pet asap if I know I need to tag.
---
I mean, UC is just the Spooky IF. 
---
Both have most of their relevant stuff on a ring that circles the outer edge of the city. 
---
Both have a soft glow provided by fluid you PROBABLY don't want to play/swim in (lava in IF, slug vomit/shit in UC).
---
 And both are housed within another object (IF is inside a mountain, UC is inside/under Lordaeron castle).
---
/s (mostly)
---
He was pure cringe.
---
Your post helps a bit. I'm contemplating either Warrior or Hunter.
---
Hunter - Good at everything but not best dps in AQ or Nax
---
Warrior - Total gimp life (until geared). Can't do much without a healer following about. If geared + healed then god mode.
---
Yeah, that Fred’s a crazy mf.
---
Yeah we can surf Facebook, Youtube, Netflix all day but god forbid you look up some game.
---
Exactly.. He plays Alliance
---
You could complete quests in the BG. Taming wolves for their respective elite versions etc. You could loot enemy players to turn in their armor to improve ur NPC's and whatnot.
---
Some held the front and some others farmed the quests to aid your frontline and to gain some ground. It was just epic
---
Do you mind elaborating? I’m vehemently behind Vanilla and all it stands for but I remember really loving the flying elements of TBC and the feeling of exploration
---
Things in dire maul hit pretty fucking hard. Scholo same thing. Strat is indeed pretty ezmode though.
---

You wish I streamed all this ;)
---
Doesn’t change the fact. :(
---
Zhevera Hooves.  They all have mfing 4 legs which each end in 4 mfing hooves. One kill - Done.
---
Yeah that is a good way to envision it, like a hub of different expansions. Each era, whether it be vanilla, TBC, WOLTK, etc could be independently controlled as far as merges to keep population up. If they merged down to one server in each expansion era, so be it. But people could play one or all of them as they saw fit.
---
People might say "I don't have time to play on 3 different servers", but that's where character copying helps. It means you start TBC server at burning crusade, and you don't lose progress back on the classic vanilla server, since that character is still there.
---
There's probably problems with the idea that we aren't thinking about. But I think it'd be neat, and it would keep people subbed a long time. Blizzard surely likes that.

This is not 100% true as warriors in BC would use a trinket from BRD all the way up to s3 ended  (as far as I remember). Also engineering from vanilla had its uses. Remember TF used on worlds first illidan kill? I might have that wrong but i seem to recall it being used, at least for progress.
---
No, I did not.
---
So I plan on playing a rogue as I really enjoy world pvp, I'm curious what everyone's thoughts are when comparing undead against troll. 
---
My reasoning for this is I plan to run maces for the stuns and was thinking beserking may be extremely useful to get more attack speed. Do you think itll be more useful than the undeads fear mitigation?
---
Lots of TBC love in here.  I love it...
---
THE BURNING CRUSADE!
---
As someone who played back then on a hunter, it was TBC 2.3 yea.
---
The range 8-35 and 0-5 were ranges that were different than players might expect.  One of the devs talked about this (kevin jordan I think).  The 5-8 gap is because of limitations of network code.  2.3.0 brought new network code that allowed Queued network commands, probably part of the ability to remove the deadzone.
---
im indifferent about it, dont care either way, its just 1 click difference

Meeting stones would just put anyone in your group with no regard for their role.
---
Generally, nobody really wants a Shaman tank, even at lower levels. You will struggle to keep aggro off of the healers, much less the DPS. If there are more than 2 mobs, you're going to need CC. It will be slow and everyone will be eating/drinking between pulls. It's not a great time.
---
Today I learned light dies in your eyes. RIP.
---
I'm sure Method will change their tune once classic surpasses retail, but until then it's a great opportunity for other guilds to make a name for themselves. Removing the best guild from the most popular version of the game is a golden goose for someone to exploit.
---
That's inside the caverns of time instance
---
yeah thats why i used that Keyword: trivial
---
“Chuck Norris, is that you?”
---
The gnolls in Northern Silverpine are a great place for Horde to grind Linen. It's why all of my Horde tailors eventually end up in Silverpine before too long.
---
Reeeeeeeee I knew I should have made this meme long ago
---
But blizz never wanted hybrids. Wotlk tried really hard to kill hybrid builds (to the point of nerfing def/crit/etc ratings so you can't be a rogue tank anymore, which was a better dps than any other tank).
---
Also, blizz put the most powerful talent at the end of the trees, which it would make sense if you want specialization to be stronger than anything else, but if you want to allow hybrid specs, the strongest should be lower in the talent tree, if the max level is 80, the strongest talent should be around 50 if you want hybrid specs to be worth (although I still think those would be weaker than specialized), instead they put that at 60 (sometimes at +55, locking you out of a skill in other tree).
---
Cata was when blizz gave up and just said "choose one tree and put 80% of your points in that tree"
---
I've been tossing up between warrior and hunter.
---
Warrior - it's a grind but it should be easy to get a spot in group content. My PVP and PVE specs are different.
---
Hunter - Really good at everything in the game until AQ40+.
---
I'm not 19 anymore, I'm 33 with kids. I used to no life but that's not an option this time. Leaning towards hunter now.
---
because even 12 years later Outland is still the best continent in the game as a whole. I wouldn't mind BC classic not happening if Outland somehow ended up in classic proper
---
I'm going to take 10 steps back now haha
---
Yeah agreed. Keep on mind MC is open even when everyone is level 1. So it will be a race to 60 that will decide first MC.
---
The hardcore guilds will try for day 6-8 MC. Depending on the actual release time, they might try to get prepped in 6.5 days to kill Rag on Tuesday night before the reset.
---
Yea for sure. I just think it would look more presentable that way.
---
Retail is going to remain as is I imagine. Makes sense to leave the player base be with their tiered difficulty and conveniences for casual friendly. 
---
Otherwise, unless classic is so wildly successful and continues to be over a year after, they could tailor retail after a similar design model. But it can only go so far, because you know, TBC and WotLK.
---
If classic is so wildly successful, I imagine they just create new content with armor tiers to support alternative specs for classes, instead of the "mainstream" spec for raids.
---
I think people associate a certain spec with an element of damage.
---
It's made by navak, and included in the google docs presentation of every one of kargoz's class leveling guides.

---
I already have a post there at the top of the subrrddit. Nobody reads that sub.
---
That's just wrong.  You gain 59 +heal and some stats while losing 5 mp5 going from aurastone -&gt; lokamir .  A priest gains 29 +heal and loses 13 intellect and 2% crit.  It is clearly a much more significant upgrade for non-priests.  I've never seen lokamir go to a healing priest in my years of playing private servers
---
Also,  it is very possible that other healers haven't yet gotten an aurastone hammer by the time BWL rolls around,  but every priest will almost certainly have benediction already.
---
That thing is legendary &lt;3
---
You can't fake a mana tide totem though.
---
I am not sure if I understand the question. I am absolute ass at playing mages. But I love the feel and fantasy behind them in wow. Especially the human female ones. But my favorite is night elf balance druid, and I am better at that class. I love that artsy, dreamy feeling mixed with love for primal nature and nature research. Also moonkin have something in common with mages. So for me it is more beautiful and interesting version of a mage. Also night elves are unique - most nature connected elves in other universes are primal and wild...ish? These are dreamy, artsy, sophisticated, but nature lies in their hearts, and is connected to their very existance. Their city is melded with the forest and nature is allowed to run wild inside. Their love of nature is more of an ecologist then gardener (blood elves, eversong enchanted into permament spring and strictly cut, shaped and controlled nature of Silvermoon).
---
I remember people doing that because they were choosing the mount they wanted to rep. Like a gnome running to teldrassil at lvl 1 in order to build darnassus rep so they could rock a tiger mount as a gnome. 
---
I see your point but I still think what you’ve described is far from what modern mount collecting has become. I say this as a vanilla player and someone who focused on collecting mounts through the later expansions.
---
Is the regular BETA that I was using this morning down then?
---
Someone said that at some point and someone answered something like "are you sure it's not the warrior spell you're talking about?" or something. Meaning, is the blood coming from any attack or from a specific skill?
---
Transmog is a huge reason WoW has survived this long.
---
I am not saying bring transmog entiry to classic, but let players transmog old raid sets.
---
Human Skulls hillsbrad.
---
I still have my "Humar" IRL. [Doesn't look much](https://imgur.com/afe4Re7) like a pridelord, but he is.
---
No, This is Dave.
---
Yeah, he had a breakfast at Tiffany's. Or something.
---
It wouldn’t be good writing, but man the drama. Wouldn’t that mean that with &gt;!Calia technically being dead, holy-undeadness notwithstanding!&lt;, Anduin is next in line as the rightful heir of Lordaeron?
---
fury is nuts in MC, really.
---
Take that as a sign lol
---
Alpha disappeared... rest still offline...
---
Honestly just give me Kara and I’d be super happy.
---
Well, other than transmog (which is a big thing that a huge percentage of Classic aficionados are stacked against), and the fact that literally all of the relevant content would have to be redesigned from the ground up (sans the art assets, I guess), tested and incrementally expanded, and the fact that it would in essence completely negate the Vanilla content entirely (since none of the raid gear would have stats and the honor system would reset) while still mainly being mostly superfluous (since there are 30+ zones in Classic and 7 in BC, excepting the Isle of Quel'Danas, there wouldn't be enough questing zones to progress from 1-60 in Outland, you couldn't get to Outland without being level 50 or so because of the location of the Dark Portal (unless they bolted on a teleport somewhere), and running on foot through all of Outland for forty levels (or worse, back and forth between Outland and Azeroth on foot to get to zones to continue questing to level) sounds terrible.
---
Oh, and you *cannot access* many parts of Outland without flying. Netherwing Ledge, Tempest Keep, and Skettis (might be wrong about that) require flying to access. The Throne of Kil'Jaeden is accessible through a portal at some point, but most people just flew up there. Blade's Edge Mountains would be a ghost town without flying because of the ridiculous verticality; I'm not even sure if all the areas are even *passable* overland. Don't get me wrong, I'm with you on the idea that flying broke a lot of things (flying in Azeroth proper being the biggest nail in a lot of coffins), but Burning Crusade's maps were designed to require flying in places. Same thing with Wrath of the Lich King if you go that route; Icecrown and its subzone Hrothgar's Landing are impassible in sections via the ground, there is a quest hub *on a moving airship*, and Storm Peaks requires flying as well. Either you add zone redesign to the already-lengthy list of bits they'll need to fix, redesign, or rebuild from the ground up just to get this off the ground, or it just doesn't fly without flying. :P
---
I hope they do continue with, say, Burning Crusade content after a couple of years, "warts and all." Even if they keep the 1.12 class design so the game remains the same I'd be okay with it (since that would hopefully just be some numbers tuning and a few more talent points to bring you to level 70). Or they could make BC and Wrath servers if there's enough interest. I'm all for expanding on the Classic server options with content from the "glory days" of WoW, from back in the days when I first started playing with my buddies. But the whole point of playing the game as it was in that time period *is playing the game as it was in that time period*. ;P If I wanted to go back and run expansion zones out of order with a mishmash of ability designs that weren't around at the time the content was current and transmog to my heart's content, I can already do that in the modern WoW client.
---
Did any of you actually watch the damn video? Sco was 100% sarcastic when he was speaking about this, he was joking around. Literally 5 seconds after the clip he had a smirk on and called out Scrype on starting in WOTLK and not Vanilla.
---
it's an immunity vehicle
---
Gotta time the shots to kite the mobs early on! But yeah the first levels are kind of annoying :)
---
Yeah, noticed immediately the graphics improvement during stress test.
---
What server? I been playing on Nost but don't want to level anymore.
---
These are not the shit posts we deserve, they are the shit posts we need.
---
You don't need good gear for MC. And by the time BWL comes out they will have 2 alts each and will raid with them to funnel gear to their mains
---
Illegal Danish was pretty funny
---
Yeah so you can be a carrier for blonde and just not show it
---
As Horde, that final push across the Alliance Bridge was amazing.  I loved it when both sides faced off, sitting on opposite ends no one willing to be the first across.  I vividly remember charging across the bridge, sacrificing my blueberry, and dropping my howl of terror with a Leeroy Jenkins /yell Macro.  About 2 seconds later, after being obliterated, watching the Horde come pouring in behind me.  It was glorious.  One of my favorite WoW memories of all time
---
I thought horde had shorter bg queue times
---
I think they will have dual talent spec but maybe not so they take gold out of the economy
---
This is the correct answer.
---
In my experience, horde always had faster queues than alliance did.  However, everything is probably all based on battlegroup.
---
Patch 1.13, not 1.12. This is it's own incarnation; “Currently, based on both your feedback and our own deliberations" This content was never in 1.12; this game is based off 1.12, but it's 1.13. The added content was content added as other patches.   
---
The content added is mixed and matched from other patches. Calling it 'gated content' doesn't make it a special exception against the 'mixed and match' comment. It's literally just that. This isn't a recreation of a PATCH, it's a recreation of the entire original game. Furthermore, recreated with community input. 
---
You can argue all you want, but it's not the same game. It's not 1.12. It's pretty close, sure. Don't pretend like this game satiates your #wowpurist wetdream.
---
Ah, awesome, thanks a lot!
---
Eschayakee, can recall countless attempts to hijack it from horde peons questing. Eventually doing an alt on wrong side just for this quest to summon it, relog and tame. Unfortunately, it worked on pve server only.
---
Guys, it’s okay. OP plans to spend ~$1300 on 10,000g once the gold sellers get up and running. Gotta buy money to make money.
---
Lol honestly I'd like to find out Anduin is Onyxias baby in a Wrathion plot
---
I am rolling Paladin. Was looking at a warrior because I wanted to tank, but in the end I am deciding that I will  heal. Also, the gear sets look awesome on Paladins. There are also not an overwhelming amount of Paladins compared to the absurd amount of warriors. I was never into cloth wearers so that realistically is the only reason I’m not rolling Priest haha.
---
It looks much better with the graphics turned up and playing on 1080 instead of 640 like the old days.
---
lul rite
---
Lol, talent system being vastly more complex.
---
It really wasn't, most of the stuff in the talent tree were pretty obvious that you took them, and everyone used cookie cutter builds.

Water sections were a blessing as a warlock with water breathing back in vanilla. Killed a few guys that forgot about needing air back then.

Cant wait until Gorak makes it to Crossroads and Barrens chat. I love your work.
---
Facial expressions are best even with low poly.
---
The estimates for super-fast are just laughably bad.
---
TBH most people are simply not interested in discussing it. There's a bunch of interesting ideas floating around but at this point we have no base to work from. Most players just want to get to launch and start leveling.
---
That's not classic though.
---
Pristine yeti horn in winterspring
---
Yea. This is not important.

Fargodeep Mine and Jerod's Landing ;)
---
Discussing the possibility of an eventual classic plus is not against the rules as far as I can tell. Trolling is, on the other hand, and telling people to go post in a 181 reader sub is at least borderline troll.

No thanks. Hate the whole space goat theme and flying mounts.

Currently trying to decide between Shaman and Druid, some info:
---
I mained a paladin in Vanilla with my brother playing a warrior and our main focus was pvp together. Worked like a charm and had a blast. We decided we wanted to switch factions to horde, he’s still going to play as a warrior and our focus will still be pvp together. I saw previous comments comparing druids to paladins in regard to survivability. Yet, I’m interested in elemental/Resto shamans, which I know are more viable at max level opposed to leveling which I would most likely do as enhancement. 
---
Any thoughts on this? What would make a better teammate to a warrior? 
---
I know but if they implement it they would need to do so in a way that doesn’t break immersion. I remember when dual spec first came out you had to visit your trainer to activate it. That was short lived as they then said you just need to not be in combat. Either way I’m ok with it.
---
i love the ulduar song he made
---
Might wanna check up on that.
---
Family of 5 we all play.  It h we will all be 60 before typical dad dings 40
---
If you aren't already familiar with it, you might check out the "Immersion" addon. It provides a cool interface for quests...
---

That's awesome!

Oh wow. I don't know if this makes it better or worse.

That fucking orb or whatever you need for Tower of Athalaxx in Ashenvale
---
Why are you telling people something they can learn by playing the game?
---
Edit. To clarify, this is a guy who throws a hissy fit for people posting knowledge people should learn by playing, or remember since release.
---
Spec elemental, heal raids and dungeons. You’ll be fine.
---
00F
---
Some private servers even had Expose Armor and Sunder stacking...
---
Certain classes have no issues leveling solo, others such as Priest can have some issues solo from time to time. 
---
Another variable would if you’re leveling on a pve or pvp server if pvp having someone for back up is definitely beneficial.
---
Make a 40man raid because it can be looted by all if it drops
---
Big time wise guy!
---
Fun fact btw: we didn’t have Taco Bell in Finland during Vanilla, first one opened in Novembet 2017

If we allow NPC races I'd say Shadowforge City is pretty darn cool.

Solo is faster. You split the XP from mobs when grouping. That said duo leveling can save some time on PvP servers. People are less likely to mess with two people than they are a lone adventurer.

You can heal relatively well if you go down to NS in resto and the rest in ele

I sell BL on K3 atm for 150(back patch). but yeah the prices will be a lot lower on a fresh server.
---
yes
---
Depends on classes. Also at some point solo is better at others duo so best case you'd play solo except for the places where you know duo is better.
---
I mean...looks like there is dried semen on the keyboard so I’d say 75 cents is too much

---
Honest question? have you seen the numbers for the world first races in BFA (the first time they started streaming) and have you seen the drop in number on twitch for the beta? Besides, if it is that big of a deal they will just sponsor a top guild.
---
Listen - what some of the Try Hard Streamers are doing isn't testing the game as it was intended to be when they run SM at 30: it's them dicking around because they've hit the cap and may as well try.
---
ok
---
This is great please addit to the game &lt;3
---
That's the spirit!
---
...which one are the Magram again? I always kill the ones closest to Shadowprey Village.
---
And by quite a bit you mean literally like 6 full levels lmao not rlly plausible/practical , would require (off the top of my head) something like 50000 mob kills to go from 30-40 killing things that are your own level.
---
I’ll do 3-4 hours tonight and tomorrow night that should get me to 25
---
I love hunter because all their tier sets are amazing and look sick. (Even tier 1 can last a long time). Even in Naxx they are a necessity for tranq and their role of kiting mobs is so unique to them in the raid setting. Upgrades feel nice and straightforward. Rhok &lt; Ashjrethul &lt; Nerubian Slavemaker. Warrior dps is nuts but I just don’t want to put in so much time grinding to get to that point. Frost mages will still be your bane and hunters fuck warriors too. They are still a master class if played properly though with some solid upgrades
---
This was never a problem for me.  They aren't even a quest drop
---
Yea. 5 months is probably closer
---
I Feel sorry for you man, btw what class are you playing?
---
There are multiple pserver guilds full of dedicated and experienced players who will nolife 16-20h per day until Ragnaros dies. We have been doing this for years now. For example, on the latest big pserver, Ragnaros died on day 10.
---
People take vacations specially for this. Some don't have jobs. There are alot of nerds out there.
---
If Method isn't gonna dedicate their time to practicing lvling until Classic launch, they don't stand a chance. To compete with pserver guild getting world first MC, you would need the whole guild to hit 60 in around 4 days /played.
---
Ya which they don't do for any other classes. Nobody rolls physical damage rogue. I would even say it's different for mages they do damage based on which spec they are using, but arcane doesn't use arcane damage.
---
Make your own groups and join a guild that isn't full of elitists. 
---
Unless you're looking to min/max you will be fine as ele. It's obviously not a top dps spec, but play whatever you enjoy and just have fun.
---
It's called lag or latency. This was 100% present in Vanilla. It always pissed me off that a melee could hit me when I was in a position where my nova wouldn't catch the other player.
---
TLDR: The player isn't actually in the position you see him on the screen.
---
It's a really good thing they wasted all those beta keys on players who don't have a clue about Vanilla.
---
10 hours a week, but seeing as this is 2019 and you kinda know a lot of the areas it should be like 2-3 months
---
Horde has always had the more PVP minded players - from level 19 Orc Twinks to Gank-and-Nom undead rogues. Almost every PVP server leans at least slightly horde. 
---
You'll only get your ass handed to you so many times before you just stop playing their game.
---
Ah it’s Ranji, the neet from the pserver. Might wanna keep your content in that other sub, it’s not relevant here at all.
---
Are you serious? I .. just... told you.
---
Proof &lt; Decade old memories
---
Seriously though, thank you for the effort. I thought for sure they were flagged...
---
Also confusing that basically every private server I've played has them alone flagged.
---
Why does this matter to anyone at this point in time?

**\[Alliance\] \[Oceanic\] \[PvP\]**
---
Hello! Welcome to the as-yet unnamed Alliance guild for Classic WoW. In Vanilla WoW, many more people ran dungeons as they levelled. It was common to meet likeminded people and make friends as you journeyed through Azeroth. The world was huge, with lots to experience – and that experience was magnified for people who joined a guild whose members supported and helped each other. This is a guild where you can hang out and chat, join guild-led instance runs, quest together, and give and receive help with classes and game mechanics.
---
\-- **Are you a progression guild?** This is intended to be a guild for people who work full-time and have families but still want to enjoy playing Classic with others. We are going to take our time to level to 60, but there is an expectation to gear up and delve into raiding (and a bit of level 60 PvP).
---
\-- **What are the requirements?** The guild has a few rules: • Be open and willing to accept all different kinds of players, with different levels of experience, a different approach to how they play and different real-life commitments • Have a good attitude to the game in general and towards your guildmates, regardless of how they choose to play • Be willing to help others where needed, albeit dungeon runs, supporting alts or helping people with group quests • Be willing, as you approach level 60, to work towards pre-raid gear • Be free for three hours, two nights a week for dedicated raiding progression • Be communicative: let the guild leader or other guild officers know if you need to take a break or can’t attend a raid or event This is about community and helping each other enjoy the game; but understanding that sometimes life itself prevents you from doing everything you may want to do. --
---
**Is this guild only for Kiwis/Aussies?** We will be raiding 9 p.m. to 12 a.m. NZST (New Zealand Standard Time), two nights a week – but anyone is welcome to join.
---
\-- **Do I have to have played vanilla WoW?** I suspect many people who are going to jump into Classic experienced vanilla WoW to some degree. There may be a few dabblers or people who started in TBC or Wrath; but I predict that the majority of those who stick around through to level 60 will be veterans coming into the remake with a nostalgic view. This guild is a place of acceptance, where anyone with the right attitude and willingness to learn and improve can find a home. I’m looking for people with dedication, who are willing to level to 60 and enjoy playing with like-minded people as part of a supportive community. --
---
**I didn’t see a name. What is the guild called?** I have a few names in mind, but I’m going to put the guild name to a vote once the game goes live, for two reasons: • If I name the guild now, there’s no guarantee that the name will be available when we get the guild charter up (call me paranoid) • Collective, or at least majority agreement on the name, will give people more investment in the guild I understand that some people may not want to commit until they know what the name of the guild is. We will have many weeks, if not months of levelling to 60, so I don’t expect a full 40-man raid of committed members when Classic goes live. But it sure would be nice! I am also hoping that those who are happy with the choice of name when the time comes will be willing to pitch in and help pay for the guild charter. The more people who pitch in, the sooner we will be able to secure the name that we agree on – if enough people contribute to the 10g fee, we may even snag the name we want within a few days (or even hours) of release. --
---
**How do I apply?**

I don’t remember him doing an Ulduar song. Cranius and Summergale had one that was popular (based on the Timbaland song “The Way I Are”). That’s one of my favorite parodies from that era.
---
No you can`t. Shadow meld is mostly a PvP ability. And as such it is far better than the average non night elf priest rate it as. Having the ability to be unseen in battlegrounds and other PvP situations is massive, as everyone that has played some PvP in vanilla knows that priests are the focus targets of the other faction.
---
I’m doing this on a warrior.
---
&gt; Pure classes don't really have to do with respeccing though.
---
I meant "pure" more as in the RS sense. Pure classes being ones that not only are 100% holy but never touched any spec or talent other than holy. A bitch to level, but all the more rewarding for it in the process.  
---
&gt; They do it because it makes the game more enjoyable.  
---
Enjoyable is subjective. They make the game more casual-friendly, that's for sure.
---
Do you hate yourself?
---
I mean that the worst possible class to do that on
---
Holy shit I hope this tattoo is a joke......
---
That's funny, not the first time I've read this but in all my alliance history (15+ characters easily) I never once spent more than like 10 minutes killing oozes before the bag dropped.
---
30/0/21 spec can still do great in BGs and you have resto talents to help healing.  Even 31/0/20 is still fine as a healer, just keep a separate set of PVP gear (stam, int, +damage, +crit) and heal gear (int, mp/5, +heal or +damage)
---
Ned Stark was an honorable man.
---
Ha! Vanilla is my home.

I watched Asmon beat SM at 30. Some of the later bosses had Skull Markers over their level.
---
They will.
---
Can't "battleground locations" be read as "locations of battlegrounds"? Sorry, English isn't my native, silly joke attempt if so.
---
In 1.12 AV, does one faction over the other have an advantage? If memory serves right, Horde had a big advantage at one point and wondering what's 1.12 AV like.
---
It's really the compounding of incremental gains. These things seem small, but there are a LOT of them. Not only do you have 19 equipment slots, but you also have numerous stacking buffs (alcohol,food,elixir,weapon buff,and myriad class specific buffs like power word:fortitude).
---
Beyond that, much of the content in wow is based on a race to zero. You are fighting something or someone, and it has resources, and you have resources, and you will run out after they do. 
---
But your margin of safety is how much you win BY, and that can be much smaller than the total amount of health you have and damage you do. 10% more health doesn't seem like it should matter much, until your plan is to trade 50% of your health every time you try to fight something. Then, 10% more total health is the difference between ending the fight with 50% health and 60% health, which is the difference between  having to rest after every pull, or being able to comfortably pull twice before healing. 
---
I feel that as wow aged, this became less and less important because the expectation was just that the player won, no matter what. As that expectation is scaled back, you really start to appreciate the little differences, which not only give you increased margin of safety, but just let you take fights you otherwise couldn't. For a rogue or warrior, the difference between being able to chain pull 2 and 3 mobs without healing, is not small.
---
Also, a lot of classes have inherent sustain, through bandaging, or evocation, or some weak (in terms of mana per second or health per second) regeneration function.
---
This is even more impactful, as when your gearing allows your actual resource expenditure to approach your resource generation, you can start to see dramatically smoother results. 
---
Also, there is a selection bias. The people who care about getting THIS part right tend to be the people who care about getting other parts right, and those added effects compound.
---
It's the guys who will go for marshal/warlord we really have to worry about..
---
Basically this but you lose progress when you stop playing.

So TL:DR Classic is going to be considerably easier than private servers?
---
That’s kind of a bummer
---
Completely agreed.  Unfortunately, I already put my days in for Wed-Friday haha but for sake of avoiding the madness a little bit I might just keep it at that and take some days off the next week. 
---
First world problems when you've put in the wrong day off work to play a video game.
---
It's just a bug fix but classic will be based on 1.12 for theses things so don't worry about it.
---
Echeyakee
---
Good post. I agree with a lot of it. My comment regarding leveling zones was using Outland zones to supplement Azeroth leveling. All the Classic leveling zones would remain relevant, but you could choose to level in new Outland zones if you wanted to as well. I understand some players don't like transmog, but I think it is the single feature that would keep people playing Classic WoW. Cosmetics are everything to a lot of players. Just look at BFA.
---
Ideally, they create new content that fits in with the lore of Classic and the world of Azeroth. The issue of powercreep and inflation has to be addressed. Powercreep was actually an issue in Classic, as Naxx gear rendered earlier raid gear insignificant. The inflation issues is also an obstacle. If you add more level 60 content, then it makes it faster to gear. If you had several MC or BWL type raids, then players could gear too quickly. The progression phases of Classic up until AQ were one of the highlights of the game. Rewards were meaningful, but not game breakingly imbalanced.
---
I think some type of reset or seasonal system is required.
---
Are the building designs changes or are those from vanilla too?
---
At the moment you can Mount up on Zeppelins everywhere on the deck, no restrictions. Also can Mount up in Undercity. Lets see if they leave it as is or change it like it was in Vanilla.

---
[I got you bro](https://imgflip.com/i/33bkxd)
---
I just think That post Naxx it’s probably a better option than the current devs trying to make new content to follow Naxx because they could use that opportunity to make post naxx be too similar to retail which could ruin the game for people
---
And then, of course, Whereveryouarthas.
---
No, they're not much better (except in the case of orc warriors, in which case they actually are much better), which is not something I ever claimed either, I simply said that they are better/bis, which they are.
---
And I'm aware rank 14 requires a ridiculous amount of time, but that's not really relevant to the discussion anyway, and if you really want to nitpick, just because you're killing a boss does not mean it's actually going to drop a certain item. In the 10 months or whatever it was of farming BWL on a private server, my guild saw a grand total of 2 staff of the shadow flame, for example.
---
Transmog = identity loss
---
I ams alliance! Hear me meow!

They look like someone just jammed an Arcanite Reaper up their bum.

It most certainly was not, your server must have just sucked.
---
You say "for over 9 years" like that's a long time, but the game is 18 years old and its prime was in the first ~3. I started in 1.08-1.09 and played up to and including 1.11, which was for over 5 years, and I didn't know tokens of absolution existed. And I was entirely an HC player.  
---
For me, that's rather disappointing. If you saw a dude at level 95+ in HC with base str/dex rolling around with nigma for the str and like 100% of his points into vit, you knew this guy was a big badass.  
---
Nowadays I'd wager it's fairly trivial to go some spec that's good for undergeared peeps, gather 40pgems and d2jsp your way to nigma/etc and then respec into some endgame build. Kinda trivializes the game and kills the RPG aspect, for me anyway.  
---
Naturally, more casual players will enjoy it more. And I don't say that as an insult. Not everyone is going to play a game like D2 and play it on HC and want it to be a grueling experience where they feel attached to their characters.  
---
I personally would just rather a system on WoW where you are permanently locked into your talents, or even are permanently locked into two separate talent builds (as in dual specialization), rather than freely respeccing.  
---
Naturally, I find the (meaningfully high) 50g in Vanilla to be a decent compromise, where some people will respec often but others will respec only on special occasions or when they are committing to a new build. But that's my entire point in this thread. I don't find 50g respecs to be excessive, and if it were up to me I'd remove them altogether.  
---
Matter of opinion.
---
Basically what you do is spec elemental. The spec for elemental is 30-0-21. You heal or dps in dungeons, but can work, and you need on healing gear and sometimes dps gear. In dungeons there really aren't going to be that many dps items that you need. You want high stam high int mail items, with crit and sp being good bonuses. In raids you will be healing as well so you want a full healing set. If you talk with your guild you will probably be alllowed to heal as elemental in raids, and you can get priority on the few elemental pvp items that drop there, and a lot of them are heal+elemental hybrids like loka'mir from nefarian.

It was a different time.

Oh I understand that. I just think the expansions are mostly nostalgia. They are lobby based games. There are a lot more options for lobby/queue based games nowadays.

They all feel safe for different reasons.

Thunder Bluff feels like you're in the clouds, above the world.

 Everything's green and woody, the sky is super blue .  You're above the conflict.
---
Undercity is nestled away, claustrophoic almost, but comfortable for those that don't like big open areas.
---
Orgrimmar is comfortable because it's full of Horde.  Nothing makes me feel safer than knowing that before you get into the city, there's a bunch of people duelling  outside the main gate.  And if you come in the back entrace, well there's a bunch a people duelling outside the main gate.
---
Fuck. Old Cold Bolvie's gonna be real pissed when he wakes up.
---
I've never played vanilla, I started in late BC and played most of the years in WOTLK...
---
I've been reading a lot about what classes / specs are viable and which ones are completely trash. After getting informed, I've decided to play in an instant-60 p server to try all the classes and there are two classes that I liked more than the rest...
---
I liked rogue and mage. At first I wanted to main a rogue, but then I've read that the good spec for PvP is different than the good spec for PvE... I don't want to be switching talents everytime I want to go to kill people or do some raids.
---
So I decided to play mage. Frost will be good for both PvP and early PvE (and late PvE i'll switch to fire which is pretty good for pvp too).
---
Now, my only concern is that there will be a lot of mages... right? I've read that warriors, rogues and mages are more than 50% of the game population. Will I feel good playing a popular class?
---
Mega kek
---
The middle bit is just drawn not inked right?
---
Human Mage/Rogue?
---
lol, no way. Human warrior will be the most played by far. As for the worst, probably anything-troll.
---
I think Sunken Temple is one of the more well made dungeons because it required you to do ZF beforehand to summon a boss in it.
---
Lock and shaman do well.in PvP and pve but shaman are boxed into one role in pve (in contenr-pushing raid groups) , and that's healing
---
You could def find a group that would being you as enh or ele but it would be more difficult than if u were a healing shaman or warlock

"lmao you fool I can't believe you thought I was serious!"
---
The system requirements were at most similar to other contemporary 3d games.
---
&gt; I simply said that they are better/bis, which they are.
---
And they are still on par with BWL weapon, which they are. Ashjre'thul is better but still on par with Rank14 Xbow.
---
&gt; And I'm aware rank 14 requires a ridiculous amount of time, but that's not really relevant to the discussion anyway, 
---
The problem with Rank14 is that it might even be unattainable. There is absolutely zero guarantees classic servers will be able to sustain Rank14s. Before BGs it's almost impossible.
---
Sure fucking hope so...
---
Remind me, what was the name of the 1 handed axe everyone wanted at 49....can’t remember but I remember what it looked like.

---
They could've at least put that kind of effort into the horde starting areas. They dont need to put that much effort into all the contested zones but it would be nice to have horde starting areas be better than they are
---
Damn, sorry bro.
---
I can feel it, this one is going to the top.
---
Considering the retail raids have mechanics that make Classic look like a toddlers game, yes people will still watch them.
---
Aw, you beat me to it by one minute.
---
With someone by far. But you have to be prepared to split up. There are speedrunners who assume that both of you will pee in a bottle, play for 12 hours straight, etc....
---
but in reality, it's just fine to group up and spread out as appropriate. As soon as you diverge from a planned out step by step route, it makes sense just to not think of you as joined at the hip, or think that the default is that you pull together and clip each other's dots. 
---
While duo leveling, for example, in elwynn forest, you know that "get 6 defias bandanas quest"? I don't even recommend doing that in the same place. One of you farms one area, one of you farms another (there are 4 places for that quest: dead tooth jack, over by the waterfall next to stormwind, jerrod's landing, and the pumpkin patch.).
---
But there's a lot of value. 
---
- You get to trade greens and double your utilization of world drop boe's (Which are often quite powerful). 
---
- You get to trade buffs with each other
---
- You get to stack valuable but rare items like shiny pearls separately so they don't waste as much inventory space.
---
- Tough quests which must be skipped (like murkdeep in darkshore)  no longer need to be skipped. 
---
- You take less damage when breaking up spawns and need to leash mobs less often.
---
- You can share credit on kill quests.
---
And finally, but very importantly
---
- Some really nasty mobs are hard countered by other players, like for example, priests and rabid thistle bears, who can cure rabies. (a really nasty debuff that destroys rogues and warriors and lasts 30 minutes). 
---
Duo leveling is great, when you are willing to split up. Remember... you don't even need to be in the same ZONE to be grouped. Sometimes, the mob density, especially for item drop quests, does not support 2 guys leveling in exp range of each other, but you just don't need to BE within exp range of each other. 
---
In fact, it's much better to be grouped with a guy, than solo, of your level: If there is a level 7-8 human in elwynn, he probably wants defias bandanas. If he is in your group, you can coordinate that so you don't fight over them. If he ISN'T in your group, it is quite likely you will show up at the same place looking for the same bandanas. 
---
Exp is never destroyed by being in a group with an equal leveled player (and I suspect, though I haven't done the math, a slightly differently leveled player). And it can break down when you have 2 skinners double pulling, or something like that. But you don't need to do that at all. And there is a lot of value in just having a guy keep you in mind for all his green drops, especially now the mail system is not instant any more.
---
And to repeat myself, the easiest way to make sure that a player is nowhere near you, is to group with him and coordinate that you be on opposite sides of the zone.

Raided a lot in vanilla. I was in my early 20s. I have a 12 year old son now who could play with me. Time is weird.
---
Idk if this is good or bad
---
I strongly remember hunter 1-10 being very easy in vanilla and it seemed much harder on a pserver when I did it recently and I am a lot better at the game than I would have been back then.
---
That's a big IF Classic surpasses retail.
---
Before you go quote me OSRS it was plummeting before they introduced a lot of  new stuff into OSRS.
---
Not enough*
---
It was literally a 10 second clip in the middle of a fucking "the best classic wow stream jokes" video on YouTube. How on earth can you have this little comprehension.
---
Gets the job done,
---
IIRC heroic strike got two chances to proc before the bug fix. One for the white swing and then a second for the HS that overwrote it. No source other than memory feels.
---
And then there was that one time in av when windfury procced windfury and you globaled 12 generations of nelf hunters and everything was right with the world.
---
Unlike Stormwind Org was never sacked by an enemy army
---
In your case, leveling is going to take days and days

Oh that's a good idea to just stash extra bags of them in the bank. Hadnt thought of that. Thanks for adding a class back to the pool of choices... :p
---
Lol I’m 2007 it was still a piece of shit, tbh
---
I sure hope this is just pen and marker lol
---
I doubt it’ll take me a year to level a paladin to 60
---
Thank goodness for Thunder Bluff. The splat at the bottom would remove all evidence of such an abomination if anyone on the Horde ever dared.
---
See now you’re just being picky.
---
If the even less people play BFA then they just might actually use it. I can imagine that in Classic, people will just hang in the throne room in Stormwind and yell at Anduin about how Varian isn't his real dad, thinking they're being funny.
---
it cant proc off itself like early vanilla and also has reduced attack power. i think enh is kind of pointless because as ele you can do better burst without even having to wait on procs and being kited
---
The best PVE rewards require a cooperating group.

Underrated comment
---
Horde for the racial variety. 
---
Alliance has Humans, smaller humans, even smaller humans, and blue/purple humans with pointy ears.
---
Horde has giant cows for Pete's sake.
---
As long as battle grounds give that bonus honor, it will always be the better option. If you increase player kill honor even more, it will just help BGs more
---
And each teams starts summoning their spirit lords, so good.
---
Same:) what race were you? I was a night elf male warrior
---
Thunder Bluff is probably the most efficient capital when it comes to AH &gt; Mailbox &gt; Bank.
---
IF is a close 2nd though, very close.

Solo = fastest If you get ahead of the pulk and stay there

There have been a ton of failed MMOs but I think we now have more successful MMOs than we ever have. Final Fantasy is doing pretty well and it's actually really fun. Elder Scrolls still exists and has expansions coming out which goes beyond what I gave it credit for. RuneScape has two successful MMOs and they're run by a shit company. I think there's more competition than there has ever been. But I do agree that we don't have a juggernaut like WoW used to be.
---
I'm not saying they're not enough. Of course they'll crush everything in greens and blues within hours after release. But IMO, the experience private server guilds *have* in running and speedrunning these raids is likely to outweigh the experience that Method *is going to get*.
---
Not something you should be proud of...
---
You’re being intentionally obtuse because it’s easier than admitting you’re wrong.  That’s a pathetic way to go through life.
---
In the outside world you are a simple geologits
---
Remember when PVP was for the sake of PVPing?
---
Pepperidge Farm Remembers.
---
I hope they do what they were talking about and create completely new content post classic, and take the story in a better direction.
---
Huh, back in original Vanilla my experience was exactly the opposite. Mostly older folks in the Horde that were completely chilled out while the angst-y teens all went Alliance and were generally obnoxious.
---
who gives a shit, besides you?
---
Why
---
He's my personal favorite Druid streamer. He seems way more knowledgeable and chill than the bigger ones. He has some good videos on YouTube too
---
Lol. Reminds me of a thread from way back in the old forum when some dude said troll enhance was actually god tier raid dps and then rolled out the numbers to prove it. 
---
It’s getting tiring to read all the posts from people that never played back then trying to bring the new status quo to classic.
---
Breaking that status quo is the whole reason for classic. 
---
The game isn’t built around 1% of the player base so why bring that ill conceived, joy killing bullshit here?
---
Tarren Mill remembers.
---
This is so bad lol
---
Going tunnel
---
It is an Open world mmo. Not sit in a capital city capturing flags all day. Sad
---
What a great movie! Never seen it as a meme...
---
I suspect this is the correct answer.
---
Inb4 any ”The retail players laughed at us for years..” etc. Yes its true. Its still good to spread positivity instead of trying to split the people.
---
I'm wifed up but no kids yet.  Looking forward to playing but I'm working full time and working on my MBA part time at night/weekends.  I wish I had known classic was coming earlier I woulda crammed more classes in the last few years to try to graduate sooner.  8/hrs a week sounds reasonable for me I'm just worried about being too behind that I'm constantly ganked while I'm leveling =(  I'm stricly a PVP player in retail (gladiator/r1 disc priest) so I welcome the ganking but I think I'm going to get really pissed if I have \~1 hour to play and I spend 20 minutes in shadowmeld avoiding some idiots.  
---
wish me luck m8s
---
I don't think anyone has mentioned RuneScape yet. This is exactly what they did years ago. It never had the golden age success of WoW but there was a good period of time where that was the MMO to be. I'm not sure a single player actually likes Jagex similar to what Blizzard is becoming. But plenty of people still play RS3 and Old School RuneScape. They're treated as two different games with two different player bases and I think Classic WoW will have a similar progression.
---
Weight increase - 20kgs
---
The problem is that there's no structure to world pvp. The winner is usually decided simply by who is out-numbered. So if you did get good rewards from world pvp, it would just devolve into roaming bands preying on smaller bands of people, and then the smaller bands would stop playing.   
---
The the main point of BGs is to ensure both sides have equal numbers. Then of course you don't want people who actually do objectives and support getting less honor so you weight most honor by winning the bg.  
---
That's why HKs don't give much honor.
---
honor from kills should be shared in BG's tbh. So unfair for people actually playing the game properly like defending bases.
---
Diminishing returns. Lower the reward for 5 minute AB stomps.
---
You are likely misunderstanding/misremembering a highly coincidental series of drops or something, because this is not how the drop table ever worked and these mobs in particular had no 2h weapon drops over a percent.
---
Yeah Borderlands 3 says hello. Even being a console game as well, it’s going to fucking slaughter in sales on PC.
---
You can heal dungeons as any spec. You can get by as 30/0/21 in raids if they let you. Either way you're healing in PvE content regardless of spec.
---
BRD isn't even that "long" if you know the route, which a lot of players will know by october I think. There are plenty of people reminiscing about spending several hours in there and maybe not even clearing it. The main route of the dungeon is actually pretty straight forward if you pay some attention to it and I remember doing several runs per day on a former vanilla p-server for the hand of justice trinket back in 2013.
---
I think the only change to windfury weapon in vanilla was that extra attacks from windfury cannot proc windfury.
---
They also changed windfury totem in some way to make spamming hamstring on a slow 2-hander less effective, but I am not sure what the exact change was.
---
Don’t talk to me like that bitch. I’ll have you know that I average about 2-3 twitch viewers while streaming.
---
green agility enchants are so nostalgic lol
---
This is false, actually takes longer to lvl in classic vs Pservers.
---
Completely normal, Horde side I actually payed 90g per flask from a guildie once a week. Alliance was more populated so they had cheaper prices. Caster flask I wanna add.
---
They have the right to kick you for a better class/spec/player if they want... If you care this much, play a good class/spec. Lord knows they weren't balanced. If you don't want to do this, put up with the occasional elitist kicking you or make your own groups.
---
And judgement stacking too
---
Yeah, sorry about that.
---
Hi, /u/chopedsuey

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bzxv9n/best_twink_for_19_whats_your_plans/). 
---
That’s another reason why BGs are better. You get a fresh set of players to fight every match. In world pvp you gonna be fighting the same people all night
---
It was honestly really impossible.
---
You're right in the % etc but those few guilds that did have it, Elitist Jerks being my experience/example, were putting out the guides and math- they had a specific section called Think Tank, and it was just that, a really refined forum of breaking down numbers on certain spells/combinations, coef's, items and itemization
---
Yes it is. This marks the zones I visit so I tried to get as compact route as possible.
---
I get where to are coming from - since it just makes wpvp a place to grief instead of grind - but at least you'll be able to enjoy it in phase 2 while waiting for phase 3 :)
---
Or maybe it was an issue with more than just my server and Blizz saw that and changed it... It could also be that. Oh wait, it was that.
---
"on a mountain" in general but it's not a main herb of any zone in particular.
---
The game’s been out for 15 years. If you don’t like it, don’t play it. But stop asking for what YOU want it to be. It will NEVER happen.
---
If you want to hear good things about retail you could always head over to /r/wow
---
Ah yes that’s what I’m looking for. Thanks bud
---
Is this the Swampletics addon of classic WoW?
---
I love how it’s actually a coverup for a tribal tat. This is peak irony.
---
This one guy commented well: 
---
”Because, let's be honest, it's the current trend, and most people are just parrots  (special mention to some streamers with that "I was wrong" sh*t). They either think having their own opinion is too tiring or don't want to get downvoted (or whatever "punishment" depending on the community).
---
But we can't forget that before Classic announcement it was the other way around. Modern players bashing and ridiculing Vanilla and the players that wished for it.
---
That is how the average approval-seeking human works, unfortunately.
---
That said, Classic fits my playstyle way better and I don't have any interest in playing BfA (after lasting 2 weeks in WoD and Legion, I am done with wasting money). If I voice what I think is worse about modern WoW, that doesn't necessarily mean I am against the players who think it is a better experience.”
---
Yeah that’s a yikes from me
---
and a few people at level 58-59.
---
They could also probably adjust spawn node timers for how many layers there are. For example, if thorium has an hour respawn timer and there are 3 active layers, make it take 3 hours to respawn
---
Which is why all Undead should be executed on sight.  
---
Do you know how weird it was being a BE Paladin grouped with Undead?
---
I wouldn't wish your and your sister's loss on my worst enemy. Hope you'll have a good time in Classic, OP. You deserve it.
---
Best quote:
---
&gt; We shit on Retail because they took a game that 12 million people loved and chipped away at it so much only 1.5 million people can even stand it anymore.
---
who cares about retail lmao
---
You could convert it into a mechanical keyboard.
---
Wotlk was when things started to turn.
---
the part where players think they're gonna get 60 and get attuned n then clear mc and ony in two weeks lol.
---
if they some how pull it off I'd be impressed, I'm not saying mc is hard, but I mean I highly doubt they'll do it with greens and a tank thats not defense capped.
---
No you are misunderstanding what i'm talking about. Look at this
---
https://www.wowhead.com/npc=5861/twilight-fire-guard See how its using a 1h and a shield? 
---
you would you expect every single one of these mobs ever to use that same mace and shield right? I'm talking about one spawning holding a 2hand mace and wielding that instead and when you kill it it drops it.
---
Since mobs spawn with the loot they will drop already, these mobs like have access to whats in their "pockets" and can "equip" the items in their "inventory"
---
so what I'm talking about is being able to tell a mob will drop a weapon because you can see them wearing it, they are wearing it because its in their inventory to drop already.
---
&gt; The problem is that there's no structure to world pvp.
---
That's not a problem, that's a benefit.
---
&gt; The winner is usually decided simply by who is out-numbered. So if you did get good rewards from world pvp, it would just devolve into roaming bands preying on smaller bands of people, and then the smaller bands would stop playing.
---
Or the smaller band could call for help.
---
&gt; . Then of course you don't want people who actually do objectives and support getting less honor so you weight most honor by winning the bg.
---
But sitting by a flag is kinda boring.  Maybe if AB was 40v40 I'd enjoy it more.  It's OK, but AV is just better.  I don't need a BG to end.  I need it to be something I feel is part of the actual world, where what I'm working for is real. 
---
"Oh hey, we got 3 flags FOR THE HORDE!"
---
Why do I care if the horde have more flags?  Shouldn't we just be able to craft some as tailors or something?  See, in AV buildings crumbled and burned.  We killed a leader.  It felt more as an actual piece of the world.
---
For streamers only
---
Now that all three dead horses have been beat, let's call this one a /thread.
---
See you at the next one, my dudes.
---
&gt; they won't break any BiS lists
---
Yea, they do. Diamond Flask for warriors for example will totally make you go back to ST.
---
Baconquest: one man's ham-fisted attempt at infamy
---
In world pvp you have the entire world to fight in. 30 + zones. Battlegrounds are the same fights over and over. Classic wow is an open world game. why not make more use of that instead of standing around in a capital city doing queue simualtor. That is what killed wow.
---
I was in a similar spot but thinking I’m going to go warlock. Mainly because less people play them and class fantasy. 
---
Also kinda in the hope when naxx comes out and I’m a decent warlock on the server I’m hoping to get gear fast? Not sure if it works like that I didn’t raid in vanilla
---
Did you ever RMA your brother?
---
Right but getting to 60 as fast as people did on that server, with 10k+ online at all times for the first couple of weeks was much harder than it will be on Classic realms with a smaller population per realm, layering, etc.
---
Well I dont think its that great of a quote, as 1.5 million people still love that game apparently. Why shit on something those people enjoy, as it accomplishes nothing?
---
Thank you for the tip
---
Not fully. If it did no-one else could see your eyes.
---
It's fine. It's not great, but it's not bad either. It's just an entertaining action fantasy movie. It is one of the best video game movies around, but that bar isn't super high.
---
The movie exists as its own thing. The lore isn't accurate. It's really best to go in expecting a movie INSPIRED by warcraft rather than a movie about warcraft.
---
I’m gonna have a good day today.
---
“Lmao you fucking idiots I can’t believe you fell for it!”
---
Dwarf male, solved it for you.
---
This is still pre-reinforcements AV.  
---
1.12 AV killed the purpose of the level 51 player.  Now I forgot when 51-59 became its own bracket, was that 1.12 as well?
---
Beware the Devilsaur mafia
---
People love mages in groups. Probably only second to tanks and healers. You dont compete for gear with most people, and you have the best  CC
---
Follow up question: If the patch note refers to heroic strike, what about the weapon procs like Ironfoe, and other effects like sword spec, HoJ, and windfury which grant extra attacks on next swing? Can those chain proc off themselves/each other? Again, sources are appreciated!
---
You’re the one arguing with a stranger on the internet about the finite details of a 15 year old mmo, and expecting results without providing links or any other supporting evidence. And then there is crying, calling the neckbeard who does provide links and quotes pathetic? You’re even a poor excuse for a nerd. 
---
See you in the field of strife, dirtbag.
---
I'm basically doing the same thing.. accept I will be going to the gym 3-4 hours a day because I'm also prepping for a body building show.
---
You farmed pve from 1-60, whats wrong with a bit more?
---
We dont know subs, but we do know how popular a game is and you reference that with other games that give you numbers like counter strike.
---
I agree strongly with this. I mean there is a reason no open world pvp game succeeded. Players will gang up and take the safest path to overcome their opposition. I am not sayinf remove battlegrounds, but increase the honor rewards so players can viably rank up doing open world pvp. The best part of classic wow zones is all the valuable reasources and farming spots. 
---
There are plenty of ways to punish and reduce the effectiveness of zerging. Besides those types of players would have the option to BG. What is the point of awarding players 200 honor for killing players, but 2000 for capping a few wsg flags?
---
U gonna check that ass %90 of the time.
---
Cats Eye Emerald
---
The first lie the boy-King has bestowed upon us!
---
Well apparently half of the total sales came from China, which is definitely a huge chunk, but considering it sold about double that of warhammer... its about the same amount of sales, excluding China. 
---
Also it got great reviews, an 85 on metacritic which is pretty damn good for any game.
---
Maybe, but dual rogue in world pvp is very rewarding.
---
Yeah make phase 2 last all year lol
---
Either way, for this specific question, the answer would be the same. 2 points in suppression to cap.
---
But I think Eskablade is correct.
---
What, no mention of weapon skills you have to grind out in order to hit the broad side of a barn?
---
Click on 'Hot' and read the [infographic](https://i.redd.it/epg8dba6ss331.jpg) thread.

Hey man - sorry for your loss. I don't know if they are any good but you can turn her character into a 3D model if you want. There's a company called figureprint that does but can't vouch for it.
---
Arthas is anduin’s real daddy
---
I'm pretty certain it worked off your spell power at the time it proc'd and not the time it was cast.
---
Thank you guys so much for the excellent feedback. I've already started working on implementing some of the suggestions.
---
While it’s fun running around killing unsuspected people all day, I like the group oriented play from BGs. And I don’t think that killed wow as a lot more people were on pve servers
---
IIRC bonus honor over time was tested in original, but removed because it promoted AFKs.  Then they settled on the token system, which promoted team wide AFKs.
---
I remember some AVs were so bad even I started AFKing them on my alts because there was 20 people in the cave.
---
Go full meme spec, that's what I'm gonna do.
---
From the research I have done I'm convinced at this point most of these people just regurgitate the bullshit they hear.  I fully intend to roll a meme spec just to prove how viable they are.
---
And he is dead.
---
I justify nothing. There is no moral high ground here. Your people have killed billions of horde. We are all covered in blood. There may be more on my hands than yours, but in the end we are both killers.
---
&gt;1.5 million people
---
Huh, I thought they didnt disclose numbers anymore?
---
I think that's the main city of iron dark dwarves in bfa, but im not too sure.
---
Nope. 2-3 months at most. Those are Blizzard’s words.
---
Oh boy mistakes were made that day. After ressing from Blood of Heroes I stepped foot in WPL...
---
ORCS ON AN OPEN FIELD!!!
---
&gt;Questie
---
Be careful with overinterface addons. THinks like Map overrides (like waypoints that show where quest givers are) can get you in trouble.
---
Classic wow doesnt exist yet. Current wow, also called retail, is the final product of the original game that came out 14 years ago. Since then, there have been 7 expansions and countless patches and changes over time, and the game today looks very different from when it first came out. 
---
Classic wow is going to go all the way back to the beginning, resetting everything and making the game exactly as it was originally, for better or worse.
---
Wouldn’t that make for an interesting story. Maybe like stormwind shuns him for being the bastard of a monster and someone steps into the power void his exile leaves
---
Oh I dont know actually about the numbers. I kind of just assumed the commenter knew.
---
Warlocks are easier than most of the other classes.
---
but theres a better chance of Method players/streamers getting into the beta, giving them more practice with the difference in leveling on classic compared to private servers
---
private server players still have the advantage though
---
Because an 88% drop in the number of players is fucking embarrassing.
---
Wait, people thought Sco was serious?
---
I didn’t realize there were so many Hunter mains on this sub.
---
[To illustrate your point...](https://youtu.be/zG5iyOdVywI?t=1035)
---
I was an oddball and wanted a ram really bad on my night elf hunter. But i stopped somewhere between 40-45 to reroll to a different server with friends and never got close to hitting that goal.
---
I was always lost in that city haha :D
---
Based on what? Watch the video buddy
---
The Mage neck gives 16 SP which is pretty close to pre raid BIS, and just 6 shy of orb of the darkmoon. In terms of return vs time needed it’s way up there.
---
longer view distance: no, they went with something faithful
---
Higher poly models: no, these are all the old models, even models they have new versions of are not used. 
---
Higher res textures: not sure, there may be some that are higher res due to better compression or because they busted them down for size reasons in the original client, no recreations though.
---
The content is mostly the same, but the renderer is more modern, so you get things like better shadows, more foliage density, a smoother full screen glow effect, modern water.
---
Name one
---
Yes, the faction rewards alone were worth the few days grind to exalted.
---
&gt; I agree strongly with this. I mean there is a reason no open world pvp game succeeded. 
---
DAoC was a thing.
---
“Ah, yes” **cracks open can of Monster Energy Zero Sugar** *siiiiiiippp* “some good ol’ fashioned OC, that’s the good stuff.”
---
Hello, GoFundMe? Ya hi, can you give me money cause I quit my job to game. KTHXBAI
---
The truth right here:
---
   We shit on Retail because they took a game that 12 million people loved and chipped away at it so much only 1.5 million people can even stand it anymore.
---
Purely based on memory, but I believe they originally could proc off themselves but that got fixed, so Classic will not have that. Otherwise you could theoretically, with the right RNG, windfury 1-shot a raid boss.
---
You are the man ! (or woman).  You must be truly passionate about the druid class.
---
Please respect tagging your post with a PSA. Your opinion on some small aspect of the communities behavior does not qualify as a public service.
---
I really don’t care how I get to 60.
---
Slow has benefits such as more opportunities to make levelling  buddies, less stressing and taxing on life, better gearing per level - meaning an easier experience per level.
---
Speeding through let’s you be more dominant in the PvP scene - gets your name out there to fellow faction members - and makes you infamous with the opposing.
---
The levelling experience is significantly harder due to being on the very forefront of levelling and having fewer similar people to play with.
---
I can imagine having a very hard 3-4 man quest and having to wait for the second wave of levellers to catch up to help you out.
---
Although, this is perfect downtime to work on grinding herbs and ore to sell very expensively on the AH - and work on other professions.
---
I’ll only speed it if I become friends with people speeding it.
---
I’m not playing classic Wow solo - games are always better when you have a mate to chat with.
---
I agree with you there. I do thi k World PvP should have been more viable
---
 The lack of honor rewards made it pointless when bgs came out.
---
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeewwww
---
Not on Beta he doesn't
---
Current Retail WoW (BFA) is catered to casual players. Leveling is quick and easy, every class pretty much shares every ability, its been very dumbed down over the years, but it still offers challenging raid content for those that seek it. Classes are well balanced as mentioned before they have all gained DOZENS of abilities over the years giving no class true purpose as they all seem to share abilities now.   
---
Vanilla wow was the opposite. Classes were quite unique and unbalanced, leveling takes 100+ hours for most people, and in order to see end game content you need a group of 40 which is not an easy task to gather and manage.   
---
I wouldnt suggest playing WoW Classic unless you plan to commit a ood chunk of time to it.
---
Hahaha totally accurate, Blizzard definitely dedicated millions of dollars toward something they thought wasn’t going to bring in any subscriptions
---
Spitting on Undead Rogues and Ironforge is why you should go Alliance.
---
woaaahhhhhh the alpha version is so cool...
---
Based on mob exp values, quest exp etc. Look at speed runs from 1-10 on Pservers VS Classic. Based on facts my friend.
---
Epic does count, despite what any angry nerds on reddit say, the mass majority of them and the public will buy it, EpicGS or not.
---
LOL dude, come on
---
I am doing 18 hours play, 6 hour sleep for 7 days
---
Food: First day or two I will have food prep in advance for me to just heat up. Outside of that - I will be using Doordash/Favor/Grub/Uber Eats/Postmates and just order take out to minimize downtime. 
---
Lots of lots of water
---
I already eat healthy and don't drink sugary stuff or sodas, so I won't be feeling bloated or get sleepy from those stuff. I also have protein shakes as well but during this week, I may just buy 14 muscle milk or premade shakes to save me downtime. 
---
Also Fruits.
---
I also work at Sbux, so I will be stocking up on some cold brews for the week in the event I need something to keep me up.
---
I also workout at home, so any downtime in game (flight path, boat ride, auto run afk) I will knock out my push ups, pull ups, planks, dumbbells
---
Unless you are on a private server, this is a completely pointless discussion.  Classic will be using 1.12 as a base.  If you are on a private server, nothing anyone says matters because PS just do whatever they feel like/are able to.  So unless you are trying to create a 1.9 PS, which would violate one of the rules of the sub... this is pointless to discuss.
---
I really love the whole atmosphere of the Night elf race, i love druids aswell, but i had pretty bad memories in Darnassus. :D
---
I never personally liked playing on RP, but its crazy that it isnt automatically being offered. All i can think of is maybe they are underestimating how big classic is gona be and think it will lead to a dead server? Still seems silly not to add ONE rp-pvp server right??
---
best of luck to getting blizzard to notice and add one!
---
Sing along with me ! :D
---
There is a reason all the popular PvP videos from Classic had World PvP encounters. Instead of a premade wsg player perspective.
---
Be prepared to fight for mobs in duskwood. It’s always being farmed by mages
---
Exactly. Which is why we need old av. Players are gonna burn out on Ab/WSG just wait.
---
Go browse WoWhead with the classic DB selected, or somewhere like [VanillaWoW DB](https://vanillawowdb.com).  You can look by zone, or look up creature types and sort by zone, etc.
---
Definitely overthinking this. Spec and play how you want to. Yes, some guilds will require everyone to run the cookie-cutter spec for the best dps and maintain a certain level of dps in raids.
---
But there will also be guilds who aren't full of min/maxers and just want to have fun together. When it comes to 5 mans you can run any spec and be fine. Even the early raids (MC/Ony) aren't an issue if you're running a sub-optimal spec.
---
Please, please play the game how you want to, the differences to 'Bis' specs are miniscule as long as you dont go full retard and put some thought into your spec.
---
Good plan. It's easy to stay motivated when playing less time early on since you level up so much quicker. Save the time off until you need longer periods to feel that same accomplishment.
---
305 is essentially all you need for defense, and you can get that from talents.  
---
Armor value is highly valued unless you hit the cap, which is probably not happening until AQ+
---
The main thing is, they are different methods of survival.
---
**Mitigation vs Avoidance**
---
In general, avoidance leads to 'spiky damage' and mitigation leads to 'smoother damage'.  If they both give the same overall survival benefit, then Mitigation is better because it removes dangerous random situations.  
---
In vanilla, Mitigation is rare (armor) but avoidance is powerful (anti-crush).  In general though:   
---
**Armor &gt; Parry &gt; Dodge &gt; Defense &gt; Block**  
---
with Agility somewhere in the middle, and strength lower than block.
---
Maybe the most important thing (and what you should probably focus on first) is collecting and structuring all of the data efficiently.
---
There's about 1300 ranks of Talents if you combine every specialization of every class in WoW classic. Each rank has unique information (such as Tooltip info, prerequisite talents, etc.) which -- if not structured properly -- could lead to difficulties in development. Collecting all of that information is time consuming, and it's in your best interest as a developer to structure it in a way that can be polled easily.
---
Once you have your data, my style of programming is to build small proofs of concept. I.e., build a clickable "talent" button that can only have a certain amount of points spent in it. Focus on small, atomic features and build upward.
---
If you try to think about *every single thing* before you start, you'll find that you end up having to throw some of it away. That's why focusing on small features works well. Fail fast, fail often.
---
Best of luck with your app!
---
Yeah, that sounds like it.
---
Levelling up you'll have an easier time on the priest. Mage brings a lot of quality of life however.
---
I think it's Tormund that shows up here.
---
You weigh as much as two fleas fucking
---
I havent looked in YEARS but thottbot.com used to be the go-to
---
Yikes he uses autistic as an insult a lot doesn't he? It's really off-putting
---
Ahh gotcha. I'm willing to put time into it as i've always been interested but i have no one to play with haha
---
There it is.
---
I'm starting to feel you on this. Especially after this post.
---
That said, there's no real reason to hurry through anything in Classic either.  You can play it at your leisure.  Depending on your goals, you can rush or laze around and still have loads of fun either way.
---
What would be cool is if you can loot people you killed in world pvp and take their insignia, and you can turn in those insignias for special rewards. People just need that extra incentive
---
takes like 2 hours to farm that as a mage/warlock
---
Naw I think I will take who I want to my dungeon group. You can group with who you want.
---
There is a guild that did a pserver naxx in under 30mins. Obviously geared.
---
I crave that time we actually cared about the epicness of gear
---
Did you do this yourself? In a mirror? On meth?
---
The only kiting you ever really do is waiting for your energy to regen and it's not useful at all while leveling unless you can't kill the target any other way.
---
Thanks for coming on the show mate, happy to have you!
---
The trolls outside the horde STV town (the one with the zepplin). I think it was tablets or something you had to farm? Took me forever to get all the ones I needed for the quest
---
Elemental seems fun in pvp do you need another set of gear to switch back to healing?
---
I'm just wondering how many people are going to roll lock this time around.
---
I agree, it's pointless that you ever thought to respond because you didn't agree with the usage of the word 'harder' to describe the experience and building up to max level compared to retail.
---
hard - /härd/
---
3. requiring a great deal of endurance or effort.
---
Classic requires more effort and time than retail. It's harder. It takes more time and effort to reach max level. It takes more time and effort to farm mats, build your resistance sets, build your character funds to raid, buy mounts etc than it does in retail. Are 100% all aspects harder? No. The entry point though without question is, and someone stating otherwise is simply not being honest with what the experience is. Harder doesn't mean bad, harder doesn't mean it's a negative shot at the game or the experience. I welcome this change and the sense of accomplishment that comes with it, without having achievements tied to it as well, but indicating it doesn't require more time and effort to do the things we've mentioned from the start compared to retail is disingenuous and just being contrarian as they're taking some sort of pride hit about classic as they feel someone is taking a swing at it.
---
Hard is appropriate. It's also welcome.
---
Imagine being on the same faction as gnomes though 
---
Horde it is
---
Keep in mind that Current retail wow shared really little actual gameplay with classic wow - sure it still have quests, bg, leveling, raids, dungeons etc but those are vastly different from one another. Having played retail wow most likely won't help you in classic due to the vast difference.
---
Yeah I just gave up on some of the quests around level 8 and farmed mobs who used ranged attacks because I was feeling lazy lol
---
Eventually?  Perhaps.  Initially?  Certainly not.  I got exalted with stormpike when games lasted for days and I can tell you 90% of the people playing were on the fronts, flanking, or gathering for summons.
---
Got that on my first drop. There were others who had been there over an hour looking for that. Kinda funny.
---
depends what you prefer  
---
if you prefer gameplay(combat) then current wow  
---
if you prefer more "adventure" rpg then classic
---
In prison. With a ballpoint pen, sewing needle, and lighter.
---
Thanks for the answer.  Yeah I'm level 6 right now and it was already a while ago that kiting felt pointless because I'm making too much energy.
---
Edit: I'm playing private in prep for Classic.

No words.
---
The psychological feeling that it's an 'official' server, making it feel like it's worth investing your time into your character.

I've been playing private servers, but this is the biggest thing stopping me from going 'all out' and completely committing to the game.

Proof?
---
As far as I know, retail WoW is perfect for casuals and hardcore PvE players. If you start playing now in retail, you can hit max level pretty fast, and then start working towards the current best gear. Also, the hardest PvE encounters are a lot more complex than everything classic wow has to offer.
---
Now classic, personally, I think it was designed as a world first, and then as a game. Leveling, professions, community, even if this subreddits repeats that min-maxing is required, theorycrafting (if you don't want to go hardcore PvE or PvP, you will need to create your own build, so you can be, at least, decent in both) are a lot better, also, the world has a lot more people, because consumables are more powerful, even low level ones (2 really good items you can find in a lvl 10-20 zone), so people will be outside of the cities akfing more often.
---
Good idea. Absolutely. Turn in insignias for honor or rewards.
---
Where are the next boars after that? Would hellboars in blasted lands be next? 
---
Edit; I guess RFD would be next
---
The idea that flying mounts are an inherently bad game feature is a falsehood propagated by Blizz's own disappointing devs.
---
The problems with flying is that the flight ceiling is way too high and there are no dangers restricting the ability to fly anywhere; back in TBC, flying too close to an enemy town caused you to be attacked by ranged defenses, which meant you had to pay attention to where you were flying. The cast time to mount up was also twice as long (it went from 3 sec to 1.5 in patch 3.2), so it wasn't easy to escape a gank, and there were items designed specifically to dismount players.
---
People like to say flying mounts were what killed wpvp, but TBC was my favorite era for wpvp. I'll never forget the intense fights in the Elemental Plateau of Nagrand, and part of the reason it was cool was because you needed a flying mount just to get there.

The game is built with them in mind, and it's not like any of these play the game for you

I like this one too! I suppose you got enough upvotes from the last one to make another?!
---
Okay good, thought I was overthinking, wondering what some other people's thoughts were. Thank you
---
haha yeah, got more than 7 in the end
---
Lovely
---
&gt;Unless they completely redesign how the game works any and all content added to the game does this.
---
New raids added by patches don't trivialize previous gear since they then become pre-raid BiS and those raids still have some BiS pieces for certain classes/specs. A whole new expansion where even a green item is better than an endgame epic is trivialized. It wouldn't have been hard to let players keep their lvl 60 epics but introduce new raid tiers at 70 with gear that was better, but not so much that previous expansion's endgame gear was completely useless after a couple levels. It would definitely remove some incentive for old players to go out and upgrade their gear since the new pieces are not as massively improved. But it would also mean that their old gear could still stick with them through those raids. You could say that the leveling process for old players would be pretty boring if it didn't offer gear that was better than their current epics but there could be other ways around that, for instance unlocking points in the new expansions system with quests e.g glyphs or whatever that expansion was using. It would indeed be possible to do.
---
&gt;Classic is too easy and a waste of time for top Retail guilds
---
Technically true, when you compare them today.
---
Nice, thank you!
---
Yes it is.
---
Perfect, thank you!
---
They didn't exist on my server. Or at least not at that time. It was fairly early on. I had free reign over devilsaur leather.
---
Elemental when geared out to the tits can land like 3k+ crits, there's videos from vanilla it's nuts
---
I'm not sure about the sets, I assume some pieces would need to be swapped but that some are the same . 
---
Lock is gonna probably be like 4-5th most played class behind , imo, warr mage rogue hunter (in that order) but that's just a lame  mans opinion
---
From personal experience on pservers, I got invites all the time from people seeking a healer on my Druid. I can't speak for the other two healing classes but I am certain that if people will reach out to a Druid they will reach out to any healer. I only say this because druids do not have a normal rez (which is very inconvenient in some cases) while the other three healers do. 
---
Desparate groups will put up with a lot to fill the tank/heal slots.
---
Let classicwinds take the journey. He's the one who came up with the idea. Imo it partially devalues his upcoming journey if people start first on the beta. That goes double if they publicize it, just like classicwinds planned to.
---
Cyperpunk 2077?
---
Rogue levels much faster, lesser gear dependence. Better in pve/pvp subjective. Wanted in groups warrior for sure, better in solo rogue.
---
Nice data. Still incorrect to say Pserver levelling takes longer. It is most definitely nerfed on Pservers, and Classic will take longer.  There's no argument and facts don't need your approval.
---
You really don’t get how this might be useful to discuss for Classic? Yes this is a patch 1.9 question, and yes Classic will be running on patch 1.12.1. That means that all patches leading up to patch 1.12.1 will be in effect, unless a later patch corrects, nullifies, or hot fixes anything prior to 1.12.1. 
---
This is useful to discuss because if there is an official source stating how Vanilla mechanics worked, or might work, then it applies directly to Classic. 
---
Btw I’d like to point out the incredibly obvious in that I never brought up private servers at all. I’m not operating on private server assumptions, hence my coming here to ask the community for their collective wisdom (and potentially with concrete evidence) to answer my questions.
---
It all makes sense right?
---
Lets look at what we know.
---
Anduin is a priest, wielding the power of the light.
---
Varian is a warrior with no affinity for the holy light.
---
Arthas was a paladin.
---
How could we be so blind?
---
wasn't horde a lot stronger than alliance in tbc mostly due to blood elfs?
---
It's easy enough to stop exploits, make it that you can only change layer in a capital/starter area.
---
Someone took some analytical data from WoWhead and ran the numbers and posted the info on Twitter... it was taken down fast, but not before people saw and started looking into it.
---
Fair play, sounds like time well earned.
---
2 weeks is 336 hrs. 240 hrs /played to 60 means like 17 hour days on average to hit it in 2 weeks
---
This post was more entertaining then all my combined time spent in BFA so far
---
You were able to mount in Undercity in vanilla.

&gt; Now, my only concern is that there will be a lot of mages... right?
---
One of the most popular classes. Easy to level, able to do a lot of things.
---
And you're right warriors, rogues and mages make up the majority of the game population, will you feel good playing it? Depends on how well you will stand out.
---
You will have to grind a lot. This is not possible through questing.
---
One of the ugliest tattoos ive ever seen if real
---
&gt;Nice data
---
Wheres your data to backup your claim?
---
&gt;Still incorrect to say Pserver levelling takes longer
---
I didn't say it takes longer, just saying it's pretty much the same.
---
&gt;It is most definitely nerfed on Pservers
---
It's not.
---
&gt;and Classic will take longer
---
Judging by all the speedrunners and hunters I've watched its the same.
---
&gt;There's no argument and facts don't need your approval

Anduin doesn’t seem to proficient with a sword either, maybe he would be better...with a mace
---
I'm honestly surprised to see so many comments like this. TBC was the start of the class/spec homogenization that killed the game for me. It stripped classes and specs of their uniqueness, and it trivialized the hard choices that went into picking a class in the first place.
---
Not everything should be equal. This was one the many wonderful things of Vanilla.
---
tru, it's an advanced keyboard cause if ur internet went down you could still masturbate to the picture of the NE (..or the orc? question mark?)
---
&gt; coming to PC this year
---
Cyberpunk isn't until 2020
---
I disagree, it'd make you feel like a bad-ass since you still had all that good gear to get a head-start in the expansion. If you had engame gear at 60, that gear should fair you up to 68-70 dungeons. And all the quest rewards would be more for new players or people who didn't have good gear at 60. You could argue it'd make leveling more boring if you didn't have good quest rewards, but there are other ways to reward people other than gear that can still be exciting.
---
TB is quietly probably the best city.  Most of the essential functions in the city feel so close together in the center.
---
What respectable priv server has 5-10min respawn on golden lotus?
---
Boffum..
---
Sounds good. Ooga gang style! However loot sharing is tough too... We would take a long time to equip both rogues
---
TL;DR your format would take way longer that tipsout's format for an equal amount of players.
---
So, assuming this tournament matched tipsout's number of 32 players, there would be 4 round robins, each with 8 players. Class 1 has to play each other of the 7 classes. Then class 2 has to play 6 other classes because they already played against class 1.
---
7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 28 matches for 1 round robin of 8 classes
---
28 * 4 round robins = 112
---
After that, you still have 16 players who have advanced. So assuming you make a bracket for that, doing 2/3 until finals, calculating the minimum amount of duels it could take:
---
semiquarters: 8 matches * 2 duels = 16 total duels
---
quarters: 4 matches * 2 duels = 8 duels
---
semifinals: 2 matches * 2 duels = 4 duels
---
finals: 1 match * 3 duels 
---
112 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 3 = 143 duels
---
If you make the 2-round matches take 3 rounds and the 3-round match take 5 rounds it comes out to 159.
---
Tipsout's single elimination bracket, minimum duel calculation: 32 players, so 16 matches in round 1, bo3 until semifinals
---
16 * 2 duels = 32
---
8 * 2 duels = 16
---
4 * 2 duels = 8
---
2 * 3 duels = 6
---
1 * 3 duels = 3
---
Comes to a grand total of 65 duels minimum. Max is 99.
---
I'm actually kind of a fan of your format regardless though. It would show who was able to triumph over classes that others of your class weren't.
---
Flayed demon skin in desolace.
---
Well not really true it only takes 10 or so people to turn it into a turtle that will last hours
---
I've always been Alliance and I really want to be there...but I want to main a shaman. And my husband is horde. I'm so torn!

---
If one parent is blonde and the other parent is brunette with the blonde recessive gene, then the kid can be blonde.
---
Emerald dragons are late game content that needs a raid to take down. They are in a mix of low/med/high level areas.
---
&gt;I highly doubt they'll do it with greens and a tank thats not defense capped.
---
well, everybody will do MC with a tank not defense capped, it's impossible to get defense capped in pre raid gear.
---
Dude Arthas was already the LK when Anduin was born. Debunked!!!!
---
This spec really interests me, how viable is this in other aspects of the game? And in phase 1 of classic?  Just love the hybrid/caster nature of it
---
yeah your 2nd point is true, but if you distribute your loot in a way that always the player with the worst item gets it you will soon have a lot of sad raiders. 
---
also the first point is actually much closer than u think, not actually equivalent, but close. i did some shit maths and shamans gain 34 (136 -&gt; 173) while priests "only" get 22 (152 -&gt;174). but then you have to keep in mind that lok is actually bis for priests at that patch, while for shamans its claw (180). it just feels weird leaving priests out in general when its their bis for quite some time, by quite some margin.
---
its hard doing it right, but telling priests they won't get any weapon in bwl while shamans can go for both will make them not very happy.
---
shit math: https://imgur.com/a/8kA85Vh
---
&gt; Yes, some guilds will require everyone to run the cookie-cutter spec for the best dps and maintain a certain level of dps in raids.
---
Let's be clear, these are bleeding edge, top 1% guilds. You find those in retail already.
---
The other 99% you'll be fine.
---
As a sidenote: I was feral spec, healing in naxx. We were fine up to saph where I needed to switch. (The encounter was REALLY taxing, needed the swiftmend)
---
Do you have a link to that for those of us that are uninformed?
---
Are they going to do this? Please say yes
---
Even with the extra height. They are still the most ridiculous models. Gear looks garbage on them. All their faces are old and condescending looking
---
10-12 days /played was fairly common for casual players back in the day from what I remember.
---
This is my context. I'm an original 2004 vanilla player, my main was a human holy paly in raids and ret paladin in pvp, suramar pve server back in the day.  
---
I pvp'd a LOT, so much so that I didn't think about the fact that I was on a pve server as a 'safer' option, but now that I'm deciding on a server again, I'm a little more concerned/aware of potential dangers that might await me on pvp server.   
---
\*Anyway, to the point...\*  
---
I plan on being on a mid-high ish pop server, I'm  playing alliance because that's what my group is playing, and I'm specifically deciding to avoid paladin because I /played way too much paladin in vanilla.  
---
So... Hunter, mage, or rogue? o.o
---
Man I actually really miss vanilla mara.  At first I didnt really care for classic, but recently Ive just had this feeling that I really want to play it.
---
This story seems kinda related. But in wotlk I was doing a pug of one of the wintergrasp bosses and one of the DKs whispered me saying that his guild follows my armory to see what build I was running. (This was when dks were going through a lot of changes so weird builds kept popping up.)
---
I was kinda taken aback cause I was in a decent guild but not the best on the server by far. So I asked why they didn’t follow the DKs in bane (by far the best guild on the server since that’s pretty much what I was doing anyway.) 
---
He responded that their guild thought bane was a bunch of assholes. Which they were I always thought in a funny way but they were kinda the definition of toxic elitist trolls. 
---
Idk just a thing about the difference in toxic elitism and actual advice and playing well together
---
OK so.. that is literally a fact...
---
but when a dude makes a post about how it is fully his intention to literally no life a video game and do literally nothing at all for an entire month but play a video game... warnings about people dying become suddenly infinitely more relevant than reminding Todd the 17 year old who plays 10 hours of video games a week that sometimes people die from gaming too hard...

They have an actual working copy of 1.12 that they are basing Classic on.  They are not rewriting it one patch at a time up until they hit 1.12.  They actually have it.

Yeah, the top rated comment, referencing the WoW South Park episode, in a thread that is doing the WoW South Park theme, being meta... totally underrated

---
Because they aren't making a new game.  They're trying to re-create an old game as close to the way it was as they can.
---
Hunter is probably most effective for least time invested.
---
Cuz I'm cookin up more biscuits than a Buskens yo

[https://youtu.be/90Bf\_wJSq2A](https://youtu.be/90Bf_wJSq2A) I just remembered a couple Machinimas. First. CHronicles of the annoying quest episode 1, a Classic. Came in late during Vanilla, but it definitely deserves to be here for the legacy.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD6n5Fv99KU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD6n5Fv99KU) Survivor: STV episode 1. A reupload, Classic is old as heck though. Older than Crotaq. Had the superior comedy as a series as well. (AND BEST OF ALL THIS ONE IS STILL GOING TODAY AS SURVIVOR WASTELANDS!)
---
[https://youtu.be/iEWgs6YQR9A](https://youtu.be/iEWgs6YQR9A) Of course, the Classic. Roflmao. Technically after TBC launch, but it's very much associated with the time.
---
I managed to get that guy on my NE hunter, Emerald Dream if I recall correctly. Managed to emote enough to get my point across and the Horde quest goers let me tame him!
---
City raids!
---
Sad, but true.
---
there was also a spot on Alliance ships where you could mount
---
i remember it being patched out before 1.12 though
---
BATHROOM!
---
Overrated comment.
---
All of it. Primarily I like the raids a tad better (although I never did AQ40 or Naxx during vanilla) and I loved playing enhancement, so getting raid viability was a great boon and is what enabled me to start raiding the more serious content of the expansions going forward.
---
Also, totally anecdotal. But I had such a good time leveling blood elves with a friend when they first came out, and I really want to re-do it. 
---
Ultimately I think it comes down to the same justifications as Vanilla. I want to re-experience it with adult eyes, complete the content to the best of my abilities. I'd want Wrath to finish it all up personally, although my desire is not as intense for that, since I actually completed all of Wrath's PvE content and its simply not as long ago, thus carrying less nostalgic value. It also, unfortunately, started the systems I think ultimately led us to where BfA is.
---
yup but you can get close, and no one is going to have pre raid bis in two weeks anyways. but you're only selecting a section of my post, like I said I highly doubt any one is going to get 60 and clear mc and ony in two weeks. if they do I'd be impressed.
---
The thing is I wouldn't want it to be used to find dungeon or raid groups, but rather just a profile to connect people to guilds or other players to level or pvp with.   
---
More so to find people to do world things with than instanced, but have the guild finder as an option so you can do those things with a guild you click with.
---

---
"for the first couple probably around a couple of months"
---
&gt;  These changes hurt the game.
---
They aren't making a new game.  They are re-launching an old game.  They aren't trying to give us the optimal best little pieces from every previous version.  They are simply trying to re-create 1.12 on a newer engine.
---
... how can U not link the videos
---
I wanted to watch the funeral for pure nostalgia... I remember being so horrified and offended yet conflicted and ... Inspired?
---
Elwynn to Westfall to loch Modan to auberdine back to westfall to redridge back to Westfall is one of the best questlines in the game. The quests are all super easy and the ones that aren’t are easily skippable where you don’t have to worry about falling behind the leveling curve.
---
Keep me posted if you guys start this project would love to share my input :)
---
Awesome explanation, thanks! I feel that same way about current wow taking away these cool elements of the game.
---
Someone should tell him to come back to WoW,Classic needs him.
---
It will still have the 1.0 attack speed in classic.
---
I actually loved the movie. Mainly the Orc stuff though, human stuff was kinda meh.
---
Probably faster if you do that shit during different times and only doing it while traveling having one of you running and the other on follow.
---
I want this back, please.
---
Good point, I forgot about them.  Azuregos and Kazzak too.
---
The barrens is shit don’t @ me. The quillboar quests are aids and so are several of the others.
---
Yes yes, let's keep people thinking that so I can farm gold there in peace.
---
Eastwatch should be by the sea.
---
Dude, you should book the day off to experience the awfulness and craziness.
---
If you want shiny new graphics and about uh 7 expacs worth of content, go for Retail. If you don't mind old as fuck graphics and gameplay, but want to roll a fresh start with others I'd wait for Classic.
---
Why would you think you couldn't mount in the undercity?
---
We've already established that streamers aren't in the beta to test it. They're in to build hype for the game. And they've done a good job so far.
---
Parts of classic that was scrapped for TBC:
---
Hellfire Peninsula, hyjal, caverns of time and karazan (including the area below kara)
---
Cake day comment.
---
If a few million people all share the same complaints about BFA then there's probably some validity to it. That doesn't mean that other people can't keep enjoying something. People still play all kinds of weird shit for some reason... so whatever, more power to them.
---
But I don't like this culture of shaming people for disliking something. It's normal to hate shit. There are people out there who hate all of my favorite things. And there are people out there who hate all of your favorite things. And that's fine. Let people hate shit.
---
Additionally, I've always said that the person who complains the loudest about something is the person who should be listened to the most (but is usually the one that is ignored and shut down). People who don't care won't put the energy into complaining about it, they'll just do something else. The people who are shitting on BFA are pissed because they love the game but resent what it's become. At least these people are still invested enough to put energy into expressing their complaints. They ultimately want what everyone who still plays and who has ever played the game want - for it to be a fun and successful game.
---
Stuck between Warlock and Hunter :(. 
---
Going to be raiding a few nights a week but not fussed at all re; topping meters, more interested in competing within my class.  
---
I spend most of my time doing wpvp or BGs so my indecisiveness is based on the following:
---
Does hunters lack of gear/scaling through AQ and Naxx gimp them in pvp through these tiers?
---
Conversely, do Locks perform ok in pvp through MC/early BWL and at low gear levels?
---
How do Locks and Hunters compare in wPvP overall? It's easy to get a sense of how they go dueling and in BGs on instant 60 servers but wpvp is harder to suss.
---
Edit: also how bad is lock levelling pvp I've heard your super gimped before you get death coil?
---
Classic is the better version of the game. Don't waste your time with retail.
---
Retail WoW is like playing PUBG, Fortnite, LoL, Dota2, or pretty much any other online game these days. You log in, queue up, play some matches, and log out. You have very minimal social interaction with your teammates. Everything you do is streamlined for the sake of convenience. 
---
Classic WoW is completely different. It is hard. It is time consuming. It has all the old-school RPG elements. And it has none of the modern conveniences of modern WoW. But this gives life to the game. It brings people together. The increase of difficulty actually requires you to group up and interact with people. The lack of an automated dungeon-finder requires you to make friends so you put those groups together quickly. There's actually a social community, and the game becomes something different than just another queue simulator like all other multiplayer games.
---
There's a bunch of other reasons that I won't go into, but you can just google "classic vs retail wow" and find multitudes of videos and articles talking about the subject. But basically, if you only have a few hours to play a week and you're just looking for a quick dopamine rush, then retail WoW is for you. If you want to play an actual MMO**RPG** and not just another MMO-queue-simulator, then Classic is better.
---
Happy Cake Day good sir
---
I didn't find Mankrik's wife until I was a man
---
I am taking my vacation starting friday of the release week, ergo I am working tue-friday and then once friday shift ends, I shall enter caveman mode until the week after monday. That is a lot of WoW goodness and hopefully the hordes have spread out a little. First day at launch is probably extremely unwise. Likely lag and slight overpopulation. I would advice going to bed early and waking up 4-6 hours after it officially launches to have the initial lag/burnout and people actually going to bed having set in :P
---
You can always buy an epic mount at 60 like everyone else.
---
UC doesn’t hold a candle to IF, sorry
---
WE CAN'T TRUST THE SWORD OF A THOUSAND TRUTHS TO A NOOB!
---
You're going to have to learn to kite to be a good hunter in PvP.
---
1.12 AV is still miles better than what it was changed into in the later expansions.
---
I certainly wouldn't give Asmongold the time of day otherwise.
---
I get that knowledge comes with playing the game. But, like I said I was VERY young when I played vanilla and I don’t want to look up everything about the game. We have the knowledge of where/how/what things are, when we didn’t 15 years ago, and I want to kind of figure it out on my own. I’m just not sure how to tell if, for instance, 2% increased chance to crit or 2% increased critical effect is better. So, while I don’t want to ruin the experience of “discovery” if you will, I do want to know how to spot a food item when I come across it.
---
I want to agree but that's difficult to measure and also being wow players we are heavily biased.
---
I can play on private servers right now.
---
IF is perfect for all business. Perfect for spamming profs, perfect for selling ports, perfect for lockboxes, perfect for distance to raids, perfect for literally everything
---
And I will probably be going horde because too many of my friends and old guild mates are
---
Esfand and ziqo are method streamers.................................
---
That is definately useful, but my Idea would be more user friendly with a way to create a profile and swipe through potential friends or leveling partners for launch.
---
I’ve seen people do 72h streams, they’ll be fine!
---
approved.
---
Add it to the Vanilla+ content potential list.
---
Will someone please think of the children?!

My first character was an Enhance Shammy, and I had a blast then, but didn't really know what I was doing. This time around I'll be rolling it again but aiming for the Hand of Rag. I don't know how I'll do it but I'll get it. Been waiting for a long time to something like that.
---
Hunters have tools for most things, are mandatory in some fights with tranquillising shot. In PvP they offer a lot of control and utility, damage is pretty good too. Play what you like, every class has strengths and weaknesses as well as hard counters as a two way street.
---
That would be a great name! :) I was initially thinking of "The Meeting Stone" but I like Campfire better.
---
IF has never and will never be taken
---
I tried to find something for that line but failed. 10/10
---
Clearly you don't know how good the comment was then.
---
Going to bed with only their radishes tonight.
---
That is a crock. You have a taunt totem with a cd and a health pool. It’s fine when mobs are low but it scales poorly as damage ramps. 
---
The best thing about shaman tanks is that paladins and bear tanks are pretty bad and by contrast, shaman aren’t super far behind. 
---
But tanking just because you kinda can is far from ideal, and torturous for the people that are running with you.
---
Signed former shaman tank
---
That was still before reinforcements, yeah?
---
This sounds more like you are "genuinely concerned" that someone will play more than you.
---
Ha, nice try, casual! We're getting to 60 faster than you and there's nothing you can do to stop us
---
Too far from raids, not enough pop to sell profs or ports or lockpocking, also terrible for dueling
---
hunters and mages
---
you can't solo everything but you can solo plenty
---
Hunters, Mages, and Warlocks.
---
What two professions if I may ask? It could be useful for the goldmaking.
---
Posting a comment on your cake day, how overrated
---
You sound like a guy that is for the war but against the troops.
---
5 days of not sleeping cannot be deadly. You are not an doctor.
---
Not your damn business. Run to your safe space or something.
---
No you shouldn't kite because it's a massive dps loss, your autottacks account for most of your dps so kiting to regen would just make the fights take too long. Warriors don't have this issue as they wear slow 2handers. Though kiting a mob to regen energy CAN be a useful strategy if you are fighting a very difficult mob, where you are not so much concerned about the speed you kill it, but whether or not you kill it. By kiting you can do short bursts of damage with energy, to overall take less damage.

---
And druids
---
&gt; You don't have any statistical data or evidence to support your theory of one game being preferred than the other. 
---
First of all, you don't have to have statistical data to specifically point to why things have changed. You can literally look at the trends, look at how things were, what the change did, and use your fucking brain to figure it out. 
---
Remember that example I gave you about the group quests going largely uncompleted after Vanilla was "older" and during later expansions? That's a fucking ***no brainer***. As expansions come out, people tend to ***NOT DO*** those quests because they literally have ***NO ONE*** to do them with. 
---
Are you with me so far? Is this too much? 
---
So if you are a developer, and want to make sure your content lasts for as long as possible, you just stop doing those group quests. Why? Because why spend all that fucking time on that quest or quest chain and have no one do it after a couple of months or after the next expansion? 
---
Sooooo using our big brain we can figure out ***why*** those group quests no longer exist in later expansions and were removed in the "Old World" with Cata. 
---
Does any of this make sense or should I use crayons to draw it out for you? 
---
But fuck, if you don't want to use your brain, just look at this [colorful chart.](http://www.sggaminginfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/wow-sub-numbers-1024x342.jpg)
---
You can see that the number goes ***up*** as the expansions come out. Notice that TBC and Wrath had major changes to how the game was played. 
---
And while it does dip after Wrath, the numbers are ***STILL HIGHER*** than they were at the end of Vanilla. Gee, I guess whatever Blizzard was doing was working for at least a majority of the population. 
---
When I say that you only have your opinion and no evidence or sound argument to back up any of your claims, this is the shit I am talking about. I can tell the rest of your post is going to be a shit show if this is the best you've got. 
---
&gt; So your arguments are no different to mine in just being about `how I feel'. You just waste more time explaining why you feel that way, but it's irrelevant to anyone else in this topic because you're not actually bringing any evidence of what the 'MAJORITY OF USERS PREFER' to the table.
---
You can assume that when you look at the player subs. You should also read some of the blue posts that have come up over the years because they literally explain to you why they make changes to the game. A lot of the time they share insider information as to why changes have occurred. 
---
For example, [Blizzard ***literally***](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/blizzard-70-percent-of-new-wow-players-dont-get-past-level-10_1) told the players that they found most of the people that picked up WoW for the first time stopped playing after level 10. Why do you think that is? Use your thinking cap now. 
---
One reason is because the starter zones are fucking garbage. After TBC came out it was often a ***better*** experience to go to the Dreanei or Blood Elf starter zones (if you could) to level rather than your own zone for your race. It was a better experience overall. Quests were not all over the fucking place and quest rewards were actually decent. That's because the old starter zones were built to make you spend time in them because more time spent playing meant less time for you to wait for content to come out when you were level 60. It was also "how every other game did it" prior to WoW. 
---
Another reason is because the amount of XP required to reach the next level after 10 drops off significantly. There's a psychological aspect with your character hitting so many levels so quickly from 1-10 because it feels like you're doing something. That's by design. So that when you no longer ding as much it feels bad. It feels ten times as bad when you realize you have 70 more levels to go (at the time of Wrath). 
---
And you sit there wondering, "I don't know WHY they would change the old zones." 
---
From a business point of view, it was to retain membership. From a design point of view, it was to make those quests timeless. Timeless in the sense that it didn't matter what part of the game you are in or who is with you, you should be able to do it. It ***feels bad*** when you get a group quest that you ***can't do*** because not enough people exist to do it with you. A real problem after the first expansion. 
---
&gt; I completely understand why some people don't like classic.
---
I ***highly*** doubt this. You don't understand why changes have occurred so how can this be true?
---
&gt; It is just you here who has categorically stated in a previous post that you can't see a single valid reason why people do like it.
---
To use my analogy once more, you have posters saying that Classic is "faster" than Retail and it ***totally*** isn't. Those are the posts that I have problems with. 
---
&gt; No. Opinions by their very definition cannot be wrong. End of conversation on that. That is a fact.
---
Your right to an opinion does not make your opinion valid. You can have the opinion that vaccines cause autism. Guess what, you're still wrong. 
---
&gt;Opinions by their very definition cannot be wrong. Only the facts that opinions are based around can be wrong. 
---
Is this a Jaden Smith meme? 
---
&gt; Therefore, the only fact that is relevant to us in debating which game is better is again, as you sort of said, WHAT THE MAJORITY PREFER.
---
Using your thinking cap, you can see that subscriptions continued to rise after Vanilla. 
---
But I can hear that single thought rattling around in your head, "but subscriptions dropped tho!" 
---
Still didn't drop below Vanilla prime numbers and Legion was one of ***the most*** successful WoW expansions in the history of the game. 
---
So are you telling me you're not smart enough to figure that out for yourself? Jesus Christ dude, what are you doing here?
---
&gt; I would love to find Middle ground with you, and have a sensible fair discussion. But it is simply impossible when this discussion is about preference, and the other person cannot recognise a SINGLE positive that I or anyone else can put across about classic, and then go on to suggest that they have factually backed up why a classic enthusiasts opinion is worse.
---
You lack the most basic information or knowledge of this game to have that conversation. You lack the critical thinking skills to look at changes objectively and critically. The information I can provide to you but I can't teach you how to think critically. 
---
https://tagn.wordpress.com/2016/09/08/wow-legion-sales-numbers-stacked-up-against-past-launches/
---
&gt; That is why I'm going for the throat on your argument logic.
---
Feels more like a light tickle to be honest.
---
Yo Blizzard, hire this guy.

how about you mind your own health? :)

Unexpected gush
---
Is that a Short Joke.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGBnjELkgok
---
Yup, 1.1mil views vanilla video with pure world pvp.. oh wait no, it's primarily BG's.
---
For reference, in Retail they generally last 40 mins to 2 hours. Mostly on that lower end of the spectrum
---
You realize progression guilds need A LOT in consumables, so selling a carry spots and certain loot from raids helps a lot.
---
Probably engineering and enchanting if I was gonna bet
---
Everyone and their mother is a frost mage. Go warlock. You will be greatly appreciated.
---
I thought everyone would assume: I am referring to kiting as moving away while not missing an auto attack window.  That's why I said "I'm interested in knowing if there is some amount of kite you can fit in there without interrupting your rotation".  I mean auto attacks as part of your rotation.  My question was if there is any kiting possible while dealing max damage (which implies not missing auto attacks).
---
Edit: You said "kiting to regen" and I'm talking about kiting to avoid damage.
---
oof
---
Yeah he really missed out not calling it boarletics
---
I know this feeling. I use to play WoW with my little brother. He died to cancer at age 21. He loved dragons, so when Cata came out I got the collector's edition so I could have a black dragon follow me through Azeroth and beyond. Blackdragon was one of his character names. Named the lil bugger after him and took him through everything. My dad xfered his toons to his account and levels his toons still... I still have my brother's account on my [b.net](https://b.net) friend's list to boot.
---
They wouldn’t have gotten it anyway.
---
It's not a change though..... it....was...in....classic.
---
Depends on class and what you're farming, mages in brd can skin dogs and mine dark iron, dogs in dm North can be skinned, classes that can solo bosses can have bops that are worth more disenchanted
---
ITT: "Do my changes to Classic, ~~because I'm special~~ for the children."
---
I feel that the main argument against this prototype is the fact that WoW already accommodates people looking to team up &amp; socialize through many chat channels that you can communicate through. Looking for fellow players to do content with via text is NOT a rare sight to come by in Vanilla WoW (in contrast to retail where all you need to do is click "Sign Up" to find a Raid/M-Dungeon group).
---
However... this is where it shines: better interaction.
---
WoW is a game meant to be enjoyed with other people. Friends, obviously. That's the premise of many multiplayer games. Now, finding people in-game can always be difficult. Some don't care. Some are busy. Some are already playing with others. A convenient way to connect with others in this particular format can prove to be very useful, so good luck with the project!
---
Is that vendor price or ah?
---
Is it really the most important thing tho
---
It's not a big deal.+int gets better with better gear, however, its not like +wpn skill for melee classes. The +spirit from human is largely irrelevant,  as its the least prioritised stat for a mage and it accounts for next to nothing while leveling
---
Both CRZ and Battlemasters were added to address very specific and significant problems. There is no reason to think those problems won't also be in Classic.
---
You need +3% from gear. Suppression is only for affliction spells.
---
Not really
---
The reason is both simple and complex. Simple reason: WoW is not a PvP game. Before you rush to downvote, understand that just because a game HAS PvP in it does not necessarily make it a PvP game. 
---
For example, Dark Age of Camelot and Guildwars were built from the start to be PvP games. It makes up their foundation. WoW was not. It is a PvE game where PvP was tacked on because.... MMOs need PvP I guess. 
---
Case in point: not one quest in the game requires you to raid an enemy city or kill another actual player. 
---
So, was the honor system messed up for classic, a game where PvP was an afterthought? Of course. 
---
Complex reason: the original servers already had so much to do and process that they had to dumb down certain things. Such as the number of debuffs. The honor system could become incredibly complicated very quickly which explains the arbitrary range for getting honorable kills and the basic immunity that high level players have toward low level attacks.
---
For example, a player at level 45 sees an enemy player at level 30. The high level player knows that killing the low level player is a bit of a waste of time since they get literally nothing for it. The lower level player sees an enemy "skull" player and stays away. Why was this system designed this way? A sword is a sword regardless of the experience of the wielder. 
---
Because if the low level player could attack the high level and win, then the server would need to take note of this and give some honor points to the high level player; they did defend themselves after all. But that requires a lot of calculations from the server, calculations that blizzard couldn't spare. And this becomes orders of magnitude more difficult once you add more people to the mix. 
---
So, the compromise: world PvP becomes gimped where "rules" are put in place to keep it simple (and much more unrealistic). And to make players forget that fact, let's make BGs give massive amounts of honor so that world PvP dies asb undignified death. 
---
The worst news is that modern servers can easily keep track of even the most complicated world PvP fights and they could fully rebalance the system today. But they don't have that option because of nochange.
---
well I'd like to know from OP so I can give advice specifically to his case :D
---
I'd be really interested in hearing more from Gleb about the guild coalition he was talking about. I'd like to find a server with an intentional community but that avoids streamers.
---
unless you're bad at lvling you wont use 240 hours to 60, even with enjoying the journey
---
To add on to this question.  What about other quests that came about in later patches?  Will we be able to do Thorium Brotherhood? Wildhammer? Those furbolgs in that cave before Winterspring?  What about several of the Feralas quests like the goblin before the dock to the Alliance town?
---
Joana didn’t do it in one sitting. One of the major parts of lowering your /played time is using rested exp to your advantage, meaning you actually should logout of the game to gather up rested experience.
---
Wow, he's really intolerable, isn't he?
---
r/suicidebywords ..?
---
Sorry didn't read that part.
---
That could be possible with very slow weapons and if your weapon speed is synchonized, but in almost every case it really won't be. I don't know any rogues who do this.

---
No party block or glancing blows
---
50g-60g was about normal from vanilla.  I made shitloads of them to sell back then.
---
Folks in the beta forum believe auto looting has been tied to the artificial spell batching, probably not intentionally.  So it makes it pretty inconsistent.
---
More fun as duo, and you'll have someone to help for the hard quests, and have a person at 60 already for dungeon groups. Maybe one of you is a tank or healer to get groups going fast
---
LIVE TO WIN
---
No it's not bugged. Ranged attacks don't get screwed over by glancing blows so they're by far the best for skull killing.
---
How can they solo dungeons? Can they solo dungeons like Dire Maul, Scholomance etc.?
---
That guy's mustache is legit, and that's a pretty crazy bug.
---
Classic has world design and the RPG elements, but BC had way better raiding, plus arena.
---
THE WHORE IS BREEDING NED!
---
Some of you have never leveled a warrior to 36 and it shows.
---
Devs are open to creating new vanilla content as long as there is a large enough player base. Hopefully this wont be the last raid.
---
How can a Warlock solo dungeons? Can they solo dungeons like Dire Maul, Scholomance etc.?
---
I recommend Troll for the bow specialization and the attack speed ability. You will get little use from an orcs Blood Fury, and the troll regeneration is a slight, but measurable bit of health.
---
Also, trolls have 5% extra damage vs beasts to help with leveling.
---
saladfingered420 guessed right, I want to pvp and do good enchants but these require money.

Thank you &lt;3
---
Lol if you're racing to 60 you definitely don't want to be collecting any rested experience.
---
It'll be in the afternoon in the US so I expect most people will be home from work. Expect a shit show and long ass queue times. Then a zerg fest in the leveling zones. That's what happens with any MMO launch and I'm okay with that. The hype will be at maximum and worth experiencing once you're in, but if you expect to make a lot of progress you'll be sorely disappointed.   
---
Monday is already my day off, so I plan to snag that Tuesday off and then level at my own pace after work.

Let's say you had a nice birthday cake.  Everyone liked it.  Then I smeared mud all over it, and threw it in the hog pen.   You scream at me "You ruined the cake, you ruined the cake".  I respond with "No, no, it's not ruined.  See the hogs love it.".
---
That's what you are saying.  The hogs love the cake, but everyone else at the party is having a bad time.

People die from a lot less dangerous shit than not sleeping for 5 days.

&gt; A whole new expansion where even a green item is better than an endgame epic is trivialized.
---
First off, this is an over-exaggeration. AQ40/Naxx gear easily takes you to 68-70 without finding any upgrades. Hell, even high tier PvP gear takes you halfway through the leveling before you find a few rares that are better. 
---
Secondly, if your argument is that the content is still useful as it remains as stepping stones to later content then all that really becomes useless is the raids. All 1-58 zones, quests, gear and dungeons would still be as useful, as it would be stepping stones up to TBC in the same exact way.
---
As for content becoming trivialized I would argue that with the full package of vanilla content in the game raids like MC, AQ20 and ZG are already pretty much "leveling raids" (like Gnomeregan or Scarlet Monastery are leveling dungeons) that you only do a small handful of times before moving on to more pressing content. If someone starts playing Classic in phase 5 it's not unlikely that they finish a full AQ set without ever getting more than 3-5 MC pieces (which they got in one or two gearing runs).

Who? And no the idea came from southpark http://southpark.cc.com/full-episodes/s10e08-make-love-not-warcraft

That is exactly my concern. The fastest time with some rested EXP and preformed by someone who knows everything about leveling is juts under 5 days. A regular person with bathroom and food breaks plus not know as much about leveling would need 6-7 days? People will attempt this for content and popularity.

i actually played a lot of orc shaman in retail and never any tauren, i'm still trying to get used to the idea of playing tauren on classic.

Human warriors can use a greater diversity of wpns with their + weapon skil in sword and mace. Which is a significant advantage.

I'm thinking February.  No idea yet if I'll make it to 60 by then
